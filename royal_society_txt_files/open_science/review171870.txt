Comments to the Author:
After considering the comments from the two reviewers, I recommend acceptance of this paper
provided the authors are able to address the relatively minor concerns raised by the referees.
Comments from Associate Editor
-------------------------------------
Please check the structure of product 3v in Table 2. I think there should be a benzene ring, but in
the PDF version it looks like one C-C bond is missing. Similarly, please modify the presented
structures of products 3t, 3u, and 3v so that the numbers next to the brackets are readable.
Referee 1
-----------
I'm not sure if this would be minor or majors. All in all probably minor.
Language needs cleaned up in a few places in the document (especially later in the paper). For
instance page 3 line 59 – should be 3rd and 3th.
Would like the formatting of table 2 be on the same page if possible.
On Page 2, second column, paragraph about catalyst loading is vague. Less detail about this part
of the method development then other parts of the study. What does decreased catalyst loading
mean? 5% 2% 9%??? How much of an increase did the authors explore?
Page three – the section on Catalyst recyclability. What happens on the 4th cycle and beyond?
This article would be much stronger if the authors had a possible mechanism or at least
preliminary data or hypothesis of a possible mechanism.
In the supporting information, the integrations of some of the H spectra seem a bit off suggesting
some impurities.
Overall the article presents a method of coupling phenyl acetic acids with benzyl amines, though
the method is not particular robust when variants and different substitution patterns are used.
Referee 2
-----------
This review report is for the Royal Society Open Science manuscript RSOS-171870, entitled
“Direct amidation of non-activated phenyl acetic acid and benzyl amine derivatives catalysed by
5
NiCl2” by L. Cheng, X. Ge and L. Huang. The manuscript details a synthetic method for the
NiCl2-catalyzed condensation of phenyl acetic acid and benzyl amine derivatives to provide
amides in high yields. I would characterize this manuscript as a practical synthetic method of
limited scope for the synthesis of these types of amides, and this method is anticipated to be of
general interest to chemists pursuing this specific type of bond. As such, it is appropriate content
for publishing in Royal Society Open Science. I have some comments about data presented in the
manuscript, and I therefore recommend that this manuscript be accepted pending minor
revisions. Several points that expand on my concerns are detailed below.
§ Page 2, Figure 1: I am curious why the authors did not try to use NiCl2•6H2O, as this form if
nickel(II) chloride is much less expensive than anhydrous NiCl2 (what is presumed to be used in
this manuscript, although it’s not clear), and moreover, the hexahydrate is very user friendly. It
would be interesting to see how this compares to NiCl2, and if the excess water present in the
catalyst has a negative impact (if any) of the reaction efficiency.
§ Page 2, column 1, line 25, 26: I am confused by the comment that “metal complexes show higher
catalytic activity than metal halides.” What type of catalytic activity (or reaction type)? It seems
that this is a broad claim that may oversimplify data to fit the results of the paper. I would
suggest that this comments needs clarified and properly referenced.
§ Page 2, column 2, line 10: The authors suggest that toluene as the optimal solvent, which is also
non-polar, therefore disfavors salt or charged species formation. This is partially supported by
the fact that at nearly the same temperatures, polar solvents DMSO and DMF are poor
performers. However, I believe a key piece to this comment has been omitted entirely from the
manuscript, and that is that the NiCl2 catalyst in toluene probably yields a heterogeneous
suspension. If it is homogeneous, it should be stated as such – especially given the fact that the
catalyst can be filtered after the reaction. As I assume that solids are present during the course of
the reaction, then it is possible that other charged species could form on this surface and exist in
an equilibrium (or transiently) along with other reaction species. It may be possible that toluene is
non-polar and high boiling, allow sufficient kinetic energy for the transformation while also
facilitating a heterogeneous catalyst that supports the described reaction. Again, this based on the
assumption that the catalyst is not in solution during the reaction and this point should be
clarified in the manuscript.
§ Page 3, column 1, lines 46–51: As a minor point, the amidation using L-phenylalanine could
offer a little insight into the reaction process. For example, the authors could expose a separately-
prepared non-racemic product (3p) to the catalyst conditions to see if the product racemizes after
amidation. The authors could also sample some unreacted amino acid during the course of the
reaction to see if the catalyst conditions racemize the amino acid. This information could provide
some insight into applications beyond the scope that the authors have presented.
§ Page 3, column 1, lines 57–60: It appears that there is only marginal loss of catalyst activity after
recycling catalyst up to three times. However, it would be insightful to see the fourth runs to see
how much of a loss in activity is observed. The authors write this as the limit, but it’s not clear
from the data that it is actually the limit. Several other comments that are less critical to the
science are listed below.
§ Page 1, column 2, line 33: There is mention of “small” early transition metals, but it is not clear
what this is referring to with respect to the metal. The examples provided reside in the 4th group,
and it seems that “early transition metals” is a sufficient descriptor.
§ Page 2, Table 1: There are a number of data points given in this table that could be omitted and
6
would simplify the data presentation. For example, entries 2 and 5 aren’t necessary. Also,
fluorobenzene should be abbreviated PhF, not “phF.”
§ I commend the authors on their writing in a non-native language. However, there are some
grammatical errors or inconsistencies in the manuscript. There are also some instances where
abbreviations do not necessarily conform to the norms (for example, HZ is used for NMR
coupling constants, and should be Hz).
The conclusions presented in the manuscript are not compromised by my suggestions for
revision. I find it important to emphasize that the majority of my suggestions serve to improve
clarity for the author’s method, which will strengthen the manuscript as well as aid in the
application of this technology.

Comments to the Author:
The authors have done a good job of revising their manuscripts according to the comments
provided by the previous reviewers. I do not see a need to send the revised manuscript back to
review, but there are a couple minor corrections that need to be made based on my review of the
revised manuscript.
(1) Figure 1, format so that all catalyst names are below the X-axis. Some are floating above the
bars. Unless the results presented in the Figure are of multiple runs, error bars should not be
used. Neither the text, nor the figure caption mention multiple runs. Also, it is not necessary to
provide the percentage yields above the bars in Figure 1.
(2) It is not necessary to provide the percentage yields above the bars in Figure 2. The change in
yield is apparent without this information. Clarify that the "1 2 3 4" in the legend for Figure 2 are
runs and not compounds.
(3) Format all structures in Table 2 so that they have the same scaling. Some appear to be smaller
relative to the others.
10
(4) I believe Scheme 1 needs to be provided as a separate file like the other figures. As it appears
in the text, this graphic appears to be rather small.
(5) In the response to reviewer 2 (Page 3) the authors comment about the racemization of product
3p under the reaction conditions. Please include this discussion in the main text, if it is not
already there.

Appendix B
Dear Editor and Reviewers:
Thank you for your comments. According to the reviewers’ comments, we revised and
proof-read the manuscript carefully. Here are the answers to the editor and reviewers’ comments.
Part A(Comments from Associate Editor):
Please check the structure of product 3v in Table 2. I think there should be a benzene ring,
but in the PDF version it looks like one C-C bond is missing. Similarly, please modify the
presented structures of products 3t, 3u, and 3v so that the numbers next to the brackets are
readable.
Answer:
There is no benzene ring in the structure of 3v and we have corrected the mistake in the
general synthetic scheme. The presented structures of products 3t, 3u, and 3v have been revised
and the numbers next to the brackets are readable in the revised manuscript.
Part B(Reviewer 1):
1. Language needs cleaned up in a few places in the document (especially later in the paper). For
instance page 3 line 59-should be 3rd and 3th. Would like the formatting of table 2 be on the same
page if possible.
Answer: “3th”has been corrected to “3rd and 3th.”
2. On Page 2, second column, paragraph about catalyst loading is vague. Less detail about this
part of the method development then other parts of the study. What does decreased catalyst
loading mean? 5% 2% 9%??? How much of an increase did the authors explore?
Answer: In order to obtained the optimum catalyst loading, 5 mol%, 10mol% and 20 mol%
catalyst loading were discussed in the paper, and the result indicated that 10 mol% catalyst loading
is good and enough for the amidation. And all of these were added in the revised manuscript.
3. Page three-the section on Catalyst recyclability. What happens on the 4th cycle and beyond?
Answer: In the fourth cycle, the yield decreased obviously because of the loss of the catalyst. We
have added the experimental data of fourth cycle of the catalyst in the .revised manuscript.
4. This article would be much stronger if the authors had a possible mechanism or at least
preliminary data or hypothesis of a possible mechanism.
Answer: Hypothesis of a possible mechanism has been added in the revised manuscript.
Part C(Reviewer 2):
1. Page 2, Figure 1: I am curious why the authors did not try to use NiCl2•6H2O, as this form
if nickel(II) chloride is much less expensive than anhydrous NiCl2 (what is presumed to be
used in this manuscript, although it’s not clear), and moreover, the hexahydrate is very user
friendly. It would be interesting to see how this compares to NiCl2, and if the excess water
present in the catalyst has a negative impact (if any) of the reaction efficiency.
Answer: Actually, We did try to use NiCl2•6H2O as the catalyst and the experimental data was
added in the revised manuscript.
2. Page 2, column 1, line 25, 26: I am confused by the comment that “metal complexes show
higher catalytic activity than metal halides.” What type of catalytic activity (or reaction type)? It
seems that this is a broad claim that may oversimplify data to fit the results of the paper. I would
suggest that this comments needs clarified and properly referenced.
Answer: Usually, metal complexes are homogenous and metal halides are heterogeneous in the
reaction, so they showed higher catalytic activity than the heterogeneous metal halides. This part
has been clarified in the revised manuscript. And the properly reference was added.
3. Page 2, column 2, line 10: The authors suggest that toluene as the optimal solvent, which is also
non-polar, therefore disfavors salt or charged species formation. This is partially supported by the
fact that at nearly the same temperatures, polar solvents DMSO and DMF are poor performers.
However, I believe a key piece to this comment has been omitted entirely from the manuscript,
and that is that the NiCl2 catalyst in toluene probably yields a heterogeneous suspension. If it is
homogeneous, it should be stated as such-especially given the fact that the catalyst can be filtered
after the reaction. As I assume that solids are present during the course of the reaction, then it is
possible that other charged species could form on this surface and exist in an equilibrium (or
transiently) along with other reaction species. It may be possible that toluene is non-polar and high
boiling, allow sufficient kinetic energy for the transformation while also facilitating a
heterogeneous catalyst that supports the described reaction. Again, this based on the assumption
that the catalyst is not in solution during the reaction and this point should be clarified in the
manuscript.
Answer: This part has been deleted in the revised manuscript.
4. Page 3, column 1, lines 46–51: As a minor point, the amidation using L-phenylalanine could
offer a little insight into the reaction process. For example, the authors could expose a
separately-prepared non-racemic product (3p) to the catalyst conditions to see if the product
racemizes after amidation. The authors could also sample some unreacted amino acid during the
course of the reaction to see if the catalyst conditions racemize the amino acid. This information
could provide some insight into applications beyond the scope that the authors have presented.
Answer: Chiral derivatives of amino acid were easily to raceme under heating condition and it has
been clarified in the reference (Basavaprabhu, Muniyappa K., Panguluri N. R., et al, New J. Chem.
2015, 39, 7746-7749. (DOI: 10.1039/c5nj01047k)
5. Page 3, column 1, lines 57-60: It appears that there is only marginal loss of catalyst activity
after recycling catalyst up to three times. However, it would be insightful to see the fourth runs to
see how much of a loss in activity is observed. The authors write this as the limit, but it’s not clear
from the data that it is actually the limit.
Answer: In the fourth cycle, the yield decreased obviously because of the loss of the catalyst. We
have added the experimental data of fourth cycle in the .revised manuscript.
6. Page 1, column 2, line 33: There is mention of “small” early transition metals, but it is not
clear what this is referring to with respect to the metal. The examples provided reside in the 4th
group, and it seems that “early transition metals” is a sufficient descriptor.
Answer: “small” has been deleted in the revised manuscript.
7. Page 2, Table 1: There are a number of data points given in this table that could be omitted and
would simplify the data presentation. For example, entries 2 and 5 aren’t necessary. Also,
fluorobenzene should be abbreviated PhF, not “phF.”
I commend the authors on their writing in a non-native language. However, there are some
grammatical errors or inconsistencies in the manuscript. There are also some instances where
abbreviations do not necessarily conform to the norms (for example, HZ is used for NMR
coupling constants, and should be Hz).
Answer: “phF”has been corrected to “PhF.” “HZ”has been corrected to “Hz.”
Thank you and the reviewers for the kind advice.

Appendix C
Dear Editor:
Thank you for your comments. According to your comments, we revised and proof-read the
manuscript carefully. Here are the answers to your comments.
Part A(Comments from Editor):
(1) Figure 1, format so that all catalyst names are below the X-axis. Some are floating above the
bars. Unless the results presented in the Figure are of multiple runs, error bars should not be used.
Neither the text, nor the figure caption mention multiple runs. Also, it is not necessary to provide
the percentage yields above the bars in Figure 1.
Answer: We have made the changes in the original text as suggested by the editor.
(2) It is not necessary to provide the percentage yields above the bars in Figure 2. The change in
yield is apparent without this information. Clarify that the "1 2 3 4" in the legend for Figure 2 are
runs and not compounds.
Answer: We have made the changes in the original text as suggested by the editor and clarify that
the "1 2 3 4" in the legend for Figure 2 are runs.
(3) Format all structures in Table 2 so that they have the same scaling. Some appear to be smaller
relative to the others.
Answer: We have format all structures in Table 2 so that they have the same scaling.
(4) I believe Scheme 1 needs to be provided as a separate file like the other figures. As it appears
in the text, this graphic appears to be rather small.
Answer: We have provided as a separate file for the Scheme 1.
(5) In the response to reviewer 2 (Page 3) the authors comment about the racemization of product
3p under the reaction conditions. Please include this discussion in the main text, if it is not already
there.
Answer: We have include this discussion in the main text about the racemization of product 3p.
Sincerely yours,
Longjiang Huang
