Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
Resmini and coworkers report on the synthesis of some new naphthalimide based fluorescent
probes with fluorescence triggered by protons. They also present the case of an acidic drug which
could trigger the switching of the fluorescence of these probe molecules. Even though I find that
the compounds synthesized, characterized and discussed are very interesting, I strongly believe
that from a physical chemistry point of view this work is at the moment not suitable for
publication. I believe that the authors should place their focus on the following issues:
a) There is no discussion on the specificity between the probe and the acidic drug of interest.
Apparently, a number of acidic compounds other than flufenamic acid (FA) (including other
drugs) with similar pKa values could trigger the same effects in compounds 1, 2, and 3. Could the
authors comment on this issue? Moreover, what would happen in a solution of any of these
probes involving FA and another acidic compound? I suppose there would be a competition and
the pKa value difference of the acidic solutes would control the fluorescent switching. The
authors should provide such an example in order to discuss about the scope and limitations of
these probes.
b) It is also important to provide a thorough analysis of the effects of the polarity of the medium
(e.g. by changing solvents, adding cosolvents etc.). On page 6, last paragraph, some excitation
and emission wavelength shifts are mentioned, however no information on the solvents which
were used is provided. The authors should include the spectra they have obtained in different
solvents and also quantify this effect by the use of suitable solvent polarity scales or even linear
solvation energy relationships (LSERs). The study of the PET of these compounds is an in-
solution study and much focus should be placed on the solvent polarity effects.
Other comments:
i) It is not clear to the reader which are the structures of products A and B the synthesis and
isolation of which are presented on page 3. Please refer to structures incorporated in the ESI
material. Also, what is the contribution of compound B in this study? If none, the information
about this compound should be moved to the ESI.
ii) For compound B the melting point range is about 30 degrees C. This is a rather large range for
an analytically clean compound. Any explanations?
iii) What is the reason for the limited chemical yield of Probe 2? What improvements could be
proposed for the boost of this yield. Probe 2 is one of the three probe compounds of interest so it
is important to discuss/address this issue.
iv) Regarding the synthesis of Probe 3, could the incomplete imide ring-closure be the reason of
the limited yield to compound 3? The precipitate obtained is as the authors mentioned the
desired compound, but maybe further heating (potentially at higher temp.) might help increasing
the chemical yield to Probe 3. In other words the ring-opened product might be in the filtrate. The
authors should check/comment on this issue too.
v) I suggest the insertion of three more panels in Figure 2 so that the reader could clearly see the
UV-vis spectral differences between FA and each of the compounds 1,2, and 3.
vi) Insert plot of Figure 4: Could the authors explain the reason why they chose an equation of the
type y=a/(b+x) to fit their data? What is the physicochemical meaning of this fitting?
v) Is there some spectroscopic evidence for the formation of the intramolecular H-bond in case of
the quinoline N-protonated form of Probe 3?
vi) The proposed mechanism for fluorescence enhancement depicted in Figure 6 of the ESI is very

interesting and important and thus it should be placed in the main part of the paper, not the ESI.
vii) Typo on page 4, line 49: ...obtaine by adisulfide should become: ...obtained by a disulfide.

I believe that the authors have provided adequate answers to all questions by the referees. I am
happy to see that the authors state now that there is not specificity of their probe to fulfenamic

Appendix A
Dear Editor
On behalf of the authors we would like to thank the referees for helping us to improve
significantly the work presented in the submitted manuscript. We have addressed all the points
raised and here below we provide our responses to the individual queries.
Referee 1:
a) There is no discussion on the specificity between the probe and the acidic drug of interest.
Apparently, a number of acidic compounds other than flufenamic acid (FA) (including other
drugs) with similar pKa values could trigger the same effects in compounds 1, 2, and 3. Could
the authors comment on this issue? Moreover, what would happen in a solution of any of these
probes involving FA and another acidic compound? I suppose there would be a competition and
the pKa value difference of the acidic solutes would control the fluorescent switching. The
authors should provide such an example in order to discuss about the scope and limitations of
these probes.
The review addressed the issue of probe-drug specificity by introducing a new paragraph.
The probes reported in this work have been designed not to be specific for the FA, and in fact we
would envisage the probes being used with any small molecule drug containing an acidic group.
The probes were modified in order to have a functional group for the covalent binding to
polymeric nanocarriers. FA was used in this study as a model to prove that the modified probes
undergo to fluorescent switch when they are protonated. FA is the perfect model because is
(mildly) acidic and hydrophobic and needs to be encapsulated into carrier systems to significantly
improve its solubility in aqueous phase.
As the aim of this work was to develop new naphtalimide-based fluorescent tags that could be easily
coupled to nanocarriers, potentially for drug delivery applications, the next step focused on the
characterisation of the interactions using a model drug. The proton releasing flufenamic acid was
chosen, a hydrophobic anti-inflammatory drug, although these probes were not designed to interact
specifically with this molecule. The expectation is that these findings will be applicable to any small
drug molecule containing an acidic group.
b) It is also important to provide a thorough analysis of the effects of the polarity of the medium
(e.g. by changing solvents, adding cosolvents etc.). On page 6, last paragraph, some excitation
and emission wavelength shifts are mentioned, however no information on the solvents which
were used is provided. The authors should include the spectra they have obtained in different
solvents and also quantify this effect by the use of suitable solvent polarity scales or even linear
solvation energy relationships (LSERs). The study of the PET of these compounds is an in-
solution study and much focus should be placed on the solvent polarity effects.
This point has been addressed by further discussing the excitation and emission wavelengths in
solvents of different polarity and in co-solvent mixtures. The new dataset includes 3 new graphs
(Figure 3, page 8) showing the spectra of each probe in different environments, whereas
possible being measured at the same concentration expressed in molarity. In the discussion
section at page 7, the correlation between bathochromic/hypsochromic shift obtained and the
solvent effect has been detailed. Moreover, the same approach has been used to discuss the
fluorescence data, providing an exhaustive explanation of the fluorescence emission recorded in
solvents of different polarity and in co-solvent mixtures (page 8) and including 3 new graphs
showing the original fluorescence emissions of the three probes in these solvent environments
(Figure 4, page 9).
Other comments:
i) It is not clear to the reader which are the structures of products A and B the synthesis and
isolation of which are presented on page 3. Please refer to structures incorporated in the ESI
material. Also, what is the contribution of compound B in this study? If none, the information
about this compound should be moved to the ESI.
The authors have clarified the two structures obtained and moved the information about Probe 1
- Product B (dimer) in the Electronic Supplementary Information, as this compound has no
relevance in the study of the fluorescence emission and/or interaction with acid compound
flufenamic acid (FA), but it has been reported as deemed of interest solely from a synthetic point
of view.
ii) For compound B the melting point range is about 30 degrees C. This is a rather large range for
an analytically clean compound. Any explanations?
The authors wish to apologies, as this was a mistake. The melting point for compound B has now
been measured again, using the original samples and found to be 231-233°C . The new value
has now been inserted into the ESI.
iii) What is the reason for the limited chemical yield of Probe 2? What improvements could be
proposed for the boost of this yield. Probe 2 is one of the three probe compounds of interest so it
is important to discuss/address this issue.
The following improvements to the synthetic method can boost the yield of probe 2 to be used for
future biomedical applications.
1)Scale up the reaction
2)Stir the reaction for a prolonged time (24 hours instead than 4 hours)
3) keep the temperature to reflux (120C).
The manuscript has now been amended to reflect these suggestions.
Nevertheless, as this synthesis was carried out on a small scale, increase in chemical yields are likely to
be significantly improved by applying a combination of the following: working on a larger scale,
increasing the reaction time from 4h to 24h or even longer, and also by maintaining the temperature of
the reaction solution at 120°C.
iv) Regarding the synthesis of Probe 3, could the incomplete imide ring-closure be the reason of
the limited yield to compound 3? The precipitate obtained is as the authors mentioned the
desired compound, but maybe further heating (potentially at higher temp.) might help increasing
the chemical yield to Probe 3. In other words the ring-opened product might be in the filtrate. The
authors should check/comment on this issue too.
The TLC of the filtrate showed appearance of the starting reagents. Keeping the reaction going
on for prolonged time, 2 or 3 days, definitely increases the yield of the product, but the synthesis
reported in the manuscript in particular has been carried on for 24 hours.
The manuscript has been amended to reflect this comment.
v) I suggest the insertion of three more panels in Figure 2 so that the reader could clearly see the
UV-vis spectral differences between FA and each of the compounds 1,2, and 3.
This point has been addressed by including UV-Vis spectra of flufenamic acid and the three
probes. This section has been expanded as explained above at point b).
vi) Insert plot of Figure 4: Could the authors explain the reason why they chose an equation of
the type y=a/(b+x) to fit their data? What is the physicochemical meaning of this fitting?
The data originally presented in figure 4 have now become figure 6. The data have now been
presented in accordance with the Stern Volner equation as a plot of F0/F as a function of the
concentration of flufenamic acid, acting as the quencher. The data are now fitted to a linear plot
and this has allowed us to estimate the association constant for probe 3. See comments to
referee 2 for more detailed explanation.
v) Is there some spectroscopic evidence for the formation of the intramolecular H-bond in case of
the quinoline N-protonated form of Probe 3?
The authors have referred to the intramolecular H-bond for the quinolone N-protonated form of
probe 3 on the basis of the extensive work already available in the literature, that has already
been reported and which is cited in references 22 and 33. The protonation of the probe has been
previously reported as the main reason to justify the observation of fluorescence quenching.
vi) The proposed mechanism for fluorescence enhancement depicted in Figure 6 of the ESI is
very interesting and important and thus it should be placed in the main part of the paper, not the
ESI.
The authors have moved this section to the main manuscript, where a paragraph in the
discussion of results details the mechanism supported by reported data (references 30,31).
vii) Typo on page 4, line 49: ...obtaine by adisulfide should become: ...obtained by a disulfide.
The typo has been fixed accordingly.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_11
I read the article carefully. It is acceptable after minor revision.
1)
The author must calculate binding constants for each probe
2)
Quenching constants have to be calculated for each compound.
3)
Life times have to be calculated before and after interaction.
We wish to respond to the query by combining all three points.
First of all we would like to highlight that, as stated in the manuscript, the main purpose of the
work is to report the synthesis of the probes and their versatility, having the side chain which
allow it to be covalently linked to polymeric systems and therefore be used for applications
related to sensing and drug delivery.
Unfortunately the equipment available in our laboratories does not allow us to determine the life
times for the probes. We have tried but the system is not sensitive enough. However we have
found a reference in literature where accurate characterisation of naphalimide derivatives was
carried out and we could see that different compounds had life times comprised between 10 and
30ns. We have also seen in literature that often authors are reporting ‘estimated’ binding and
quenching constants. We have used this approach and added the relevant reference to the
manuscript.
With regards to probes 1 and 2, where fluorescence enhancement is observed, the data set
available are covering a relative small range of concentration and when the data are plotted it is
evident that saturation is not reached and in fact we are still in the linear portion of the curve.
This means that when we tried to apply the correct equation to determine the binding constant
the error was so significant that the value was not, in our view, meaningful.
With regards to probe 3, we have fitted the data to the Stern Volmer equation and obtained
linearity. We have made therefore the assumption that we in the presence of static quenching,
also due to the very low Ks and low concentration of the reagents. We have been able to
calculate the association constant and by using an estimated life time, also an estimated
quenching constant.
We have amended the manuscript accordingly by introducing two new paragraphs copied here
below.
Figure 5(C) shows the direct correlation between the fluorescence enhancement and the equivalents of
quencher (flufenamic acid) that were added for both probe 1 and probe 2. Both probes have low
solubility in the system evaluated and attempts to estimate binding and quenching constants were not
successful. Plots of F /F0 vs [FA] (figure S8, ESI) show that the data acquired are still in the linear portion
of the saturation curve. The use of the Benesi-Hildebrand equation to calculate association constants[35]
with the available data could not be implemented, as the errors associated with the analysis were too
large.
The fluorescence quenching data were analysed using the Stern-Volmer equation and plotted as F/F0 .
[FA] shown in figure 6 (B). The data can be fitted with a linear equation, with a good fitting, where the
slope provides the value for the Stern-Volmer constant (KS) of 2.79x10-7M-1. The quenching occurring
between probe 3 and flufenamic acid is presumed to occur via static quenching, due to the linearity of
the data, and also to the very small size of KS and the fact that the measurement is done at very low
concentrations. [36]. Under these assumptions, the Stern-Volmer constant can then be considered as the
association constant. Life time measurements, which would allow a more precise calculation, could not
be obtained, however literature data for naphtalimide probes[37] report values for the life time (t) of
these compounds comprised between 10 and 30 ns. If an indicative value of 20ns is used and applied
in conjunction with the Ks, it would result in an estimated value for the quenching constant for probe
3 of 13.95M-1s-1.
We hope that following the extension revision you will be able to accept the paper for
publication.
