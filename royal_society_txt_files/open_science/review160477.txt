General Comments: Content
I do not have much to suggest vis a vis content. It is challenging to read only one side of a
discussion, but as far as I can tell, the suggestions the authors make regarding the analysis (the
bulk of pages 2-4) seem appropriate. I cannot evaluate all of their claims, but they seem to be
reasonable points to present to the readers for consideration. There are only minor edits needed.
P2, ln 56/57: In the sentence, “In seven articles the individuals were aware of…” who are “the
individuals?” My assumption is the authors of the reply are referring to the authors of the
comment, but it’s not completely clear. They could also be referring to themselves in the third
person as the authors of the original article in question.
P 6 last sentence: I’m not a fan of rhetorical questions, but that is a stylistic choice. I understand
the point the authors are making. More importantly, there is no overall conclusion to the reply.
The authors should summarize their response in a civil couple of sentences.
General Comments: Tone
The authors (Norscia et al.) of this reply as well as those of the comment (Gallup & Massen)
should avoid inflammatory rhetoric that risks implying personal attacks. We are supposed to be
having a discussion of ideas, and thus we ought to keep the dialogue civil. This applies to both
the comment and the reply. I do not have access to the comment by Gallup & Massen, so I do not
know if there are issues in their tone or word choice. I encourage the editor to suggest changes to
the word choice of the comment, if and where needed. Even if there are problems with the tone of
the comment that go uncorrected, I would like the authors of the reply to take the moral high
ground, so to speak, and utilize a civil discourse. The issues I have in the word choice of the reply
are not extensive or egregious, but there are a few places where subtle changes can make a big
difference in how the reply may be interpreted by readers.
Specific lines relevant to this point:
P 2, first sentence: Remove the italics from the quoted passage, unless this is the formatting of the
reply by Gallup & Massen. May come across as derogatory.
P 3, ln 45/46: Remove the scare quotes around “free-ranging,” as again this can be misinterpreted
as derogatory, even though the authors are referring to a study by their group. Choose a
description that is accurate, even if wordier, that does not require scare quotes like this.
P 3, ln 54-57: This last sentence may be condescending. If the authors know full well that, having
reduced the meta-analysis to two articles, the power will not be there to conduct the analysis the
commentators performed on the original sample, then they should just say so. If the analysis
could be performed and may still show the effect the commentators found with the original
sample, then the authors should include a statement that the effect may indeed be there. Norscia
3
et al. can, with neutral affect, state that re-doing their calculations with the revised sample Gallup
& Massen may or may not find their original effect.
P 4, ln 43-45: Rather than “makes the results questionable” I suggest a revision to the tone of
limiting the interpretability of the results.
P 5, ln 7-25: This paragraph contains multiple wording decisions that may be interpreted as
antagonistic. I suggest a careful consideration of all the words emphasized in italics. I think that
the only one that aids clarity is ‘same’ in the parentheses in line 16. I think all others should be
normal typeface. That includes ‘different’ in the same line; having made the point with ‘same’,
italicizing ‘different’ is overkill. At the beginning of that sentence (ln 14) delete ‘very clearly’. In
line 12 change ‘never said’ to ‘did not state’. Delete the last sentence of the paragraph (A careful
reading…).
P 5, ln 32: Remove the scare quotes around restricted, and change the word if need be. I cannot
tell if the authors are quoting a source, disparaging the commentators, or making some other
point.
P 6, ln 21: Most importantly of all of these suggestions, remove and replace the word ‘attack’. No
one is being attacked here, or at least they shouldn’t be. Even if the tone of the comment warrants
this word choice, it is imperative that the authors of the reply respond with a strictly civil tone as
befitting a dispassionate, scientific discussion.

This reply presents its view in a clear and well-cited manner. I would only request that the
authors include the caveat that while sex played a statistically significant role in their paper, the
actual effect size of sex on the yawn response was quite small. It is important to clarify that
women who yawn in this setting only produce slightly more yawns than men.
4
I also wanted to indicate that my own data, where we collected a thousand people's yawn
responses to a three-minute video of people yawning, supports the claim made by the authors
that females who have a contagious yawn response yawn slightly more than men who have a
contagious yawn response. I would be happy to share my data with the authors if they would
find this useful, and they can contact me at etc3@duke.edu.
