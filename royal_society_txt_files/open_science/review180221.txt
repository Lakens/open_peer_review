Referee rapport of the manuscript “Imaging of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spin-lattice
relaxation activation energy in cartilage” by R. J. Foster, R. A. Damion, M. E Ries, S. W. Smye, D.
G. McGonagle, D. A. Binks, A. Radjenovic.
The core of the study was the measurements and analysis of proton NMR spin-lattice relaxation
time, T1, as a function of depth through the cartilage tissues. Samples of human and bovine
cartilage were examined using novel Magnetic Resonance Imaging method. The T1 was
measured for in vitro samples between 8 and 38 0C. Measurements were performed at 9.4 T
Bruker ADVANCETM II 400 MHz spectrometer. Normal MRI scans are usually collected at 1 T
magnetic field. Choosing 9.4 T magnets guaranteed better resolution between cartilages layers.
The method applied has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for detail examination of
proton dynamics in biological tissues. This paper should be published in Royal Society Open
Science. It is an excellent manuscript that is very well – written and clearly and logically
organized. References are collected professional and very carefully. I would like to strongly
recommend manuscript for publication. The performed measurements and their analysis present
significant contribution to study of proton dynamics in biological tissues.
The spin-lattice T1 relaxation in cartilages results predominately from dipolar interactions
between the hydrogen nuclei in water molecules. The relaxation observed depends on the rate of
exchange between states when water exists in the two states – bound and unbound to
macromolecules (bulk water). In the case of fast exchange between states, the observed relaxation
is monoexponential and observed relaxation rate (1/T1) is the weighted average of the relaxation
rate of different environments:
where pbound and punbound are the fractions of unbounded and bounded water in sample
(pbound + punbound = 1).
The relaxation individual inherent relaxation rates (i = bound, unbound) at the high temperature
regime are functions of correlation times that is where relaxation constant Ci is average sum of
inter-atom distances Rij to minus sixth power that is (Ni is number of i nuclei). Correlation times
follow Arrhenius relationship: where Eiact is activation energy. The molecular motion of water
molecules in the bound state is slower than in unbound state. Therefore correlation time is
higher value and . Therefore observed relaxation time T1 can be lower value for more fraction of
bounded water. The depth-wise T1 profiles presented in Fig. 2 shows diminished values of T1 as
the function of depth.
That correlation time and therefore T1 fulfilling Arrhenius relationship over studied temperature
range is presented in Fig. 3. As expected, the T1 increases with increasing temperature (Fig. 2 and
3). The effect of increasing of T1 is caused by shortening the correlation time when temperature
increases. The shortening of correlation time when temperature increases is a normal effect
proving the faster molecular motion at higher temperatures. Higher activation energy
corresponds to higher value of correlation time and shortening relaxation time T1. The activation
energy profiles through the depth of the cartilage (a) bovine and (b) human are shown in Fig. 4
are consistent with T1 profiles shown in Fig. 2. Activation energy contains new, interesting and
additional information to the spin-lattice relaxation time T1.
The conclusions presented in the manuscript are clear, consistent with the text and important
Some minor corrections (see below) are proposed before the manuscript can be accepted. The
detailed remarks concerning the manuscript :
1. The sentence “NMR spin-lattice relaxation time, T1” should be changed to “Proton NMR spin-
lattice relaxation time, T1”.
3
2. The measurements T1 are performed for samples in vitro this should be indicated.
3. I suggest writing in the acknowledgments that work was created thanks to the wonderful
discoveries of the MRI method by the recently deceased Peter Mansfield (1933 - 2017).

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors experimentally study the nuclear magnetic resonance spin-lattice relaxation time,
T1, as a function of depth through the cartilage tissues and temperatures between 8 and 38 °C. It
is shown that the T1 relaxation time is well described by Arrhenius-type dependence and the
activation energy of the relaxation process is quantified.
I think the result is a useful contribution to the fields. However, there are some points of concern,
which I recommend the authors to address before the publication:
1. The authors defined "A" as the pre-exponential factor. However "A" will have some
characteristic time known as the correlation time. The measurement of T1 will enable to
determine the correlation time. It requires additional detailed analysis of the experimental data.
2. Most importantly, I am left with the question of why would anyone want to do this
measurement? Any motivation for performing such measurements or what is to be gained
through this analysis is missing. Does one get any information that one does not already know?
Is some additional insight gained which is important? Might this help one accomplish
something? They only say " that the EA reveals additional information to that of the T1
relaxation time".

Friday 27th April 2018
Dear Editors,
Thank-you for accepting our paper “Imaging of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spin-lattice relaxation
activation energy in cartilage” (RSOS-180221), subject to minor revisions, for publication in Royal
Society: Open Science.
We have carefully reviewed the comments and discussion from the reviewers and would like to take
the opportunity to respond to the comments.
Comments from reviewer 1:
1. The sentence “NMR spin-lattice relaxation time, T1” should be changed to “proton NMR
spin-lattice relaxation time, T1.”
We agree with this comment and have amended the sentence in the abstract as the reviewer
suggested.
2. The measurements T1 are performed for samples in vitro this should be indicated
We agree with this comment and have amended the first sentence in the ‘Materials and Methods’
section, 2.1, to read: “Samples of human and bovine cartilage were examined in vitro using MRI.”
3. I suggest writing in the acknowledgements that work was created thanks to the wonderful
discoveries of the MRI method by the recently deceased Peter Mansfield (1933-2017).
We recognise the pioneering work of Peter Mansfield in the area of MRI. However we are unsure as
to the appropriateness of including this acknowledgement, since none of the authors were
colleagues or collaborators of Professor Mansfield, nor was this work inspired or developed from his
work directly. We suggest that an acknowledgement of this type is more the Editor’s decision.
Comments from reviewer 2:
1. The authors defined “A” as the pre-exponential factor. However “A” will have some
characteristic time known as the correlation time. The measurement of T1 will enable to
determine the correlation time. It requires additional detailed analysis of the experimental
data.
The reviewer is correct in his interpretation of the pre-exponential factor, A, and this can be related
to free rotation times. However, determining the intercept to the fit from the Arrhenius plot
requires extrapolation to infinite temperature / zero activation energy and corresponds to the
“inertial limit of a completely free rotor” (Carper et al, J Phys Chem vol 100, No 12, 1996 p4724). We
have included an example of this pre-factor, A, and how it varies with depth through the cartilage for
one of the samples with results presented in the main body of the manuscript (sample #1). This
figure shows a comparison of T1, EA and A variation with depth.
We believe that a full analysis of this pre-exponential factor is beyond the scope of this work,
because it does not directly impact on the key findings of the manuscript; that is the variation in EA
with depth throughout cartilage. Further, there is an added layer of complexity within such an
analysis, because there is an entropic term embedded within A that is not usually taken into account
during an Arrhenius analysis.
2. Most importantly, I am left with the question of why would anyone want to do this
measurement? Any motivation for performing such measurements or what is to be gained
through this analysis is missing. Does one get any information that one does not already
know? I some additional insight gained which is important?? Might this help one accomplish
something They only say “that the EA reveals some additional information to that of the T1
relaxation time.”
In order to clarify the motivation of the work, we have added a sentence in the final paragraph of
the introduction clearly stating the motivation of the study, thus the paragraph now reads:
“In this study, we have therefore chosen to investigate the depth-wise change in T1
relaxation time as a function of temperature to extract the depth-dependence of the EA for
the T1 relaxation process, in order to determine if new structural information could be
highlighted by this approach.”
We have also clarified the statement to which the reviewer has pointed in the results section, by the
addition of an extra sentence:
“..., which reveals that the activation energy profile is giving different and therefore
additional information to that of the T1 profile; it is this that motivates this article. A
detailed discussion of the nature and value of the additional information of the EA is given
in the conclusions.”
This is intended to point the reader to the detailed discussion regarding the additional information
provided by EA which can be found in the final three paragraphs of the conclusions section.
