This manuscript describes an analysis of the patterns and processes of morphological evolution in
sea snakes, with particular attention paid to taxa which feed on burrowing eels. The authors
document a strong pattern of convergence among these species and find evidence that these
species have shown elevated rates of morphological evolution, compared to other sea snakes.
They interpret these patterns as indicating strong selective pressure on this particular trophic
strategy.
This is a strong evolutionary morphology study. The hypotheses work together to build a
unified investigation, the statistical analyses are all appropriate to the hypotheses, and the
conclusions fit the results. The authors keep their analysis focused (almost to a fault) and the
language is very clear. I enjoyed reading this paper. I do have a few concerns and requests for
additional information, which I describe below, but overall this is a solid manuscript.
Obviously, the results of most analysis are highly dependent on the input phylogenies used.
Although I’m no expert, I have no reason to doubt the authors’ methods of phylogeny
reconstruction, and the use of 500 trees ameliorates one’s concerns about the dependence of the
results on any one particular tree. However, the use of this many trees seems at odds with some
of the authors’ later assertions. Is it really the case that for every one of the 501 trees analyzed
here (the maximum credibility tree + 500 others) there were always 9 independent lineages of
microcephalic snakes, no more, no less? If so, that’s remarkable and should be stated. If not,
perhaps the authors could describe the distribution of independent lineages (mean +/- st. dev.?)?
The presence (which the authors point out) of two distinct morphological clusters of burrowing
eel specialists does raise the possibility of unrecognized phylogenetic signal, but this could be
easily exorcised if the authors assert (which I suspect is the case) that these two clusters never
comprised two clades in any of the phylogenies.
Even in the case of the maximum clade credibility tree, the claim of so many independent
lineages is somewhat dubious – for example, there’s a clade consisting of three burrowing eel
specialists (H. coggeri, belcheri, and jerdoni) and three non-burrowing eel specialists (H.
cyanocinctus, melanocephalus, and parviceps) in the tree (S1). I don’t know what the transition
matrix looks like for trophic specialization, but lacking that it seems as though a single transition
to feeding on burrowing eels, followed by a transition away, might be just ask likely as three
independent transitions to feeding on burrowing eels. Again, it would be great if the authors
could quantify this uncertainty. I note that this will not necessarily invalidate the conclusions of
this paper, but it would be helpful for readers looking to understand the strength and magnitude
of the patterns.
To this end, I strongly recommend including a phylogeny (such as Figure S1) with
burrowing/burrowing eel specialists labelled. It could replace or be combined with Figure 1.
Similarly, the results also are highly dependent on proper dietary data. These are often
frustratingly hard to come by, and I am impressed that the authors were able to find data on so
many species. I worry that the different sources of gut content data may have introduced biases
in the study, however, so a bit more detail would be appropriate. Did any of the studies only
look at gut contents in one sex? Did some look at juveniles and adults? Are there possible
3
seasonal biases in the gut content data? Again, these could have strong effects on the results, so
some assurances would be welcome.
I think the authors should also provide a bit more information on their morphological
measurements. If certain sea snakes are interesting for their microcephalic morphology, why
weren’t any head measurements taken? Is neck girth a good proxy for head size? And is relative
neck girth a good proxy measure of “microcephalicness?” Looking at the picture, it seems as
though the microcephalic snakes have, not only narrow heads, but also narrow bodies posterior
to the head. Do the measurements capture this aspect of morphology, and do they need to? This
seems biologically relevant – a narrow head and anterior body seems useful for preying on
burrowing eels, while a narrow head by itself does not. Some clarity would be useful here.
Along those lines, I was surprised to see a lack of any functional interpretation in the Discussion
section of this paper. Perhaps I’m too much of a functional morphologist, but I think that a
sentence or two on the functional significance of the small heads would be welcome. Why are the
small heads particularly useful for burrowing eels, and not gobies?
These are really my most substantive critiques of the paper. Smaller issues are listed below.
Overall, this paper represents an interesting, well-constructed study of some fine snakes, with
good analyses and interesting results. It will make a find contribution to the literature. The
convergence results are particularly interesting – I note that the C1 of 0.55 represent an average
among all pairs of burrowing eel specialists, even though these are found in two distinct clusters.
If the values were calculated within each cluster individually, they’d be much higher. In general,
this is a really strong pattern of convergence, and should be noted as such.
Smaller-scale comments (numbers indicate pages, then line numbers):
4,45 – I think that “Yule” is capitalized.
5,19 – “Individuals with obvious stomach or gut contents…” Ah, but it’s the non-obvious ones
that get you! Were there any other methods used to determine if the specimens were
inappropriately “full”?
5,20 – Why wasn’t SVL used as the proxy of body size, rather than total length?
8,17-18 – If I understand this correctly, this means that longer snakes also tend to have relatively
smaller heads, yes? Thus it’s probably very important to point out that the microcephalic snakes
are not particularly large, and thus their microcephaly is not due simply to this larger-scale
allometric trend.
8, 51 – Would it be worthwhile to compare the burrowing eel specialists to other burrowing
pretty specialists, as well as to “all other species”? Maybe it’s the burrowing prey that induces
rapid evolution, or maybe there’s another trophic group in the “other” category that’s bringing
everyone else down.
9,9 – “evolutionarily highly labile” compared to what? Other snakes? Other organisms?
Where’s the data?
9,11 – Well, body size and shape seem strongly correlated with trophic ecology in burrowing eel
specialists. The pattern isn’t bad for burrowing goby specialists, and you really didn’t look in
detail at other trophic specialists. This is fine, but this statement should be appropriately
qualified.
4
9,19 – “nine of the ten lineages are derived from non-microcephalic species”. I think this
phrasing is confusing – why not just say “microcephaly evolved nine times among sea snakes”?
Figure 2 – The colors here are kind of hard to see. The colored parts of the dots should be made
bolder or wider.

This is a fascinating and well-written paper that describes how dietary specialization on
burrowing prey has repeatedly influenced the morphological diversification of microcephalic sea
snakes. These results will be of broad interest to evolutionary biologists, morphologists, and
herpetologists. I have a few minor comments to the authors that I think would help improve this
work.
This manuscript revolves around dietary specialization and utilizes new diet data from
specimens collected in the field, as well as published diet data obtained from the literature, to
generate a diet variable (proportion of burrowing prey; 0-1) for 48 species of sea snakes. These
diet data are summarized in table S3 of the supplementary material, which only provides the
species, the diet variable, and type of burrowing prey (goby, burrowing eel, or crevice eel). This
table is unsatisfactory in describing the trophic ecology of sea snake species and should be
expanded in my opinion, as the results presented here are dependent on this diet variable. A
more detailed table describing the trophic ecology of each species would also be incredibly
valuable to other researchers. Which of these diet variables are based on the literature (and what
are the specific sources for each species) versus new data collected in the field? How many
Hydrophis specimens and how many prey items were examined to generate each diet variable?
The methods also state that prey records were classified based on type (eel-like, perch-like, etc.)
and habit (burrowing, crevice-sheltering, etc.), but non-burrowing data (perch-like, crevice-
sheltering) are seemingly absent from the S3 table. Furthermore, it appears that there is no
5
distinction between "type" and "habit", as stated in the methods. All "burrowing eel", "crevice eel',
and "goby" prey items are classified as burrowing in table S3. I believe some ophichthid, congrid,
muraenid, and gobiid species are non-burrowing. All eels are combined in the paper and
described as "burrowing eels".
Figure 2 demonstrates that 10 species and nine independent lineages of sea snakes have
repeatedly evolved microcephalic morphologies that correspond with a trophic specialization on
burrowing eels. Another interesting observation that can be made from Figure 2 (although it is
not currently discussed in the manuscript) is that an alternative mechanism to specializing on
burrowing prey is to have an overall small body size, which likely includes a proportionally
small head size. These small-bodied burrowing specialists prey on gobies rather the eels.
Astonishingly, it appears that reducing body size isometrically to specialize on burrowing prey is
a less common evolutionary event than becoming microcephalic, which requires a decoupling
between the head and body. It is unclear in the phylomorphospace plot if the sister taxa to
microcephalic species are generally of small or large total body length. Is a microcephalic
morphology more advantageous than a miniaturized form in sea snakes? Is the large overall
body size of microcephalic species a requirement to successfully prey on eels? Is prey size data
available for the goby and burrowing eel prey items collected in the field?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
This is a well-written and interesting paper that investigates the repeated evolution of
microcephaly in Hydrophine sea snakes. The methodologies that are employed and the
interesting story should make it appealing to a broad audience. I only have a few suggestions that
I believe will help improve the Manuscript.
Firstly, I feel that this paper is missing an opportunity with figure 1: I think the narrative would
clearer if the time-calibrated phylogeny was added, with a column of labels or some other
graphic showing the degree to which terminal taxa display microcephaly (perhaps a color-coded
6
spectrum to show the neck width / body width ratio), and a second column to show diet choice.
This way the authors can show at a glance 1) the relationships and rapid diversification at the
base of Hydrophis and 2) the repeated evolution of microcephaly and how it is correlated with
eating eels. I know figure 2 does have the phylogeny mapped onto the plot, but this arrangement
makes the relationships very hard to follow.
Secondly, I think that the authors could stand to emphasize the interesting bi-modality of
phenotypes in snakes that specialize on burrowing prey: the Eel-eaters seem to converge on a
small headed, big body phenotype, while the goby eaters have become smaller overall. This is
fascinating to me- presumably ancestrally large bodied Hydrophine snakes display two
developmental pathways to produce animals with small, tunnel-probing heads: making their
heads relatively small compared to their bodies and making their whole body small; The group
has repeatedly evolved the former and only once the latter. If this interpretation is correct, I think
this could be explored more extensively in the discussion- why retain a large body? Presumably
to retain the ability to consume larger prey? Could the gut contents data could be used to confirm
this?
Finally, I wondered if a simple phylogenetic ANOVA would be a good addition to the
convergence test to show the morphological specialization for eel-eating and goby eating.
Looking at figure 2, I suspect that this analysis would show eel eaters display a significantly
different relative girdle length to non-eel eaters, while goby eaters are significantly smaller than
non-goby eaters. This would help underline the pattern I mentioned above.
Overall, this is a great paper and the authors should be congratulated. I would be happy to
review an updated version of this manuscript if the editor deems it necessary.

Comments to the Author:
Dear Authors,
This paper is well written and has been well received by the reviewers. Interestingly all
reviewers comment on similar required improvements. If you could address each of the
reviewers comments we feel the paper will be much improved.
All reviewers would like more information regarding trophic ecology of snakes and prey. Clarity
on the burrowing habits of prey fish as well as the characteristics of the snakes involved in the
study (i.e. sex, ontogeny, season collected). As well there is a general consensus that more
detailed information should be included on morphological measurements of snakes to help
elucidate the study. The first reviewer is also concerned with the accuracy of the phylogeny
chosen. More information regarding specifically the support for the phylogeny used here would
be helpful.
Finally, and possibly most interesting, is a richness of discussion that has been brought up by
multiple reviewers and will add a great new dimension to the paper. Two of the reviews really
stress the importance of the bi-modality of morphology in these snakes (small head relative to
body, vs overall small body). This is a really interesting aspect to the data that is not touched and
really should be.
The reviewers make some nice comments that could be easily brought into the paper. This is a
nice, very well written paper.
We look forward to a thorough address of each of the reviewers reports.
Sincerely,
Em

This is a fascinating and well-written paper that describes how dietary specialization on
burrowing prey has repeatedly influenced the morphological diversification of microcephalic sea

herpetologists. I have a few minor comments to the authors that I think would help improve this

morphology more advantageous than a miniaturized form in sea snakes? Is the large overall
body size of microcephalic species a requirement to successfully prey on eels? Is prey size data
available for the goby and burrowing eel prey items collected in the field?

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a well-written and interesting paper that investigates the repeated evolution of
microcephaly in Hydrophine sea snakes. The methodologies that are employed and the
interesting story should make it appealing to a broad audience. I only have a few suggestions that
I believe will help improve the Manuscript.
Firstly, I feel that this paper is missing an opportunity with figure 1: I think the narrative would
clearer if the time-calibrated phylogeny was added, with a column of labels or some other
13
graphic showing the degree to which terminal taxa display microcephaly (perhaps a color-coded
spectrum to show the neck width / body width ratio), and a second column to show diet choice.
This way the authors can show at a glance 1) the relationships and rapid diversification at the
base of Hydrophis and 2) the repeated evolution of microcephaly and how it is correlated with
eating eels. I know figure 2 does have the phylogeny mapped onto the plot, but this arrangement
makes the relationships very hard to follow.
Secondly, I think that the authors could stand to emphasize the interesting bi-modality of
phenotypes in snakes that specialize on burrowing prey: the Eel-eaters seem to converge on a
small headed, big body phenotype, while the goby eaters have become smaller overall. This is
fascinating to me- presumably ancestrally large bodied Hydrophine snakes display two
developmental pathways to produce animals with small, tunnel-probing heads: making their
heads relatively small compared to their bodies and making their whole body small; The group
has repeatedly evolved the former and only once the latter. If this interpretation is correct, I think
this could be explored more extensively in the discussion- why retain a large body? Presumably
to retain the ability to consume larger prey? Could the gut contents data could be used to confirm
this?
Finally, I wondered if a simple phylogenetic ANOVA would be a good addition to the
convergence test to show the morphological specialization for eel-eating and goby eating.
Looking at figure 2, I suspect that this analysis would show eel eaters display a significantly
different relative girdle length to non-eel eaters, while goby eaters are significantly smaller than
non-goby eaters. This would help underline the pattern I mentioned above.
Overall, this is a great paper and the authors should be congratulated. I would be happy to
review an updated version of this manuscript if the editor deems it necessary.

Dear Editorial Team,
We are grateful for the opportunity to revise our manuscript accepted in Royal Society Open Science
entitled "Trophic specialisation drives morphological evolution in sea snakes" authored by Dr. Emma
Sherratt, Arne R. Rasmussen, and Dr. Kate L. Sanders.
The reviewers raised a good point about the bi-modality of the burrowing prey specialists and we have
added text and analyses to explore this. We have also provided a comprehensive table in the Dryad
submission of our collated diet data so that this is available to other researchers going forward. We have
clarified the few misunderstanding and inconsistencies regarding the morphological data and the
phylogeny. We have addressed all of the reviewers' comments in the letter below.
We hope that this revised manuscript is suitable for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Yours sincerely,

Comments to the Author:
Dear Authors,
This paper is well written and has been well received by the reviewers. Interestingly all reviewers
comment on similar required improvements. If you could address each of the reviewers comments we
feel the paper will be much improved.
All reviewers would like more information regarding trophic ecology of snakes and prey. Clarity on the
burrowing habits of prey fish as well as the characteristics of the snakes involved in the study (i.e. sex,
ontogeny, season collected). As well there is a general consensus that more detailed information should
be included on morphological measurements of snakes to help elucidate the study. The first reviewer is
also concerned with the accuracy of the phylogeny chosen. More information regarding specifically the
support for the phylogeny used here would be helpful.
Finally, and possibly most interesting, is a richness of discussion that has been brought up by multiple
reviewers and will add a great new dimension to the paper. Two of the reviews really stress the
importance of the bi-modality of morphology in these snakes (small head relative to body, vs overall
small body). This is a really interesting aspect to the data that is not touched and really should be.
The reviewers make some nice comments that could be easily brought into the paper. This is a nice,
very well written paper.
We look forward to a thorough address of each of the reviewers reports.
Sincerely,
Em

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript describes an analysis of the patterns and processes of morphological evolution in sea
snakes, with particular attention paid to taxa which feed on burrowing eels. The authors document a
strong pattern of convergence among these species and find evidence that these species have shown
elevated rates of morphological evolution, compared to other sea snakes. They interpret these patterns
as indicating strong selective pressure on this particular trophic strategy.
This is a strong evolutionary morphology study. The hypotheses work together to build a unified
investigation, the statistical analyses are all appropriate to the hypotheses, and the conclusions fit the
results. The authors keep their analysis focused (almost to a fault) and the language is very clear. I
enjoyed reading this paper. I do have a few concerns and requests for additional information, which I
describe below, but overall this is a solid manuscript.
Obviously, the results of most analysis are highly dependent on the input phylogenies used. Although
I'm no expert, I have no reason to doubt the authors' methods of phylogeny reconstruction, and the use
of 500 trees ameliorates one's concerns about the dependence of the results on any one particular tree.
However, the use of this many trees seems at odds with some of the authors' later assertions. Is it really
the case that for every one of the 501 trees analyzed here (the maximum credibility tree + 500 others)
there were always 9 independent lineages of microcephalic snakes, no more, no less? If so, that's
remarkable and should be stated. If not, perhaps the authors could describe the distribution of
independent lineages (mean +/- st. dev.?)? The presence (which the authors point out) of two distinct
morphological clusters of burrowing eel specialists does raise the possibility of unrecognized
phylogenetic signal, but this could be easily exorcised if the authors assert (which I suspect is the case)
that these two clusters never comprised two clades in any of the phylogenies.
> We realise there was mistaken information reported regarding this issue. We reported the results of
the R package convevol function 'convnum', which takes a set of taxa that are already suspected to be
convergent in a particular area of morphospace, and counts the number of times that a lineage has
invaded that region of morphospace, taking into account the position of the ancestral nodes in this
space. This value is 9, derived from the maximum credibility tree, and the mean number from the 500
trees is 8.7 (+/- 0.49). In summary: 7 lineages = 11, 8 lineages = 112, 9 lineages =377. We realise this
is not the same as reporting the number of lineages that are microcephalic, as inferred from transitions
on the tree. We have amended the text and provided this information in the results section.
Even in the case of the maximum clade credibility tree, the claim of so many independent lineages is
somewhat dubious - for example, there's a clade consisting of three burrowing eel specialists (H.
coggeri, belcheri, and jerdoni) and three non-burrowing eel specialists (H. cyanocinctus,
melanocephalus, and parviceps) in the tree (S1). I don't know what the transition matrix looks like for
trophic specialization, but lacking that it seems as though a single transition to feeding on burrowing
eels, followed by a transition away, might be just ask likely as three independent transitions to feeding
on burrowing eels. Again, it would be great if the authors could quantify this uncertainty. I note that this
will not necessarily invalidate the conclusions of this paper, but it would be helpful for readers looking to
understand the strength and magnitude of the patterns.
>As answered above, we mistakenly reported this and have subsequently corrected the manuscript. In
terms of the transition matrix for trophic specialisation, Figure 1 shows the reader that it is between 6
and 7 transitions to feeding on burrowing eels, depending on whether H. cyanocinctus is a reversal or
coggeri and melanocephalus + parviceps acquired the specialization independently. We have amended
the manuscript to be clear on this. And we are grateful to the reviewer for pointing out this discrepancy.
To this end, I strongly recommend including a phylogeny (such as Figure S1) with burrowing/burrowing
eel specialists labelled. It could replace or be combined with Figure 1.
>We have amended Figure 1 to include a phylogeny that highlights the dietary information used in this
study.
Similarly, the results also are highly dependent on proper dietary data. These are often frustratingly
hard to come by, and I am impressed that the authors were able to find data on so many species. I
worry that the different sources of gut content data may have introduced biases in the study, however,
so a bit more detail would be appropriate. Did any of the studies only look at gut contents in one sex?
Did some look at juveniles and adults? Are there possible seasonal biases in the gut content data?
Again, these could have strong effects on the results, so some assurances would be welcome.
>A detailed summary of the data collated on diet has now been provided in the Dryad repository. Where
known, these data exclude juvenile snakes. Several studies (notably Fry et al 2012) have collated large
diet datasets (>100 individual sea snakes) for several species but have not observed sexual dimorphism
or seasonal biases in prey type, so we do not expect our results to be substantially impacted by these
potential biases.
I think the authors should also provide a bit more information on their morphological measurements. If
certain sea snakes are interesting for their microcephalic morphology, why weren't any head
measurements taken? Is neck girth a good proxy for head size? And is relative neck girth a good proxy
measure of "microcephalicness?" Looking at the picture, it seems as though the microcephalic snakes
have, not only narrow heads, but also narrow bodies posterior to the head. Do the measurements
capture this aspect of morphology, and do they need to? This seems biologically relevant - a narrow
head and anterior body seems useful for preying on burrowing eels, while a narrow head by itself does
not. Some clarity would be useful here.
>The term 'microcephalic' coined by Voris and Voris 1983 is misleading, and does not do justice to the
actual morphology of these animals because it is not simply the head that is small but also the forebody
girth is severely reduced compared to the hindbody girth. We mention this in the paper in the
introduction and materials and methods and it is shown very clearly by Figure 1. Since we focussed on
body shape in this paper (as head-specific data is an ongoing study that will be published at a later
date), we decided that the girth of the neck does capture this aspect of the morphology adequately and
is consistent with the measurements taken on ¼ of the SVL for the microcephalic species (not shown).
Along those lines, I was surprised to see a lack of any functional interpretation in the Discussion section
of this paper. Perhaps I'm too much of a functional morphologist, but I think that a sentence or two on
the functional significance of the small heads would be welcome. Why are the small heads particularly
useful for burrowing eels, and not gobies?
>This is a good point the reviewer raises and we are happy to include this information in the discussion.
These are really my most substantive critiques of the paper. Smaller issues are listed below. Overall,
this paper represents an interesting, well-constructed study of some fine snakes, with good analyses and
interesting results. It will make a find contribution to the literature. The convergence results are
particularly interesting - I note that the C1 of 0.55 represent an average among all pairs of burrowing
eel specialists, even though these are found in two distinct clusters. If the values were calculated within
each cluster individually, they'd be much higher. In general, this is a really strong pattern of
convergence, and should be noted as such.
>We thank the reviewer for their support.
Smaller-scale comments (numbers indicate pages, then line numbers):
4,45 - I think that "Yule" is capitalized.
>Done
5,19 - "Individuals with obvious stomach or gut contents…" Ah, but it's the non-obvious ones that get
you! Were there any other methods used to determine if the specimens were inappropriately "full"?
>Certainly it is not possible to account for all gut contents, but the number of specimens measured
coupled with diligent palpation and outlier analysis allowed us to be reasonably sure of the data.
5,20 - Why wasn't SVL used as the proxy of body size, rather than total length?
>We used total length because this was given more consistently in the literature than SVL.
8,17-18 - If I understand this correctly, this means that longer snakes also tend to have relatively
smaller heads, yes? Thus it's probably very important to point out that the microcephalic snakes are not
particularly large, and thus their microcephaly is not due simply to this larger-scale allometric trend.
>Not exactly, no. The statistical relationship between relative girth and maximum total length is
reported for completeness. However the correlation should be taken with caution - as stated in the
paper, it is clear that the relationship between these two variables is clearly not linear (Figure 2 shows
this). We have added to the text that the GLM estimated slope is -0.52, implying a shallow, negative
correlation.
8, 51 - Would it be worthwhile to compare the burrowing eel specialists to other burrowing pretty
specialists, as well as to "all other species"? Maybe it's the burrowing prey that induces rapid evolution,
or maybe there's another trophic group in the "other" category that's bringing everyone else down.
>We had previously run the rates analysis defining the goby specialists and found there is no difference
between them and the other non-burrowing pre specialists, nor is including them in the model reported -
the goby specialists are not doing anything differently to the other species, and thus it is only the
burrowing-eel specialists that are showing this marked shift in rates of morphological evolution.
9,9 - "evolutionarily highly labile" compared to what? Other snakes? Other organisms? Where's the
data?
>The data presented show that both of these traits are very variable among closely-related taxa. We do
not think this needs any further clarification in this sentence.
9,11 - Well, body size and shape seem strongly correlated with trophic ecology in burrowing eel
specialists. The pattern isn't bad for burrowing goby specialists, and you really didn't look in detail at
other trophic specialists. This is fine, but this statement should be appropriately qualified.
>We have amended this sentence. Trophic ecology is referring to proportion of burrowing prey in the
diet and we have clarified this.
9,19 - "nine of the ten lineages are derived from non-microcephalic species". I think this phrasing is
confusing - why not just say "microcephaly evolved nine times among sea snakes"?
>We have edited this sentence to fix the error as explained above, but we retain the original wording
because it is concise in that it explains that the species are derived from non-microcephalic ancestors.
Figure 2 - The colors here are kind of hard to see. The colored parts of the dots should be made bolder
or wider.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a fascinating and well-written paper that describes how dietary specialization on burrowing prey
has repeatedly influenced the morphological diversification of microcephalic sea snakes. These results
will be of broad interest to evolutionary biologists, morphologists, and herpetologists. I have a few minor
comments to the authors that I think would help improve this work.
This manuscript revolves around dietary specialization and utilizes new diet data from specimens
collected in the field, as well as published diet data obtained from the literature, to generate a diet
variable (proportion of burrowing prey; 0-1) for 48 species of sea snakes. These diet data are
summarized in table S3 of the supplementary material, which only provides the species, the diet
variable, and type of burrowing prey (goby, burrowing eel, or crevice eel). This table is unsatisfactory in
describing the trophic ecology of sea snake species and should be expanded in my opinion, as the
results presented here are dependent on this diet variable. A more detailed table describing the trophic
ecology of each species would also be incredibly valuable to other researchers. Which of these diet
variables are based on the literature (and what are the specific sources for each species) versus new
data collected in the field?
>We agree that what we originally provided was not sufficient and a detailed summary of all of the data
collated on diet has now been provided in the Dryad repository. This includes references (literature or
field observation) for each individual prey record.
How many Hydrophis specimens and how many prey items were examined to generate each diet
variable?
>A total of 1400 prey items were collated from 281 records and are summarised in the spreadsheet now
provided in the Dryad repository. Like terrestrial snakes, sea snakes typically feed on single, large prey
items, so that very few snakes have more than one prey item in their stomach.
The methods also state that prey records were classified based on type (eel-like, perch-like, etc.) and
habit (burrowing, crevice-sheltering, etc.), but non-burrowing data (perch-like, crevice-sheltering) are
seemingly absent from the S3 table.
>Present in the spreadsheet now provided in the Dryad repository.
Furthermore, it appears that there is no distinction between "type" and "habit", as stated in the
methods. All "burrowing eel", "crevice eel', and "goby" prey items are classified as burrowing in table
S3. I believe some ophichthid, congrid, muraenid, and gobiid species are non-burrowing. All eels are
combined in the paper and described as "burrowing eels".
>We have addressed this inconsistency by giving prey "type/form" and "habit" separately in the
spreadsheet now provided in the Dryad repository. We follow the prey classification scheme of Voris and
Voris (1983). This classes most of the large Muraenidae (morays) and Congridae (congers, excluding
burrowing garden eels) as crevice eels. Ophichthidae (snake eels) and Moringuidae (worm or spaghetti
eels) are classed as burrowing; this is justified by the many morphological specialisations to burrowing
in these groups. Not all gobies or goby-like fishies are treated as burrowing; burrowing gobies such as
worm and eel like gobies are distinguished from non-burrowing gobies ("sitters" sensu Voris and Voris
1983).
>The original submission had a table S3 in which the prey item "crevice eels" was stated, which are the
large Muraenidae. We have decided to focus this study only on species with >70% burrowing prey in
their diet, and none of these snakes fed on predominantly crevice eels so only goby and burrowing eel
specialists are discussed. Incidentally, the crevice-eel feeders are the long-bodies snakes on the far right
of the morphospace in Figure 2.
Figure 2 demonstrates that 10 species and nine independent lineages of sea snakes have repeatedly
evolved microcephalic morphologies that correspond with a trophic specialization on burrowing eels.
Another interesting observation that can be made from Figure 2 (although it is not currently discussed in
the manuscript) is that an alternative mechanism to specializing on burrowing prey is to have an overall
small body size, which likely includes a proportionally small head size. These small-bodied burrowing
specialists prey on gobies rather the eels. Astonishingly, it appears that reducing body size isometrically
to specialize on burrowing prey is a less common evolutionary event than becoming microcephalic,
which requires a decoupling between the head and body. It is unclear in the phylomorphospace plot if
the sister taxa to microcephalic species are generally of small or large total body length. Is a
microcephalic morphology more advantageous than a miniaturized form in sea snakes? Is the large
overall body size of microcephalic species a requirement to successfully prey on eels? Is prey size data
available for the goby and burrowing eel prey items collected in the field?
>This is an excellent observation, and is shared by reviewer 3. We now explore this in the discussion but
suggest that selection for larger, microcephalic bodies (instead of miniaturising) is driven by diving
abilities as well as allowing larger prey to be taken; however, testing these ideas is beyond the scope of
the current paper.

This is a well-written and interesting paper that investigates the repeated evolution of microcephaly in
Hydrophine sea snakes. The methodologies that are employed and the interesting story should make it

>We thank the reviewer for this great suggestion and we have amended Figure 1 to include a phylogeny

pattern I mentioned above.
>We performed two phylogenetic ANOVAs for relative girth and max total length against diet type
(burrowing eel, goby, or none). Both are significant, indicating these traits differ between the three
groups. Relative girth is significantly higher in burrowing eel specialists than goby specialists or other
species. Max total length is significantly lower in goby specialists, intermediate in eel specialists and
higher in the rest. A new supplementary figure is included to show these in more detail and the text has
been updated.
Overall, this is a great paper and the authors should be congratulated. I would be happy to review an
updated version of this manuscript if the editor deems it necessary.
