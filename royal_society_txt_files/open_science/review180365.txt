General comments
This work investigated environment problems caused by Chuankou open-pit limestone quarry.
The manuscript is, in general, interesting but in the present form is more a technical report than a
scientific article or maybe a mix. I strongly suggest to use the canonical subdivision of chapters:
introduction, material and methods; result, discussions, conclusions. It needs
improvements/clarifications in many points. The introduction should be extended in some parts
(see specific points) while the methods section needs several elucidations. I also strongly suggest
to clarify method and result sections: what are the authors measuring? Which is effect of the
treatments the authors are applying (i.e. before and after the treatment)? Some terms across the
manuscript do not follow those of standard scientific literature.
1) Title and across the manuscript: What does “environmental geological restoration” means? It’s
not clear to me. In general, when a quarry is recovered, the commonly used forms are “ecological
restoration” or “environmental restoration”.
2) P2-LL21-22. Geological environment. Again this is strange a terminology. In ecological
restoration this is rarely used. I recognize that, this term is probably used from people following
in engineering approach. For this reason I would insert a definition of this term. For instance I
found the definition of Niec et al. “The geological environment is defined as the natural and
anthropogenic forms of the earth’s surface relief, exposing parts of the geological structure along
with all the geological processes shaping it (now and in the past) and with all mineral resources
available for use, and also the preserved signs of mining activity and building works in the
vicinity which indicate the scale of the use of minerals occurring in it” (see Pietrzyk-Sokulska
2012- AGH Journal of Mining and Geoengineering, Vol. 36, No. 1)
3) P3-LL44-46. The authors state: “At present, there are few researches about how to treat the
environmental problems and restore ecosystem of abandoned limestone quarry, especially for the
quarry with deep open-pit and steep palisades”. I do not agree. There are a lot of works treating
the environmental problems of abandoned limestone quarry. For instance, see and cite:
a) Gilardelli F., Sgorbati S., Citterio S., Gentili R., 2016 - Restoring limestone quarries: hayseed,
commercial seed mixture or spontaneous succession? Land Degradation & Development 27: 316-
324.
b) Gilardelli F., Armiraglio S., Sgorbati S., Citterio S., Gentili R., 2015 - Assigning plant
communities to a successional phase: time-trend in abandoned limestone quarries – Plant
Biosystems 150: 799-808.
c) Tropek R, Kadlec T, Karesova P, Spitzer L, Kocarek P, Malenovsky I, et al. 2010. Spontaneous
succession in limestone quarries as an effective restoration tool for endangered arthropods and
plants. J Appl Ecol 47(1): 139–147.
d) Khater C, Martin A, Maillet J. 2003. Spontaneous vegetation dynamics and restoration
prospects for limestone quarries in Lebanon. Appl Veg Sci 6(2): 199–204.
The preceding paragraph from LL11 to 41 needs to be extended. The argument should be
addressed from a theoretical point of view. The problems related to the vegetation establishment
in quarry activity have to be more focused. Which ecological filters encounter species to establish
in abandoned quarry? What about the problem related to the slope stability? After that the
authors could introduce the paragraph related to the active restoration that is able to facilitate
3
more quickly the recovery of a natural vegetation and animal colonization. About these issue
there are numerous works to be cited, in addition to the above mentioned. For instance: the
works of Novak and Prach 2003; Prach K, Reounkhovà 2006; Gentili et al. 2011; Gilardelli et al.
2015.
Methods (Paragraph 4).
What does the authors measured or tested? Is there a control in their protocol?
Did they measure revegetation cover (before and after)? Did they compare vegetation cover with
the vegetation cover outside the quarry? Did they measure stability before and after the
treatment? Did they measure slope design?
Authors should have to clearly state what they are measuring, which statistics they are using and
so on. If this is a scientific article readers need to know these information in the method section.
Minor points
The language needs improvements. I suggest a professional proofreading service.

Manuscript comments (RSOS-171623):
This paper takes the abandoned Chuankou open-pit limestone quarry, located in Tongchuan
City, Shaanxi Province, Northwest China, as engineering case. The work investigated the
geological environment problems in mining area and proposed a new method to treat these
environmental problems and restore local ecosystem to some extent. And the numerical analysis
and field investigation after construction completion evaluate the stability and subsidence
deformation of artificial filling slope. The study is systematic, substantial and significative, which
could provide a reference for other analogous engineering.
Still, some technical errors should be corrected.

1. Some grammatical mistakes exits, e.g. at line 31 “cover 7.69×106 m2”; at line 34” people or
government pay more and more attention to protect the mining environment”; at line 45
“report”, and so on.
2. In this paper, “sedimentation”, “settlement” and “subsidence” are used to express the
subsidence deformation. Maybe, the subsidence is better expression, and the expression should
be uniform.
3. The Fig.3 and 5 are nor very clear.
4. The Fig.12 is not clear, and some words is blurry.
5. The Section 5.2 should illustrate the constitutive model of this numerical model and load. I
guess the model is Mohr-Coulomb model, and the load is the self-weight.
In summary, the paper expresses the geological environmental problems induced by the
exploitation and novel method to solve these problems and restore local ecosystem to some
extent. I think the paper could be published in this journal after minor revision.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_5
I am glad to assess that the manuscript in its current form is much better than the previous
version. The authors addressed the several of the referee´s concerns appropriately. Particularly,
the general structure is more consistent (specifically introduction), also the readability was
considerably advanced. However, there are still some deficiencies, which may be addressed in a
further revision (i.e., moderate revision).
In particular the scheme of fig 10 should be also applied to the result section then some parts of
the method reporting some results should be moved in the Result section. Several figures should
be joined to increase the readability of the manuscript.
P2L40: “..and other projects have provided valuable…” please remove “have”
8
P2L48-50: “After development for decades, the land reclamation rate of the Malan iron mine….
Not clear sentence, please rephrase
P3L8-23: “Unlike the significant adverse impacts of many other mined rock material such as coal,
ore on the environment… as well as the occurrence of potential geological mining hazards[22].”
This is a very confusing paragraph with strange sentences, in particular: “focus on the physical
effect rather than the chemical impact [12-15], including species extinction”. This has not a sense.
Please rephrase
P3L43: “…if suitable environmental conditions occur…”. Please add “suitable”
P4L3. Please add multidisciplinary i.e. “comprehensive and multidisciplinary study” with
P4L6: please rephrase…… “comprehensively carried out by implementing and integrating
complex engineering and revegetation measures”
P5L45 “jujube, thorn” Please include scientific names and then italicize them, including Setaria
viridis and Arteimisia giraldii
P6L42-45.please rephrase. I suggest…. “..the vegetation establishment is considerably limited”
M&M and RESULTS
P9FIGURE 10. This is a very clear and impressive figure that really explain your work. You have
to follow the same scheme both in M&M and in the Results. Indeed, in your M&M you often mix
methods with some results. You should move such paragraph in the results section. For instance:
A) the results of the profiles of the artificial design slope should be reported in a table and put in
the Results; at present you only report an interesting figure (12a,b). B) Probably, some results of
“artificial slope construction” (i.e. Fig. 13) should be also moved and described in the Results; C)
idem for the revegetation; D) perhaps also some parts of paragraph 2.2.2
This is an important point that really would strength your work
P12LL16-29. I understand that the authors are not ecologist or botanist but the name of species
have to be replaced (or reported by parenthesis) with scientific name of the species then the
scientific name must be italicized. The authors are reporting a mixed list of common and scientific
names
P12L16-29. Did you monitor the establishment of vegetation? If yes please report in the result
section
P14L31 replace “will be focused on for…” with “will be monitored for”
P1439-40. Please cite this work indicating the stabilizing effect of the root systems on slopes:
Gilardelli F., Vergani C., Gentili R., Bonis A., Chanteloupe P., Citterio S., Chiaradia E.A., 2017 -
Contribution of herbaceous species' roots to topsoil stabilisation on quarry dump deposits. Land
Degradation & Development 28: 2074–2085
P14L44-48. I would extend this part of the discussion that is quite interesting. In particular, you
can discuss that a correct slope design can help the increase in vegetation cover can that in turn
can reduce the environmental hazard of debris flow and other risks.

The manuscript has further improved and it’s almost ready for publication (i.e. minor revision).
In the following specific comments I’ll give mention to some language problems (probably the
grammar is correct but the authors use a not common terminology or phrasing) and the need to
extend a bit the discussion, comparing your work/method with those of already published in

List of Responses to the first Reviewer’s Comments for Manuscript RSOS-171623
Appendix A
Reviewer #1:
We deeply appreciate your time and effort reviewing our manuscript. Your comments regarding
missing content and vague descriptions were valuable and helpful for revising and improving our
paper. Additionally, they provided important guiding significance to our future research. Thus, we
have studied the comments carefully and have made the appropriate corrections. Over a half of the
original paper has been modified and updated, and all amendments have been highlighted in red in
the revised manuscript.
This paper takes Chuankou open-pit limestone quarry located in Tongchuan City, Shaanxi
Province, Northwest China, as the engineering case. In quarry, the original earth surface in mine area
have been completely stripped, and the eco-environment have been completely destroyed. Based on
the field investigation about current environmental problems in mine area induced by over 40 years
limestone exploitation activities, this paper proposes a systematic method, including engineering
measure and revegetation measure. The engineering measure, which is the construction of artificial
slope, solve the current environmental problems including land degradation, land occupation, dust
pollution and potential geological disasters, and provided site condition for revegetation measure.
Through revegetation measure, the trees, shrubs and grass were planted on the artificial slope surface.
The planted vegetation was selected according to the local climate, which contain but not just contain
the local species. After treatment, the local eco-system have been restored very well. And this
provides a useful reference for analogous engineering cases.
As suggested, we have updated the contents and structure of the paper as the canonical
subdivision of chapters. The abstract have been modified and the introduction have been re-whited to
enhance the logic of this paper. Moreover, the description on the current environmental situation in
mine area in Section 2 have been simplified and the description way about environment treatment
method have been recomposed to highlight the theme. Some figures have modified to make them
clearer. The revised manuscript has been edited by American Journal Experts (AJE), and the editing
certificate is attached. Some errors have been modified, and the revised paper was again reviewed for
grammar and English. We have attached details of the modifications to the manuscript below. These
corrections are as follows.
1. We have rewritten the abstract make it more logical and clear. In this abstract, we focus on
the description about the environment treatment method, rather than the stability analysis of artificial
slope.
In general, rock material exploitation activities, such as limestone or granite exploitation, would
cause serious damage to the ecological environment near the mine area. With economic development
and the ever-increasing demand for ore resource, mining activities have induced very serious
environmental issues in China. Therefore, environmental restoration work around mines in China is
required. This study explores the Chuankou open-pit limestone quarry in Tongchuan City, Shaanxi
Province, Northwest China, as the engineering case. The environmental issues caused by 40 years of
limestone exploitation were investigated; these issues included land degradation, land occupation,
1
List of Responses to the first Reviewer’s Comments for Manuscript RSOS-171623
dust pollution and potential geological disasters. Combining the characteristics of this quarry with a
summary of previous studies on environmental restoration work, this paper proposes a novel and
systematic method that was comprehensively carried out through engineering and revegetation
measures. The engineering measure, that is, the construction of an artificial slope by using local
abandoned construction materials, solved the environmental problems in this quarry and provided
site conditions favourable for revegetation. The revegetation measure restored the local ecosystem.
This method provides both a new idea for the sustainable development of a mining area and a useful
reference for analogous engineering cases.
2. As suggested, we have referred and supplied the domestic and overseas research status about
environmental treatment of limestone quarry. Indeed, a large number of researches about
environment treatment of abandoned limestone quarry have been finished. And we have modified
this kind of description. According to the relative references and engineering experience, the original
earth surface in limestone quarry would been completely stripped, which seriously destroy the local
ecosystem. Moreover, the loss of surface water and exposed bedrock induced that it is very difficult
that vegetation spontaneously grow.
Unlike the significant adverse impacts of many other mined rock material such as coal, ore on
the environment, the damage of limestone exploitation activities on integrated ecological systems
near mining area mainly focus on the physical effect rather than the chemical impact, including
species extinction, wetland destruction, and dust and particulate matter formation as well as the
occurrence of potential geological mining hazards. In addition, these limestone exploitation activities
usually also has a significant adverse effect on hydrological processes, consuming significant
quantities of water and contaminating the surface water and shallow groundwater.
With the development of economy, non-metallic materials such as limestone are widely used as
building materials, and significant amounts of industrial raw materials are exploited. In 2011, China
consumed up to 2.68 billion tons of limestone to produce cement. As a result, the exploitation of
limestone has seriously destroyed the ecology environments in these mining areas. At present, there
are many studies on how to treat environmental problems and restore ecosystems of abandoned
limestone quarries. Robert et al. discussed the effect of spontaneous succession as a vegetation
restoration tool and agreed that it is effective. Gilardelli et al. studied the vegetation restoration effect
of different methods and provided valuable suggestions for limestone quarry environmental
restoration. In general, if environmental conditions occur, natural succession will have a good
recovery effect. However, for a limestone quarry, it is long-term and difficult work to restore the
ecosystem because the vegetation and layers of soil are often completely removed during resource
extraction. Therefore, appropriate human intervention is necessary. Considering these adverse factors,
this paper takes the Chuankou limestone quarry with a deep open pit and steep palisades as an
engineering case. Moreover, combining the characteristics of this quarry with a summary of previous
studies on environmental restoration work, a novel and comprehensive method, which can restore the
local environment and ecosystem, was proposed. The idea was comprehensively carried out through
engineering and revegetation measures. Through the engineering measure, an artificial slope was
filled with local abandoned building materials that included rock debris, construction waste and loess;
this measure solved the environmental problems induced by the limestone exploitation activities over
40 years, including land degradation, land occupation, dust pollution and potential geological
2
List of Responses to the first Reviewer’s Comments for Manuscript RSOS-171623
disasters. In addition, the slope provides site conditions favourable for artificial revegetation.
Furthermore, the revegetation measure restored the local ecosystem. This method provides both a
new and effective idea to use in the sustainable development of an abandoned limestone quarry and a
useful reference for analogous engineering cases.

3. The description about mine area and current environmental problems in mine area have been
modified in Section 2.1 and 2.2. Indeed, as a scientific artificial, these description is too redundant.
Therefore, as to the content about study area and the land degradation, land resource occupation, dust
pollution, potential geological hazards, unnecessary and repetitive expression was deleted, and
redundant content was simplified. And the revised content was highlighted in red.
3
List of Responses to the first Reviewer’s Comments for Manuscript RSOS-171623
4. The environment treatment method have been rewritten more clearly and logically in Section
2.3. We adjusted the content and order of description. The method contains engineering measure and
revegetation measure. The engineering measure was divided to two section. The first section is the
artificial slope design to guarantee the stability of slope and facilitate the construction. The second
section is the artificial slope construction, which includes unstable rock cleaning, backfill of mining
pits, construction of reinforced soils slope, drainage of the rain, watertightness of slope top and
deformation monitoring. The revegetation measure includes artificial vegetation restoration and
water storage. In this case, considering local climate and environment, and guaranteeing the survival
rate, the species of trees, shrub and grass were selected, which focus on the survivable and general
species surrounding mine area.
Because of the limestone exploitation activities, the local landscape and eco-environment have
been destroyed, and a series of environmental problems, including land degradation, dust pollution,
surface water loss and potential geological hazards, have been caused. Moreover, the loss of surface
water and exposed bedrock make it very difficult for vegetation to spontaneously grow.
Considering the characteristics of this quarry, a novel environmental restoration measure is
proposed. The implementation processes are shown in Figure 10. Through an engineering measure,
this method takes full advantage of the local construction materials, including the rock debris,
construction waste and abandoned loess. Using a mixture of these materials, an artificial slope is
filled. The engineering measure eliminated the environmental problems induced by the limestone
exploitation activities and provided site conditions favourable for artificial revegetation.

5. The effect of environment and ecosystem restoration have been rewritten in Section 3.1. We
focus on the environment problems treatment and the restoration of vegetation.
In summary, through the implementation of the project, the local environmental problems
4
List of Responses to the first Reviewer’s Comments for Manuscript RSOS-171623
including land degradation, land occupation, dust pollution and potential geological disasters were
relieved and eliminated, guaranteeing the safety of nearby engineering facilities and the security of
the personal. Compared with the previous eco-environment, the artificial slope provided a favourable
growth environment (Figure 14). Therefore, the artificial vegetation grew well and formed a local
ecology system that integrated into the surrounding environment (Figures 15 and 16). In addition, the
human intervention accelerated the recovery process of the ecological environment.
6. The future work about the development of vegetation and animal colonization in mine area and
the effect of vegetation on slope stability is discussed in Section 4.
The environmental treatment method in this paper provides a novel and systematic idea to use for
the restoration of abandoned limestone quarries, especially for quarries with deep open pits and steep
palisades. Through revegetation, a local ecological environment in the mine area was formed.
Because of the result of manual selection, the species in the mine area are similar to but more
abundant than those outside the vegetation cover. However, the development of vegetation and
animal colonization in mine areas will be focused on for a long time. In addition, this type of work is
in process.
By combining the previous numerical simulation with the field investigation, the slope was found
to have good stability. In general, vegetation is advantageous for slope stability, due to the anchorage
effect of deep roots of woody plants on the slope, the reinforcement effect of shallow roots of
herbaceous plants on the slope and the slope erosion prevention that vegetation cover offers [38]. In
addition, the field investigation shows that the slope surface erosion clearly diminished. However,
the study of the effect of vegetation on slope stability is complex. This topic will be paid close
attention in the future work.
7. We modified the Figures. 2, 5, 13, 16 and 18 to make them more clear. Moreover, the
figures.10, 11 and 14 were supplied. Figure.10 indicated the revised environment treatment method.
Figure.11 showed the current terrain and the profile design of artificial slope. The figure.14 was
added and descripted the artificial revegetation on artificial slope.

fluent. Additionally, some necessary content noted by the reviewers has been added. Some errors
have been modified, and the revised paper was again reviewed for grammar and English. We have
attached details of the modifications to the manuscript below. The detail revision is listed:

Reviewer #2:
We deeply appreciate your time and effort reviewing our manuscript, as well as your affirmation
for this paper. Your comments regarding missing content and vague descriptions were valuable and
helpful for revising and improving our paper. Additionally, they provided important guiding
significance for our research. We have studied the comments carefully and made the appropriate
corrections.
We have updated the contents and structure of the paper as the canonical subdivision of chapters.
The abstract have been modified and the introduction have been re-whited to enhance the logic of
this paper. Moreover, the description on the current environmental situation in mine area in Section 2
have been simplified and the description way about environment treatment method have been
recomposed to highlight the theme. Some figures have modified to make them clearer. The revised
manuscript has been edited by American Journal Experts (AJE), and the editing certificate is attached.
Some errors have been modified, and the revised paper was again reviewed for grammar and English.
We have attached details of the modifications to the manuscript below. These corrections are as
follows.
1. We have rewritten the abstract to make it more logical and reasonable.
In general, rock material exploitation activities, such as limestone or granite exploitation, would
cause serious damage to the ecological environment near the mine area. With economic development
and the ever-increasing demand for ore resource, mining activities have induced very serious
environmental issues in China. Therefore, environmental restoration work around mines in China is
required. This study explores the Chuankou open-pit limestone quarry in Tongchuan City, Shaanxi
Province, Northwest China, as the engineering case. The environmental issues caused by 40 years of
limestone exploitation were investigated; these issues included land degradation, land occupation,
dust pollution and potential geological disasters. Combining the characteristics of this quarry with a
summary of previous studies on environmental restoration work, this paper proposes a novel and
systematic method that was comprehensively carried out through engineering and revegetation
measures. The engineering measure, that is, the construction of an artificial slope by using local
abandoned construction materials, solved the environmental problems in this quarry and provided
site conditions favourable for revegetation. The revegetation measure restored the local ecosystem.
This method provides both a new idea for the sustainable development of a mining area and a useful
reference for analogous engineering cases.
2. The manuscript has been edited by American Journal Experts (AJE), and the editing certificate
is attached.
3. As suggested, we have referred and supplied the domestic and overseas research status about
environmental treatment of limestone quarry. Indeed, a large number of researches about
environment treatment of abandoned limestone quarry have been finished. And we have modified
this kind of description. According to the relative references and engineering experience, the original

earth surface in limestone quarry would been completely stripped, which seriously destroy the local
ecosystem. Moreover, the loss of surface water and exposed bedrock induced that it is very difficult
that vegetation spontaneously grow.
Additionally, ten citations were added in the paper.

4. The description about mine area and current environmental problems in mine area have been
modified in Section 2.1 and 2.2. Indeed, as a scientific artificial, these description is too redundant.
Therefore, as to the content about study area and the land degradation, land resource occupation, dust
pollution, potential geological hazards, unnecessary and repetitive expression was deleted, and
redundant content was simplified. And the revised content was highlighted in red.
5. The environment treatment method have been rewritten more clearly and logically in Section
2.3. We adjusted the content and order of description. The method contains engineering measure and

revegetation measure. The engineering measure was divided to two section. The first section is the
artificial slope design to guarantee the stability of slope and facilitate the construction. The second
section is the artificial slope construction, which includes unstable rock cleaning, backfill of mining
pits, construction of reinforced soils slope, drainage of the rain, watertightness of slope top and
deformation monitoring. The revegetation measure includes artificial vegetation restoration and
water storage. In this case, considering local climate and environment, and guaranteeing the survival
rate, the species of trees, shrub and grass were selected, which focus on the survivable and general
species surrounding mine area.
6. The effect of environment and ecosystem restoration have been rewritten. We focus on the
environment problems treatment and the restoration of vegetation.
7. We modified the Figures. 2, 5, 12, 14 and 19 to make them more clear. Moreover, the
figures.11, 12 and 15 were supplied. Figure.11 indicated the revised environment treatment method.
Figure.12 showed the current terrain and the profile design of artificial slope. The figure.15 was
added and descripted the artificial revegetation on artificial slope.
8. The future work about the development of vegetation and animal colonization in mine area and
the effect of vegetation on slope stability is discussed in Section 4.
9. According to the comments, we have modified the text to make the paper more logical and
fluent. Additionally, some necessary content noted by the reviewers has been added.
1) The figure order of whole paper have adjusted.
2) We supplied the detail of revegetation measure in Section 2.3.2 in Page 17 and 18.
3) The geological environment treatment in all article have been changed as environment
treatment, including the title, text and so on. In this paper, the ecology restoration is a part of the
environment treatment.
4) The “sedimentation” and “settlement” have been replaced by “subsidence” in Section 3.2 in
Page 19 and Section 5 in Page 22. The description was uniform.
5) We supplied the content constitutive model and the load condition in numerical simulation in

In recent years, with the development of the economy in China, non-metallic materials such as
limestone are widely used as building materials, and significant amounts of industrial raw materials
are exploited. From 2010-2016, annual average consumption of limestone used to produce cement in

China exceeds 2.5 billion tons. As a result, the limestone exploitation caused a strong adverse impact
on integrated ecological systems near these mining areas. Considering the own characteristics of
limestone exploitation, the environment damage reduced by limestone exploitation mainly include
species extinction, wetland destruction, dust and particulate matter pollution and potential mining
geological hazards etc. In addition, these limestone exploitation activities usually also has a
significant adverse effect on hydrological processes, consuming significant quantities of water and
contaminating the surface water and shallow groundwater.

difference between your method ecosystem of an abandoned limestone quarries with deep
and other restoration methods open pits and steep palisades. Compared with previous
(with adequate citations). 2) studies, in this method, the mixture of rock debris,
Cost benefits of your technique. construction waste and loess were selected as the
building materials, which overcame the deficiencies of
10 high permeability of rock debris, construction waste and
the collapsibility of loess. Moreover, the design of
multi-level slope guaranteed its own stability and
facilitated the revegetation.
In the engineering case, the cost of the environmental
restoration project in this abandoned limestone quarry
was approximately 40 million Yuan. This project had
been conducted, solving the environmental problems in
this quarry, restoring the local ecosystem and improving
