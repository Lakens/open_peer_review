In this paper, a lead-resistant bacterium, Bacillussubtilis X3, was used to prepare a lead
bioadsorbent for immobilization and removal of lead in lead solution. Over the topic is
interesting, however the paper is missing so much basic information. Major revision is needed if
this paper can be accepted.
1. Page 3, line 24, The authors should explain why the adsorption capacity increased with the
increase of pH, not just present a phenomenon.
2. Fig. 1(A) and (B), what do the abscissas represent?
3. Fig. 1(C), this figure should be revised and the title of abscissas should be revised to adsorbent
concentration (g/L).

Pb5(PO4)3, Pb10(PO4)6(OH)2 and Pb5(PO4)2Cl. However, there is no any analysis. You
absolutely have to use citations to back up your statements.

label_comment_2
This manuscript by Qiao, Zhang, and Luo is an overall well-written report on their study with
lead bioimmobilization by Bacillus. The authors used several lines of evidence to show sorption
of lead onto the biomass. There are only a few details in the manuscript that need to be
edited/added in order to make the methods more clear.
Specific comments:
Page 1 Line 22 – the “subtilis” is not capitalized.
Page 2 Line 27 – What does ‘manually’ mean here with regards to genomic DNA extraction. Is
there a protocol to reference? If not, some brief details on genomic DNA extraction need to be
provided.
Page 2 Line 28 – What primers were used for the PCR of the 16S rRNA gene?
Page 2 line 43 – What is the form of lead here? Is it lead nitrate still? Be specific.
Page 2 line 59 – The qe in the figures is in terms of mg/g, yet here, they would be in mg/(g-
L)*mL (concentrations are in mg/L and V is in mL). The authors should change V here to L (or
concentration to mg/mL) so that the units would cancel (and double check that their reported
data is correctly in mg/g, and not mg/(g-L)*mL)
The number of replicates are not clear in the methods. Were each condition in 3.3 tested in
triplicates? There are standard errors shown in the figures so I think there were, but this should
be explicit.
Page 3, line 13. 16S rDNA isn’t a thing. The authors should change this to “16S rRNA gene” here
and elsewhere.
Figure 1 – The figure legend needs to make clear what panel A, B, C, and D are showing (and x-
axis labels on A and B are needed).

Comments to the Author:
The authors have done a good job addressing most of the concerns raised by the previous
reviewers. However, there is still one item they should clarify.
One of the reviewers raised the following question:
"Comment: The title of figure 3. XPS spectra of the lead shot precipitate and B. subtilisX3 biomass,
(a) full spectrum; (b) Pb-4f spectrum; (c) C-1s spectrum. However, there is only one figure. Please
explain."
The author's response was:
"Response: We are sorry for the mistake. Here we only analyzed Pb-4f spectrum of the lead shot,
so there is only one figure here."
The figure caption for Figure 3 still reads the same and strongly implies that there are multiple
parts to this figure, but there is clearly only one part there. Please revise the Figure caption so it is
more representative of what is there.

Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:
Appendix A
Dear Editor and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments
concerning our manuscript entitled “Bioimmobilization of lead by
Bacillus subtilis X3 biomass isolated from lead mine soil under
promotion of multiple adsorption mechanisms” (No.: RSOS-181701).
Those comments are all valuable and very helpful for improving our
paper, and they are also an important reference to our future researches.
We have carefully considered the comments and have made
corrections.
Reviewer # 1:
(1) Comment: Page 3, line 24, The authors should explain why the
adsorption capacity increased with the increase of pH, not just present
a phenomenon.
Response: We have added the explaination of the phenomenon in
page3, Line 3-8 (5. Disscusion). That is: “Ren et al. (2015) pointed out
that pH is one of the most important parameters affecting the solubility
of metal ions and functional groups on the cell wall of biomass. A
functional group such as a carboxylate on the bacterial cell wall is
protonated below 4.0, and Pb(II) is weak in competition with hydrogen
ions at the adsorption site on the surface of the cell. Therefore, the
lower Pb(II) absorption capacity was caused by more hydrogen ions at
a pH of 3.0 to 4.0 ”.
Reference:
Ren, G., Jin, Y., Zhang, C., Gu, H., Qu, J. 2015 Characteristics of
Bacillus sp. PZ-1 and its biosorption to Pb(II). Ecotoxicol.
Environ. Saf. 117, 141-148
(2) Comment: Fig. 1(A) and (B), what do the abscissas represent?
Response: The abscissas in Fig.1 (A) is “pH”, and that in Fig.1(B)
is “Time (min)”. We have added the abscissas in the figure.
(3) Comment: Fig. 1(C), this figure should be revised and the title of
abscissas should be revised to adsorbent concentration (g/L).
Response: We have revised the abscissas in Fig.1(C) according to
the reviewer’s comment. The abscissas “ absorbent quality(g)” has
been replaced by “adsorbent concentration (g/L)”.
(4) Comment: 4.3.3 XRD analysis, page 4, line 32-33, the authors
stated that Pb2+ was transferred to Pb5(PO4)3, Pb10(PO4)6(OH)2 and
Pb5(PO4)2Cl. However, there is no any analysis. You absolutely have
to use citations to back up your statements.
Response: The MID Jade software can calculate the chemical
structure to obtain the molecular according to the XRD spectra of lead
shot. Previous studies had similar statements (Levinson et al.; Mire et
al.), which was mentioned in our manuscript( Page 5,Line 9)

(5) Comment: The experimental conditions of Figure 1 should be
provided in figure title.
Response: We have added the experimental conditions (in a
shaker at 25°C and 150 rpm for half an hour) to the caption of Fig.1.
(6) Comment: The title of figure 3. XPS spectra of the lead shot
precipitate and B. subtilisX3 biomass, (a) full spectrum; (b) Pb-4f
spectrum; (c) C-1s spectrum. However, there is only one figure. Please
explain.
Response: We are sorry for the mistake. Here we only analyzed
Pb-4f spectrum of the lead shot, so there is only one figure here.
(7) Comment: The figures in page 9-11 and figures in page 12-16 are
same.
Response: We have deleted the same figures.
Reviewer # 1:
(1) Comment: Page 1 Line 22 – the “subtilis” is not capitalized.
Response: We have revised the “Bacillus subtilis X3” to
“Bacillus subtilis X3”.
(2) Comment: Page 2 Line 27 – What does ‘manually’ mean here with
regards to genomic DNA extraction. Is there a protocol to reference? If
not, some brief details on genomic DNA extraction need to be
provided.
Response: Genomic DNA of strain X3 was extracted using
Bacterial Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Sangon, China). We extracted
the genomic DNA according to the protocol of the Kit, which is the
conventional operation.
(3) Comment: Page 2 Line 28 – What primers were used for the PCR
of the 16S rRNA gene?
Response: We have added the primers in our manuscript:
f1 (5’-AGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3’) and r1
(5’-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3’)
(4) Comment: Page 2 line 43 – What is the form of lead here? Is it
lead nitrate still? Be specific.
Response: The solution contained Pb(NO3)2 (200, 400, 600, 800,
1000, 1200, 1400 mg L-1 of Pb2+). We have revised the sentence.
(5) Comment: Page 2 line 59 – The qe in the figures is in terms of
mg/g, yet here, they would be in mg/(g-L)*mL (concentrations are in
mg/L and V is in mL). The authors should change V here to L (or
concentration to mg/mL) so that the units would cancel (and double
check that their reported data is correctly in mg/g, and not
mg/(g-L)*mL)
Response: We have revised the mistake. That is: “…C0 and Ce
were the initial and final concentrations of lead (mg/L), respectively
and V and M were the volume of solution (L) and the weight of the
biomass (g), respectively”.
(6) Comment: The number of replicates are not clear in the methods.
Were each condition in 3.3 tested in triplicates? There are standard
errors shown in the figures so I think there were, but this should be
explicit.
Response: Each experiment was performed with three biological
and technical replicates. The 95% confidence interval (P<0.05) was set
as the significance threshold. We have added the sentence in our
manuscript.
(7) Comment: Page 3, line 13. 16S rDNA isn’t a thing. The authors
should change this to “16S rRNA gene” here and elsewhere.
Response: We have corrected all the mistake according to the
reviewer’s comment.
(8) Comment: Figure 1 – The figure legend needs to make clear what
panel A, B, C, and D are showing (and x-axis labels on A and B are
needed).
Response: We have corrected Fig.1 according to the reviewer’
comment.

Response: We are sorry for the mistake. We have checked Fig.3 and
its caption carefully. Then we added a part in Fig.3 and revised the
caption for Fig.3. The caption is: “XPS spectra (Pb-4f spectrum) of the
