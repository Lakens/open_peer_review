This paper deals with the study of the stability of three pesticides in oil samples prior analysis.
The paper is well written and experiments well conducted, yet, novelty is low since the study of
the stability of analytes is included routinely in all analytical method and do not merit
publication in a scientific journal. Also, the use of disulfoton and fenthion is discontinued and
banned (at least in EU) since 2007, so such compounds will be rarely found in the samples. As
such, I recommend rejection.

The authors present the study of “The stability of organophosphorus pesticides in peanut and
soybean extracting solutions”. In this study, the stability of three organophosphorus pesticides in
peanut and soybean extracting solutions were analyzed under different storage conditions. I
think this interesting study can provided data support for storage and pretreatment of food
sample before quality inspection. However, the manuscript is not well organized. So in my
opinion, it can be accepted in Royal Society Open Science after substantial revisions.
1. Please carefully reorganize and polish the total manuscript to demonstrate the research
significance and related discussion should be added. Related discussion is simple. Please
reorganize section 3 by adding more discussion instead of simply mentioning the results and
tables.

2. The title of the manuscript is ‘in peanut and soybean extracting solutions’, However, the
following sample preparation and test did not distinguish between soybean and peanut.
3. There are many spelling and formatting errors in the manuscript, for example, Line 103,
‘increased to 260 <U+2103>at 20 <U+2103> min -1’ should be ‘increased to 260 <U+2103> at 20 <U+2103> min-1’, line 108, ‘50L’
should be ’50 mL’, line 114 ‘10hr’ changed to ’10 h’… the format of this manuscript should be
Unified and adjusted to fit the journal requirement.
4. Fig. 1 has no figure captions and too vague to see. Please provide several high-quality figures
and figures for supporting the results.
5. Experiments and results seem simple, and the results are just in tables without error analysis.
The font size in the table. 2 is not uniform, and the ‘35 <U+2103>’ can be written directly in the title.
6. The formula in 3.2 should be written in Experimental.
7. What’s the meaning of ‘5g samples’ in line 108?
8. Why are the fungicide standards dissolved in acetonitrile and diluted with ultra-pure water
instead of corresponding solvents?
9. The LODs and LOQs were the concentrations produced at a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 3 and
10, so why the values of LOD and LOQ of phorate and fenthion are equal?
10. The years of reference are old and more literatures needed to be supplemented, I suggest the
authors to search the published papers during the last three years more completely in order to
give a subjective comparison.
11. Conclusion seems long, which should be simplified to include a brief summary and a
promising outlook.

The authors have carefully responded all the comments and accordingly revised the manuscript
for a great improvement. All the responses and revisions are satisfactory, except the following
two points still need to be further optimized in the manuscript before its publication in RSOS.
1. The revised Conclusion still needs optimization. I think your response to Reviewer 1 can be
suitably added as outlook, which will fully demonstrate the important necessity and significance
of the present work. For example, related similar descriptions about “In the future, the new
pesticides with similar structures can perform the similar stability with the same matrix or refer
to the results of this article.”etc.
2. The supplemented and updated references are still not enough. The reference should be
expanded to covering some more publications. Since the study of the stability of analytes is
included routinely in all analytical method, several recently related sample preparation methods
relevant to analytes stability should be cited to support this manuscript as follows:
Please add the references in the suitable positions in lines 40-46. “Sample preparation is

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_10
This paper deals with the study of the stability of three pesticides in oil samples
prior analysis. The paper is well written and experiments well conducted, yet,
novelty is low since the study of the stability of analytes is included routinely in all
analytical method and do not merit publication in a scientific journal. Also, the use
of disulfoton and fenthion is discontinued and banned (at least in EU) since 2007, so
such compounds will be rarely found in the samples. As such, I recommend
rejection.
Response:
Thank you for your comments.
Storage stability is part of the mechanistic study to investigate the instability of
certain types of pesticides or certain groups, provide similar stability reference
studies for the development of new similar pesticides in the future, or some known
pesticides contain the similar groups have not been subjected to similar studies for
reference.
It is well known that chlorpyrifos is very stable and even used as an internal
standard compound in some experiments. Phorate, Disulfoton and Fenthion are
relatively unstable, but in what circumstances and how unstable it is. Especially in
this matrix, there is no previous research. The stability of compounds with similar
functional groups is also the same as them. In the future, the new pesticides with
similar structures can perform the similar stability with the same matrix or refer to
the results of this article.
# 2 Reviewer’s comments:
1. Please carefully reorganize and polish the total manuscript to demonstrate the
research significance and related discussion should be added. Related discussion is
simple. Please reorganize section 3 by adding more discussion instead of simply
mentioning the results and tables.
Response:
Thank you for your comments. We have revised the manuscript carefully and added
related part detailed in a new paragraph. In addition, we have added relevant
references to compared with other published articles in this field to demonstrate
the research significance and related discussion.
2. The title of the manuscript is ‘in peanut and soybean extracting solutions’,
however, the following sample preparation and test did not distinguish between
soybean and peanut.
Response:
Thank you for your comments. It should be explained that we handled the peanut
and soybean samples with the same way because they belong to the same
classification group, high oil content group, and we have revised the manuscript
carefully and added related part detailed in the section of “Sample preparation”.
3. There are many spelling and formatting errors in the manuscript, for example,
Line 103, ‘increased to 260 <U+2103>at 20 <U+2103> min -1’ should be ‘increased to 260 <U+2103> at 20 <U+2103>
min-1’, line 108, ‘50L’ should be ’50 mL’, line 114 ‘10hr’ changed to ’10 h’… the
format of this manuscript should be Unified and adjusted to fit the journal
requirement.
Response:
Sorry for our mistakes. We have revised the manuscript carefully and these have
been corrected.
4. Fig. 1 has no figure captions and too vague to see. Please provide several high-
quality figures and figures for supporting the results.
Response:
Thank you for your comments. We have revised the Figure carefully and this has
been supplemented.
5. Experiments and results seem simple, and the results are just in tables without
error analysis. The font size in the table. 2 is not uniform, and the ‘35 <U+2103>’ can be
written directly in the title.
Response:
Thank you for your comments. We have revised the experiments and results
carefully and added related part detailed in a new paragraph. In addition, we have
added relevant references to compared with other published articles in this field to
demonstrate the research significance and related discussion. And we have revised
the table 2 and corrected its font size and corresponding content.
6. The formula in 3.2 should be written in Experimental.
Response:
Thank you for your comments. We have revised the expression of that formula in
section 3.2 carefully and added related expression detailed in manuscript.
7. What’s the meaning of ‘5g samples’ in line 108?
Response:
Thank you for your comments. ‘5g samples’ ’in line 108 was that the weighing
sample of peanut and soybean was 5 g. We have revised the expression carefully in
manuscript.
8. Why are the fungicide standards dissolved in acetonitrile and diluted with ultra-
pure water instead of corresponding solvents?
Response:
Sorry for our mistakes. We have revised the manuscript carefully and these have
been corrected as follows: ‘Working standard solutions were prepared daily by
diluting the stock standard solution with acetonitril to the required concentrations'.
9. The LODs and LOQs were the concentrations produced at a signal-to-noise (S/N)
ratio of 3 and 10, so why the values of LOD and LOQ of phorate and fenthion are
equal?
Response:
In the vicinity of the detection limit, the laws of Langby's Beer are generally not
strictly observed. 3.3 is based on a linear relationship, which is inconsistent with
reality. The LOD and LOQ is by the actual experiments.
10. The years of reference are old and more literatures needed to be supplemented,
I suggest the authors to search the published papers during the last three years
more completely in order to give a subjective comparison.
Response:
Thank you for your comments. We have revised the manuscript carefully and added
related part detailed in some new paragraphs. In addition, we have added relevant
new references to demonstrate the research significance and related discussion.
11. Conclusion seems long, which should be simplified to include a brief summary
and a promising outlook.
Response:
Thank you for your comments. We have revised the conclusion carefully.
