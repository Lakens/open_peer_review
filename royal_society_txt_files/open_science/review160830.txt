Dear Author,
This paper investigated how scrounging by predators affects to predator-prey dynamics stability
and a paradoxical theoretical phenomenon, named as paradox of enrichment. As mentioned by
the author, this is a kind of predator interference that is known to stabilize the predator-prey
dynamics. In addition, the stabilization by scrounging has been shown by a previous study
(Coolen et al. 2007). However, as emphasized by the author, this paper has focused on the effects
of paradox of enrichment. I think that it will have some contribution to this theme.
Before publication, I think that several changes in the ms are necessary as below.
[1] Since this paper is related to the paradox of enrichment, he should mention about many
papers on this topic.
[2] Some biological examples about scrounging should be mentioned.
[3] Before examining one predator-two prey systems with optimal foraging, the author should
examine one predator-two prey systems without optimal foraging. This model can find purely
effect of scrounging in such system.
[4] In fig. 2, 3, 4, f/F=1 should be base line. Please show the results assuming f/F=1, and then
continuously change the values.
[5] Why f is not divided by the number of producers? Is this assumption critical to the main
result?
[6] The part of Page 10, Line 170-Page 11, Line 175 should be moved into section 3.1.1.

Review of Toyokawa, Scrounging by foragers can resolve the paradox of enrichment.
This manuscript derives ways to eliminate the paradox of enrichment from the interaction of
predators with their victims. The paradox: give prey more of the resources that individuals need
to increase their net rate of reproduction and, sometimes, their population goes extinct.
The principal addition of the ms to the simplest predator-prey dynamical system is "scrounging."
Instead of searching for prey that have not been caught, some predators look for prey that have
already been caught and try to steal it from the predator that caught it. The latter predator is
called the producer. In his models, the author assumes that the producer obtains a fraction of the
value of the prey, but then must share the rest equally with all members of its population. The
manuscript shows that scrounging, under certain circumstances, can eliminate the paradox. It
does this for both a two species interaction, and a three species interaction (two prey species).
The mathematical models of this manuscript are straightforward. Even though they are
sometimes quite simplified, I have no problem with them because the manuscript amounts to an
existence theorem; thus it need be true only for a single case, and the author provides two. I
encourage the author to mention this fact.
Although its English is fine, the manuscript could be written to achieve a much greater impact.
Most important are the unusual terms used. These include scrounging; producer; divisible prey.
All three of these terms are defined in the manuscript, but in various strange places, often after
having been used without a definition. For example, we encounter the notion of divisible prey on
line 45. We are not told what that means until line 64 and we have to work very hard to deduce
what it means from line 64. Then there is the footnote at the bottom of page 6, which defines the
term producer. I strongly recommend a short glossary of these few terms near the beginning of
the paper. I also recommend that, wherever the author needs them in the abstract, they need to be
defined therein.
In the same spirit, I recommend a short non-technical description of the common features of the
models.
The author can reach many more ecologists by relating what he is doing to well known ecological
concepts. He does this already by speaking about competition. But he can bring in Fretwell's
concepts of optimal foraging, i. e., Ideal free distribution and Ideal despotic distribution. In the
absence of scrounging, predators should distribute themselves according to ideal free rules. By
adding the scrounging, the paper divides predators into two classes, producers and scroungers.
These two do not receive an equal return for their efforts: producers get more than scroungers.
That resembles the Ideal despotic distribution in which some forgers, the despots, get a greater
return than others.
Another point worth mentioning is the stabilizing effect of competition. We knew this, graphed
it, and wrote it in our early papers (e.g., Rosenzweig & MacArthur, 1963; Rosenzweig, 1977,
Quarterly Review of Biology 52:371-380). Our arguments were quite general so in some ways this
manuscript constitutes a particular case of that general argument.
In most cases, the author has not yet found the words to explain what is going on in his models.
He does try but the explanations are simply translations of the mathematics. For example, I can
see that the second derivative of the isoclines in figure 1 depend on the relative magnitude of two
ratios: f/F and dh/b. These second derivatives are crucial; can you explain to a biologist why
they are crucial? This is a single example but there are a number of others. Basically, for each
conclusion I would try for a biological explanation. The good news is that the author does try and
does succeed in at least one place: lines 230-235.
4
In some places, the manuscript uses too many words, which makes it difficult to understand
what is going on. Perhaps the most egregious case of this is the description on page 10 and 11.
Here is my distillation of those pages:
Let there be two prey species. Let one be both the superior competitor and the preferred prey. Let
the second be preyed upon if and only if the population size of prey one declines to a certain
threshold level.
Then you go in and add the mathematical terms to translate that paragraph into something a
computer can understand.
I hadn't thought about the paradox of enrichment in a number of years and enjoyed the
opportunity to review this ms.

Dear Alice Power:
I have attached a revised manuscript, Scrounging by foragers can resolve the paradox
of enrichment (Ref: RSOS-160830). In the following, I summarised how I have revised
the manuscript in response to the comments.
====
Reviewer 1
1. Since this paper is related to the paradox of enrichment, he should mention
about many papers on this topic.
I agree with this comment, so I have cited more papers in the introduction. Please
see lines 27-38.
2. Some biological examples about scrounging should be mentioned.
I agree with this comment. I have cited many empirical examples of the
producer-scrounger behaviour in a range of taxa (please see lines 53-56). Also, I
have mentioned one particular example of producing and scrounging by Nutmeg
mannikins in the discussion. Please see lines 375-379.
3. Before examining one predator-two prey systems with optimal foraging, the
author should examine one predator-two prey systems without optimal foraging.
This model can find purely effect of scrounging in such system.
I do not agree with the reviewers argument that one-predator two-prey systems
without optimal foraging should be a better test bed for finding purely the effect of
scrounging. There are two reasons. First, it is already known that imperfection of
optimality in predators diet choice can stabilise this Genkai-Kato and Yamamura
system ([17] in the main manuscript). Additionally, simple frequency-dependent
switching of prey by predator, rather than optimal diet choice, may generally
stabilise such one-predator-two-prey systems ([18] in the main manuscript).
Therefore, eliminating optimality from this system should hide, rather than clarify,
the potential effect of scrounging on the paradox of enrichment.
Second, if the reviewer meant a one-predator-two-prey system without any diet
choice (i.e. the capture probabilities for both prey species are always one: p1 = p2 =
1), it is known that such a system has a parameter region in which the system has a
stable equilibrium point ([20] in the main manuscript). I could have analysed the
potential scrounging effect on local stability of the equilibrium point outside of that
parameter region, where the paradox of enrichment exists. However, there is no
benefit to study such a system over studying the Genkai-Kato and Yamamura
model because the Genkai-Kato and Yamamura model is universally unstable and
the paradox of enrichment always exists. Additionally, and more importantly,
studying non-equilibrium dynamics is important for understanding complex
community dynamics (as I have mentioned in lines 93-98). Because its
non-equilibrium dynamics has been well studied ([17, 45, 50, 52, and 53] in the
manuscript), Genkai-Kato and Yamamuras model is a good model for studying the
scrounging effect on the non-equilibrium paradox of enrichment.
4. In fig. 3, 4, 5, f/F=1 should be base line. Please show the results assuming f/F=1,
and then continuously change the values.
The model becomes identical to the basal model (i.e. Genkai-Kato and Yamamura
model) when f1/F1 = f2/F2 = 1, because all of the predators choose the producing
tactic under such a circumstance. In such the case, therefore, fig. 3 and fig. 5 in the
manuscript show exactly the same result to fig. 1d and fig. 2b in the original
Genkai-Kato and Yamamuras paper [45], respectively. I could have shown the
results with f/F=1 to replicate their original work. However, because my model can
already replicate almost the same pattern to the basal model when f/F is high
enough (i.e. when there are lots of producing predators), I do not think that showing
the f/F = 1cases in my figures would add any significant information.
As for fig. 4, I already show the cases in which f1/F1 = 1 and/or f2/F2 = 1 as base
lines.
5. Why f is not divided by the number of producers? Is this assumption critical to
the main result?
In the standard producer-scrounger game, there is an assumption that the two
tactics are incompatible: The individuals that search for food by themselves cannot
visit other individuals discoveries. Such an assumption might be suitable for some
animals social foraging (e.g. Nutmeg mannikins [30]), but empirical support for this
incompatibility-assumption is still largely lacking. Especially, if animals can conduct
both producing and scrounging simultaneously, the PS game may be no longer
valid and my result here may be altered. I have added some discussions on this
point. Please see lines 375-385.
Nevertheless, I believe that the standard PS game is a reasonable starting point as
this is the first study on social foraging and the paradox of enrichment. I would like
to leave this point for future studies.
6. The part of Page 10, Line 170-Page 11, Line 175 should be moved into section
3.1.1.
I have modified the text as suggested. Please see lines 219-234.
Reviewer 2
1. The mathematical models of this manuscript are straightforward. Even though
they are sometimes quite simplified, I have no problem with them because the
manuscript amounts to an existence theorem; thus it need be true only for a
single case, and the author provides two. I encourage the author to mention
this fact.
I have modified the text as suggested. Please see lines 84-99.
2. Although its English is fine, the manuscript could be written to achieve a much
greater impact. Most important are the unusual terms used. These include
scrounging; producer; divisible prey. All three of these terms are defined in the
manuscript, but in various strange places, often after having been used without
a definition. For example, we encounter the notion of divisible prey on line 45.
We are not told what that means until line 64 and we have to work very hard to
deduce what it means from line 64. Then there is the footnote at the bottom of
page 6, which defines the term producer. I strongly recommend a short glossary
of these few terms near the beginning of the paper. I also recommend that,
wherever the author needs them in the abstract, they need to be defined
therein.
I agree with this comment, so have added a short glossary section at the end of the
introduction. The position (and formatting) of the glossary may be changed at the
editorial process though. Also, because the term divisible prey is not necessary
for introducing the PS game, I have removed this word.
3. In the same spirit, I recommend a short non-technical description of the
common features of the models.
I agree with this comment. I have modified the text so that the non-technical
descriptions come before the full mathematical details. Also, I have added a new
figure that describes schematic diagrams of my (basal) models (Figure 1).
4. The author can reach many more ecologists by relating what he is doing to well
known ecological concepts. He does this already by speaking about competition.
But he can bring in Fretwell's concepts of optimal foraging, i. e., Ideal free
distribution and Ideal despotic distribution. In the absence of scrounging,
predators should distribute themselves according to ideal free rules. By adding
the scrounging, the paper divides predators into two classes, producers and
scroungers. These two do not receive an equal return for their efforts: producers
get more than scroungers. That resembles the Ideal despotic distribution in
which some forgers, the despots, get a greater return than others.
The relationship between the producer-scrounger dynamics and the ideal despotic
distribution is interesting, and may be relevant to some social-foraging situations.
For example, resource monopolizability can alter the PS game dynamics, and
result in dominant individuals get more foods than other less-dominant individuals
([61] in the main text). In that case, the ideal despotic distribution may be realised.
However, at the equilibrium of the standard PS game model, producers and
scroungers earn equally. At a food clump discovered by a producer, the producer
gets more foods than scroungers because of the finders advantage. However,
scroungers can visit the other producers discoveries, and consequently, when the
ESS is realised, both two tactics yield the same profit. Therefore, I do not think the
standard PS game model directly links to the ideal despotic distribution.
Nevertheless, I agree with the reviewers point that relating the ideal despotic
concepts to my model is worth mentioning. So I have mentioned this in the
discussion (Please see lines 386-391).
5. Another point worth mentioning is the stabilizing effect of competition. We
knew this, graphed it, and wrote it in our early papers (e.g., Rosenzweig &
MacArthur, 1963; Rosenzweig, 1977, Quarterly Review of Biology 52:371-380).
Our arguments were quite general so in some ways this manuscript constitutes
a particular case of that general argument.
I agree with this comment. I have mentioned this point in lines 324-334.
6. In most cases, the author has not yet found the words to explain what is going
on in his models. He does try but the explanations are simply translations of
the mathematics. For example, I can see that the second derivative of the
isoclines in figure 1 depend on the relative magnitude of two ratios: f/F and dh/b.
These second derivatives are crucial; can you explain to a biologist why they are
crucial? This is a single example but there are a number of others. Basically, for
each conclusion I would try for a biological explanation. The good news is that
the author does try and does succeed in at least one place: lines 230-235.
I agree with the reviewers point that biologically meaningful interpretations of the
mathematical results are very important. Therefore, I have added biological
explanations to as many results as possible. Especially, in lines 168-189, I have
explained why these two ratios  f/F and dh/b  are crucial for my one-prey model.
Also, I have added a few more biological interpretations for the two-prey model as
well (lines 292-297).
7. In some places, the manuscript uses too many words, which makes it difficult to
understand what is going on. Perhaps the most egregious case of this is the
description on page 10 and 11. Here is my distillation of those pages:
Let there be two prey species. Let one be both the superior competitor and the
preferred prey. Let the second be preyed upon if and only if the population size
of prey one declines to a certain threshold level.
Then you go in and add the mathematical terms to translate that paragraph
into something a computer can understand.
I have modified the text as suggested. Please see lines 191-206.

Dear Andrew Dunn and Kevin Padian:
I have attached a revised manuscript, entitled Scrounging by foragers can resolve the
paradox of enrichment (Ref: RSOS-160830.R1). I am pleased to learn that my
manuscript will be publishable pending minor revision. In the following, I summarised
how I have revised the manuscript in response to the comments.
====
Reviewer 2
I have modified the text as suggested. Also, in the following, I have answered the two
comments from the reviewer 2:
1. I am a little bit confused because you wrote (line 124) that prey discovery is
rare so that no more than a single prey clump is available at one time.
I assume that multiple food discovery events can happen within a single time step
of population dynamics (i.e. at time scale of population dynamics), and all
scroungers can visit all of those events occurred in that time-step. I also assume
that NO multiple food discovery events happen at exactly the same moment (i.e. at
time scale of behavioural interaction among foragers).
The latter assumption might be confusing. This assumption aims at assuring
scroungers that they can visit all food discovery events: Otherwise, if multiple food
discoveries could happen at the same moment, scroungers would split into multiple
sub-groups because there are several food clumps available. In that case,
expected food intake of scroungers (and of producers) should be affected by the
frequency of such the splitting events, which would make the PS game model
messy. To emphasise this point, I have modified the text. Please see lines 125-128
(for the one-prey system) as well as lines 246-247 (for the two-prey system).
2. Why did you focus on amplitudes instead of on minima?
I have modified the text (lines 265-269) because I actually focused on both
amplitudes and minimum densities of population oscillations as indices of the
paradox of enrichment (Figure 5). I regarded that the paradox of enrichment would
be resolved when amplitudes decrease and minimum densities increase with prey
enrichment.
It would be an interesting case if the minimum densities increase while the
population oscillations are amplified with prey enrichment. However, such a case
was not observed in my model. Therefore, I do not think it is worth discussing
further about it in this manuscript.

anonymous reviewer. I hope that the current manuscript has successfully incorporated
the points raised by the reviewers.
