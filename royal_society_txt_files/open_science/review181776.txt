Comments:
Authors tried to discuss an essential aspect of acoustophoretic devices which is of clear
importance to the acoustofluidic community. However, I am not convinced with the conclusion
that the authors made based on the reported data and discussion. It is obvious that the thickness
of acoustic devices has an impact on the efficiency of focusing and a study like this should do a
thorough investigation without limiting to one type of material as stated below. Overall, the
manuscript contains significant weaknesses, therefore, I cannot recommend publishing the
manuscript in the current format.
1) Authors used only glass as a substrate to fabricate microfluidic device but, silicon is the most
commonly used substrate in bulk acoustic wave-based devices. Glass substrates are rarely used
thus I am not convinced about the study just limiting to the glass. Silicon has better acoustic
properties than glass. It would make the manuscript convincing if authors compare the Si-devices
with different thicknesses and/or different thicknesses of top glass layer which is bonded to Si on
such devices. Silicon devices can easily be integrated with optical detection systems by having a
glass lid; thus I cannot accept the reason to use glass only devices in this study.
2) Page 4 line 48, the authors mentioned the flow rate used is 0.2 µL/min, which is a very low
flow rate in common acoustophoresis experiments. Effect of thickness is not described in higher
flow rates such as 100 µL/min. The supporting movies indicate that even at this very low flow
rate the extent of focusing is poor. Movie 2 clearly shows that particles are not focused and they
are directed into three outlets. Previous work from other groups has utilized high flow rates with
thick devices yet with very efficient focusing.
3) Authors mentioned that they have used 120 µm wide channels. Assuming the device was
operated at half wavelength mode, the resonance frequency used (3.98 MHz) does not match
with the width (assuming the speed of sound in the medium ~1500 m/s).
4) Page 5, Line 51-52: Authors reasoned that they had to use high voltage due to high frequency
(3.98 MHz). However, particles should focus at a lower voltage when the resonance frequency is
high.
5) Design and fabrication of the device are not discussed well in the manuscript.
6) Authors claim that thinner glass substrates (<0.2mm) are not useful due to the fragility under
acoustic mechanical stress. I am not sure why they still investigated devices with 12 µm thickness.
There is no use of such devices for real applications. ( e.g. Pressure drop issues and particle
clogging will be significant)
7) The extent of the focusing is calculated based on the distribution of particles inside the
microchannels, but no quantitative measurement of the samples collected from each outlet is
provided.
3
8) On page 5 line 17 authors discuss using 280 nm particles for the acoustic focusing experiment.
No matter the thickness of the device, it is well accepted fact that manipulation of submicron
particles with direct acoustophoresis is really hard. This adds up nothing to the manuscript. And
acoustic streaming effects can be significant for nanoparticles at very slow flow rates.
9) In usual acoustophoresis setup, 20 Vpp is sufficient to focus the particles >2 µm in size in a
very narrow space within the microchannel. Authors do not mention why it is not the case with
glass devices.
10) Figures 3b and 5b must have scale bars
11) The manuscript has some narration inconsistencies and typos.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors considered the effects of glass thickness on acoustic particle focusing. Although the
obtained results are limited to glass microfluidic devices, I still think the work is interesting and
may provide some guidelines for designing glass-based acoustic microfluidics. In their future
works, the authors are strongly encouraged to explore this thickness-effect in devices of other
popular materials (e.g., PDMS, SU-8). Overall, I would like to recommend its publication in Royal
Society Open Science if the authors are willing to address the following comments.
(1) I don’t know the meaning of “the thickness of a glass microfluidic device” (i.e., page 2, line
29). The authors are suggested to give a clear definition. Does it mean the distance between the
transducer and the microchannel or the thickness of the microchannel in the bulk glass?
(2) The simulation of the flow in branched microchannel is very simple and meaningless. It
would be better if the authors move it to the supporting information.
(3) The focusing performance under the optimal condition is not very good. Is it possible to
4
achieve the singe-line focusing using this acoustic focusing device?
(4) In the introduction, the authors are suggested to briefly discuss the importance of particle
focusing (e.g., for particle/cell separation (Analytical chemistry, 2018, 90(6): 4212-4220.) or
microflow cytometer (Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical, 2018, 266:26-45; Analytical chemistry,
2017, 89(5): 3154-3161.)). In addition, the other active or passive focusing schemes (e.g., inertial
microfluidic, electric, magnetic and optical methods) are suggested to be discussed. This would
make the readers better understand the meaning of studying particle focusing and why the
acoustic particle focusing is studied in this work.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
In this resubmission, authors have tried to address my main comments. Authors have mentioned
the reason for using the glass-glass device instead of the more commonly used glass-silicon
device; however, I am still not convinced by the performance of this device. Authors have failed
to demonstrate good focusing in any of the devices for 10 µm particles even at very slow flow
rates (0.2 µL/min). There is so many previous works showing excellent focusing of particles and
cells smaller than 10 µm at much higher flow rates than 0.2 µL/min. Since authors have not
investigated the most common device type (glass-silicon), to come to a conclusion and use the
finding for further studies, authors should at least first establish a working device. Authors have
mentioned the reason for using slow flow rate was due to the weak focusing of sub-micron
particles. It is not necessary to use sub micron-particles to establish the phenomenon. Acoustic
streaming can interfere with particle focusing when the particles are smaller than 1 µm, and the
flow rate is very slow. The observation in Movie 1 cannot be considered as good focusing. The
end of Movie 1 shows some non-focused particles. The movies are so short that it is difficult to be
convinced that the device is capable of good focusing. I would like to see a more extended video
clip with unfocused stream getting focused in real time. Also, the video should be collected away
from the trifurcate end so that the focusing can be easily evaluated. The figure 6B does not
correlate with what I observe in the Movie 1. In this context, I do not see the importance of Figure
7.
Authors should build a good working device first and demonstrate efficient focusing of particles
and then test their hypothesis.

In this paper, the authors developed a glass-based acoustic microfluidic device to investigate the
correlation between the degree of acoustic focusing vs. thickness of the microfluidic device.
Showing that for the same applied voltage, a higher degree of acoustic focusing of beads was
observed in thinner microfluidic devices, and the degree of focussing in a device is positively
correlated to the strength of the incoming acoustic waves, thin glass microfluidic devices were
found to enhance focussing of submicron particles. These results suggest that acoustic focusing
will also be applicable to microorganisms of a few µm in thin glass microfluidic devices.
Overall, the revised manuscript is clearly written and presented. As well, the originality and the
contributions are significant to publish the paper in this journal. The reviewer has the following
comments/ concerns:
- In the summary refer to the difference of acoustic waves propagating on glass and silicon.
- The conclusions have to be revised and reorganized to be more focused and concise. The
conclusions must not just repeat the data. Instead, it should highlight the significant of the
finding for the field as well as for general interests.

of clear importance to the acoustofluidic community. However, I am not
convinced with the conclusion that the authors made based on the reported
data and discussion. It is obvious that the thickness of acoustic devices has an
impact on the efficiency of focusing and a study like this should do a thorough
investigation without limiting to one type of material as stated below. Overall,
the manuscript contains significant weaknesses, therefore, I cannot
recommend publishing the manuscript in the current format.
Answer: We highly appreciate the reviewer’s comment and would like to answer
the reviewer’s questions.
In this study, our primary focus was investigation on the correlation between
degree of acoustic focusing and thickness of microfluidic devices. We consider that
the influence of device thickness on acoustic focusing is not always obvious
because acoustic energy can be allocated to both acoustic focusing and deformation
of the acoustofluidic device. As the device becomes thinner, the device deformation
by acoustic waves is larger. An extreme case of deformation is permanent damage
to the device. In fact, our study showed that a 0.2-mm device did not double the
degree of acoustic focusing comparing with a 0.4-mm device, and an ultrathin
(0.012-mm) glass device was permanently damaged by the acoustic waves.
In this study, we have accumulated the skills and technology to overcome
technical difficulties in producing thin glass devices that many research groups
have faced. We think this is one major reason why no systematic study has been
performed on a correlation between device thickness and degree of acoustic
focusing. Thus, we were motivated to study this perspective. Meanwhile, we did
not intend to achieve the best acoustic focusing performance or to compare the
difference in acoustic focusing among various materials.
To clearly figure out the correlation between device thickness and degree of
acoustic focusing, we desired employing a single material to fabricate
microfluidics, rather than employing two or more materials as some microfluidic
devices are composed of. Thus, we selected glass as the structural material of the
microfluidic devices because devices could be made of glass only and glass has
optical transparency and can propagate acoustic waves efficiently. Although the
obtained results were limited to the glass microfluidic device as the reviewer
mentioned, publishing the current work will provide a useful guideline for
designing acoustophoretic devices by providing the influence of device thickness
on degree of acoustic focusing.
1) Authors used only glass as a substrate to fabricate microfluidic
device but, silicon is the most commonly used substrate in bulk acoustic
wave-based devices. Glass substrates are rarely used thus I am not convinced
about the study just limiting to the glass. Silicon has better acoustic properties
than glass. It would make the manuscript convincing if authors compare the
Si-devices with different thicknesses and/or different thicknesses of top glass
layer which is bonded to Si on such devices. Silicon devices can easily be
integrated with optical detection systems by having a glass lid; thus I cannot
accept the reason to use glass only devices in this study.
Answer: Thank you for the comment. As the reviewer suggested, silicon is much
more frequently employed in acoustofluidics because of its excellent acoustic
properties. To find the difference between silicon and glass in propagation of
acoustic waves, we conducted additional experiments in which propagated acoustic
waves showed 10% higher amplitude on average on silicon than glass. We would
like to discuss this result in page 4, lines 35-48 (4.3, 2nd paragraph) and page 5,
lines 17-23 (5.1, 1st paragraph).
On the other hand, our primary purpose was to investigate the correlation
between the degree of acoustic focusing vs. thickness of the microfluidic device.
For such a purpose, it is desirable to use devices composed of a single material to
conduct a clear investigation on how the device thickness influences the degree of
acoustic focusing. Thus, we have selected glass as the substrate for the device
because it does not require an intermediate or adhesive layer to make a microfluidic
device, and it has properties of its optical transparency and ability to conduct
acoustic waves efficiently. Although silicon is a great material for propagation of
acoustic waves, silicon-based microfluidic devices require two materials, silicon
and glass, to perform optical observation. If a silicon-glass device is used, the ratio
of silicon and glass affects the correlation between the degree of acoustic focusing
and device thickness. To avoid this complexity and by considering that the acoustic
properties of glass and silicon were not too much different (no more than 10%
difference in vibrational amplitude by acoustic waves), we used devices composed
of glass only. As Reviewer 2 admitted, even in this limited condition, this
investigation will provide some guidelines for designing glass-based acoustic
microfluidics. This discussion on why we decided to work only with glass
microfluidic devices is on page 2, lines 24-26 (2. Introduction, 6th paragraph):
Before (Page 4)
(None)
After (Page 4)
To investigate the difference in propagation of acoustic surface waves on glass and
silicon, micro-vibrational amplitude of glass induced by acoustic waves was
measured based on laser reflection. Both glass and silicon plates had thickness of
0.5 mm. As shown in Fig.S1A, a He-Ne laser (632.8 nm, S145197, Lumentum,
Milpitas, CA, USA) emitting a beam diameter of less than 1 mm was irradiated
onto a specific point on the substrate. Four points at 15-mm intervals were
investigated along the line of the attached piezoelectric transducer. The
piezoelectric transducer was glued in place with cyanoacrylate glue and was
connected to a function generator for actuation and a home-made power amplifier.
The actuation frequency was 3.46 MHz by applying 20 V on the piezoelectric
transducer to observe the largest amplitude for both glass and silicon. The reflected
beam was collected by a segmented photodiode (SPOT 2D 1647-1, OSI
Optoelectronics, Hawthorne, CA, USA). Fluctuation of the beam induced by
micro-vibrations was changed to an electronic signal and amplified by an
instrumentation (BB-INA103, Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX, US). The principle of
this measurement system resembles that of an atomic force microscope, which is a
highly accurate device to measure surface height in a non-contact manner. The
difference of collected signals was directly proportional to the difference of the
vibrational amplitudes.
Before (Page 5)
(None.)
After (Page 5)
Compared with silicon, a frequently employed material for acoustofluidic devices,
glass plate showed 10% smaller amplitude of propagated acoustic waves on
average (Fig. S1). Given that the density of silicon is 2.33 g/cm3 and the density of
borosilicate glass is 2.23 g/cm3, the difference in the mass of the examined silicon
and glass plates was 4.3%. According to equation 1 with these values, energy of
the acoustic waves propagating on glass was 22% less than that on silicon. In other
words, the 22% energy difference induced by the difference in device thickness
corresponded to the material difference of glass and silicon. Therefore, this
difference was small compared with the range of glass device thicknesses in this
study.
Before (Page 2)
We have selected to use glass for our microfluidics because of its excellent optical
transparency beside its efficient propagation of acoustic wave although there are
some other materials such as SU-8 to construct a highly sophisticated
acoustofluidic device[18].
After (Page 2)
We have selected to use glass to use for our microfluidic devices because of its
excellent optical transparency beside and its efficient propagation of acoustic
waves although there are some other materials such as silicon and SU-8 that have
been used to construct sophisticated acoustofluidic devices with good propagation
of acoustic waves [25,26].
2) Page 4 line 48, the authors mentioned the flow rate used is 0.2
µL/min, which is a very low flow rate in common acoustophoresis experiments.
Effect of thickness is not described in higher flow rates such as 100 µL/min.
The supporting movies indicate that even at this very low flow rate the extent
of focusing is poor. Movie 2 clearly shows that particles are not focused and
they are directed into three outlets. Previous work from other groups has
utilized high flow rates with thick devices yet with very efficient focusing.
Answer: Thank you for the comment. As the reviewer mentioned, the flow rate
used in this study was slow although it was sufficient for investigating our primary
interest, correlation between degree of acoustic focusing vs. thickness of
microfluidic device. In addition, if the flow was as fast as 100 µL/min, our
detection system would have faced a difficulty in detecting small particles,
especially submicron beads. Thus, the low flow rate was beneficial for our study to
evaluate the degree of acoustic focusing of small particles correctly.
In Movie 2, as the reviewer commented, we agree that particles are not
focused well because we used a thick microfluidic device (1.8-mm thick) to
compare with the results of focusing in a thin device (0.4-mm thick). We expected
to have a much lower degree of acoustic focusing in a thick device and the results
of thin (Movie 1) and thick (Movie 2) devices matched the expectation. We had an
insufficient explanation and would like to modify it on Page 7, lines 25-29 (Section
5.3, 3rd paragraph) as following:
Before
The introduced beads were focused by acoustic radiation through a straight
microchannel and collected through the middle channel (Fig. 6c and Movie 1 and 2
of ESM). A portion of the liquid that suspended fluorescent beads flowed into
detours as waste. Thus, particles were concentrated by flowing through this
microfluidic device when they flowed into the middle channel for collection.
After
The introduced beads were focused by acoustic radiation through a straight
microchannel and collected through the middle channel in the 0.4-mm device
(Movie 1) while acoustic focusing was not strong in the 1.8-mm device (Movie 2).
A portion of the liquid that suspended fluorescent beads flowed into the detours as
waste. Thus, particles were concentrated by flowing through this microfluidic
device when they flowed into the middle channel for collection (Fig. 6a).
3) Authors mentioned that they have used 120 µm wide channels.
Assuming the device was operated at half wavelength mode, the resonance
frequency used (3.98 MHz) does not match with the width (assuming the speed
of sound in the medium ~1500 m/s).
Answer: Thank you for mentioning this. We had also expected that 3.98 MHz
would match well to the channel of approximately 188-µm width for acoustic
focusing. However, we did not obtain the results as we expected; inertial force
possibly affected acoustic focusing[40]. We empirically found that the channel
width of 120 µm worked well for our system. To clarify this, we added the
following sentence in page 5, lines 24-26 (5.1, 2nd paragraph):
Before
Fluorescent beads of 2-µm diameter were introduced into a straight microchannel
of 120-µm width and 35-µm depth at a flow rate of 0.2 µL/min to investigate the
correlation between acoustic focusing and the thickness of glass microfluidic
devices.
After
Fluorescent beads of 2-µm diameter were introduced into a straight microchannel
of 120-µm width and 35-µm depth at a flow rate of 0.2 µL/min to investigate the
correlation between acoustic focusing and the thickness of glass microfluidic
devices. The channel width was empirically adjusted to 120 µm to avoid any
disturbance, possibly due to inertial force, on acoustic focusing of particles[40].

4) Page 5, Line 51-52: Authors reasoned that they had to use high
voltage due to high frequency (3.98 MHz). However, particles should focus at a
lower voltage when the resonance frequency is high.
Answer: We appreciate the reviewer for pointing this out. As commented, acoustic
radiation force increases as the frequency of acoustic waves is larger. In the
manuscript, we tried to state that higher voltage was needed for focusing particles
in the combination of higher frequency and narrower channel (vs. the values in
reference [21]). Also, the device materials were different in [21] which used silicon
and glass. However, our description was confusing and we would like to modify
this on page 6, lines 36-38 (5.2 2nd paragraph) as following:
Before
While the present study applies higher voltage to a transducer (20 V vs. 11 V), this
difference was caused by different frequencies of acoustic waves (3.98 MHz vs.
3.24 MHz) to induce effective acoustic focusing on the microchannels with the
different width (120 µm vs. 230 µm).
After
While the present study applies higher voltage to a transducer (20 V vs. 11 V) with
different frequencies of acoustic waves (3.98 MHz vs. 3.24 MHz), this difference
could be caused by differences in the width (120 µm vs. 230 µm) and device
material (glass vs. glass and silicon) to induce effective acoustic focusing.
5) Design and fabrication of the device are not discussed well in the
manuscript.
Answer: Thank you for the comment. We modified section 4.2 (page 4, lines
10-24) to discuss design and fabrication of the device more:
Before
The glass microfluidic device was fabricated by the previously described
method[32] with slight modifications. In short, the glass plates were cleaned by
H2SO4/H2O2 solution for 15 minutes to subsequently deposit Cr and Au layers on
the glass surface by sputtering (EIS-220, Elionix, Tokyo, Japan). Photoresist
(OFPR) was spin-coated on the metal layers and exposed to UV light for 14.5 s to
develop the microchannel pattern. Through Cr, Au, and glass etching, the
microchannel was patterned onto the glass surface. The etched glass plate and a
glass plate with inlet and outlet ports were treated by H2SO4/H2O2 solution to
activate the glass surface. These activated glass plates were firstly bonded manually.
For permanent bonding of the glass, a weight of 1.2 kg was placed on top of them
and the complex was exposed to a temperature of 620°C for 0.7-mm glass or
500°C for thinner glass. Then, the glass microfluidic device was cut to the
dimensions of 70 x 15 (H x W) mm making it more sensitive to propagated
acoustic wave.
After
The glass microfluidic device was fabricated by the previously described
method[32] with slight modifications. In short, the glass plates were cleaned by
H2SO4/H2O2 solution for 15 minutes to subsequently deposit Cr and Au layers on
the glass surface by sputtering (EIS-220, Elionix, Tokyo, Japan). Photoresist
(OFPR) was spin-coated on the metal layers and exposed to UV light for 14.5 s to
develop the microchannel pattern. The pattern on the photomask had either a
straight microchannel of 6-mm length and 50-µm width for acoustic focusing
experiments or a channel of 5-mm length and 50-µm width that branched into a
middle channel of 0.5-mm length and 1-µm width and two detours of 1.1-mm
length and 140-µm width for the enrichment of fluorescent particles experiments.
Through Cr, Au, and glass etching by corresponding etchant, the microchannel of
35-µm depth was patterned onto the glass surface. The etched glass plate and a
glass plate that had inlet and outlet ports made by a diamond-coated drill of
0.8-mm diameter (DCSSSD0080, Mitsubishi Materials, Tokyo, Japan) were treated
with H2SO4/H2O2 solution to activate the glass surface. These activated glass plates
were firstly bonded manually. For permanent bonding of the glass, a weight of 1.2
kg was placed on top of them and the complex was exposed to a temperature of
620°C for 0.7-mm glass or 500°C for thinner glass. Then, the glass microfluidic
device was cut to the dimensions of 70 x 15 (H x W) mm making it more sensitive
to propagated acoustic waves.
6) Authors claim that thinner glass substrates (<0.2mm) are not useful
due to the fragility under acoustic mechanical stress. I am not sure why they
still investigated devices with 12 µm thickness. There is no use of such devices
for real applications. ( e.g. Pressure drop issues and particle clogging will be
significant)
Answer: Related to comment 1), our primary focus was investigation about the
degree of acoustic focusing vs. thickness of a microfluidic device. We considered
that data of acoustic focusing in an ultrathin device were useful to study more
comprehensively if it could be obtained. To state this clearly, we modified the
sentence in page 5, lines 48-49 (5.1, 4th paragraph):
Before
In further experiments, we investigated ultrathin glass microfluidic devices of
0.012-mm thickness to check whether an ultrathin device was feasible for acoustic
focusing.
After
In further acoustic focusing experiments, we investigated ultrathin glass
microfluidic devices of 0.012-mm thickness to check whether it was feasible to use
an ultrathin device was feasible to find the degree of acoustic focusing in a device
with extreme thickness.
7) The extent of the focusing is calculated based on the distribution of
particles inside the microchannels, but no quantitative measurement of the
samples collected from each outlet is provided.
Answer: Thank you for the comment and we would like to explain clearly why we
chose counting beads inside of the microchannels. The main purpose of sample
enrichment in this study was to demonstrate how thickness of the device affects
collection of particles via acoustic focusing. Therefore, we decided to count the
distribution of particles inside the microchannels, rather than in the collected
suspension from each outlet, because the effect of device thickness on acoustic
focusing could be investigated more directly by excluding the influence of different
dimensions of the middle (collecting) channel and the detour. To explain this, we
would like to modify page 7, lines 20-23 (5.3, 3rd paragraph) as the following:
Before
For enrichment of fluorescent polystyrene beads, a piezoelectric transducer was
attached to the glass microfluidic channel alongside the straight microchannel.
Fluorescent beads were introduced to the microchannel at a flow rate of 0.5 µL/min
for beads of 2 or 6-µm diameter or 1 µL/min for beads of 10-µm diameter.
After
For enrichment of fluorescent polystyrene beads, a piezoelectric transducer was
attached to the glass microfluidic channel alongside the straight microchannel.
Fluorescent beads were introduced into the microchannel at a flow rate of 0.5
µL/min for beads of 2- or 6-µm diameter or 1 µL/min for beads of 10-µm diameter.
The beads were counted where the microchannel branched to the middle channel
and the detours to find the effect of device thickness on particle enrichment before
being affected by different dimensions of the middle channel and the detour.
8) On page 5 line 17 authors discuss using 280 nm particles for the
acoustic focusing experiment. No matter the thickness of the device, it is well
accepted fact that manipulation of submicron particles with direct
acoustophoresis is really hard. This adds up nothing to the manuscript. And
acoustic streaming effects can be significant for nanoparticles at very slow
flow rates.
Answer: Thank you for the valuable comment. As the reviewer commented,
280-nm particles are difficult to manipulate while, related to our answers in 1) and
6), this experiment was planned to investigate degree of acoustic focusing in an
ultrathin device as a part of systematic study. Although the device was found not to
tolerate actuation of the piezoelectric transducer before we could observe the
behavior of particles, we hoped to see any results of focusing (focusing via acoustic
radiation force, focusing by acoustic streaming effect or no apparent focusing) in
the 0.012-mm device to discuss the influence of device thickness on focusing.
9) In usual acoustophoresis setup, 20 Vpp is sufficient to focus the
particles >2 µm in size in a very narrow space within the microchannel.
Authors do not mention why it is not the case with glass devices.
Answer: When particles with diameter of more than 2 µm were not focused well
by applying 20 V to the piezoelectric transducer in this study, we considered that
thickness of glass microfluidics affected the degree of focusing. Since our primary
purpose was investigating the degree of acoustic focusing vs. thickness of devices,
the influence of material was a different parameter to investigate and beyond the
scope of this study. Because of this comment, we modified the following sentence
in page 8, lines 25-26 (6. Conclusion, 3rd paragraph):
Before
As theoretically expected, the focusing capability is therefore strongly dependent
on the thickness of the device.
After
Although a future investigation is desired to study correlations between acoustic
focusing and thickness of microfluidic devices composed of materials other than
glass, the acoustic focusing capability is strongly dependent on the thickness of the
microfluidic devices composed of glass as theoretically expected.
10) Figures 3b and 5b must have scale bars
Answer: Thank you for the comment. Assuming that the comment mentioned 3b
and 5a to add scale bars, we added scale bars in the corresponding figures and
explained this in figure captions.
11) The manuscript has some narration inconsistencies and typos.
Answer: Thank you for carefully reading our manuscript. We have checked
through the entire manuscript and have corrected English errors as much as
possible.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors considered the effects of glass thickness on acoustic particle
focusing. Although the obtained results are limited to glass microfluidic
devices, I still think the work is interesting and may provide some guidelines
for designing glass-based acoustic microfluidics. In their future works, the
authors are strongly encouraged to explore this thickness-effect in devices of
other popular materials (e.g., PDMS, SU-8). Overall, I would like to
recommend its publication in Royal Society Open Science if the authors are
willing to address the following comments.
Answer: We appreciate the reviewer’s comment on this study and the suggestion
for possible future work. The following are our answers to the reviewer’s
questions.
(1) I don’t know the meaning of “the thickness of a glass microfluidic device”
(i.e., page 2, line 29). The authors are suggested to give a clear definition. Does
it mean the distance between the transducer and the microchannel or the
thickness of the microchannel in the bulk glass?
Answer: We recognize the need to clarify the definition. We meant the thickness of
a microfluidic device as total thickness of upper, intermediate (if it is included),
and lower plates that compose a microfluidic device. In this study, it was the sum
of the thicknesses of the upper glass plate (the plate with inlet and outlet holes) and
lower glass plate (the plate with etched microchannels). In other words, it was the
distance between the top plane of the upper glass plate and the bottom plane of the
lower glass plate. To clarify this point, we added the definition in page 2, lines
14-16 (2. Introduction, 4th paragraph) as the following:
Before
For example, decreasing the thickness of a microfluidic device without changing
the microchannel design itself readily increases the amplitude of acoustic waves
and avoids the generation of additional heat otherwise caused by increasing the
electric input into a piezoelectric transducer.
After
For example, decreasing the thickness (i.e. the distance between the top plane of
the upper layer and the bottom plane of the lower layer) of a microfluidic device
without changing the microchannel design itself readily increases the amplitude of
acoustic waves and avoids the generation of additional heat otherwise caused by
increasing the electric input into a piezoelectric transducer.
(2) The simulation of the flow in branched microchannel is very simple and
meaningless. It would be better if the authors move it to the supporting
information.
Answer: Thank you for the suggestion. We moved Figs. 6a and 6b with their
corresponding caption into the supporting information. Thus, the following changes
were made:
Before Figs. 6a and 6b -> After Figs. S4a and S4b.
Before Figs. 6c and 6d -> After Figs. 6a and 6b.
Before Fig. S3 -> After Fig. S5.
(3) The focusing performance under the optimal condition is not very good. Is
it possible to achieve the singe-line focusing using this acoustic focusing
device?
Answer: Thank you for the comment. With our setup, 10-µm beads in 0.4-mm
device showed focusing close to, but not completely, single-line focusing (Fig. 5b).
To achieve single-line focusing, we assume either applying larger amplitude of
acoustic waves or employing larger diameter of particles is required. Therefore, we
added the following sentence in page 6, lines 27-29 (5.2, 2nd paragraph):
Before
In general, fluorescent beads of larger diameter were focused narrowly in glass
microfluidic devices of 0.4 and 2.1-mm thickness, although the beads of each
diameter appeared to be less dispersed in a 0.4-mm device as compared to a
2.1-mm device.
After
In general, fluorescent beads of larger diameter were focused narrowly in glass
microfluidic devices of 0.4- and 2.1-mm thickness, although the beads of each
diameter appeared to be less dispersed in a 0.4-mm device as compared to a
2.1-mm device. The strongest acoustic focusing was observed for 10-µm beads in
the 0.4-mm device while amplitude of acoustic waves or diameter of beads needed
to be larger to attain single-line focusing.
(4) In the introduction, the authors are suggested to briefly discuss the
importance of particle focusing (e.g., for particle/cell separation (Analytical
chemistry, 2018, 90(6): 4212-4220.) or microflow cytometer (Sensors and
Actuators B: Chemical, 2018, 266:26-45; Analytical chemistry, 2017, 89(5):
3154-3161.)). In addition, the other active or passive focusing schemes (e.g.,
inertial microfluidic, electric, magnetic and optical methods) are suggested to
be discussed. This would make the readers better understand the meaning of
studying particle focusing and why the acoustic particle focusing is studied in
this work.
Answer: We apricate the suggestion and modified page 1 (2. Introduction, 1st
paragraph) like the following with adding the suggested literatures:
Before
Acoustic focusing has gained attention as a non-contact method for manipulating
micro/nanoparticles found in biological[1,2] and industrial[3,4] fields. This
focusing technique has been applied to sorting[5–7], enrichment[8,9], and
analysis[10,11] of particles. For example, acoustic focusing is employed in flow
cytometry[12,13], where focused particles need to be precisely aligned in a
microchannel to obtain high-quality images in continuous flow.
After
Acoustic focusing has gained attention as a non-contact method for manipulating
micro/nanoparticles found in biological[1,2] and industrial[3,4] fields. Particle
focusing, including acoustic focusing, has been widely studied by utilizing inertial
force[5] as well as electric[6], magnetic[7] and optical[8] methods. These focusing
techniques are highly compatible with quickly advancing technology of
miniaturized instruments e.g. microflow cytometry[9,10] that are suitable for
manipulating small particles like cells[11]. This Acoustic focusing, as a particle
focusing technique, has also been applied to sorting[12–14], enrichment[15,16],
and analysis[17,18] of particles. For example, acoustic focusing is employed in
flow cytometry[19,20], where focused particles need to be precisely aligned in a
microchannel to obtain high-quality images in continuous flow.

Answers to the Reviewers’ Comments
Associate Editor (Dr Chong Li) Comments to Author:
Thank you for re-submitting the manuscript after significant efforts on
addressing the comments from previous reviewers. However there are still
minor concerns with the paper. Please take into account Reviewer 2's comments
on focusing capability of the devices and Reviewer 3's comments on
"Conclusions" when revising the manuscript.
Answer: We deeply appreciate all comments given by the editor and reviewers.
Below we have highlighted the given comments in bold, made our comments as
“Answer”, and wrote our modifications on our revised manuscript in red with the
previous description (denoted as “Before”) and revised description (denoted as
“After”) to respond to the given comments/questions/suggestions. In the revised
manuscript, we modified Results and discussion (sections 5.3 and 5.4) and
Conclusion (section 6) with respect to the Reviewer’s comments.
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Authors:
In this resubmission, authors have tried to address my main comments. Authors
have mentioned the reason for using the glass-glass device instead of the more
commonly used glass-silicon device; however, I am still not convinced by the
performance of this device. Authors have failed to demonstrate good focusing
in any of the devices for 10 µm particles even at very slow flow rates (0.2
µL/min). There is so many previous works showing excellent focusing of
particles and cells smaller than 10 µm at much higher flow rates than 0.2
µL/min. Since authors have not investigated the most common device type
(glass-silicon), to come to a conclusion and use the finding for further studies,
authors should at least first establish a working device. Authors have mentioned
the reason for using slow flow rate was due to the weak focusing of sub-micron
particles. It is not necessary to use sub micron-particles to establish the
phenomenon. Acoustic streaming can interfere with particle focusing when the
particles are smaller than 1 µm, and the flow rate is very slow. The
observation in Movie 1 cannot be considered as good focusing. The end of Movie
1 shows some non-focused particles. The movies are so short that it is difficult
to be convinced that the device is capable of good focusing. I would like to see a
more extended video clip with unfocused stream getting focused in real time.
Also, the video should be collected away from the trifurcate end so that the
focusing can be easily evaluated. The figure 6B does not correlate with what I
observe in the Movie 1. In this context, I do not see the importance of Figure 7.
Authors should build a good working device first and demonstrate efficient
focusing of particles and then test their hypothesis.
Answer: We appreciate and would like to answer the reviewer’s comments.
This study has focused on investigating the correlation between degree of
acoustic focusing and thickness of microfluidic devices while we understand that
previous studies have reported excellent focusing of small particles as the reviewer
mentioned. Although we did not investigate acoustic focusing of glass-silicon
devices due to absence of glass-silicon bonding equipment in our lab, we compared
propagation of acoustic waves on glass and silicon to indicate the potential of glass-
silicon devices (section 4.3 and 5.1). Improved acoustic focusing could be
accomplished if an amplifier generating higher voltage was available to obtain
stronger acoustic waves (Fig. 3) although we do not have this amplifier. Thus, we
paid more attention on the varied degree of acoustic focusing in different thickness
of the devices rather than the best focusing ability of the devices or the difference of
device-composing materials. As the reviewer pointed out, collection of 10-µm beads
was not 100% in Movie 1; Fig. 6B, including the result of Movie 1, showed that 10-
µm beads were collected at 96.0% on average. Fig. 7 served to state acoustic focusing
of microorganisms with confirming previous studies of cellular viability. Since we
recognize our focusing results were not optimal (also stated in section 5.2, 2nd
paragraph), we would like to modify sections 5.3 and 5.4 based on considering the
reviewer’s comments:
Section 5.3, 2nd paragraph (page 7)
Before
For enrichment of fluorescent polystyrene beads, a piezoelectric transducer
was attached to the glass microfluidic channel alongside the straight microchannel.
Fluorescent beads were introduced into the microchannel at a flow rate of 0.5 µL/min
for beads of 2- or 6-µm diameter or 1 µL/min for beads of 10-µm diameter. The beads
were counted where the microchannel branched to the middle channel and the
detours to find the effect of device thickness on particle enrichment before being
affected by different dimensions of the middle channel and the detour. The
introduced beads were focused by acoustic radiation through a straight microchannel
and collected through the middle channel in the 0.4-mm device (Movie 1) while
acoustic focusing was not strong in the 1.8-mm device (Movie 2). A portion of the
liquid that suspended fluorescent beads flowed into the detours as waste. Thus,
particles were concentrated by flowing through this microfluidic device when they
flowed into the middle channel for collection (Fig. 6a).

For enrichment of fluorescent polystyrene beads, a piezoelectric transducer
was attached to the glass microfluidic channel alongside the straight microchannel.
Fluorescent beads were introduced into the microchannel at a flow rate of 0.5 µL/min
for beads of 2- or 6-µm diameter or 1 µL/min for beads of 10-µm diameter. The beads
were counted where the microchannel branched to the middle channel and the
detours to find the effect of device thickness on particle enrichment before being
affected by different dimensions of the middle channel and the detour. The
introduced beads were focused by acoustic radiation through a straight microchannel
and collected through the middle channel in the 0.4-mm device (Movie 1). Even
though it was not optimal focusing to attain collection of all beads in the 0.4-mm
device, while acoustic focusing was much stronger in the 0.4-mm device than not
strong in the 1.8-mm device (Movie 2). A portion of the liquid that suspended
fluorescent beads flowed into the detours as waste. Thus, particles were concentrated
by flowing through this microfluidic device when they flowed into the middle
channel for collection (Fig. 6a).

These results suggest that acoustic focusing will also be applicable to
microorganisms of a few µm in thin glass microfluidic devices, even though this field
still requires further scientific development. As current technologies employ acoustic
focusing for enhancing screening and analysis of microorganisms in flow systems
such as flow cytometry, thin glass microfluidic devices offer new possibilities to
further enhance the efficiency of acoustic-focusing systems.

Comments to the Authors:
In this paper, the authors developed a glass-based acoustic microfluidic device
to investigate the correlation between the degree of acoustic focusing vs.
thickness of the microfluidic device. Showing that for the same applied voltage,
a higher degree of acoustic focusing of beads was observed in thinner
microfluidic devices, and the degree of focussing in a device is positively
correlated to the strength of the incoming acoustic waves, thin glass microfluidic
devices were found to enhance focussing of submicron particles. These results
suggest that acoustic focusing will also be applicable to microorganisms of a few
µm in thin glass microfluidic devices.
Overall, the revised manuscript is clearly written and presented. As well, the
originality and the contributions are significant to publish the paper in this
journal. The reviewer has the following comments/ concerns:
- In the summary refer to the difference of acoustic waves propagating on
glass and silicon.
- The conclusions have to be revised and reorganized to be more focused and
concise. The conclusions must not just repeat the data. Instead, it should
highlight the significant of the finding for the field as well as for general interests.
Answer: We highly appreciate the reviewer’s comment. We would like to modify
the Conclusion based on the comments.

In this study, we used glass acoustofluidic devices to investigate how acoustic
focusing of flowing particles was influenced by the thickness of the employed glass
microfluidic devices. We show that the thickness of glass microfluidic devices has a
strong influence on the focusing of small particles by acoustic radiation. Furthermore,
we show that thin glass microfluidic devices are able to focus submicron particles in
a straight path via acoustic radiation. We also demonstrated that acoustic focusing
was applicable to concentrating particles by removal of excess liquid, and to acoustic
focusing of E. coli of one to a few µm in size.
Using thin glass microfluidic devices, it is possible to adopt more diverse layouts of
microchannels that may not be advantageous in terms of the energy of acoustic
waves but are desirable in special cases e.g. when using shallow microchannels for
observation of particles in fast flow. Another application that thin glass microfluidic
devices can contribute to is the isolation and analysis of rare cells and organelles via
acoustic focusing. Because this application requires manipulation of small particles
and concentration of particles to trap them in small volumes, employing a
combination of acoustic focusing and thin glass microfluidic devices is an obvious
method to achieve this. Separating mixed particles with diverse sizes is another
possible application. Particles of different sizes can be sorted based on their size-
dependent dispersion properties in acoustic focusing.
Overall, we showed that thin glass microfluidic devices significantly enhance
acoustic focusing of particles, including focusing of submicron particles by acoustic
radiation force, due to their highly efficient energy propagation of acoustic waves to
target particles. Although a future investigation is desired to study correlations
between acoustic focusing and thickness of microfluidic devices composed of
materials other than glass, the acoustic focusing capability is strongly dependent on
the thickness of the microfluidic devices composed of glass as theoretically expected.
Engineering the device thickness as a method to enhance acoustic focusing does not
require a change of equipment or microchannel dimensions, effectively eliminating
the two major practical difficulties that hamper high acoustic focusing efficiencies
in current setups. Finally, we expect thin glass microfluidic devices to become an
essential component in future microfluidic systems that require optimized acoustic
focusing.
