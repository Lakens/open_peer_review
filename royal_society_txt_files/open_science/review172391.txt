Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
In a number of experiments, Agee & Monfils investigated the reliance of observer rats on
maladaptive social information provided by a fellow demonstrator rat, here the preference for
food that resulted in sickness of the conforming observer. Using adapted versions of the socially
transmitted food preference (STFP) paradigm, the authors tested whether observer rats show
decreased reliance on demonstrator rats that had presented cues of the ´poisoned´ food and
would rather develop a STFP from demonstrator rats that provided cues of food that did not
cause illness.
Overall, the structure and methodological planning of the experiments is thought through and
the manuscript is excellently written.
The following minor points should be added or clarified in the manuscript for further
improvement:
1. In the experiments, you used differend flavors (cinnamon, cocoa, anis and majoram). Have you
ever tested if these flavors differ in general palatability and if they do, does this matter in your
experiments?
2. Why weren´t the observer rats food deprived? Would food deprivation alter their choice
behavior (negatively)?
3. The duration of the choice period, where observer rats are exposed to two flavors of food, is
sometimes 1h and sometimes 18h long (for ex. in experiment 2). Can you explain this difference
in duration?
4. Exposing rats to food for 18h can be quite long. Please add how much food you presented to
the observer rats. Did it occur that rats finished a full bowl of food during the choice period,
resulting in a ceiling effect?
5. The data you show are the total grams eaten of a certain food; however, this type of data
doesn´t correct for the overall amount of food eaten during a session. For example, a rat that is
hungry might eat more of the demonstrated food, but also more of the undemonstrated food,
whereas a rat that is satiated doesn´t eat much in general (thus also less of the demonstrated
food). How could you make sure that the observer rats always consumed roughly the same
amount of food, e.g. exclude hunger as a confounding variable?
6. In Fig. 1, you show percentages of the data, whereas your analysis is based on the raw values
(see my previous point). The significant difference graphically shown in Fig. 1 was derived from
the raw data and not from analyzing the percentages. Please be constant and show the raw data
that was analyzed.
7. Page 4, line 16. “Sal/LiCl” and “LiCl/Sal” are mentioned here for the first time and these
abbreviations can be confusing. Shortly introducing the abbreviations might help the reader
understand the protocol. Once explained, the abbreviations are very good!
8. Experiment 3 is a good control experiment, but the sample size is very small (n=3 per
condition), which is a pity. Please put some extra caution on interpreting these data.
9. p. 7, line 49-51. A study from 1990 (Galef) cannot “replicate” findings from 1997 (Kuan and
Colwill). Please rephrase the sentence.
10. p. 8, line 8. “information does not influence …”
11. In the conclusion it is stated that the current findings contradict previous research, which
showed that observers are insensitive to characteristics of the demonstrator. Do the authors
consider ´time´ as a demonstrator characteristic (since observers tended to rely on the most recent
3
demonstrator)? I think, the term “characteristic” is not ideal, since the timing of demonstrator-
observer interaction is unrelated to specific details of the demonstrator. Please rephrase the
sentence accordingly.

REVIEW OF Effect of Demonstrator Reliability and Recency of Last Demonstration on
Acquisition of a Socially Transmitted Food Preference
by Agee & Monfils
The authors present exciting new data using the socially transmitted food preference test (STFP).
The authors find that rats readily acquire food preferences as reported before. When asking
whether such transfer would rely on the 'reliability' of a demonstrator (i.e. does illness
accompany this demonstration or not), as a characteristic of the demonstrator, they surprisingly
find no effect of reliability, but an effect of demonstration recency, with only the most recent
demonstrator being effective in transmitting a novel preference, even if this demonstrator was
previously demonstrating the flavor coupled with disease. The approach is innovative and the
results are promosing. The MS is not edited very well and lacks statistical rigor.
MAJOR POINTS:
- I feel experiment 3 is underpowered in its 2x2 between subjects design. If you agree, please run
a duplicate with reversed flavour identities as recommended below. In any case, power analyses
of the (null-)effects are warranted; some of the groups are very small (N=6 for the saline/saline
experiment; N=3 per cell in exp 3).
Exp1 - Fig.1
The authors state that: "Due to violation of assumptions, all statistical tests used the total amount
eaten in grams rather than the percent of total eaten as the dependent variable". It is unclear what
4
is meant here. If the assumption of normality for running parametric tests is violated, why not
resort to non-parametric tests? Also, does this change in statistical analysis approach pertain to
just exp. 1 or all subsequent experiments? Please clarify. In addition, Fig.1 Panel seems to still
display the %of total eaten as a metric, rather than the actual data used for the statistical test, thus
presenting false information. Please harmonise the approaches. Using a non-normalized
approach will work against detecting between-group differences, so the reported null-effects of
interaction time and flavour should be examined pairwise non-parametrically as well using the
normalized measure.
Exp2 - the authors assume that the simultaneous interaction of the observer with D1 & D2 would
result in SFTP for both the foods 3 &4 AND that this preference might be influenced by previous
reliability. Can the authors provide evidence that simultaneous exposure to two demonstrators
results in SFTP for both new flavors?
p.5 line 7: the use of order is confusing, because it could both mean "time of interaction
(first/last)" (which is implied) or the order of demonstration (with respect to the Li outcome). I
would suggest to use "time of demonstration" as descriptive for the within-subject variable, and
frame the result as a "demonstration recency" effect for clarity.
The independent samples t-test comparing the data of D2-associated consumption surprisingly
uses again the %food eaten. Please also provide descriptives and analysis of the total grams eaten
as used throughout the experiment.
please formulate the "a priori predictions formed after our detection of the demonstrator order in
our
LiCl receiving observers. Furthermore" mentioned in line 14-15 of page 5
Exp3 confounds the identity of the demonstrated food with the other effects. I would recommend
adding a doubling of the design using the Cocoa chow as the demonstrated food, also the power
the design above the N=3 per cell it has now. Please make the hypotheses for the groups based on
the results from Exp 2 explicit in the introduction to Exp. 3
Fig.5 the D2 demonstration should read "Cocoa", not "Anise". Also, the labels for
unreliable/reliable demonstrator seem to be mixed up
panel b) the four-group design could be clarified by drawing for example cross-hatching in the
D1 color based on reliability.
Fig. 6
-panel A: do the error bars represent SEM? if so, do all groups show the STFP effect, i.e. difference
from 50%? With N=3 animals this is hard to ascertain, calling possibly for a duplication of Exp. 3
(see above)
-panel B"Preference of observers for the first demonstrated flavour over a novel flavour based" ->
panel B does not show a preference score for the first, but the second demonstrated food. Perhaps
rephrase as "%eaten", rather than "preference". What do the signifcance stars indicate here?
If I understood the experiment correctly, the animals labeled "unreliable" in panel A are the same
as "LiCL" in panel B; and the animals labeled as "reliable" should be the "saline" animals? If so,
why are the group means different? It seems the 'reliable' animals end up around 65%, while the
'saline' animals hover around 50%
p.6 results
The results mentioned for the SFTP and CTA test refer to Fig. 4, which is from a different
experiment. I could not find the data for the CTA anise vs. marjoran test in any figure. Please
amend or report raw data. Do the authors think that the previous "neutral" SFTP for Ani in the
saline rats has gotten overwritten in the Cin SFTP test?
p.7 discussion: observing Fig. 6a, there seems to be a trend towards a main effect of demonstrator
5
novelty. Again, a duplication of the Exp. 3 might give more conclusive results in the direction of
rejecting/accepting such a hypothesis and bring more subtle effects to bear in a higher powered
design as indicated by the authors op p8-first paragraph.
with respect to the conclusion: it seems that if animals have encountered a recent aversive
experience, they favor the most recent socially transmitted information (i.e. from D2 in Exp. 2),
regardless of whether that demonstrator individual was the "cause" of the illness in the observer,
suggesting a type of model-free learning that is actually maladaptive with regards to the model-
based (i.e.demonstrator identity linked to illness food) information that is available.
i think the line "Unexpectedly, our results also suggest that processing of olfactory cues
mediating socially transmitted food preferences may be facilitated if a demonstrator has been
recently learned from" should be qualified for now with the addition "in animals that recently
experienced an aversive episode linked to a taste experience".
minor:
abstract: the continuation of the line after "(2) whether reliance on a specific demonstrator that
had transmitted poor information" seems grammatically incomplete.

a number of experiments, Agee & Monfils investigated the reliance of observer rats on
aladaptive social information provided by a fellow demonstrator rat, here the preference for
od that resulted in sickness of the conforming observer. Using adapted versions of the
cially transmitted food preference (STFP) paradigm, the authors tested whether observer rats
ow decreased reliance on demonstrator rats that had presented cues of the ´poisoned´ food
d would rather develop a STFP from demonstrator rats that provided cues of food that did not
use illness.
verall, the structure and methodological planning of the experiments is thought through and
e manuscript is excellently written.
he following minor points should be added or clarified in the manuscript for further
provement:
In the experiments, you used differend flavors (cinnamon, cocoa, anis and majoram). Have
u ever tested if these flavors differ in general palatability and if they do, does this matter in
ur experiments?
experiment 1 and 2, the demonstrated flavor/demonstrator that had eaten a given flavor
s counterbalanced so the palatability of the flavors should not affect our final results. For
eriment 3, this is admittedly a flaw in our design. This is also the reason why we are unable
ssume the mu = 50% number used for the one-sample t-test that to ascertain the presence
n STFP/CTA in the other experiments.
t said, given the robustness of the STFP behavioral paradigm and our demonstration of STFP
ng other flavors, it seems unlikely that the paradigm would fail at this point. Regardless, this
weakness in our design that is now included in the discussion on experiment 3.
egards to the palatability of anise vs marjoram, the only effect that a palatability difference
ween these two flavors might have would be in experiment 2 if observers somehow altered
ir response to a demonstrator based on the palatability of the flavor they had originally
monstrated. Given that all the current literature suggests that observers are not able to
ust their preferences in such a way, this seems unlikely, but we nevertheless now address
possibility in the discussion section.
Why weren´t the observer rats food deprived? Would food deprivation alter their choice
havior (negatively)?
explanation for why we did not food deprive our observers in any of our experiments was
ed to the end of the experiment 1 methods section. The added paragraph reads as follows:
tably, observers were not food deprived before their choice test because (1) the 18 hr
gth of the choice test made this an unnecessary stressor and (2) we hoped that removing
immediate strong hunger motivation would encourage observers to be more “picky” in
osing which food to consume, thus increasing the sensitivity of our test to small differences
lavour preference. Subsequent experiments utilize this strategy for the same reasons.”
The duration of the choice period, where observer rats are exposed to two flavors of food, is
metimes 1h and sometimes 18h long (for ex. in experiment 2). Can you explain this
fference in duration?
ile the observers are given a smaller time window (1 hr) to consume demonstrated flavors
ore injection, all choice tests lasted 18 hrs. Since we wanted the observers to be able to link
consequences of their reliance on a given demonstrator to that demonstrator, a longer time
dow would have worked against our design.
Exposing rats to food for 18h can be quite long. Please add how much food you presented to
e observer rats. Did it occur that rats finished a full bowl of food during the choice period,
sulting in a ceiling effect?
now explicitly mention in the text the amount of food supplied to observers during the
ice test. While we did not observe a ceiling effect in experiment 1, one subject did finish the
25g of one of his food cups. To prevent any of the rats in our subsequent experiments from
shing all of their food, we increased the amount/flavor from 25g to 30g between
eriments 1 and 2. No one else finished all their food.
The data you show are the total grams eaten of a certain food; however, this type of data
esn´t correct for the overall amount of food eaten during a session. For example, a rat that is
ngry might eat more of the demonstrated food, but also more of the undemonstrated food,
hereas a rat that is satiated doesn´t eat much in general (thus also less of the demonstrated
od). How could you make sure that the observer rats always consumed roughly the same
mount of food, e.g. exclude hunger as a confounding variable?
cent total eaten is now used for the results of experiment 1 & 3. The design of experiment 2
uld make the use of the % total eaten impossible, as by nature of the way that it is calculated
h population of measures has the exact same variance. In order to control for this, we ran an
itional one-way ANOVA to see if we could detect a significant difference in the total amount
en for any of the conditions, which picked up nothing significant.
In Fig. 1, you show percentages of the data, whereas your analysis is based on the raw values
ee my previous point). The significant difference graphically shown in Fig. 1 was derived
om the raw data and not from analyzing the percentages. Please be constant and show the raw
ta that was analyzed.
tistical tests for the first experiment were changed to reflect differences in the percent of
al eaten of the demonstrated food vs. mu = 50%. On follow up analysis, we realized the
umptions of the one-sample t-test were not actually violated in this dataset. The error was
ually in our code, which has now been rectified. Due to the change in our statistical analysis,
ure 1 continues to display % preference rather than grams eaten. In experiment 2, as the
ults we were comparing were primarily within-subjects, it was necessary to use the grams of
monstrated food eaten as the dependent variable. In order to confirm that this measure was
confounded by differences in overall consumption between groups, a one-way ANOVA was
on the total amount in grams eaten over the course of the STFP choice test in order to
firm that there was not a significant difference between the three conditions.
Page 4, line 16. “Sal/LiCl” and “LiCl/Sal” are mentioned here for the first time and these
breviations can be confusing. Shortly introducing the abbreviations might help the reader
derstand the protocol. Once explained, the abbreviations are very good!
Sal/LiCl and LiCl/Sal labels are now clearly defined before the abbreviations are used. In
ition, for increased clarity given experiment 2’s somewhat difficult to understand design,
Sal/LiCl, LiCl/Sal, and Sal/Sal labels throughout the paper have been changed to Reliable D1
/LiCl), Reliable D2 (LiCl/Sal), and Saline Control (Sal/Sal), respectively.
Experiment 3 is a good control experiment, but the sample size is very small (n=3 per
ndition), which is a pity. Please put some extra caution on interpreting these data.
agree with the reviewer that we ought to proceed with caution regarding our
rpretations of Experiment 3. To evaluate the results better, we calculated effect sizes for
eriment 3, and found that all main effects and interaction effects displayed effect sizes that
re quite small.
s suggests that there likely are not effects of these variables present or, at least, that if any
hese effects do exist they are too small to be of real practical importance. This said, it’s true
t our small sample size does make this study somewhat underpowered and that, since our
ign only uses Cocoa chow as a demonstrated flavor, our results are somewhat confounded.
such, a discussion of the limitations of experiment 3 has been added to the discussion
tion, and reads as follows:
is said, an isolated aversive event resulting from reliance on social learning may simply not
e been sufficient to induce a decrease in reliance on social information. It is quite possible
t if observers were to go through multiple trials of learning an STFP, eating the
monstrated food, and being injected with LiCl, we might observe the originally predicted
ct. It should also be stated that in interpreting the results of experiment 3 it is important to
e into account the small sample size per cell (n = 3). The effect sizes calculated from our
ples were also very small, so we believe that it is unlikely that our design would have
ded an effect even with a reasonably larger sample size (a power of .8 estimates sample
s of over 100). Still, the possibility remains that a main effect of social information reliability
s exist and our sample size was simply insufficient to detect it. This interpretation is further
plicated by the fact that, due to our use of only one of the two choice test diets, we cannot
tistically validate that the rats used in experiment 3 obtained a socially transmitted food
ference. Follow-up research using larger sample sizes, varying LiCl injection trials, and
nterbalanced diet presentations will be required to affirm that our findings from this
eriment are valid.”
p. 7, line 49-51. A study from 1990 (Galef) cannot “replicate” findings from 1997 (Kuan and
olwill). Please rephrase the sentence.
Galef 1990 paper referenced in the discussion section as replicating the Kuan & Colwill
97) experiment was mistakenly referenced. We changed it to the correct paper, Galef &
iskin (2000), which was a direct replication of the Kuan & Colwill experiments.
. p. 8, line 8. “information does not influence …”
have made the proposed modification.
. In the conclusion it is stated that the current findings contradict previous research, which
owed that observers are insensitive to characteristics of the demonstrator. Do the authors
nsider ´time´ as a demonstrator characteristic (since observers tended to rely on the most
cent demonstrator)? I think, the term “characteristic” is not ideal, since the timing of
monstrator-observer interaction is unrelated to specific details of the demonstrator. Please
phrase the sentence accordingly.
would argue that in the particular context of our experiment, the time that has elapsed
e a given demonstrator was learned from is a demonstrator characteristic in that it is (1)
cific to that demonstrator, (2) a detail that the observer must be able to connect to that
cific demonstrator at the time of learning and (3) a detail the observer must process during
rning in some way for it to have an effect at recall. Though admittedly this characteristic is a
nsient one, “demonstrator characteristics” is a term that has been used to refer to similarly
nsient details about the demonstrator (e.g. health status of the demonstrator at the time of
raction).

EVIEW OF Effect of Demonstrator Reliability and Recency of Last Demonstration on
cquisition of a Socially Transmitted Food Preference
Agee & Monfils
he authors present exciting new data using the socially transmitted food preference test
TFP). The authors find that rats readily acquire food preferences as reported before. When
king whether such transfer would rely on the 'reliability' of a demonstrator (i.e. does illness
company this demonstration or not), as a characteristic of the demonstrator, they surprisingly
nd no effect of reliability, but an effect of demonstration recency, with only the most recent
monstrator being effective in transmitting a novel preference, even if this demonstrator was
eviously demonstrating the flavor coupled with disease. The approach is innovative and the
sults are promosing. The MS is not edited very well and lacks statistical rigor.
AJOR POINTS:
eel experiment 3 is underpowered in its 2x2 between subjects design. If you agree, please run
duplicate with reversed flavour identities as recommended below. In any case, power analyses
the (null-)effects are warranted; some of the groups are very small (N=6 for the saline/saline
periment; N=3 per cell in exp 3).
agree with the reviewer, and we proceed with caution regarding our interpretations of
eriment 3. To evaluate the results better, we calculated effect sizes for Experiment 3, and
nd that all main effects and interaction effects displayed effect sizes that were quite small.
s suggests that there likely are not effects of these variables present or, at least, that if any
hese effects do exist they are too small to be of real practical importance. This said, it’s true
t our small sample size does make this study somewhat underpowered and that, since our

xp1 - Fig.1
he authors state that: "Due to violation of assumptions, all statistical tests used the total
mount eaten in grams rather than the percent of total eaten as the dependent variable". It is
clear what is meant here. If the assumption of normality for running parametric tests is
olated, why not resort to non-parametric tests? Also, does this change in statistical analysis
proach pertain to just exp. 1 or all subsequent experiments? Please clarify. In addition, Fig.1
nel seems to still display the %of total eaten as a metric, rather than the actual data used for
e statistical test, thus presenting false information. Please harmonise the approaches. Using a
n-normalized approach will work against detecting between-group differences, so the
ported null-effects of interaction time and flavour should be examined pairwise non-
rametrically as well using the normalized measure.
tistical tests for the first experiment were changed to reflect differences in the percent of
al eaten of the demonstrated food vs. mu = 50%. On follow up analysis, we realized the
umptions of the one-sample t-test were not actually violated in this dataset. The error was
ually in our code, which has now been rectified. Due to the change in our statistical analysis,
ure 1 continues to display % preference rather than grams eaten. In experiment 2, since the
ults we were comparing were primarily within-subjects, it was necessary to use the grams of
monstrated food eaten as the dependent variable. In order to confirm that this measure was
confounded by differences in overall consumption between groups, a one-way ANOVA was
on the total amount in grams eaten over the course of the STFP choice test in order to
firm that there was not a significant difference between the three conditions.
o the authors think that the previous "neutral" SFTP for Ani in the saline rats has gotten
erwritten in the Cin SFTP test?
xp2 - the authors assume that the simultaneous interaction of the observer with D1 & D2
ould result in SFTP for both the foods 3 &4 AND that this preference might be influenced by
evious reliability. Can the authors provide evidence that simultaneous exposure to two
monstrators results in SFTP for both new flavors?
iscussing the effect of demonstrator order, a few previous studies were brought up which
d similar simultaneous demonstration designs. The results of these studies strongly suggest
t observer’s subsequent preference for each demonstrated food is altered even if they are
eiving multiple inputs. Chou & Richardson (1992), in particular, were able to demonstrate a
itive linear relationship between the number of demonstrators that had eaten a given flavor
the preference of observers for that flavor, which clearly indicates that multiple inputs
re being processed. Given this evidence, and also considering the highly social environment
ch rats live in (which naturally results in a single animal receiving multiple simultaneous
uts), it is highly unlikely that (1) Old STFPs would be overwritten by new STFPS, and (2)
ltiple STFPs would not be able to form.
5 line 7: the use of order is confusing, because it could both mean "time of interaction
rst/last)" (which is implied) or the order of demonstration (with respect to the Li outcome). I
ould suggest to use "time of demonstration" as descriptive for the within-subject variable, and
ame the result as a "demonstration recency" effect for clarity.
use of demonstrator order has been clarified, the section now reads as below:
e difference in the grams eaten of the demonstrated flavour for observers in all conditions
s analysed using a mixed-design ANOVA with a within-subjects variable of demonstrator
er (i.e., the relative time since a given demonstrator had been learned from)”
he independent samples t-test comparing the data of D2-associated consumption surprisingly
es again the %food eaten.
itional text added to the experiment 2 results section to make it clearer when we are
tching between using grams eaten of the demonstrated flavor and percent total eaten of the
monstrated flavor as our dependent variable.
ease also provide descriptives and analysis of the total grams eaten as used throughout the
periment.
descriptive statistics for the total amount eaten in grams during choice test was reported
all the STFP choice tests, and graphs visualizing this data were added to figure 1, figure 3,
figure 6.
ease formulate the "a priori predictions formed after our detection of the demonstrator order

a priori prediction for our Saline control group is now explicitly stated, this section now
ds:

xp3 confounds the identity of the demonstrated food with the other effects. I would
commend adding a doubling of the design using the Cocoa chow as the demonstrated food,
so the power the design above the N=3 per cell it has now
experiment 3, effect sizes were calculated and we found that all main effects and
raction effects displayed effect sizes to be quite small. This suggests that there likely are not
cts of these variables present or, at least, that if any of these effects do exist they are too
all to be of real practical importance. This said, it’s true that our small sample size does make
study somewhat underpowered and that, as our design only uses Cocoa chow as a
monstrated flavor, our results are somewhat confounded. As discussed above in response to
er reviewer comments, a discussion of the limitations of experiment 3 has been added to
discussion section, and reads as follows:
is said, an isolated aversive event resulting from reliance on social learning may simply not
e been sufficient to induce a decrease in reliance on social information. It is quite possible
t if observers were to go through multiple trials of learning an STFP, eating the

ease make the hypotheses for the groups based on the results from Exp 2 explicit in the
troduction to Exp. 3
hypotheses for the groups in experiment 3 are now made explicit at the end of the overview
tion.

reliable/reliable demonstrator seem to be mixed up
nel b) the four-group design could be clarified by drawing for example cross-hatching in the

ure 5 was updated so that the four group design of experiment 3 was more clearly
resented. In addition, inaccuracies in labelling were corrected.
g. 6
anel A: do the error bars represent SEM? if so, do all groups show the STFP effect, i.e.
fference from 50%? With N=3 animals this is hard to ascertain, calling possibly for a
plication of Exp. 3 (see above)
, the error bars represent SEM, and All but one of the group do show an average preference
cin above 50%, but because we didn’t counterbalance the final demonstrated flavor we can’t
whether that a successful STFP or whether the rats have a natural preference for cinnamon
r cocoa.For experiment 1 and 2, the demonstrated flavor/demonstrator that had eaten a
en flavor was counterbalanced so the palatability of the flavors should not affect our final
ults. For experiment 3, this is admittedly a flaw in our design.
t said, given the robustness of the STFP behavioral paradigm and our demonstration of STFP
ng other flavors, it seems unlikely that the paradigm would fail at this point. Regardless, this
weakness in our design that is now included in the discussion on experiment 3.
anel B"Preference of observers for the first demonstrated flavour over a novel flavour based"
panel B does not show a preference score for the first, but the second demonstrated food.
rhaps rephrase as "%eaten", rather than "preference". What do the signifcance stars indicate
re? If I understood the experiment correctly, the animals labeled "unreliable" in panel A are
e same as "LiCL" in panel B; and the animals labeled as "reliable" should be the "saline"
imals? If so, why are the group means different? It seems the 'reliable' animals end up around
%, while the 'saline' animals hover around 50%
graph in panel A is displaying the % of the total demonstrated food eaten by observers
ing the STFP verification choice test, “reliable” refers to whether or not the observer was
cted with LiCl following their first learning experience with demonstrator 1 in experiment 3.
other figure (which is now in figure 6 panel C) is representing the performance of observers
the CTA verification choice test in experiment 3, where observers were given access to
rjoram chow, which was novel, and anise chow, which they had previously been
monstrated, allowed to consume, and then received an injection. As we are primarily
rested in ensuring that the LiCl injected observers display a significant aversion to the
ction paired food relative to the saline injected observers, a conditioned taste aversion was
ified via a t-test comparing the % of anise eaten by the saline injected vs the LiCl injected
. The significance stars indicate that this between-groups comparison was highly significant,
the LiCl rats did display their conditioned taste aversion.

mend or report raw data.
s has been amended. In the original draft the reader was mistakenly referenced to the
orrect graph, they are now referenced to the correct graph (figure 6 panel C)
7 discussion: observing Fig. 6a, there seems to be a trend towards a main effect of
monstrator novelty. Again, a duplication of the Exp. 3 might give more conclusive results in
e direction of rejecting/accepting such a hypothesis and bring more subtle effects to bear in a
gher powered design as indicated by the authors op p8-first paragraph.
experiment 3, effect sizes were calculated and we found that all main effects and
raction effects displayed effect sizes below what would be considered even medium. This
gests that there likely are not effects of these variables present or, at least, that if any of
se effects do exist they are too small to be of real practical importance. This said, it’s true
t our small sample size does make this study somewhat underpowered and that, as our
ign only uses Cocoa chow as a demonstrated flavor, our results are somewhat confounded.
make sure the reader is aware of all this, a discussion of the limitations of experiment 3 has
n added to the discussion section, read below:
is said, an isolated aversive event resulting from reliance on social learning may simply not
e been sufficient to induce a decrease in reliance on social information. It is quite possible
t if observers were to go through multiple trials of learning an STFP, eating the
monstrated food, and being injected with LiCl, we might observe the originally predicted

e into account the small sample size per cell (n = 3). As the effect sizes calculated from our
ples were also very small, the possibility remains that a main effect of social information
ability does exist and our sample size was simply insufficient to detect it. This interpretation
urther complicated by the fact that, due to our use of only one of the two choice test diets,
cannot statistically validate that the rats used in experiment 3 obtained a socially
nsmitted food preference. Follow-up research using larger sample sizes, varying LiCl injection
ls, and counterbalanced diet presentations will be required to affirm that our findings from
experiment are valid.”
ddition, the paragraph discussing the lack of a demonstrator effect now includes an
nowledgement that our results did non-significantly trend in that direction, read below:
rprisingly, observers in experiment 3 did not display a significant increase in their preference
the second demonstrated flavour over a novel undemonstrated flavour if they had learned
m their demonstrator in the past, though notably our results did trend non-significantly in
direction of there being a demonstrator effect.”
ith respect to the conclusion: it seems that if animals have encountered a recent aversive
perience, they favor the most recent socially transmitted information (i.e. from D2 in Exp. 2),
gardless of whether that demonstrator individual was the "cause" of the illness in the
server, suggesting a type of model-free learning that is actually maladaptive with regards to
e model-based (i.e.demonstrator identity linked to illness food) information that is available.
hink the line "Unexpectedly, our results also suggest that processing of olfactory cues
ediating socially transmitted food preferences may be facilitated if a demonstrator has been
perienced an aversive episode linked to a taste experience".
now qualify our conclusion as suggested by the reviewer, read the associated section from
revised conclusion below:
expectedly, our results also suggest that processing of olfactory cues mediating socially
nsmitted food preferences may be facilitated in demonstrators that have been more
ently learned from, at least in observers that have recently experienced social learning
ociated illness.”
inor:
stract: the continuation of the line after "(2) whether reliance on a specific demonstrator that
d transmitted poor information" seems grammatically incomplete.
. line 1 reposition 72
have modified the sentence accordingly, read below:

ance on social learning was unsuccessful and (2) whether reliance on the specific
monstrator that had transmitted poor information would similarly decrease.”.
