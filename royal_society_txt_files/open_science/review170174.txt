The paper addresses a very important issue-that of BIM applied on tunnel engineering. The paper
is fairly written and can be understood. However, these weaknesses needs to be improved for
the paper to accepted for publication.
1. A methodology section must be included. This can be ½ of a page
2. Grammar
The English needs to be significantly improved. See examples of very good facts but the English
is so poor that the intended meaning is lost.
Later, Jerry, et al. supplemented and standardized the conception and popularized BIM theory.
In the end of 2008, BSA had obtained a series of application standards, including IFC (Industry
Foundation Classes) standard, NBIMS, United States National CAD Standard, and Journal of
Building Information Modeling (JBIM) standard [4].
Relatively, BIM technology commences in China later [12].
In recent years, the BIM has gradually been known by the civil engineering [13].
The informatization of tunnel engineering level, however, is still lower in China. Although
manual drawing is replaced by computer-aided design and the efficiency of tunnel engineering
design has been improved greatly, it is still a mode of scattered resource management, which is
significantly different from the concentrated resource management mode of BIM [18].
3
There are more obstacles existed in the implementation of BIM technology-based tunnel
engineering. As previous BIM software platform caters to design of construction industry and is
not coupled with tunnel engineering standard and software, BIM technology for construction
industry cannot be directly applied in tunnel industry.
The second one is different characteristics of main structure. BIM technology-based tunnel
engineering faces more challenges [33-35]. However, the advantages of BIM technology are more
obvious since tunnel engineering is confronted with difficult problems, which including
unknown factors, longer construction cycle, narrow construction space, higher requirements for
operation and maintenance, and more serious consequence of fire and traffic accidents [36-37].
Apropos of fire accidents with more serious consequence, the interactive operation between BIM
technology and serious game platform can be applied to address the shortage of data collection of
existing simulation method in observing personal escape behavior in tunnel fire [38].
Apropos is odd here! Please think of an alternative word. Do the same for apropos in other places
of this manuscript
3D geologic model is created and combined with geologic information.
What is geologic???? Should this not be geological model?
3. Abbreviations
Authors should provide full-meaning of words on first use. E.g. CAD, PRC
4. Numbering
Number of paragraphs is really odd and should be removed. For example all the numbering of
paragraphs in section 6 should be removed.

COMMENTS FOR THE AUTHOR:
The paper demonstrated the review of the application of building information
modeling (BIM) through the related research results and engineering cases,
which can provide comprehensive experience for construction of relevant
engineering.The topic is interesting and the paper is well organized, however,
some key issues are not clearly or defects are existed in current manuscript,
details as follow:
1. What restrict the stage of BIM application during the whole project process?
For example, as authors mentioned in manuscript, the BIM model cannot be
applied in the whole process because of the incompatibility problem generated
by the standard of different software. Then, how the BIM was used in the all
stages in the Xingu mountain tunnel? A detailed explaination should be made
for the proper circumstances of BIM application during the whole project
process.
2.Page 10, a suggestion should be added for the combination system of BIM
and 3D or 4D visualized model based on the Shigu mountain tunnel.
3. Page 11-12, conclusion (2) and (3) actually focused on the same aspects of
BIM development in China, the problems and challenges. For example, BIM
application in tunnel engineering is mostly used in design stage due to many
reasons, which relating to the problems mentioned in conclusion (3).
4. Page 12, the sequence of conclusion should be adjusted. Conclusion (1)
and (4) are all about the advantages of BIM application, conclusion (2) and (3)
are focused on the problems.
5. Page 3, line 48-49. The second obstacles, the different characteristics of
main structure, should be explained more detailed.
6. Some comments on the grammars and further modification should be made
before accepted, such as following:
Page 1, line 49, guide for;
Page 3, line 29, sentence structure;
Page 3, line 44-46, sentence structure;
Page 4, line 24-30, the sentence is too long, proper punctuate is needed.
Page 5, line 18, the word “and” should be modified to “which” for the correct
grammar structure;
Page5, line 51, lays;
Page 9, line 9, it is of profound significance;
Page 9, line 49, grammar mistake;
Page 11, line 19, wastes efforts;

Responses to the Comments of the Reviewers
The authors would like to thank the suggestive comments from the reviewers, which are
very helpful to guide the authors’ rework on the manuscript, and the responses to these
comments are listed as follows:
Reviewers' comments:
Reviewer #1:
1) What restrict the stage of BIM application during the whole project process? For example, as
authors mentioned in manuscript, the BIM model cannot be applied in the whole process because of
he incompatibility problem generated by the standard of different software. Then, how the BIM was
used in the all stages in the Xingu mountain tunnel? A detailed explanation should be made for the
proper circumstances of BIM application during the whole project process.
Response:
ncompatibility between different software mainly restricts the application of BIM in tunnel
engineering. It is difficult to communicate effectively between different software platforms because of
his problem. There is still not professional software for BIM in tunnel engineering in China. In this
case of Xingu mountain tunnel, CATIA software was applied to try to build up the BIM model, and the
esult proved that CATIA software could roughly meet the requirements of BIM in the whole period in
unnel engineering. But because CATIA software is mainly aimed at mechanical and aerospace field,
and it is not professional in tunnel field, so there are still many defects and big gap to be improved,
uch as the low quality in detailed design.
We sincerely show thanks for the comment provided by the reviewer. We have ignored this
problem in the manuscript submitted last time. After carefully checking, we have added the related
nformation to the revised manuscript, as shown in Fig. 1-1.
Fig. 1-1
2) Page 10, a suggestion should be added for the combination system of BIM and 3D or 4D
visualized model based on the Shigu mountain tunnel.
Response:
We sincerely show thanks for the comment provided by the reviewer. We have added relative
nformation to the corresponding location in the revised manuscript, as shown in Fig. 2-1.
Fig. 2-1
The responses towards both (3) and (4) below are arranged together.
3) Page 11-12, conclusion (2) and (3) actually focused on the same aspects of BIM development in
China, the problems and challenges. For example, BIM application in tunnel engineering is mostly
used in design stage due to many reasons, which relating to the problems mentioned in conclusion (3).
4) Page 12, the sequence of conclusion should be adjusted. Conclusion (1) and (4) are all about the
advantages of BIM application, conclusion (2) and (3) are focused on the problems.
Response:
After carefully checking, we have made some corrections according to the reviewer’s valuable
and helpful comments, as shown in Fig. 3-1.
Fig. 3-1
5). Page 3, line 48-49. The second obstacles, the different characteristics of main structure, should be
explained more detailed.
Response:
After carefully checking, we have described different characteristics between architecture and
unnel in more details according to the reviewer’s valuable and helpful comments, as shown in Fig.
4-1.

Response:
We sincerely show thanks for the comments on grammar mistakes provided by the reviewer, and
we have sent this manuscript to a native speaker of English to be polished prior to this
esubmitting. After carefully checking, many corrections have been made according to the reviewer’s
valuable and helpful comments. All the modifications have been marked in red text in revised
manuscript.
Reviewer #2:
1) A methodology section must be included. This can be ½ of a page.
Response:
We sincerely show thanks for the comment about methodology section provided by the reviewer. We
have added this information to the revised manuscript, as shown in Fig. 5-1.
Part 1
Part 2
Part 3

2) Authors should provide full-meaning of words on first use. E.g. CAD, PRC
Response:
After carefully checking, full-meaning of words on first use is added to the corresponding location.
Such as ' computer-aided design ' for' CAD', and ' The People's Republic of China ' for ' CAD' .
3)Number of paragraphs is really odd and should be removed. For example, all the numbering of
paragraphs in section 6 should be removed.
Response:
After carefully checking, the odd and unnecessary number of paragraph is removed in the revised
manuscript, as shown in Fig. 6-1.
