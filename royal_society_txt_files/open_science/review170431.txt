This is an intriguing paper which seeks to investigate the relationship between body size and
cortical bone remodelling particularly in terms of the functional unit of cortical remodelling; the
osteon. The paper has a lot of merit so I only have a few comments.
1) As outlined by Skedros and others (particularly in the artiodactyl calcaneus and human
femoral neck), osteon characteristics in terms of density (and therefore overall size) and
proportionate infill vary considerably depending on the habitual strain mode applied to long
bones. It would be of great benefit to this study to report (if possible) the relative circumferential
position from which the samples were obtained. If of course they were whole cross-sections then
this is less of a concern providing equal numbers were obtained from regions likely to be neutral,
compressed or in tension during habitual loading.
2) The range of species will almost certainly encompass a wide range of remodelling rates which
are generally (but not always) higher in smaller species. As the authors only measured osteons
with a complete cement line (ie those most recently formed) the possibility of bias towards
osteons still undergoing bone formation and therefore incomplete is high. One way around this
is to determine the canal dimensions in pre-existing osteons which will have been completed
prior to the osteons used in this study and then only use those osteons that are within a defined
limit (say 90%) for the analysis.
3) The statistical analysis is completely incomprehensible even to those such as myself with more
than a rudimentary understanding of statistics.
4) An indication of the number of osteons used for each species would be beneficial.

The authors have not really responded to this reviewer's comments. The idea underpinning the
current work was presented presented previously in 2004, in a peer-reviewed conference
proceeding to the ORS, which was based on material published in 2003 (Anatomical Record).
The authors state: "In contrast to the general attention that scaling relationships of whole
bones...have received, quantitative measurements of the spatial dimensions of secondary osteons
across a sample range of more than ten species are yet to be reported in a single study." While this
statement may be absolutely true since the 2004 article addressed 9 species rather than 10, it is
nonetheless misleading and rather hard to understand why the authors are going to such lengths
not to acknowledge that the concept was presented previously. Why not give credit and
solidify/confirm the previously hypothesised and prelim-data substantiated relationship? Rather
than describing the study from 2004 as 're-using data and disparaging the methodology from 13
years ago, why not acknowledge its presence and positive impact as a first in the literature which
addressed a hypothesis for which the current study provides additional evidence? The authors
are 'nearly there' in publishing there paper; acknowledgement of the value of previous work is
not going to prevent their work from being published and shows greatness in recognising the
work that came before. This seems rather silly, as most science stands upon strong shoulders of
previous work!
The authors suggest that Mishra and Knothe Tate does not take into account phylogenetic effects
which is incorrect. The authors neglected to refer to another work by Mishra and Knothe Tate
(Anatomical Record 2003 - and noted in the previous review) upon which the 2004 work was
based (and cited the 2003 work): Fig. 8, “Schematic diagram describing the proposed evolution of
transport networks in biology” in Mishra and Knothe Tate, Anatomical Record 2003
The authors did not take into account other suggestions from the previous review either:
As noted previously, "the authors' language weakens the potential impact of the work".
7
The authors also failed to address other means to tie data to mechanobiologically relevant
reference points, e.g. the major and minor centroidal axes suggested by Lieberman et al. and by
McBride and Knothe Tate: 'one way to address this is to bring in another reference point such as
major or minor centroidal axis (see McBride et al. 2011 J Biomechanics, “Major and minor
centroidal axes serve as objective, automatable reference points to test mechanobiological
hypotheses using histomorphometry”)'. Why not even refer to this as a possible way to address
this potential weakness?
This reviewer took significant time and effort to read the authors' manuscript and to make
suggestions to further its impact as well to bring science a further step forward. Not heeding or
even acknowledging a reviewers' suggestions disregards the investments that others make to
bring the field further!

Review RSOS-170432.R2: Secondary osteons scale allometrically in the mammalian humerus and
femur
This manuscript describes several characteristic dimensions associated with secondary osteons in
the cortical bone tissue of a wide variety of mammalian species. The findings confirm the
hypothesis that most dimensions (osteonal size, Haversian canal diameter), are significantly
correlated to body size. The authors also show that their findings support the overall conclusions
that very small species are limited in terms of resorption size due to risk of bone failure,
The questions dealt with in this manuscript is interesting and relevant, and contributes to basic
issues of bone biology. The manuscript itself is well written and easy to follow, and represents an
impressive amount of work.
This study does have several significant limitations. These are derived from the choice of the
authors to base their study on a museum collection. As a result, the study uses samples which
often lacked precise information which would be very relevant to the questions investigated.
Such data include precise knowledge of the sex, age, weight of animal, area in bone from which a
particular transverse section was obtained and level of activity. Furthermore, a single sample
11
(from one animal) may bias the results if that particular animal was sick or deformed or different
in any significant way and therefore perhaps does not represent its species.
I am very aware however of the difficulty to obtain a large number of sample size from each of a
large selection of species, with fully known details, and I am sure the authors would have loved
to do that if it were possible. I also believe that with all its limitations, the data obtained here is
very useful and interesting.
I therefore recommend publication of this manuscript, since it will make a significant
contribution to the field of bone biology, and add relevant data to the community of bone
researchers. My suggestion is that the authors should stress the limitations of the manuscript
more thoroughly, although they already dedicated a large paragraph to some of these.

General comments
The authors have presented an interesting paper that builds on previous work
regarding allometric scaling of secondary osteons in the humerus and femur and
associated evolutionary implications. The data from the current study is strong,
and if placed in context of previously published foundational work, builds a
compelling case for osteoblastic activity as a surrogate measure for metabolism,
which scales with mammalian size/mass. In particular, Mishra and Knothe Tate’s
work of 2004 entitled “ALLOMETRIC SCALING RELATIONSHIPS IN
MICROARCHITECTURE OF MAMMALIAN CORTICAL BONE” appears to be particularly
relevant. It would also be very interesting to discuss the findings of the current
study in light of that previous work. Giving credit for previous work in no way
diminishes the value and impact of the current work – on the contrary, great
science often “stands on the shoulders” of previous fundamental work. In
general, this very interesting work would be of interest to a multidisciplinary
audience such as the readership of Royal Society Open Science.
Specific Comments
Introduction
Paragraph 1: the “collagen deficient border” is typically referred to as the cement
line rather than cement sheath.
Paragraph 2: Another important hypothesis tying the mechanical function (and
associated fatigue damage) and metabolic function of bone is that resorption
provides a means to maintain tissue viability through cell viability – cf. Knothe
Tate and Schaffler 2002 “LOSS OF OSTEOCYTE INTEGRITY COLOCALIZES WITH BONE
RESORPTION FOLLOWING DISUSE”
Paragraph 3: “…quantitative measurements of the spatial dimensions of
secondary osteon dimensions across a large sample of species are yet to be
reported in a single study”
cf. Mishra and Knothe Tate (2004) “ALLOMETRIC SCALING RELATIONSHIPS IN
MICROARCHITECTURE OF MAMMALIAN CORTICAL BONE” – species include rat,
rabbit, cat, dog, monkey, adult human, cow, diadectes, iguanodon
“This remains the only such study we are aware of, is based on a small sample of
9 species and does not take into account phylogenetic effects.”
Please refer to Fig. 8, “Schematic diagram describing the proposed evolution of
transport networks in biology” in Mishra and Knothe Tate, Anatomical Record
2003
Last paragraph: “We then hand-traced the borders of all intact secondary
osteons and their Haversian canals”
“Hand traced” evokes tracing by hand using a writing instrument. It is assumed
that the authors mean that the features were digitised by hand using imaging
software?
Materials and Methods
Historical details on specimen origin and preparation
Well done giving credit to the naturalists and anatomists and collectors of
specimens!
Imaging
Here you do say that you digitised manually and analysed using Fiji.
“Following previously established methods [14] a feature was classified as an
intact secondary osteon if >90% of the cement line and the entire canal
boundary were visible, and the aspect ratio was <2, to prevent atypical osteon
variants [from] confounding our area measurements”
It is not clear whether this sentence implies that the methods are established
(usually more than a single study is required to establish a method) or if the
authors mean “following a previously established method”. If the latter, would
suggest reiterating rationale behind methodology used in [14].
Also suggest addressing the following limitation in the discussion, i.e. exclusion
of “drifting” osteons: what is the rationale behind exclusion of these data that
may contain vital information and what effect would this have been expected to
have on the final data? This may appear to be a petty point, but osteoblasts do
not orient perfectly in alignment with the longitudinal direction of long bones
(along Haversion canals) or orthogonal to that direction (along Volkmann’s
canals). It would be interesting to include these data as well and to see if the
conclusions still hold. Of course a major limitation of these methods is the lack of
a way to study these things in 3D and the lack of methods to precisely and
repeatedly orient specimen sectioning. <U+F0E8> one way to address this is to bring in
another reference point such as major or minor centroidal axis (see McBride et
al. 2011 J Biomechanics, “Major and minor centroidal axes serve as objective,
automatable reference points to test mechanobiological hypotheses using
histomorphometry”).
Discussion
First paragraph – in this reviewer’s opinion, the authors’ language significantly
weakens the impact of the work
- “…we did not feel comfortable reporting any osteon areal density
measurements, as they would not have been comparable between
species. This was also not the focus of our study.” It seems very strange to
include this information in the first paragraph of the Discussion, where
the most important findings of the study are typically reported.
- “Our images are in agreement with the general view that extensive
remodelling is only present in larger species.” Images cannot agree with a
view – either the data supports the putative hypothesis that “extensive
remodelling is only present in larger species”…or something to that effect.
Indeed, larger species tend to be longer living species, so it is likely that
time plays a major role in this, i.e. larger species need to remodel their
bones throughout life to keep them viable.
Physiological and mechanical contraints on osteon dimensions
The authors miss an opportunity here to discuss their work in context of
previous findings, in particular those listed above
The authors neglect transport path considerations in their discussion of upper
limits for osteon and canal area, and Mishra and Knothe Tate’s extensive
discussion of the topic (Anatomical Record 2004) would be very interesting in
this regard
“The fact that phylogeny had little effect on our findings is
unsurprising…reinforces the notion that our results likely reflect overall bio-
physical limits within which the intracortical bone remodelling process
operates…”
This statement is seems rather unscientific – why go to the trouble of this whole
study which involved tremendous work? If “intracortical bone remodelling…
operates” under specific biophysical limits, then the interesting question
remains: what are those limits? See discussion in Anatomical Record 2004 for an
in depth discussion – your data can bring the field a big step further if discussed
in light of what we have learned in the past!
Appendix B
ondon, 7 July 2017
We thank the reviewers for their excellent and insightful comments on our manuscript entitled
Secondary osteons scale allometrically in mammalian humerus and femur” (Manuscript ID RSOS-
170431). We have revised the manuscript accordingly and provide our detailed responses below. We
have additionally submitted a version of the revised manuscript highlighting our changes in red and
green as a "review file".
Reviewer 1
1) As outlined by Skedros and others (particularly in the artiodactyl calcaneus and human femoral
neck), osteon characteristics in terms of density (and therefore overall size) and proportionate infill vary
onsiderably depending on the habitual strain mode applied to long bones. It would be of great benefit
o this study to report (if possible) the relative circumferential position from which the samples were
btained. If of course they were whole cross-sections then this is less of a concern providing equal
numbers were obtained from regions likely to be neutral, compressed or in tension during habitual
oading.”
We agree with the reviewer that knowledge of the circumferential position would be of benefit to our
tudy. However, as stated in the first paragraph of subsection 2.(b), the exact anatomical location from
which the historical slides were produced is unknown. We have searched Quekett's publications and
diaries in vain for indications of whether he (and his collaborators/salespeople that sold slides to him)
ampled from anatomically similar locations. To further emphasize the fact that habitual loading may
play a role in determining osteon size, we have added a paragraph about this in subsection 4.(b) and
xplicitly stated in subsection 2.(b) that circumferential/radial position was unknown for all partial
pecimens.
2) The range of species will almost certainly encompass a wide range of remodelling rates which are
generally (but not always) higher in smaller species. As the authors only measured osteons with a
omplete cement line (ie those most recently formed) the possibility of bias towards osteons still
undergoing bone formation and therefore incomplete is high. One way around this is to determine the
anal dimensions in pre-existing osteons which will have been completed prior to the osteons used in
his study and then only use those osteons that are within a defined limit (say 90%) for the analysis.”
Thanks for this particularly intriguing comment.
We noticed that we had not stated this limitation as clearly as we had hoped, although we do mention it
when reporting on the minimum infill distance (last paragraph of subsection 3. (b)). In the presence of
ny incomplete osteons, the minimum infill distance is always going to correspond to the least complete
ne, which is a possible reason why the minimum infill distance does not scale, but the mean, median
nd maximum infill distance do scale (as stated in last paragraph of 3.(b) and evident from Table 4).
n a first step, we have addressed this unclarity by adding a paragraph about this to the discussion
limitations, subsection 4. (b))
n a second step, we have added extra information about the scaling of median quantities of interest to
he results section text and tables (in subsection 3. (a)). We did this to emphasize that our conclusions
based on canal area and derived measurements are only very weakly influenced by incomplete infilling
f osteons, because the median data (which will be robust to outliers from measuring incomplete
steons) scales very similarly to the mean (scaling exponents 0.31 (with 95% confidence interval 0.24-
0.39) versus 0.3 (with 95% confidence interval 0.23-0.37).
The suggested workaround is very interesting, but unfortunately many of the smaller species (and some
f the larger) have only one generation of secondary osteons, making it impossible to reliably estimate
anal dimensions from pre-existing osteons in these samples. Therefore, this would only further
omplicate matters of comparison between small and large species.
3) The statistical analysis is completely incomprehensible even to those such as myself with more than
rudimentary understanding of statistics.”
We apologize for this, thanks for pointing this out! We have done our best to improve the clarity of the
ationale behind our statistical analyses by re-ordering and expanding on the contents of subsection 2
b) and the beginning of section 3 in a way we think is a more accessible. Our method (Warton et al.,
Biological Reviews, 2006) is the standard for scaling studies and has been cited over a thousand times in
he past decade.
n particular, we have first elaborated on our rationale behind using different square sample correlation
oefficients depending on whether data was normally distributed or not, and then provided more
background on scaling studies and phylogenetic correction, in the hope that it will be more accessible to
he general audience of RSOS.
4) An indication of the number of osteons used for each species would be beneficial.”
Thank you for the suggestion, we have replaced the last column of Tables 1 and 2 to display the number
f osteons measured in each sample (instead of solely whether there were any or not) and referred to it
n the text.
Reviewer 2
General comments
The authors have presented an interesting paper that builds on previous work
egarding allometric scaling of secondary osteons in the humerus and femur and
ssociated evolutionary implications. The data from the current study is strong,
nd if placed in context of previously published foundational work, builds a
ompelling case for osteoblastic activity as a surrogate measure for metabolism,
which scales with mammalian size/mass. In particular, Mishra and Knothe Tate’s
work of 2004 entitled “ ALLOMETRIC SCALING RELATIONSHIPS IN
MICROARCHITECTURE OF MAMMALIAN CORTICAL BONE” appears to be particularly relevant. It would
lso be very interesting to discuss the findings of the current study in light of that previous work. Giving
redit for previous work in no way
diminishes the value and impact of the current work – on the contrary, great
cience often “stands on the shoulders” of previous fundamental work. In
general, this very interesting work would be of interest to a multidisciplinary
udience such as the readership of Royal Society Open Science.”
We would like to thank the reviewer for their encouraging general comments. We agree that Mishra and
Knothe Tate's “Allometric scaling relationships in microarchitecture of mammalian bone” is one of the
most important previous studies for our work. We would like to point out that we did cite this work as
uch at the end of our introduction (reference number 27 in the submitted manuscript), also giving
redit to the authors from which Mishra and Knothe Tate re-used data in their study (references 25 and
26). We have rearranged parts of the introduction for this work to feature more prominently, with our
eview of previous relevant scaling studies ending with its citation.
Specific comments
ntroduction
Paragraph 1: the “collagen deficient border” is typically referred to as the cement
ine rather than cement sheath.”
While we agree with the reviewer that cement line (the two-dimensional observation of the “cement
heath”) is a more widely known term for the “collagen-deficient border” of secondary osteons, in this
ase, we prefer the term cement sheath, as it more appropriately describes secondary osteons in three
dimensions, which we have therefore kept. We have, however, brought forward the sentence describing
he relationship between cement line and sheath from the methods section to the introduction to
amiliarize readers with this distinction more clearly and more immediately.
Paragraph 2: Another important hypothesis tying the mechanical function (and
ssociated fatigue damage) and metabolic function of bone is that resorption
provides a means to maintain tissue viability through cell viability – cf. Knothe
Tate and Schaffler 2002 “ LOSS OF OSTEOCYTE INTEGRITY COLOCALIZES WITH BONE
RESORPTION FOLLOWING DISUSE””
Thanks to the reviewer's comment, we were made aware that the link between osteocyte viability and
bone remodelling has been hypothesized to run deeper than evident from our introductory paragraph.
We have therefore added a sentence elaborating on this and referring the reader to a recent review of
his link.
Paragraph 3: “...quantitative measurements of the spatial dimensions of
econdary osteon dimensions across a large sample of species are yet to be
eported in a single study”
f. Mishra and Knothe Tate (2004) “ ALLOMETRIC SCALING RELATIONSHIPS IN
MICROARCHITECTURE OF MAMMALIAN CORTICAL BONE” – species include rat,
abbit, cat, dog, monkey, adult human, cow, diadectes, iguanodon ”
We acknowledge the importance of this work to our study as well as the fact that their sample of species
at 9) is considerable compared to previous studies at the time. We have therefore adapted our
ormulation to emphasize that no existing previous study uses more than 10 species, which more
precisely describes the step forward that our study undertakes.
This remains the only such study we are aware of, is based on a small sample of
9 species and does not take into account phylogenetic effects.”
lease refer to Fig. 8, “Schematic diagram describing the proposed evolution of
ransport networks in biology” in Mishra and Knothe Tate, Anatomical Record
2003”
Reading the reviewer's comments, we noticed that this paragraph could have been formulated in a
learer way. What we intended to emphasize here is the fact that the previous study did not control for
he fact that some of the species sampled are more closely related than others, and therefore can not be
onsidered statistically independent (Felsenstein, The American Naturalist, 1985). We have amended the
entence to make it more precise.
Last paragraph: “We then hand-traced the borders of all intact secondary
steons and their Haversian canals””
We have clarified the sentence as suggested. Thank you!
Materials and Methods
Historical details on specimen origin and preparation
Well done giving credit to the naturalists and anatomists and collectors of
pecimens!”
We are glad that the reviewer acknowledges this, as we feel the use of a historical collection adds some
nteresting extra value to our work.
maging
Here you do say that you digitised manually and analysed using Fiji.
Following previously established methods [14] a feature was classified as an
ntact secondary osteon if >90% of the cement line and the entire canal
boundary were visible, and the aspect ratio was <2, to prevent atypical osteon
ariants [from] confounding our area measurements”
t is not clear whether this sentence implies that the methods are established
usually more than a single study is required to establish a method) or if the
uthors mean “following a previously established method”. If the latter, would
uggest reiterating rationale behind methodology used in [14].”
The latter is indeed the case, and we would like to thank the reviewer for noticing this ambiguity. We
have amended this and reiterated the rationale, as suggested.
Also suggest addressing the following limitation in the discussion, i.e. exclusion
f “drifting” osteons: what is the rationale behind exclusion of these data that
may contain vital information and what effect would this have been expected to
have on the final data? This may appear to be a petty point, but osteoblasts do
not orient perfectly in alignment with the longitudinal direction of long bones
along Haversion canals) or orthogonal to that direction (along Volkmann’s
anals). It would be interesting to include these data as well and to see if the
onclusions still hold. Of course a major limitation of these methods is the lack of
way to study these things in 3D and the lack of methods to precisely and
epeatedly orient specimen sectioning.
ne way to address this is to bring in
nother reference point such as major or minor centroidal axis (see McBride et
l. 2011 J Biomechanics, “Major and minor centroidal axes serve as objective,
utomatable reference points to test mechanobiological hypotheses using
histomorphometry ” ).”
The rationale behind excluding the drifting osteon data is that they have the potential to strongly
onfound the area measurements that we took. As a response to this comment, we have emphasized
his fact more strongly in our methods section (second last paragraph of subsection 2.(b)). Drifting
steons (and other atypical osteon variants (Skedros et al., Cells Tissues Organs, 2007)) are likely to
epresent two-dimensional observations of the three-dimensional branching morphotypes described in
eference 4 of our submitted manuscript. Therefore, we expect them to have different orientations, but
not different dimensions than the prevalent longitudinal osteons we measured, and we would therefore
olely expect a confounding effect by including this data, as already stated in our methods section.
We agree with the reviewer that additional reference points, such as e.g. the centroidal axes, would
provide useful information, in particular with regard to prevalent loading patterns in different parts of
he cortex (as also pointed out by the other reviewer, see their comment 1). However, as explained
previously in the response to reviewer 1, and elaborated on in our manuscript (See second last
paragraph of subsection 4.(b)), we intentionally sacrificed knowledge of the exact anatomical location in
rder to be able to sample from a set of mammals covering the largest range of species, clades and
body masses to date, which is important for a scaling study. Unfortunately, therefore, it was often not
possible to have any reliable additional reference point common to all specimens.
Discussion
First paragraph – in this reviewer’s opinion, the authors’ language significantly
weakens the impact of the work
“...we did not feel comfortable reporting any osteon areal density
measurements, as they would not have been comparable between
pecies. This was also not the focus of our study.” It seems very strange to
nclude this information in the first paragraph of the Discussion, where
he most important findings of the study are typically reported.”
Thank you for this helpful comment. We have moved this sentence to section 4.(b).
Our images are in agreement with the general view that extensive remodelling is only present in larger
pecies.” Images cannot agree with a view – either the data supports the putative hypothesis that
extensive remodelling is only present in larger species”…or something to that effect. Indeed, larger
pecies tend to be longer living species, so it is likely that time plays a major role in this, i.e. larger
pecies need to remodel their bones throughout life to keep them viable.
Thank you for this helpful comment. We have formulated this thought more clearly in the current
ersion.
hysiological and mechanical constraints on osteon dimensions
The authors miss an opportunity here to discuss their work in context of
previous findings, in particular those listed above
Thanks for this. We have added a sentence to the discussion referring to the previous scaling study.
The authors neglect transport path considerations in their discussion of upper
imits for osteon and canal area, and Mishra and Knothe Tate’s extensive
discussion of the topic (Anatomical Record 2004) would be very interesting in
his regard”
Thanks for this comment. We agree with the reviewer that Mishra and Knothe Tate's 2004 paper, which
uses an idealized osteon model to argue that the branching of lacunocanalicular network around the
Haversian canal reduces hydraulic losses by reducing fluid velocity up to a limit of “five to six lamellae”,
which is apparently equivalent to “150 microns”, (after which the reduction of energy loss per lamella
becomes negligible and therefore adding more lamellae becomes energetically inefficient), pertains to
ur study. We have therefore added a paragraph discussing the idea of transport paths, as suggested.
We have, however, after careful consideration, come to the conclusion that, although interesting in its
day, we do not believe Mishra and Knothe Tate, 2004 warrants as prominent a place in our discussion as
he reviewer perhaps suggests. Apart from the doubts cast on the assumptions and conclusions of the
paper by more recent studies (see our discussion of it), we could not help but notice that it further
ontains at least two basic arithmetic mistakes (paragraph after equation 10: since hydraulic losses are
proportional to Q2, the loss after one branching iteration is one quarter (and not one half) and the loss
fter six branching iterations is (1/64)2=1/128 (and not 1/64)). The paper further contains a strongly
misleading figure (Figure 6), which violates the continuity equation (the result of summing the flow rates
hat enter the system is 2Q; the result of summing the flow rates that exit the system, the result is Q).
The authors also do not mention capillary forces or whether the canalicular fluid is Newtonian or not,
which are basic considerations for the applicability of such a model to a biological fluid at the micron
cale. We have confirmed this finding independently with a colleague (added in acknowledgements) who
pecializes in computational fluid mechanics.
“The fact that phylogeny had little effect on our findings is
unsurprising...reinforces the notion that our results likely reflect overall bio-
physical limits within which the intracortical bone remodelling process
perates...”
This statement is seems rather unscientific – why go to the trouble of this whole
tudy which involved tremendous work? If “intracortical bone remodelling...
perates” under specific biophysical limits, then the interesting question
emains: what are those limits? See discussion in Anatomical Record 2004 for an
n depth discussion – your data can bring the field a big step further if discussed
n light of what we have learned in the past!”
Thanks for this comment. We have formulated our conclusion slightly more strongly as a consequence.
We do state clearly throughout subsection 4.(a) of the discussion what we believe these biophysical
imits are.
Appendix C
irst of all, we would like to thank the Subject Editor and the Reviewers for their thorough handling of
ur manuscript. Please find our responses to the latest round of comments in the following text.
------------------------------------------
Subject Editor:
Comments to the Author:
wonder if the authors re-submitted the wrong version of their manuscript, that did not take into
ccount the comments of the reviewer. Please check, and if this is not so, address more fully the
oncerns about previous publications and citations of other work. Thanks
------------------------------------------
We double-checked our re-submitted version, and found it to be the one we intended to re-submit. We
believe that we did acknowledge and address all comments of the reviewer in the previous re-
ubmission and response, although we disagreed with some of them and explained our rationale for that
n the previous response. However, after the latest round of reviews, we have found that this may,
partly at least, not have been as clear as we would have liked. We have therefore undertaken further
teps to clarify the matters raised by the reviewer in our manuscript and in our response, described in
detail below.
------------------------------------------
Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have not really responded to this reviewer's comments. The idea underpinning the current
work was presented presented previously in 2004, in a peer-reviewed conference proceeding to the
ORS, which was based on material published in 2003 (Anatomical Record).
------------------------------------------
We would like to point out that we already do cite both these articles in the previous re-submission
references 28 and 88, respectively) and in the current version (references 28 and 89, respectively). In
ur manuscript, we do fully acknowledge that the idea was presented previously, as described in more
detail further in the text.
------------------------------------------
The authors state: "In contrast to the general attention that scaling relationships of whole bones...have
eceived, quantitative measurements of the spatial dimensions of secondary osteons across a sample
ange of more than ten species are yet to be reported in a single study." While this statement may be
bsolutely true since the 2004 article addressed 9 species rather than 10, it is nonetheless misleading
nd rather hard to understand why the authors are going to such lengths not to acknowledge that the
oncept was presented previously. Why not give credit and solidify/confirm the previously hypothesised
nd prelim-data substantiated relationship? Rather than describing the study from 2004 as 're-using
data and disparaging the methodology from 13 years ago, why not acknowledge its presence and
positive impact as a first in the literature which addressed a hypothesis for which the current study
provides additional evidence? The authors are 'nearly there' in publishing there paper; acknowledgement
f the value of previous work is not going to prevent their work from being published and shows
greatness in recognising the work that came before. This seems rather silly, as most science stands
upon strong shoulders of previous work!
------------------------------------------
As stated in previous rounds of review, we fully acknowledge Mishra and Knothe Tate, 2004, as the first
to the best of our knowledge) scaling analysis of secondary osteons (although we have in the meantime
noticed that Jowsey hypothesized a relationship between osteon size and animal mass in 1966). We cite
Mishra and Knothe Tate, 2004, as “this remains the only such study [scaling study of osteon size] we
re aware of” since the original submission. In response to the previous set of comments, we gave this
work even more attention in the manuscript by citing it again (as “the only previous such study”) at the
beginning of our discussion. We also clearly state in the previous re-submission that idea of distance
rom the canal limiting osteon size was hypothesized previously in Mishra and Knothe Tate, 2003, in the
ontext of fluid transport in bone: “It has previously been hypothesized that the energy efficiency of the
luid transport to the outermost osteocytes limits the size of secondary osteons [89].”(second-to-last
paragraph of subsection “physiological constraints” of our discussion). We agree with the reviewer that
re-use” was bad choice of word on our part. We have reformulated this paragraph now, emphasizing
hat Jowsey was the first to hypothesize a link between osteon and species size as well as that Mishra
nd Knothe Tate were the first to take a scaling approach, as the reviewer rightly suggests.
However, as scientists, we feel obliged to critique previous work as well as acknowledge it. We stand by
ur opinion that we do not think 9 species (7 mammals and two long extinct species) or 13 species can
be seen as a large enough sample size to elucidate scaling trends appropriately (the scaling studies of
whole bone metrics we cite in the manuscript cover 37-79 different species), and that the controlling for
phylogenetic relationships between species has been widely considered essential for comparative
natomy since at least the mid-1980s (see also next comment and our response in this regard),
specially for data from species with such a diverse evolutionary history. Furthermore, using linear
egression for a scaling analysis in the way Mishra and Knothe Tate, 2004, does (especially in a sample
ontaining long extinct species, where the mass cannot be known exactly for sure) is problematic
Warton et al, Biological Reviews, 2006), because linear regression assumes that the values of the
ndependent variable (x-axis) are assumed to be free of error. We therefore feel that this is a fair
ritique of Mishra and Knothe Tate, 2004.
To more clearly structure our acknowledgement of the pioneering work of Jowsey and Mishra and
Knothe Tate as well as our critique of previous studies, we have split these statements into separate
paragraphs.
------------------------------------------
The authors suggest that Mishra and Knothe Tate does not take into account phylogenetic effects which
s incorrect. The authors neglected to refer to another work by Mishra and Knothe Tate (Anatomical
Record 2003 - and noted in the previous review) upon which the 2004 work was based (and cited the
2003 work): Fig. 8, “Schematic diagram describing the proposed evolution of transport networks in
biology” in Mishra and Knothe Tate, Anatomical Record 2003
------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, in this case, we have to strongly disagree with the reviewer. Mishra and Knothe Tate,
2004 (ORS) does not make any statement about phylogeny or evolution, as far as we can tell, apart
rom citing Mishra and Knothe Tate, 2003. Mishra and Knothe Tate, 2003, in turn, proposes that
minimum energy requirements may have led to the evolution of similar fluid transport networks in plant
nd animals. We believe our disagreement with the reviewer is founded in the fact that the reviewer
does not understand what is meant by “taking into account phylogenetic effects”. We have therefore
larified this sentence in our manuscript and we clarify this further in the next paragraph.
Controlling for phylogenetic effects (or “the phylogenetic comparative method”) is a statistical method
hat controls for the non-independence of samples when comparing different species: For example, a
deer and a cow are more closely related (have a more recent common ancestor) than a deer and a tiger,
nd therefore measurements of osteons from a deer, a cow and a tiger cannot be considered to be
tatistically independent variables. Assuming statistical independence can therefore in these cases
distort the result of statistical tests. Phylogenetically independent contrasts (the method we used) is one
way to deal with the fact that cow and deer data points are less independent than cow and tiger data
points. We would like to refer the reviewer to the ground-breaking seminal introduction to the subject
hat we cited in this context since our original submission (Felsenstein, The American Naturalist, 1985).
Controlling for phylogenetic effects is, therefore, in our view, a fairly disjoint concept to the hypothesized
onvergent evolution of fluid transport in plants and animals from Figure 8 in Mishra and Knothe Tate,
Anatomical Record, 2003. We do cite Mishra and Knothe Tate, Anatomical Record, 2003 in our
discussion, in the context of fluid transport to cells.
------------------------------------------
The authors did not take into account other suggestions from the previous review either:
As noted previously, "the authors' language weakens the potential impact of the work".
------------------------------------------
This previous comment was originally directed specifically at the first paragraph of the discussion, as far
s we can tell. There was, in fact, a sentence there that rather clearly was better placed in the
imitations subsection, which we did take into account. We thank the reviewer again for pointing this out
o us. Concerning the rest of this paragraph, we are wary of overstating our results and prefer the data
o speak for itself.
------------------------------------------
The authors also failed to address other means to tie data to mechanobiologically relevant reference
points, e.g. the major and minor centroidal axes suggested by Lieberman et al. and by McBride and
Knothe Tate: 'one way to address this is to bring in another reference point such as major or minor
entroidal axis (see McBride et al. 2011 J Biomechanics, “Major and minor centroidal axes serve as
bjective, automatable reference points to test mechanobiological hypotheses using
histomorphometry”)'. Why not even refer to this as a possible way to address this potential weakness?
------------------------------------------
We thank the reviewer for pointing out the Lieberman et al (2004) is an important reference in this
ontext, which we have now included in our manuscript. We would like to point out that we did
cknowledge this comment in our previous response to the reviewers: in response to the previous round
f reviews, we greatly extended our discussion of how habitual loading patterns may relate to osteon
ize (second part of paragraph 1 in subsection "Limitations" of our manuscript) to highlight the
possibility of mechanobiological effects on osteon size. We make it very clear in the manuscript that, as
we are using a historical museum collection, we have no knowledge of exact anatomical location, and
herefore, no way of knowing anatomical reference points (not even cross-sectional ones such as
entroidal axes, seeing as some of our specimens are fragments of the cortical cross-section), but that
ampling from specimens of known anatomical location is a promising direction of future work.
That being said, even if we did have complete knowledge of specimen location, estimating the load
nvironment “to test mechanobiological hypotheses” is fraught. Lieberman et al (2004) found that the
neutral plane of bending does not lie in the same plane as the principal axes or coincide with the
entroid and that magnitudes of bending load may differ by 55% compared to estimates from geometry.
n other words, neither the direction nor magnitude of a load vector can reliably be deduced from cross-
ectional parameters. Lieberman et al. do state that relative loading patterns (but not absolute values)
an be extrapolated from specimens with strain gauge data to specimens with similar loading conditions
i.e. same species or closely related species with similar locomotor mode). However, strain gauge data
xists for a limited number of species only (mostly sheep), from which the extrapolation to the more
xotic species (e.g. a dugong?) in our sample would be dubious to say the least.
These considerations have led us to conclude that deriving prevalent loading patterns (let alone absolute
alues) from anatomical reference points (if we had them) across all specimens in our study would be a
ather big leap of faith. Again, unfortunately, we do not have any reliable anatomical reference points for
ur data. We therefore do not see how an article relating anatomical to centroidal axes (McBride et al,
2011) warrants a citation in this context, as the reviewer maybe suggests.
------------------------------------------
This reviewer took significant time and effort to read the authors' manuscript and to make suggestions
o further its impact as well to bring science a further step forward. Not heeding or even acknowledging
reviewers' suggestions disregards the investments that others make to bring the field further!
------------------------------------------
We greatly appreciate, of course, the valuable time and effort invested in our manuscript by the
eviewer, as well as their patience, and we did not mean to disregard their comments in any way. We
hope the further efforts invested by us to address their comments in our manuscript and in this
esponse in this round of revision will satisfy them fully.
Appendix D
We would like to extend our thanks to the reviewer for their comments on the latest version of our
manuscript with the title “Secondary osteons scale allometrically in the mammalian humerus and
emur”. We have taken their suggestions on-board, as detailed below. We have also added them to the
cknowledgement section of the current manuscript. All changes undertaken in the latest revision step
re also highlighted in the attached review file.
>The questions dealt with in this manuscript is interesting and relevant, and contributes to basic issues
f bone biology. The manuscript itself is well written and easy to follow, and represents an impressive
mount of work.
We would like to thank the reviewer for appreciating our hard work.
>This study does have several significant limitations. These are derived from the choice of the authors
o base their study on a museum collection. As a result, the study uses samples which often lacked
precise information which would be very relevant to the questions investigated. Such data include
precise knowledge of the sex, age, weight of animal, area in bone from which a particular transverse
ection was obtained and level of activity.
Thank you for this comment. We had acknowledged most of these limitations in our discussion already.
We have, following this suggestion, added exact body weight of specimen and activity level to our list of
nformation that we could unfortunately not obtain given the circumstances (first paragraph of section
4(b) (Limitations)). As we emphasize in our manuscript, we strongly feel that sampling from a large size
ange and different clades was very important to elucidate overall scaling trends with confidence.
Therefore, our choice of using the Quekett collection was a necessary one, given the time and funding
vailable for the project.
>Furthermore, a single sample (from one animal) may bias the results if that particular animal was sick
r deformed or different in any significant way and therefore perhaps does not represent its species.
Thanks for this insightful comment. We now explicitly state this limitation in the penultimate paragraph
f section 4(b) (Limitations).
>I am very aware however of the difficulty to obtain a large number of sample size from each of a large
election of species, with fully known details, and I am sure the authors would have loved to do that if it
were possible. I also believe that with all its limitations, the data obtained here is very useful and
nteresting
We agree with the reviewer that using a museum collection brings some intrinsic limitations with it, and
ndeed, we would have liked to be able to sample from a population that was better characterized.
>I therefore recommend publication of this manuscript, since it will make a significant contribution to
he field of bone biology, and add relevant data to the community of bone researchers. My suggestion is
hat the authors should stress the limitations of the manuscript more thoroughly, although they already
dedicated a large paragraph to some of these.
We would like to thank the reviewer for their positive feedback. Further to the improvements detailed
bove, we took this latest suggestion into consideration by re-emphasizing the limitations of our study in
ur final conclusion (section 4(c)).
