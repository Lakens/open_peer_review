In this manuscript, Huang and co-workers reported the synthesis of high-quality CH3NH3PbX3
(X=Cl, Br, I) bulk crystals and used them to fabricate photodetectors. They found that they all
behave high sensitive and fast-speed response ability to 255 nm deep-UV light.
In my opinion, this manuscript is interesting to the readers of Royal Society Open Science. The
topic is very important in this field. This work is novel and original. The authors have solid
background in this field. Therefore, the referee recommends it to be published after the following
revisions:
1. The manuscript needs to be double check to avoid some typical minor mistakes, such as the
cited journal name is full for reference 8 while others are abbreviations etc.
2. As shown in Figure 2, all the weak peaks are suggested to be indexed and discussed.
3. More relative and recent literatures in this field are suggested to be referred to, just as example
Adv. Funct. Mater. 2018, 28, 1707178; J. Appl. Phys. 2017, 122, 234502; Adv. Funct. Mater. 2017, 27,

221107; J. Mater. Chem. C 2015, 3, 9346-9352 etc.
4. The stability of the photodetectors is suggested to be included, for example 20 cycles is
performed and added to the paper.

This manuscript mainly reports the response of CH3NH3PbX3 (X=Cl,Br,I) bulk crystal based
photodetectors to deep UV light. The data and analysis in the manuscript are comprehensive and
3
the results presented in this work are of novel and general interest for researchers in the field.
Therefore, this manuscript can be published after addressing the below issues.
1. The performance of the oxide UV detectors shown in this manuscript for comparison are quite
low. For better comparison, please use typical oxide UV detectors as references.
2. Please provide the length of the channel of the devices in Figure 3a.
3. The schematic in Figure 3b is misleading. The computer should not be connected with the
device in series, it should be used to control the source-meter and collect data.
4. The Ohmic region in Figure 3 d-f are not obvious might because the number of the test points
in low voltage are not enough. The I-V curves should be better measured in a logarithmic voltage
step.
5. The authors attributed the responsivity decrease under higher power intensity light to the
absorption saturation of perovskite. The explanation is unpersuasive because the light power is
still very low (< 5mW/cm2) compared with AM1.5 (100 mW/cm2) under which absorption
saturation of perovskite cannot be observed.
6. For photoconductive detector, the responsivity (or gain) is determined by the ratio of
photogenerated carrier lifetime to the carrier transit time. A high responsivity always comes with
a long carrier lifetime. The traps in the absorber layer will reduce carrier lifetime and further
reduce the responsivity of the detector. This is incompatible with the authors’ statement that
traps in the photosensitive materials increase the responsivity. Please clarify this.
7. The response time of a photoconductive photodetector is mainly determined by the carrier
lifetime rather than the transit time.

and fast-speed response ability to 255 nm deep-UV light.
In my opinion, this manuscript is interesting to the readers of Royal

work is novel and original. The authors have solid background in this
field. Therefore, the referee recommends it to be published after the
following revisions:
1. The manuscript needs to be double check to avoid some typical
minor mistakes, such as the cited journal name is full for reference 8
while others are abbreviations etc.
Answer:
Thanks very much for reviewer's advice. We have carefully examined
the grammar/typo errors appeared in the primary manuscript and have
corrected them as shown in the highlighted parts in the revised
manuscript.
2. As shown in Figure 2, all the weak peaks are suggested to be
indexed and discussed.
Answer:
We are grateful to the reviewer’s suggestions. In the revised Figure 2 in
our revised manuscript, all the weak peaks are indexed. And we have
added discussions about the indexed weak XRD peaks as shown in the
highlighted parts.
3. More relative and recent literatures in this field are suggested to be
referred to, just as example Adv. Funct. Mater. 2018, 28, 1707178; J.
Appl. Phys. 2017, 122, 234502; Adv. Funct. Mater. 2017, 27, 1700264;

Lett. 2017, 110, 221107; J. Mater. Chem. C 2015, 3, 9346-9352 etc.
Answer:
Thanks very much for the suggestion. We have carefully read the above-
mentioned literatures. After our serious consideration, we think these
studies are closely related to our work and have cited them in our revised
manuscript.
4. The stability of the photodetectors is suggested to be included, for
example 20 cycles is performed and added to the paper.
Answer:
We are grateful for the reviewers’ suggestion. The original data were
collected about 2 years ago. As time goes by, the devices test at that
time have been damaged. Thus, we still use the original data in our
revised manuscript. We feel sorry for this and we hope the reviewer can
agree with us.

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript mainly reports the response of CH3NH3PbX3
(X=Cl,Br,I) bulk crystal based photodetectors to deep UV light. The
data and analysis in the manuscript are comprehensive and the results
presented in this work are of novel and general interest for researchers
in the field. Therefore, this manuscript can be published after addressing
the below issues.
1. The performance of the oxide UV detectors shown in this manuscript
for comparison are quite low. For better comparison, please use typical
oxide UV detectors as references.
Answer:
Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added some typical oxide
UV detectors in the revised tables.
2.Please provide the length of the channel of the devices in Figure 3a.
Answer:
We are grateful for the reviewer’s question. The channel length of the
device has been given in the Figure 3d in the revised manuscript.
3.The schematic in Figure 3b is misleading. The computer should not
be connected with the device in series, it should be used to control the
source-meter and collect data.
Answer:
Thanks for the reviewer’s reminder. The original schematic is indeed
misleading and we have made corrections in the revised manuscript.
4.The Ohmic region in Figure 3 d-f are not obvious might because the
number of the test points in low voltage are not enough. The I-V curves
should be better measured in a logarithmic voltage step.
Answer:
Thanks very much for the reviewer’s suggestion. We have made
sandwich type devices and measured their I-V plots under dark
condition. The results are given in the revised Figure 3a, 3b and 3c. The
corresponding discussion are also changed as shown in the highlighted
part in the revised manuscript.
5. The authors attributed the responsivity decrease under higher power
intensity light to the absorption saturation of perovskite. The
explanation is unpersuasive because the light power is still very low (<
5mW/cm2) compared with AM1.5 (100 mW/cm2) under which
absorption saturation of perovskite cannot be observed.
Answer:
Thanks very much for the reviewer’s question. We think that the trap
states provide the high photoconductive gain under low optical power
irradiation. As the power intensity of the incident light is increased, the
effective traps are filled, leading to a decrease of the photoconductive
gain and thus the responsivity also decreases (Konstantatos, G.etal. Nature
Photonics 2007. 1, 531)).
6.For photoconductive detector, the responsivity (or gain) is determined
by the ratio of photogenerated carrier lifetime to the carrier transit time.
A high responsivity always comes with a long carrier lifetime. The traps
in the absorber layer will reduce carrier lifetime and further reduce the
responsivity of the detector. This is incompatible with the authors’
statement that traps in the photosensitive materials increase the
responsivity. Please clarify this.
Answer:
We are very grateful to the reviewer’s question. We think that the
electron trap states in the absorber layer elongate the carrier lifetime of
the holes and thus leads to the photoconductive gain (Konstantatos, G.etal.
Nature Photonics 2007. 1, 531). Thus, the larger density of trap states in
CH3NH3PbCl3 leads to its larger responsivity.
7.The response time of a photoconductive photodetector is mainly
determined by the carrier lifetime rather than the transit time.
Answer:
We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. The response speed is mainly
decided by the carrier lifetime. We have made corrections in the revised
manuscript.
