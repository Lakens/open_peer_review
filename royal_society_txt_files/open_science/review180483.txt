In this paper, the effect of sepiolite nanofiber on the mechanical and sintering behavior of
shellfish porcelain was studied. The resultant samples were fired at 1150, 1200 and 1250 <U+2103> for 80,
100, 120 and 140 min, respectively, and their structure was characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD
techniques. It was found that the flexural strength and fracture toughness of the porcelain bodies
was improved by adding 2 wt% sepiolite, due to the grain boundary diffusion mechanism caused
by addition of sepiolite. This is an interesting paper with sound results and conclusions. I suggest
this paper for publication after minor revision. The detail comments are listed as follows:
(1) Page 2, Line 4, delete “which is a hydrous magnesium silicate”; Line 21, delete “Raw”.
(2) Are you sure that the channel or tunnels in sepiolite are “fine microporous channels”? I think
“nanoporous channels” are more suitable.
(3) Please also give the mine sites where the sepiolite was taken.
(4) How do you confirm the used minerals are sepiolite? The high MgO content may be due to
the presence of dolomite in raw sepiolite. Please provide more evidences such as XRD to confirm
the sepiolite minerals.
(5) Error bars should be added in Fig. 3.
(6) Please check English language, including punctuation marks. For example, please insert a
pace between the numeral and the unit. The only two exceptions are % and &ordm;C.
(7) The format of the temperature unit in the article should be consistent with the text.
(8) For the third paragraph of the introduction, the use of the word "nano-fibrous" is
inappropriate.

account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:
Appendix A
Dear General Editor and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and the reviewers’ comments on our manuscript entitled
“The sintering kinetics of shellfish porcelain reinforced by sepiolite nano-fibers” (ID:
label_version_2
RSOS-180483). Those comments are very helpful for revising and improving our
paper, as well as the important guiding significance to other research. We have studied
the comments carefully and made corrections which we hope meet with approval. The
main corrections are in the manuscript and the responds to the reviewers’ comments
are as follows.
(1) Page 2, Line 4, delete “which is a hydrous magnesium silicate”; Line 21, delete
“Raw”.
Response:In the corresponding position, we have deleted these words.
(2) Are you sure that the channel or tunnels in sepiolite are “fine microporous
channels”? I think “nanoporous channels” are more suitable.
Response:In the corresponding position(Page 2, Line 5), we have modified the
sentence.(changed “fine microporous channels” into “nanoporous channels”.)
(3) Please also give the mine sites where the sepiolite was taken.
Response:Page 2, Line 24, raw sepiolite used in this study was obtained from
Nanyang City, Henan province, China.
(4) How do you confirm the used minerals are sepiolite? The high MgO content may
be due to the presence of dolomite in raw sepiolite. Please provide more evidences
such as XRD to confirm the sepiolite minerals.
Response:We have modified the original Figure 4 and added the XRD pattern of
sepiolite used in the experiment in the new Figure 4. As can be seen from the figure,
the sepiolite is contaminated with a small amount of calcium carbonate impurities.
And the sentence(Page 3, Line 29)" According to the raw materials we used, the
main crystalline phases without sepiolite nano-fibers at 1250oC are whitlockite
(Ca3(PO4)2) and quartz (SiO2)." analyzed in the figure 4 has been replaced by "
According to the raw materials we used, the sepiolite is contaminated with a small
amount of calcium carbonate(CaCO3) impurities and the main crystalline phases of
the ceramic without sepiolite nano-fibers at 1250oC are whitlockite (Ca3(PO4)2) and
quartz (SiO2)."
(5) Error bars should be added in Fig. 3.
Response:Error bars have been added in Fig. 3.
(6) Please check English language, including punctuation marks. For example, please
insert a pace between the numeral and the unit. The only two exceptions are % and ºC.
Response:In the corresponding position, we have modified English language errors
to make the article looks more clear.
(7) The format of the temperature unit in the article should be consistent with the text.
Response:The format of the temperature unit in the article has been consistent with
the text. (changed“<U+2103>”into “oC”.)
(8) For the third paragraph of the introduction, the use of the word "nano-fibrous" is
inappropriate.
Response:Page 2, Line 8, the word "nano-fibrous" has been changed to "nano-fiber".
In addition, an additional author named Yi Zhang from Hunan Key Laboratory of
Mineral Materials and Application was added to this article because he gave us
assistance in technology and testing methods.
Once again, thank you very much for your constructive comments and suggestions
which would help us both in English and in depth to improve the quality of the paper.
Kind regards.
