Chu et al.
This is an exhaustive manuscript on short timescale variations of a benthic community in a
seasonally hypoxia/anoxic Saanich Inlet. The novelty of this manuscript is the coupling of high
frequency dissolved oxygen measurements (minute intervals) with photographs (0.5-h intervals)
and associated low-frequency amplitude ADCP single beam at 1 m above the bottom as a
surrogate of suspended particles and their composition (the frequency is not identified). The
study lasted 14 months in 2012 and 2013. This is much greater coverage of a series of images in
103 m, also part of the VENUS array, for a 4-day interval in December 2009 with photos at hourly
time periods (Aguzzi et al. 2011).
The temporal mismatch in the data should be adjusted for in the high frequency data, so that the
0.5-h photo corresponds to the same time point that the oxygen data were collected. [If this is
already the case, then the figure legend 1 needs to state this.] Seeing the density of the time series
is interesting, but the correlations are with the same time period or time “stamp.” The high
frequency of the dissolved oxygen data would still be apparent.
The authors describe Saanich Inlet, but also describe many other types of oxygen deficient
environments and puts them all in the category of deoxygenation, a feature of declining oxygen
under climate change. The types of deoxygenation in this manuscript and Saanich Inlet
represents a deep fjord, substantially different from an OMZ, an upwelling area, and a coastal
area where deoxygenation is triggered by excess nutrient inputs. Several other manuscripts
describe deoxygenation from various ocean environments and not all are applicable to Saanich
Inlet. There is poor guidance with regard to a comprehensive summary of deoxygenation.
The manuscript presents a large amount of data related to the photographic documentation of
changes in benthic communities. There are other data, such as section 2.6 of an 11-y data set that
is not relevant to the manuscript. Just because the data have been collected, is not sufficient
reason to include them in this manuscript.
There is over-interpretation and extension of the data.
L213-214, “both were significant in explaining community variation within the time scale.” Just
two categories. This is an unjustified extension with explanation of pooled data.
L217-224, again the calculations and interpretations are an over-extension of the usefulness of
pooled data into two categories.
Abstract
The manuscript concludes that the data (1) explain differences in epibenthic communities by
knowing the sequence of sessile organisms. This is demonstrated by a single set of four
photographs. The remainder is descriptive data based on frames from the time series. This is not
a rigorous analysis. Conclusion (2) is not novel. Conclusion (3) is incorrect. My understanding of
beta diversity, as opposed to alpha diversity, is that alpha is for a specific location and beta is for
a broader geographic coverage. The geographic coverage in this analysis is a single location and
supports the concepts of alpha diversity.

The 2.5 page introduction could provide more case examples from other benthic communities
with seasonal hypoxia and, while not as frequent as 0.5 h do represent a finer scale than seasonal.
These studies should not be ignored. A list given later. In addition, important studies by
Stakovich are not introduced early in the manuscript as a potential example of decline of
bioherms and associated epibenthic communities.
L 50-51 implies a direct influence of atmospheric CO2 deoxygenation. This is not the case. The
CO2 increases in the atmosphere lead to increased air temperature, increased water temperature,
and then a reduction in the oxygen saturation with warming waters, and thus deoxygenation.
Deoxygenation in coastal waters is mainly driven by excess nutrient inputs, eutrophication, and
worsening oxygen conditions, that with climate change may be aggravated (no evidence to date).
L 54-61 The differences on a decadal scale, an annual to seasonal scale and a week to days scale
and a tidal scale are mismatched among several types of marine environments. The variability
also does not include light penetration on a diel cycle that may stimulate photosynthetic activity
in shallower waters.
L 63 Reference [13] would be better as Levin et al. 2009 [62] not cited until later and Middleburg
and Levin 2010 from the same BGS series but not cited. There are several references provided at
the end that could be in the introductory materials or discussion on at least monthly assessment
of benthic communities on a continental shelf, trawlable fish and shrimp on a continental shelf,
and demersal, epibenthic or benthic behavior across a range of dissolved oxygen on a seasonal
continental shelf, from ROV footage coupled with a CTD..
L67-70 more references for at least seasonal hypoxia. See below
L71, misuse of “beta” diversity.
L 75-87, paragraph, could be reduced substantially
Suggestion, use introduction to set stage for a naturally, seasonal hypoxic area (Staanich Inlet),
versus other types of deoxygenation, OMZs intersection with benthic habitats (e.g., sea mounts),
upwelling areas, and human-caused seasonally hypoxic conditions. The differences in benthic
and pelagic communities in the various areas. And what might be suspected based on Saanich
versus the other types of communities. The Levin et al. 2009 reference would be quire helpful.
Otherwise this is an observational study with little more. One of the issues with regard to benthic
fauna in consistently hypoxic benthic environments is that the fauna are less susceptible to
declining dissolved oxygen than benthic communities that were not historically exposed to low
dissolved oxygen, but now are, and thus, not pre-disposed to low oxygen conditions.
L 89, suggest that “0.5-h” intervals is more informative than < 24-h intervals.
L84-100, are standard responses of benthic communities stressed with declining, continual
hypoxia/anoxia, and increasing dissolved oxygen. Are there hypotheses being tested? What will
this study provide more than already recorded in the literature for similar time series?
Materials and Methods – this section is quite long, and could be reduced.
L111, suggest insert “aerobic microbial consumption…..
L112, ref [27] is about deep-water renewal not mid-depth as stated.
L116, ref [19,29] will this manuscript describe its results with those of these references? Possible
differences? Potential reasons?
L135, ref [35,36] not convinced by these references alone how the data in the results for the
components identified in the ADCP beam 1 m above the seabed is what is interpreted. Seems to
4
be a broad category that could be more clearly defined in the results for better interpretation of
the sessile and motile fauna.
L139, the instrumentation package is certainly impressive. Careful not to over-interpret.
L 140-144, not clear if the 96-m and 103-m deployments are considered to be in similar habitats.
Reading the results of the 103-m deployment indicates the same loss of benthic diversity, loss of
the squat lobsters following a migration away from hypoxia. Don’t know if the 96-m deployment
had the same presence/absence/distribution of the Begiattoa mats.
L149, 0.5-h, this way all measurements are in the same time measurements. Was described as at
least < 24 h earlier in manuscript.
L151, gappy data versus continuous data? Yes, 85% coverage is good.
L169 verified as zooplankton? Was any ground truth of water samples taken at the 1 m above the
bottom depth.
L172-174, what where the groundtruth data that allowed for identification of different types of
zooplankton and the other identified groups of living or non-living characteristics. If a [ref] was
given and I missed it, I apologize. Might want to repeat in this section.
L178, should insert the preferred units ml/L and all of its various calculations at the end of the
first sentence. However, see kPa in Table 2.
L201-202, a calculation for beta diversity was chosen, not necessarily justified. The definition of
beta diversity I am accustomed to do has to do with a broader spatial variability than a point
photograph. I think the use of a beta diversity is an invalid extension of the species richness,
especially when the categorization is limited to mobile, sessile (of several unidentified categories
other than a list provided), and the data are presented as no. individuals/m2 for sessile, motile,
and total individuals.
L213-214, “both were significant in explaining community variation within the time scale.” Just
two categories. This is an unjustified extension with explanation of pooled data.
L217-224, again the calculations and interpretations are an over-extension of the usefulness of
pooled data into two categories.
P12, then pseudo time points were used to insert non-existent data into an ordination plot. Shows
appropriate knowledge of appropriate data analysis with a denser data set, but the use is not
justified on the limited pooled data.
**I think I could have told you at this point in the data methods, that the motile and sessile
organism would be separated on the first axis. And, yes they are two points (the two motile
organisms identified) to one side of the centrum and all the others to the other side.
Pg14-15, this analysis is not necessary or relevant to the focus of the paper, a tight time sequence
of one location. Same for section 3.6.
[55] indicates the oxygen threshold is too conservative, so there is a correction for occurrence of
the motile species. The data in the time series, so technical and I am supposing accurate and
precise, should be the data analyzed and interpreted in this manuscript and not data from a
different time series.
L361-362, this should not be considered new to the literature.
P16-23, for Results, much too long, as methods) for the data collected and reduced.
Section DISCUSSION
This section repeats several misrepresentations of benthic community temporal variation under
seasonal hypoxia from the introduction.
L625-626 the interpretation of the data do not justify the statement made about a regime shift.

Your manuscript is well done and a good contribution to hypoxic literature. This type of in situ
study is very informative. You have made very good use of VENUS data.
Statistical methods are a bit dense for me and maybe more than you needed, but your discussion
is clear.
You might consider adding more detail to the abstract relative to your conclusions.
Also, there are inconsistencies in the literature cited. Sometimes you use et al. and sometimes
you spell out the author names, even when there are the same number of authors.

Comments to the Author:
This data-heavy manuscript was read by two experts and myself. During pre-assessment, I had a
difficult time understanding what specifically was done to analyze this large, somewhat
complex/uneven dataset. Clearly, both expert reviewers were also quite ambiguous about the
analyses. Although one reviewer was quite enthusiastic about the conclusions drawn, which I
agree are worthy, provided the analyses do indeed rigorously support them, the more critical
reviewer raises several pivotal issues. I agree with these comments, and believe they are fair and
constructive. There are some insurmountable shortcomings that a revision will not be able to
adequately address. As such, I am afraid I have to recommend a rejection. With much gratitude
to both reviewers, I wish the authors all the best in incorporating these comments and submitting
to a more discipline-specific journal.

Comments to the Author:
This data-heavy manuscript was read by two experts and myself. During pre-assessment, I had a
difficult time understanding what specifically was done to analyze this large, somewhat
complex/uneven dataset. Clearly, both expert reviewers were also quite ambiguous about the
analyses. Although one reviewer was quite enthusiastic about the conclusions drawn, which I
agree are worthy, provided the analyses do indeed rigorously support them, the more critical
reviewer raises several pivotal issues. I agree with these comments, and believe they are fair and
constructive. There are some insurmountable shortcomings that a revision will not be able to
adequately address. As such, I am afraid I have to recommend a rejection. With much gratitude
to both reviewers, I wish the authors all the best in incorporating these comments and submitting
to a more discipline-specific journal.

Chu et al.
This is an exhaustive manuscript on short timescale variations of a benthic community in a
seasonally hypoxia/anoxic Saanich Inlet. The novelty of this manuscript is the coupling of high
frequency dissolved oxygen measurements (minute intervals) with photographs (0.5-h intervals)
and associated low-frequency amplitude ADCP single beam at 1 m above the bottom as a
surrogate of suspended particles and their composition (the frequency is not identified). The
study lasted 14 months in 2012 and 2013. This is much greater coverage of a series of images in
103 m, also part of the VENUS array, for a 4-day interval in December 2009 with photos at hourly
time periods (Aguzzi et al. 2011).
The temporal mismatch in the data should be adjusted for in the high frequency data, so that the
0.5-h photo corresponds to the same time point that the oxygen data were collected. [If this is
already the case, then the figure legend 1 needs to state this.] Seeing the density of the time series
13
is interesting, but the correlations are with the same time period or time “stamp.” The high
frequency of the dissolved oxygen data would still be apparent.
The authors describe Saanich Inlet, but also describe many other types of oxygen deficient
environments and puts them all in the category of deoxygenation, a feature of declining oxygen
under climate change. The types of deoxygenation in this manuscript and Saanich Inlet
represents a deep fjord, substantially different from an OMZ, an upwelling area, and a coastal
area where deoxygenation is triggered by excess nutrient inputs. Several other manuscripts
describe deoxygenation from various ocean environments and not all are applicable to Saanich
Inlet. There is poor guidance with regard to a comprehensive summary of deoxygenation.
The manuscript presents a large amount of data related to the photographic documentation of
changes in benthic communities. There are other data, such as section 2.6 of an 11-y data set that
is not relevant to the manuscript. Just because the data have been collected, is not sufficient
reason to include them in this manuscript.
There is over-interpretation and extension of the data.
L213-214, “both were significant in explaining community variation within the time scale.” Just
two categories. This is an unjustified extension with explanation of pooled data.
L217-224, again the calculations and interpretations are an over-extension of the usefulness of
pooled data into two categories.
Abstract
The manuscript concludes that the data (1) explain differences in epibenthic communities by
knowing the sequence of sessile organisms. This is demonstrated by a single set of four
photographs. The remainder is descriptive data based on frames from the time series. This is not
a rigorous analysis. Conclusion (2) is not novel. Conclusion (3) is incorrect. My understanding of
beta diversity, as opposed to alpha diversity, is that alpha is for a specific location and beta is for
a broader geographic coverage. The geographic coverage in this analysis is a single location and
supports the concepts of alpha diversity.
The 2.5 page introduction could provide more case examples from other benthic communities
with seasonal hypoxia and, while not as frequent as 0.5 h do represent a finer scale than seasonal.
These studies should not be ignored. A list given later. In addition, important studies by
Stakovich are not introduced early in the manuscript as a potential example of decline of
bioherms and associated epibenthic communities.
L 50-51 implies a direct influence of atmospheric CO2 deoxygenation. This is not the case. The
CO2 increases in the atmosphere lead to increased air temperature, increased water temperature,
and then a reduction in the oxygen saturation with warming waters, and thus deoxygenation.
Deoxygenation in coastal waters is mainly driven by excess nutrient inputs, eutrophication, and
worsening oxygen conditions, that with climate change may be aggravated (no evidence to date).
L 54-61 The differences on a decadal scale, an annual to seasonal scale and a week to days scale
and a tidal scale are mismatched among several types of marine environments. The variability
also does not include light penetration on a diel cycle that may stimulate photosynthetic activity
in shallower waters.
L 63 Reference [13] would be better as Levin et al. 2009 [62] not cited until later and Middleburg
and Levin 2010 from the same BGS series but not cited. There are several references provided at
the end that could be in the introductory materials or discussion on at least monthly assessment
of benthic communities on a continental shelf, trawlable fish and shrimp on a continental shelf,
14
and demersal, epibenthic or benthic behavior across a range of dissolved oxygen on a seasonal
continental shelf, from ROV footage coupled with a CTD..
L67-70 more references for at least seasonal hypoxia. See below
L71, misuse of “beta” diversity.
L 75-87, paragraph, could be reduced substantially
Suggestion, use introduction to set stage for a naturally, seasonal hypoxic area (Staanich Inlet),
versus other types of deoxygenation, OMZs intersection with benthic habitats (e.g., sea mounts),
upwelling areas, and human-caused seasonally hypoxic conditions. The differences in benthic
and pelagic communities in the various areas. And what might be suspected based on Saanich
versus the other types of communities. The Levin et al. 2009 reference would be quire helpful.
Otherwise this is an observational study with little more. One of the issues with regard to benthic
fauna in consistently hypoxic benthic environments is that the fauna are less susceptible to
declining dissolved oxygen than benthic communities that were not historically exposed to low
dissolved oxygen, but now are, and thus, not pre-disposed to low oxygen conditions.
L 89, suggest that “0.5-h” intervals is more informative than < 24-h intervals.
L84-100, are standard responses of benthic communities stressed with declining, continual
hypoxia/anoxia, and increasing dissolved oxygen. Are there hypotheses being tested? What will
this study provide more than already recorded in the literature for similar time series?
Materials and Methods – this section is quite long, and could be reduced.
L111, suggest insert “aerobic microbial consumption…..
L112, ref [27] is about deep-water renewal not mid-depth as stated.
L116, ref [19,29] will this manuscript describe its results with those of these references? Possible
differences? Potential reasons?
L135, ref [35,36] not convinced by these references alone how the data in the results for the
components identified in the ADCP beam 1 m above the seabed is what is interpreted. Seems to
be a broad category that could be more clearly defined in the results for better interpretation of
the sessile and motile fauna.
L139, the instrumentation package is certainly impressive. Careful not to over-interpret.
L 140-144, not clear if the 96-m and 103-m deployments are considered to be in similar habitats.
Reading the results of the 103-m deployment indicates the same loss of benthic diversity, loss of
the squat lobsters following a migration away from hypoxia. Don’t know if the 96-m deployment
had the same presence/absence/distribution of the Begiattoa mats.
L149, 0.5-h, this way all measurements are in the same time measurements. Was described as at
least < 24 h earlier in manuscript.
L151, gappy data versus continuous data? Yes, 85% coverage is good.
L169 verified as zooplankton? Was any ground truth of water samples taken at the 1 m above the
bottom depth.
L172-174, what where the groundtruth data that allowed for identification of different types of
zooplankton and the other identified groups of living or non-living characteristics. If a [ref] was
given and I missed it, I apologize. Might want to repeat in this section.
L178, should insert the preferred units ml/L and all of its various calculations at the end of the
first sentence. However, see kPa in Table 2.
L201-202, a calculation for beta diversity was chosen, not necessarily justified. The definition of
beta diversity I am accustomed to do has to do with a broader spatial variability than a point
photograph. I think the use of a beta diversity is an invalid extension of the species richness,
15
especially when the categorization is limited to mobile, sessile (of several unidentified categories
other than a list provided), and the data are presented as no. individuals/m2 for sessile, motile,
and total individuals.
L213-214, “both were significant in explaining community variation within the time scale.” Just
two categories. This is an unjustified extension with explanation of pooled data.
L217-224, again the calculations and interpretations are an over-extension of the usefulness of
pooled data into two categories.
P12, then pseudo time points were used to insert non-existent data into an ordination plot. Shows
appropriate knowledge of appropriate data analysis with a denser data set, but the use is not
justified on the limited pooled data.
**I think I could have told you at this point in the data methods, that the motile and sessile
organism would be separated on the first axis. And, yes they are two points (the two motile
organisms identified) to one side of the centrum and all the others to the other side.
Pg14-15, this analysis is not necessary or relevant to the focus of the paper, a tight time sequence
of one location. Same for section 3.6.
[55] indicates the oxygen threshold is too conservative, so there is a correction for occurrence of
the motile species. The data in the time series, so technical and I am supposing accurate and
precise, should be the data analyzed and interpreted in this manuscript and not data from a
different time series.
L361-362, this should not be considered new to the literature.
P16-23, for Results, much too long, as methods) for the data collected and reduced.
Section DISCUSSION
This section repeats several misrepresentations of benthic community temporal variation under
seasonal hypoxia from the introduction.
L625-626 the interpretation of the data do not justify the statement made about a regime shift.
FIGURES are appropriate, although many are quite small.
Several of the references below provide benthic infauna data under varying conditions of
hypoxia, and some on a monthly basis. Others are on many types of organisms and their
behavior on becoming stressed with decreasing dissolved oxygen values.

Review of the paper ‘Drivers of temporal beta diversity of a benthic community in a seasonally
hypoxic ocean basin’ by Chu et al.
This paper presents an important high resolution dataset, thoroughly analysed, and addressing
one of the major issues in our ocean, the loss of oxygen. This dataset is highly valuable, since such
18
long-term high resolution dataset are scarce at this depth, and should be published. The authors
also used interesting, relevant and novel statistical analyses, thus exploring further the scales of
environmental and biological variability and the links among the different components of the
ecosystem. The beta diversity approach is really powerful to assess shift in community
composition as a result of environmental change, and it is really nice to see it applied to deep
observatory data. Data and results constitute a significant advancement in our comprehension of
the potential impacts of climate change on marine communities, especially in this region of the
world where higher levels of hypoxia are recorded. Even though I’m not a native English
speaker, I believe it is really well written and I really enjoyed reading it. I recommend the
publication of this important paper after addressing few little comments detailed below, that I
hope will help improve the manuscript.
Title: When I read the title I thought there would be results from the Pacific Ocean. I don’t believe
we can qualify a fjord as an ocean basin; I would thus modify the title to ‘fjord’. I understand the
authors ‘extrapolate’ these results to the Northeast Pacific, which I believe is valid and justified,
but the title is misleading.
Materials and methods:
- L163: ‘If both images from a position were missing, both images from the other pan
position were analyzed.’ I’m wondering how this can affect the results. You are pooling counts
from both images so you are basically counting each individual twice in the picture? Then by
standardizing you obtain what you would have obtained by counting only one of them. So I am
not sure I understand the logic, or maybe I mis-understand how this was done. Also, how
different the image was between the two positions? Wouldn’t this affect results for the sessile
species?
- L179: If I understand 2.7 m² is the area of both images pooled. How did you calculate
when two images in the same position were used?
- L194-195: what range of data did you use for water column data? Before/after the
image? An hour/six hours?
- There is no mention on the processing of the ADCP data for back scatter
- L202 and following paragraph: Legendre and Decaceres, 2013 advise to perform the
Hellinger transformation prior to beta diversity analyses, and especially for SCBDs. This
transformation is also recommended for canonical redundancy. Were the data transformed prior
to LCBD/SCBD computing? Why is the data transformed in log(x+1)? Why not use Hellinger like
it was done for the dbMEMs? I would recommend do conduct all multivariate analyses with the
Hellinger transformation, unless the authors have a good reason not to.
- L232: a coma or period missing before ‘significant linear trend’?
- L235: ref [42] – I believe it is not the good reference
- L244: ‘these submodels explained variation at scales of 8 months (duration of the second
deployment period) to 24 hours’ – a variation of 8 month would represent a trend on the 8 month
time-series. If such a trend exist you should remove prior to dbMEM analysis as this analysis
won’t allow to resolve the scale of the associated variation (could be larger than 8 months)
- L246 : specify the adjR² value for the negative dbMEMs
- L247-248: I am not sure I understand how the contribution of the environmental
variables to the difference time scales was computed. ‘Regression of the biological response data
[…] for each submodel’: the regression should be applied to the fitted species values generated by
the RDA performed between species response data and the dbMEMs of each defined sub-model.
However after reading through the reviewers comments of an earlier version, I understand you
simplified and shortened this, but I think it could be better explained in the supplemental
material; then I guess the reader could refer to the original publication. Please also refer to the
supplementary material to explain the sub-models (the mention of the supplemental material
comes too late in the text).
- The supplementary material helps a lot to better understand what was done. However,
19
to my opinion one aspect that should be quickly mentioned in the main text is the addition of
supplementary points in time by referring to the supplemental material then. Again I understand
this was shortened to address the reviewers’ comment but it seems important enough to be
briefly mentioned in the main text.
Results
Video: I was a bit disappointed to not have the images of the flatfish period when the sessile
species disappeared (d in Figure 2)… but that is just personal curiosity and enjoyment.
L325-326: during the mass migration of squat lobsters in May 2012 (that affect the LCBD value)
there is an associated decrease in sessile species (figure 4) that you did not comment. Is it possible
that you saw less species because of the high amount of squat lobsters? Or is it a real decrease?
L341-342: why ‘hypoxia community’? the area is not hypoxic all year round (which makes this
timeseries so valuable!) , ‘local community’ seems more appropriate.
L373: again scale of 14 months, this just means there is a general trend in the data set, and you
should be cautious in attributing it to a 14 months scale (could be a segment of a longer trend).
You should make sure to remove the trend in the data before doing the analyses. If this trend
exists, the dbMEM analysis should be conducted on the residuals. But also see my comment
below
L379-382: what are the temporal scales of the three sub-models? You can define them looking at
the dbMEMs themselves or by running a periodogram analyses on each submodel. I feel
something is lacking here, it left me a bit frustrated : broad, medium, small is not enough.
L414 Variance partitioning and figure 5: doesn’t add up for the community response, all three
explanatory variables add up to 75% and residual should 25%.
L430-431. I believe this belongs more to the discussion, and it is an important point. The role of
tidal signal is super-imposed on the other scales of variability, and this observation supports one
of the authors’ conclusions that ‘accounting for small scale variability is important when
explaining compositional heterogeneity’. This highlights the need of such time-series and might
have been worth mentioning again in the discussion. Just a suggestion.

here to add the corresponding temporal scale of each sub-model.
Fig. 2 In the legend ‘beta diversity increased in near-anoxia’, change to ‘Local contribution to Beta
diversity increased’ or ‘high values of LCBDs’. LCBDs are indices used to decompose beta
diversity, but beta diversity itself is just a rate and has no unit and is represented here as the total
community composition variance as you explained it. I don’t think it appropriate to interchange
LCBD and Beta-diversity. I believe this might have misled reviewer 1.

Review regarding the ms ”Drivers of temporal beta diversity of a benthic community in a
seasonally hypoxic ocean basin” by Chu et al.
This ms is based on a unique temporal data set (14-month) regarding epibenthic community
responses to fluctuations in bottom water oxygen concentrations. The authors have – in simplistic
terms - deployed a camera, an oxygen sensor and an acoustic backscatter at the seafloor (96 m
depth), to gain high-frequency temporal in situ data in an area susceptible of low-oxygen
conditions. Through image processing and advanced statistical methods they assess 1) temporal
change in diversity (H’ and J) as well as beta diversity of the (epi)benthic community, 2) the
relative contribution of environmental drivers versus temporal autocorrelation (variation
explained by, for example, biological processes) in explaining temporal pattern in total
community composition and in the two dominant species (flatfish and lobster). Furthermore, they
have examined the long-term trend in hypoxia in the study area, the Saanich Inlet.
I appreciate the effort the authors have made in analyzing this large amount of data, and also
their ability to quite comprehensively explain the results. The authors show that responses to
hypoxia differ at the community and species level, that small-scale variability is important and
that the recovery pattern from hypoxic stress show hysteresis. In this specific context, both the
hypoxic stress and biological processes influence benthic community patterns.
I find this ms interesting, the approach quite novel and the stats complex. I think this paper
should be published as it is an valuable addition to the “hypoxia literature”. The authors should
make clear, already in the abstract, that they explore quite a unique ecosystem where hypoxia has
been an evolutionary pressure.
I have some minor comments that I hope will help to clarify things for the readers;
Abstract
p2, l. 34; hysteresis in recovery, not in decline.
Introduction
p.3, l50-61 “biased towards the Atlantic Ocean” – why the Atlantic? There is oxygen deficiency in
waters elsewhere too. Your system seems very different from other regions suffering from
periodic or seasonal oxygen deficiency – you make it quite clear here in the intro, but try to stress
it even further (you could copy your explanation to rev. 1 about hypoxia as an evolutionary
pressure?)
21
p3, l. 58-60 I do not understand this argument – if biodiversity in NEP has developed during low
oxic/hypoxic regimes, the species here would probably be more tolerant against hypoxia than in
places where oxygen deficiency has historically not been an issue? think about the use of the
word “conservative”
p3-4, l70-71. Hypoxia gradients also change in time on various scales:…… and even daily (25).
However, measures of beta diversity ….
(For further refs on b-diversity see: Hewitt et al. 2016. Species and functional trait turnover in
response to broad-scale change and an invasive species. Ecosphere 7, and references therein.)
p4, l75-77 How do you mean here? relative influence of rapid habitat change and community
response on shorter time-scales – that I get, but how are they a result of long-term
deoxygenation?
p4, l80 year to ?
p5 l107 highly variable habitats? How do you mean? Did you not pool the community counts
from the two images (covering a single habitat?) and calculated ind. m-2? It is important that you
clarify this.
Material & methods
p 11, l. 237-240 Please explain here (not only in appendix) what the positive vs negative
temporal correlation actually means / represents in this case. Chapter 2.5 is not easy to follow,
although supplementary details are available.
Results
p15, l. 300 during what?
p 15 l 296-313 – could you see which species were alive or dead from the video photage?
p 15, l. 318-322. This is quite interesting – because the obvious “expectation” would be that H’
and J’ would decrease in response to the onset of severe hypoxia. Especially if there is 5 months
of more or less hypoxic / anoxic conditions! It is clear that the elevated values are due to
emerging infauna, but still I would expect a total azoic seafloor. I think it would be useful to add
comparisons of the hypoxic tolerance of epibenthic species in other systems in the discussion?
Discussion
p 22, l. 467 I do not follow the habitat comparison? What do you mean? It is not a habitat
comparison when you explore a temporal pattern in community composition. The habitat
remains, but the environmental drivers might change.
p 23, l 503-505. I do not understand what you mean?
p 26, l. 568 Episodic or seasonal hypoxia occurs in estuaries…..
p 27, l. 578 see Villnäs et al. The role of recurrent disturbances for ecosystem multifunctionality,
Ecology 94 (10), 2275-2287.
Table 1
– define the periods according to Fig 4, what is deoxygenation and reoxygenation?
- be clear in the table title that you are talking about rates.

Review of the paper ‘Drivers of temporal beta diversity of a benthic community in a seasonally
hypoxic ocean basin’ by Chu et al.
This paper presents an important high resolution dataset, thoroughly analysed, and addressing
one of the major issues in our ocean, the loss of oxygen. This dataset is highly valuable, since such
long-term high resolution dataset are scarce at this depth, and should be published. The authors
also used interesting, relevant and novel statistical analyses, thus exploring further the scales of
environmental and biological variability and the links among the different components of the
ecosystem. The beta diversity approach is really powerful to assess shift in community
composition as a result of environmental change, and it is really nice to see it applied to deep
observatory data. Data and results constitute a significant advancement in our comprehension of
the potential impacts of climate change on marine communities, especially in this region of the
world where higher levels of hypoxia are recorded. Even though I’m not a native English
speaker, I believe it is really well written and I really enjoyed reading it. I recommend the
25
publication of this important paper after addressing few little comments detailed below, that I
hope will help improve the manuscript.
Title: When I read the title I thought there would be results from the Pacific Ocean. I don’t believe
we can qualify a fjord as an ocean basin; I would thus modify the title to ‘fjord’. I understand the
authors ‘extrapolate’ these results to the Northeast Pacific, which I believe is valid and justified,
but the title is misleading.
Materials and methods:
- L163: ‘If both images from a position were missing, both images from the other pan
position were analyzed.’ I’m wondering how this can affect the results. You are pooling counts
from both images so you are basically counting each individual twice in the picture? Then by
standardizing you obtain what you would have obtained by counting only one of them. So I am
not sure I understand the logic, or maybe I mis-understand how this was done. Also, how
different the image was between the two positions? Wouldn’t this affect results for the sessile
species?
- L179: If I understand 2.7 m² is the area of both images pooled. How did you calculate
when two images in the same position were used?
- L194-195: what range of data did you use for water column data? Before/after the
image? An hour/six hours?
- There is no mention on the processing of the ADCP data for back scatter
- L202 and following paragraph: Legendre and Decaceres, 2013 advise to perform the
Hellinger transformation prior to beta diversity analyses, and especially for SCBDs. This
transformation is also recommended for canonical redundancy. Were the data transformed prior
to LCBD/SCBD computing? Why is the data transformed in log(x+1)? Why not use Hellinger like
it was done for the dbMEMs? I would recommend do conduct all multivariate analyses with the
Hellinger transformation, unless the authors have a good reason not to.
- L232: a coma or period missing before ‘significant linear trend’?
- L235: ref [42] – I believe it is not the good reference
- L244: ‘these submodels explained variation at scales of 8 months (duration of the second
deployment period) to 24 hours’ – a variation of 8 month would represent a trend on the 8 month
time-series. If such a trend exist you should remove prior to dbMEM analysis as this analysis
won’t allow to resolve the scale of the associated variation (could be larger than 8 months)
- L246 : specify the adjR² value for the negative dbMEMs
- L247-248: I am not sure I understand how the contribution of the environmental
variables to the difference time scales was computed. ‘Regression of the biological response data
[…] for each submodel’: the regression should be applied to the fitted species values generated by
the RDA performed between species response data and the dbMEMs of each defined sub-model.
However after reading through the reviewers comments of an earlier version, I understand you
simplified and shortened this, but I think it could be better explained in the supplemental
material; then I guess the reader could refer to the original publication. Please also refer to the
supplementary material to explain the sub-models (the mention of the supplemental material
comes too late in the text).
- The supplementary material helps a lot to better understand what was done. However,
to my opinion one aspect that should be quickly mentioned in the main text is the addition of
supplementary points in time by referring to the supplemental material then. Again I understand
this was shortened to address the reviewers’ comment but it seems important enough to be
briefly mentioned in the main text.
Results
Video: I was a bit disappointed to not have the images of the flatfish period when the sessile
species disappeared (d in Figure 2)… but that is just personal curiosity and enjoyment.
26
L325-326: during the mass migration of squat lobsters in May 2012 (that affect the LCBD value)
there is an associated decrease in sessile species (figure 4) that you did not comment. Is it possible
that you saw less species because of the high amount of squat lobsters? Or is it a real decrease?
L341-342: why ‘hypoxia community’? the area is not hypoxic all year round (which makes this
timeseries so valuable!) , ‘local community’ seems more appropriate.
L373: again scale of 14 months, this just means there is a general trend in the data set, and you
should be cautious in attributing it to a 14 months scale (could be a segment of a longer trend).
You should make sure to remove the trend in the data before doing the analyses. If this trend
exists, the dbMEM analysis should be conducted on the residuals. But also see my comment
below
L379-382: what are the temporal scales of the three sub-models? You can define them looking at
the dbMEMs themselves or by running a periodogram analyses on each submodel. I feel
something is lacking here, it left me a bit frustrated : broad, medium, small is not enough.
L414 Variance partitioning and figure 5: doesn’t add up for the community response, all three
explanatory variables add up to 75% and residual should 25%.
L430-431. I believe this belongs more to the discussion, and it is an important point. The role of
tidal signal is super-imposed on the other scales of variability, and this observation supports one
of the authors’ conclusions that ‘accounting for small scale variability is important when
explaining compositional heterogeneity’. This highlights the need of such time-series and might
have been worth mentioning again in the discussion. Just a suggestion.

Legends: Add Saanich Inlet, British Columbia, Canada in all the legends

dbMEMs? Please specify in the legend. Also explain the R² in the legend. It would also be nice
here to add the corresponding temporal scale of each sub-model.
Fig. 2 In the legend ‘beta diversity increased in near-anoxia’, change to ‘Local contribution to Beta
diversity increased’ or ‘high values of LCBDs’. LCBDs are indices used to decompose beta
diversity, but beta diversity itself is just a rate and has no unit and is represented here as the total
community composition variance as you explained it. I don’t think it appropriate to interchange
LCBD and Beta-diversity. I believe this might have misled reviewer 1.

Comments to the Author(s)
Review regarding the ms ”Drivers of temporal beta diversity of a benthic community in a
seasonally hypoxic ocean basin” by Chu et al.
This ms is based on a unique temporal data set (14-month) regarding epibenthic community
responses to fluctuations in bottom water oxygen concentrations. The authors have – in simplistic
terms - deployed a camera, an oxygen sensor and an acoustic backscatter at the seafloor (96 m
depth), to gain high-frequency temporal in situ data in an area susceptible of low-oxygen
conditions. Through image processing and advanced statistical methods they assess 1) temporal
change in diversity (H’ and J) as well as beta diversity of the (epi)benthic community, 2) the
relative contribution of environmental drivers versus temporal autocorrelation (variation
explained by, for example, biological processes) in explaining temporal pattern in total
27
community composition and in the two dominant species (flatfish and lobster). Furthermore, they
have examined the long-term trend in hypoxia in the study area, the Saanich Inlet.
I appreciate the effort the authors have made in analyzing this large amount of data, and also
their ability to quite comprehensively explain the results. The authors show that responses to
hypoxia differ at the community and species level, that small-scale variability is important and
that the recovery pattern from hypoxic stress show hysteresis. In this specific context, both the
hypoxic stress and biological processes influence benthic community patterns.
I find this ms interesting, the approach quite novel and the stats complex. I think this paper
should be published as it is an valuable addition to the “hypoxia literature”. The authors should
make clear, already in the abstract, that they explore quite a unique ecosystem where hypoxia has
been an evolutionary pressure.
I have some minor comments that I hope will help to clarify things for the readers;
Abstract
p2, l. 34; hysteresis in recovery, not in decline.
Introduction
p.3, l50-61 “biased towards the Atlantic Ocean” – why the Atlantic? There is oxygen deficiency in
waters elsewhere too. Your system seems very different from other regions suffering from
periodic or seasonal oxygen deficiency – you make it quite clear here in the intro, but try to stress
it even further (you could copy your explanation to rev. 1 about hypoxia as an evolutionary
pressure?)
p3, l. 58-60 I do not understand this argument – if biodiversity in NEP has developed during low
oxic/hypoxic regimes, the species here would probably be more tolerant against hypoxia than in
places where oxygen deficiency has historically not been an issue? think about the use of the
word “conservative”
p3-4, l70-71. Hypoxia gradients also change in time on various scales:…… and even daily (25).
However, measures of beta diversity ….
(For further refs on b-diversity see: Hewitt et al. 2016. Species and functional trait turnover in
response to broad-scale change and an invasive species. Ecosphere 7, and references therein.)
p4, l75-77 How do you mean here? relative influence of rapid habitat change and community
response on shorter time-scales – that I get, but how are they a result of long-term
deoxygenation?
p4, l80 year to ?
p5 l107 highly variable habitats? How do you mean? Did you not pool the community counts
from the two images (covering a single habitat?) and calculated ind. m-2? It is important that you
clarify this.
Material & methods
p 11, l. 237-240 Please explain here (not only in appendix) what the positive vs negative
temporal correlation actually means / represents in this case. Chapter 2.5 is not easy to follow,
although supplementary details are available.
Results
p15, l. 300 during what?
p 15 l 296-313 – could you see which species were alive or dead from the video photage?
p 15, l. 318-322. This is quite interesting – because the obvious “expectation” would be that H’
and J’ would decrease in response to the onset of severe hypoxia. Especially if there is 5 months
of more or less hypoxic / anoxic conditions! It is clear that the elevated values are due to
emerging infauna, but still I would expect a total azoic seafloor. I think it would be useful to add
comparisons of the hypoxic tolerance of epibenthic species in other systems in the discussion?
28
Discussion
p 22, l. 467 I do not follow the habitat comparison? What do you mean? It is not a habitat
comparison when you explore a temporal pattern in community composition. The habitat
remains, but the environmental drivers might change.
p 23, l 503-505. I do not understand what you mean?
p 26, l. 568 Episodic or seasonal hypoxia occurs in estuaries…..
p 27, l. 578 see Villnäs et al. The role of recurrent disturbances for ecosystem multifunctionality,
Ecology 94 (10), 2275-2287.
Table 1
– define the periods according to Fig 4, what is deoxygenation and reoxygenation?
- be clear in the table title that you are talking about rates.

Appendix A
First, thank you so much for taking the time to review our manuscript. We are at fault for the
lack of clarity and the over emphasis on the complicated analysis and completely understand
the rejection. However, we wanted to point out that there two major points of criticism by
Reviewer #1 that deserve a clarification because they were used to invalidate our approach.
First, the Reviewer incorrectly invalidated our beta diversity analysis with their own loose
definition of 'broader spatial coverage' which is actually one for gamma diversity. Beta
diversity is simply the difference in species composition among samples (compositional
heterogeneity) and alpha diversity is the species richness index within a sample. Temporal
beta diversity studies are relatively new (most focus on spatial sampling designs), but the
methods were developed by others for this purpose (Pierre Legendre, who we cite) and were
valid in their use.
The second criticism suggested 'we inappropriately overinterpreted and extended our analysis
with data pooled into two categories (sessile & mobile)" when this was also not the case. We
used unpooled, individual species counts of 42 species in the community ordination analysis -
the standard practice. The reviewer may focused on the figures which is where the 'pooling
into mobile and sessile species' was done for visual clarity (instead of plotting 42 species in
one figure) - we did state this in the methods but were at fault for not indicating this in the
figure legend.
Your time and feedback was very much appreciated

appreciate the opportunity to present a revision of our manuscript, and the time invested by
reviewers and associate editor. To assist the re-assessment process, we have divided this
ponse in three parts:
A commentary on the key negative criticisms from Reviewer 1 that we believe should be
set aside as incorrect or misunderstandings; however, some clarifying changes that we
made are indicated.
Responses to the valid/useful criticisms from all three readers.
Additional comments to Reviewer 1 comments that extend from his/her primary position;
we offer no manuscript changes in response here.
As a response to the issue of dense methods, we have shifted the extraneous details to a
pplementary methods section. This has reduced the methods word count by ~30%.
Reviewer 1’s Severe criticisms
1.1. Low oxygen in Saanich Inlet is “different” from other ocean environments. Our paper
neither studies, nor equates, mechanisms. Yes, many processes cause deoxygenation, but
the ecosystem affected does not care about cause. We focus on the community responses
to the oxygen problem; our introduction is meant to highlight a range of worldwide
causes. The study fjord has a natural seasonal cycle – forced by the same offshore
conditions that affect the Oxygen Minimum Zone in the northeast Pacific. Similar
seasonal expansion/contraction do affect OMZ zones1 thus Saanich is, indeed, a good
study system especially given recent conditions2.
We revise to make this point clearer [Lines 78-90].
1.2. In terms of comparability and transferability of our results to other hypoxic systems,
Saanich Inlet has a long Holocene record of naturally occurring hypoxia3. Thus some of
the species and their response reflect biota that have adapted to chronic hypoxia

exposure (e.g. such as the sessile invertebrate community)4. This has always been one of
the major advantages of using Saanich Inlet as a tractable and accessible ‘natural
laboratory’ that reflects processes characterizing the OMZ setting5.
1.3. There is not a lot of novelty in the study as we have missed past studies. AND
“There is poor guidance with regard to a comprehensive summary of deoxygenation.”
1.3.1. Ironically, the reviewer underscores our point that the NE Pacific is different:
historic research bias is towards the Atlantic Ocean. In the list (n=14) references
provided by Reviewer #1, all are hypoxic systems from the Atlantic Ocean. In our
past work, we show that what is ‘hypoxic’ for Atlantic systems does not apply to
Pacific settings because of differences in large oceanographic dynamics and
evolutionary history (Chu & Tunnicliffe 2015; Chu & Gale 2017; also echoed by
Sperling et al. 20166).
We have adjusted our Introduction to emphasize the northeast Pacific context and
that our study is one of very few that has examined in situ hypoxic communities at
decline and recovery processes in this critical region.
1.3.2 Reviewer expresses strongly we are not citing a myriad of studies, and that we are
misrepresenting temporal variation. First, a comprehensive survey of all causes of
deoxygenation is not appropriate for this paper; there are some great recent review
papers. Instead, we illustrate examples of a pervading literature focus on different
causes of hypoxia instead of the biology of the response which are somewhat
unified regardless of environmental forcing. We did state that, regardless of the
mismatch of scale and cause of ‘oxygen loss’, the biological response needs to be
the focus if we are to understand consequences of deoxygenation and
reoxygenation. Second, we do embrace several temporal studies (including Glover
et al’s review7), and discuss several in the Discussion where the context is relevant.
We have reviewed our summary of other temporal studies and have assessed the
reviewer’s suggestions for relevant contributions [e.g. Lines 69-75].
1.4. “My understanding of beta diversity, as opposed to alpha diversity, is that alpha is for a
specific location and beta is for a broader geographic coverage. The geographic
coverage in this analysis is a single location and supports the concepts of alpha
diversity.” This criticism is repeated to nullify the analytical approach that looks at
temporal changes in diversity; the reviewer had only to examine the key methods

references to see the advent of new approaches that include temporal studies 8 Our
definition of beta diversity was clear - ‘compositional heterogeneity’ which is simply the
difference in species composition among temporal samples with alpha diversity being
the species richness within a sample.
A key novelty of our study is this temporal application of beta diversity. The analytical
methods we apply are also novel – they were developed by others for this purpose (P.
Legendre et al). This recently designed beta diversity analysis (LCBD) approach is the
only method that allows for beta diversity to be calculated for individual time points; we
are the first to apply this method in a deep-sea setting. All prior temporal beta diversity
indices use pairwise site comparisons to calculate a beta diversity index value which
meant that beta-diversity could not be calculated for individual time points or sites.
1.5. We present “an over interpretation and extension of the data” by using data pooled into
two categories (sessile and mobile species)” This assertion is repeated throughout
comments to invalidate our results. We did not pool, but used individual species count
data of all 41 species observed in our study - the standard practice in multivariate
community ordination methods. All epibenthic species were counted and analyzed in
every image of our time-series as indicated in Methods. Perhaps Figure 5 was
misinterpreted so we have re-emphasised in text [Line 212 & 230] and figure legend
[Lines 943-945].
1.6. “interpretation of the data do not justify the statement made about a regime shift”
This statement comes from the Reviewer’s misunderstanding of the definition of beta
diversity, the ‘pooled’ data, and the importance of the analysis in Figure 6. If,
i) different communities characterize the low vs high oxygen regime in a seasonal
hypoxia cycle (which we have shown),
ii) the community shifts in a threshold-like response (Fig 4), and
iii) the low oxygen period has been increasing over time (Fig 6) ,
then, a regime shift is a reasonable hypothesis to present. If the system stays longer in
the low-oxygen regime, then the community will shift accordingly to the new regime.
1.7. “Temporal mismatch in the data should be adjusted for high frequency data…The 0.5h
photo frequency….so that the 0.5-h photo corresponds to the same time point that the
oxygen data were collected.” A mis-reading by the reviewer: the camera fired at half
hour intervals, but we clearly stated that our study used a 12-h interval time-series with a

Address of Readers’ suggestions/criticisms
2.1. Associate Editor
2.1.1. “I had a difficult time understanding what specifically was done to analyze this
large, somewhat complex/uneven dataset”
In very general terms, we looked at (1) beta diversity of the community and (2) the
environmental drivers influencing biological response at single species and whole
community response levels. The slightly complicated methods were primarily a result
of the unevenness of the sampling intervals (i.e., traditional time-series analyses can
not account for irregular sampling intervals) and the need to account for
autocorrelation in the analysis because of the fine-scale sampling interval of the data.
To simply the message and to also address Reviewer 2’s concern, we have shifted the
extraneous details of how we dealt with these issues to a supplementary methods
section.
2.2. Reviewer 2
2.2.1. “Statistical methods are a bit dense for me and maybe more than you needed”
Likely the explanation was more than needed; please see streamlined version and
comment above.
2.2.2. “You might consider adding more detail to the abstract relative to your conclusions”
Abstract adjusted; thank you.
2.2.3. “There are inconsistencies in the literature cited.”
[Neither Rabalais (NN) nor Levin are more than 10 authors – I did not check
further…]
Corrected.
2.3. Reviewer 1
2.3.1. Abstract “Conclusion 2 is not novel”
Edited to include ‘northeast Pacific Ocean’ context. Our study is novel in that it is
the only one to address this question in situ in this key oceanographic region that
shows both community decline and recovery to oxygen with high-frequency data.
2.3.2. “introduction provide more context from benthic communities with seasonal
hypoxia”
Added additional citations where relevant.
2.3.3. L 50-51 implies a direct influence of atmospheric CO2 deoxygenation.
Reworded to state ‘indirect consequence’.
2.3.4. L84-100, are standard responses of benthic communities stressed with declining,
continual hypoxia/anoxia, and increasing dissolved oxygen. Are there hypotheses
being tested?
Have reworded introduction to set our study in context of past work and clarified the
hypothesis of community hysteresis and beta diversity [Lines 99-108]
4
2.3.5. One of the issues with regard to benthic fauna in consistently hypoxic benthic
environments is that the fauna are less susceptible to declining dissolved oxygen
than benthic communities that were not historically exposed to low dissolved
oxygen, but now are, and thus, not pre-disposed to low oxygen conditions.
Yes, agree – we had addressed this topic of differences in hypoxia tolerance among
taxa in our previous work (Chu & Tunnicliffe, 2015; Chu & Gale, 2017) and
emphasize that we are seeing even these “less susceptible” animals hammered in
this particular event. The important point is that we see a poor short-term recovery
even in a supposedly predictable system with species adapted to chronic hypoxia.
2.3.6. L111, suggest insert “aerobic microbial consumption
Edited as suggested.
2.3.7. L 140-144, not clear if the 96-m and 103-m deployments are considered to be in
similar habitats. Reading the results of the 103-m deployment indicates the same
loss of benthic diversity…
Made the difference clearer in edit [Lines 144-147]: although they seem close the
presence of infauna at our site (that emerges) is very important in the consequences.
2.3.8. L169 verified as zooplankton? Was any ground truth of water samples taken at the 1
m above the bottom depth and L172-174 what where the groundtruth data that
allowed for identification of different types of zooplankton and the other identified
groups of living or non-living characteristics.
Yes, we can see zooplankton to general group in the images (note data are
presence/absence); but, we add the reference to a groundtruth study capturing
plankton 2m above bottom at this site [Line 178].
2.3.9. L178, should insert the preferred units ml/L and all of its various calculations at the
end of the first sentence.
Edited as suggested.
2.3.10. “There are other data, such as section 2.6 of an 11-y data set that is not relevant to
the manuscript.” “Pg14-15, this analysis is not necessary or relevant to the focus of
the paper, a tight time sequence of one location. Same for section 3.6”
We have edited to clarify that the 11-year record grounds our 14-month study into
the broader long-term conditions at the same location [Lines 263-265]. The analysis
is key to demonstrating i) that this coastal inlet is experiencing progressive
deoxygenation (similar to the Northeast Pacific), and ii) that, if this trend continues,
there may be a permanent shift in the community towards the low oxygen phase.
We edited the figure to indicate the period covered by the images (Fig. 6).
Other Issues from Reviewer 1
3.1. Conclusion 1 in abstract “is demonstrated by a single set of four photographs. This is
not a rigorous analyses” Comment may stem from reviewer mistake noted in 1.5
above. Figures 3 to 5 plus tables show the ‘rigorous’ analyses derived from data
5
presented in Dryad repository with documentation of animal counts in 1,573 images.
We also offered a sample time-lapse video created with all the images: see Supp.
Video S1.
3.2. L71, misuse of “beta” diversity. See 1.4 above.
3.3. “L 75-87, paragraph, could be reduced substantially… Suggestion…”
Appreciate the reviewer’s ideas here: however, much was done in the past
publications at this site so we do not wish to repeat. Also see 1.3.2 above.
Because the reviewer dismisses the beta-diversity analysis, this rest of this comment
devolves to “Otherwise this is an observational study with little more.” Please see
point 1.4 above.
3.4. What will this study provide more than already recorded in the literature for similar
time series? See points 1.3 and 1.4 (Objectives and novel hypotheses tested have been
rewritten for clarity – Lines 95-109)
3.5. L 89, suggest that “0.5-h” intervals is more informative than < 24-h intervals.
See point 1.6.
3.6. “The frequency [of scatter detector] is not identified” Yes, it was: “Near-bottom
acoustic backscatter was sampled at 1 MHz”
3.7. L112, ref [27] is about deep-water renewal not mid-depth as stated. Incorrect: this
reference is the first to describe Spring mid-depth renewal in Saanich Inlet (it does
have deep-water renewal, too).
3.8. L135, ref [35,36] not convinced by these references alone how the data in the results
for the components identified in the ADCP beam 1 m above the seabed is what is
interpreted. Seems to be a broad category that could be more clearly defined ….
The Aquadopp (not ADCP) acoustic beams cannot differentiate the type of suspended
particle – thus, the ‘broad category’. Reference [41] used an exhaustive set of tools to
groundtruth the signal for suspended particulates at the same study site; the particulates
include both sediment, organics and zooplankton, all of which can be important to
suspension feeders.
3.9. “L149, 0.5-h, this way all measurements are in the same time measurements. Was
described as at least < 24 h earlier in manuscript.”
See 1.6 above.
6
3.10. “L201-202, a calculation for beta diversity was chosen, not necessarily
justified…The definition of beta diversity I am accustomed to do has to do with a
broader spatial variability than a point photograph…. I think the use of a beta
diversity is an invalid extension of the species richness, especially when the
categorization is limited to mobile, sessile (of several unidentified categories other
than a list provided), and the data are presented as no. individuals/m2 for sessile,
motile, and total individuals”. Comment extends from two reviewer mistakes
addressed in points 1.4 and 1.5 above. We are not extending alpha diversity…
3.11. “L213-214, both were significant in explaining community variation within the
time scale.” Just two categories. This is an unjustified extension with explanation of
pooled data and (C) L217-224, again the calculations and interpretations are an over-
extension of the usefulness of pooled data into two categories.
Not pooled data; see point 1.5 above.
3.12. “I think I could have told you at this point in the data methods, that the motile and
sessile organism would be separated on the first axis. And, yes they are two points (the
two motile organisms identified) to one side of the centrum and all the others to the
other side “
Not pooled data! Figure 3e illustrates the community turnover over time (temporal
beta diversity) is driven by different key species at different time points and that
mobile and sessile species do not differentiate themselves over time. The proximity of
a mobile (e.g. squat lobster) to a sessile species (ball sponge) illustrates the point.
And the motile and sessile species are not on opposites sites of the ordination plot.
The correct way to interpret the left side vs right side of the figure is to focus on the
two motile organisms on the left side (spot prawn, and slender sole); they are
important in driving beta diversity at the start / end points of the time-series. However,
spot prawn points towards the beginning of the time-series because it didn’t appear at
the end of the observation period. We edited the figure caption for clarity.
3.13. “[55] indicates the oxygen threshold is too conservative, so there is a correction
for occurrence of the motile species. The data in the time series, so technical and I am
supposing accurate and precise, should be the data analyzed and interpreted in this
manuscript and not data from a different time series.”
The threshold we use is not a “correction” for motile species but one that is more
relevant for this region of the world (see global metanalysis in Chu & Gale, 2017).
Thresholds developed from Atlantic systems [original ref 55] do not apply to our study
site or even other ocean basins (footnote 2 above).

ments on Chu et al
paper uses a detailed, unique data set to show how rapidly communities in low oxygen
ironments can change, and to some extent, how slowly they recover. I am unfamiliar with the way
a is handled (not being a biologist or statistician). Such methods may become more common as
an observatories collect large data holdings, so the level of description is likely justified.
conclusions drawn from the data analyses are sensible and a valuable addition to the literature on
oxia. The paper is a thoughtful analysis of an important data set.

68 the definition of beta diversity needs to include both spatial and temporal, since it is the point at
ch you explain to the reader what you are assessing. It's confusing to say beta diversity can also
ude temporal variability when this is the mode you are focussing on.
rather than daily, you might say "daily tidal cycles". This lets the reader understand how daily
llations might occur.
new sentence and maybe new paragraph "Measuring beta diversity in the temporal context is not..."
Perhaps say "Basin waters of Saanich Inlet, a British Columbia fjord..."
to be clearer, "Coastal wind patterns drive seasonal upwelling which leads to deep-water renewal..."
"...or shorter intervals"
"...spanned periods of both..."
perhaps delete "multiscale"
"exchange between the inlet basin and adjacent waters"
cribe here how basin renewal affects your observation site at 95 m. The deep anoxic waters of the
in are displaced upward during the density inflow in late summer, forcing low oxygen waters to
llower depths. Reoxygenation occurs at 95 m as less dense waters flow across the sill, carrying
gen to intermediate depths. This occurs most strongly in early Spring when you observe highest
gen levels at your site. Water density is lowest at this time, probably because of gradual mixing with
her waters over the Winter (I checked my historical data at 100 m).
ummarize, lowest oxygen results from upwelling of basin waters (the hypoxia event), increasing
gen results from horizontal exchange with Satellite Channel. The hypoxic event is not something
sed by a sudden increase in oxygen consumption.
more info on what R is or who provides it (e.g. a statistics package available from ...).
"...relative to the entire..."
awkward sentence, punctuation missing?
I like this approach, assessing the duration of hypoxic events each year to see if there is a trend.
9 add dates of observations to title or first line
ve returned to my review, and am trying to find exactly what O2env means. I see no definition and am
ndering if it is the 12 h average before each image. (see below also)
I am trying to understand how some sessile animals remain at the site during "anoxia". With no
gen at all in the water, I would expect no squat lobsters or slender sole. Perhaps you need to use and
ne a term "suboxia" (severe hypoxia, <1% O2 saturation or <0.07 ml/l at VENUS, e.g. Codispoti 2010)
ndicate minuscule oxygen levels (levels perhaps undetectable by instruments used at VENUS). Anoxia
o oxygen) leads to hydrogen sulfide production when it persists which must be toxic to animals.
en't I seen results from you and Verena, showing the lower oxygen limit for squat lobster, etc.?
-358 when discussing decreasing rates, values should not be negative. e.g. declining at -0.52 d-1
uld indicate an increase.
sounds like you're suggesting the eastern Pacific is seeing an increase in hypoxia. Reword sentence.
perhaps small temporal-scale variability?
community changes, rather than turnover?
...is explained by the seasonal hypoxia cycle. (I'm not sure why oxygen would be the broadest
e). Also, be sure to mention here or later that the hypoxia event in 2012 was stronger than has been
erved in many years (VENUS time frame). This may have led to the loss of sessile species that had
en several years to develop, and would take several years to repopulate the area. Perhaps the
ervation of Leys et al 2004 that dead sponges have been observed deeper in the inlet is suggesting a
ger term decline in oxygen levels in Saanich. If hypoxic events such as 2012, 2015-16 become more
uent, the larger sessile sponges and anemones may be lost from this habitat?
I find the sentence "In addition to oxygen..." to be perhaps unnecessary. If you wish to make the
nt that other environmental factors could be important, I'd rather see it stated that temperature
s not vary much (range of 7.8 to 9, Fig 1) and the inlet is highly productive (no food shortage).
wever, I do believe that gradually warming waters should increase the rate of oxygen consumption
microbes, exacerbating hypoxia. I've checked my historical data and see a warming rate of ~0.01 C y-1
ween 1953-2015 at 100 and 200 m depths (Whitney, pers comm if you need it).
if you wish to suggest oxygen is not the only variable in community turnover, I'd suggest being
cific about e.g. the time it takes for sessile organisms to re-establish after a strong hypoxic event (as
ntioned above). A community such as shrimp may be pushed to shallower habitat during a mild
oxic event, or decimated during a strong one if they find no refuge. I mention shrimp because I have
rd from sport fishers that this population is unfishable following the 2015-16 period of hypoxia.
I see you have done what I suggest above, discuss resettlement issues.
a good example of where suboxic would be an appropriate descripter
ewhere in your discussion, I suggest emphasizing that the strength (not the direction) of the 10 year
d in oxygen observed at VENUS may be an anomaly driven by recent extreme events (the warm
er mass off the BC coast being the main one, but also by the recent El Nino). Oscillations in the N
ific are often tied into multi-decadal influences such as the lunar nodal cycle (18.6 y). This is not an
e for your paper and only becomes important if trying to predict future trends.
The term "regime shift" should be used cautiously (suggests to me a reorganization of an ecosystem
h essential components replaced). Your observations come from a single depth, so you can't be sure
ecies are lost (e.g. sessiles) or have just lost their deep habitat. I suggest you focus your discussion
oss of habitat, not regime shift.

and Fig 1. " annual hypoxia cycle" just to be clear that it is an annual cycle.
2 and in text. Can you suggest why sessile organisms are lost when oxygen returns? Weakened and
erable to predation/decomposition?
3. I finally see your definition of O2 env. This needs to be stated when you first introduce the term in
text. Be clear if it's an average of data from the 12 h before an image is taken.
6. Can you easily update the figure to include all of 2016 oxygen data? Only if it's simple.

iewer is aware of our past work on the topic but may have misremembered how we
pirically addressed these questions.
response of the fish and invertebrates to ‘lethal hypoxia’ is not instantaneous. Throughout
paper, we have emphasized ‘duration of exposure’ – as an important concept to consider
en trying to link environmental time-series with biological time-series.
me animals can tolerate lethal exposure if the duration of exposure is brief (imagine
cessfully holding your breath for a few seconds versus failing to hold your breath for a few
rs). For mobile species, their response can be quick because they can migrate away before
al exposure occurs and return again when oxygen conditions are ‘better’. As for sessile
cies, lethal exposure occurs after an elapsed period of time and then the process of ‘dying’
urs which is also not instantaneous. For example, species such as sponges take weeks to
nths before signs of declining health are visible – this is misinterpreted as ‘dying in high
gen’ by the reviewer instead of the delayed response.
have edited this result statement to help guide the interpretation for non-biologists. L330-332

]env had already recovered to higher levels ([O2]env = 0.6 ± 0.3 ml L-1); thus, a time delay
ween population decline and the initial onset of anoxia.”
ile hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can be toxic (e.g. the bacterial mats in this system are a good
logical indicator of the compound) – the flatfish and squat lobster in our study site has been
wn to be able to withstand H2S by living on/in the bacterial mats– this was shown in our past

growth rates and massive adult size classes are often associated with basal metazoans.

community recovery rates as it takes longer for this size class to recover.

environmental factors could be important...be specific…
497 – I suggest you be specific…time for sessile organisms to re-establish
544 – I see you already did that
believe it is important to keep the wording of this section because we do show in our results
all these other variables are important (e.g. Table 2).
broad-scale hypoxia cycle might be the most important driver – but the fluctuations in
perature and food need to be included in the ecological assessment of ‘hypoxic
munities’. A temperature range of 7.8-9 may not seem like a wide range to an
anographer but 1°C is a biologically relevant range that can influence biological processes in
4
therms (e.g. all the species presented in our study). Food is not limiting per se, but if the
ductivity sinks into the severely hypoxic zone of the basin, then most species will not be able

der sole further down in the manuscript.

er of the 10-year trend (L467-L470).
this manuscript, we do not expand further in our discussion on the specific ‘causes’ of the
malous hypoxic periods. As stated in our introduction – the paper focus is on ecological
sequences. However, we have another manuscript in preparation that specifically touches the
malous events which will likely satisfy the reviewer’s suggestions.
580 – Regime shift should be used cautiously

inning of what has been documented as hypoxia-induced regime shifts in Atlantic ecosystems

(1) The scenario when two images were analyzed from the two different camera positions –
the images were from two non-overlapping areas of the seafloor (pan 30 left, pan 30
right) and thus no individuals were counted twice. We have edited this for clarity (L157).
(2) Yes, the scenario where both images from the same camera position were analyzed was
redundant in the way the reviewer described (the redundant data was then divided by
2*the area of the one photo). This was a byproduct of our initial efforts to develop a
standardized protocol for processing the entire set of 30-min interval sequence of images
(n=89,000+, now edited to clarify, L158) which did not make the final paper because of
the faulty camera issues. However, this situation only occurred twice in the analyzed
time-series (0.0025% of the dataset of the n=1,573 analyzed images) and had no impact
on the end results.

ond deployment period) were used to determine if variation in the community and key species
ponse could be explained by different environmental variables at different time scales (see
plementary Methods). “

The supplementary material helps a lot better understand what was done…however,
mention the addition of supplementary time points in the main text.
balance comments from Reviewer #1 with Reviewer #4 we have done the following:
Reworded the regression methods statement in the main text and supplementary materials

h the dbMEMs of each model were used in regressions with a matrix of explanatory
ironmental variables (n=25)...” (L262-264)
Reintroduced the description of the supplementary timepoints back into the main text. L241-
248 now reads,
To reduce the other, smaller data gaps (excluding the 15-day gap) to a maximum interval of
hours, supplementary time points (n=19) were added to the time series [56] prior to
erating the dbMEM variables for the two different deployment periods. The addition of these
plementary time points does not affect the dependent variables [56] but allows fine-scale
poral structure to be represented better in the analysis that would otherwise be constrained
he size of the largest data gap. The tradeoff is a slight loss in orthogonality among the
enfunctions which prevents reducing the sampling interval any further. All supplementary
e points were removed prior to using RDA involving species abundance data.”

mple, increasing the average temperature is deleterious to many inverts…the ‘deleterious
ct’ can be offset if there is an equal increase in the variability (e.g. standard deviation) of
perature. This can’t happen for systems already characterized by ‘low oxygen conditions’ as
deleterious trajectory (oxygen decrease) can not coincide with an increase in variability near
