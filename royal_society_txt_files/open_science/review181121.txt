label_comment_1
The manuscript presents a study concerning the robustness of electrowetting based display
(electrofluiduc display) pixels. The robustness is studied by means of performing electrical tests,
namely, I-V and C-V measurements in two dielectric configurations, a single and a multilayer
one. The manuscript is well and concisely written (despite some typos in instrument names, p5
line 14, or others, please check) and offers valuable knowledge in the technology community
dealing with such displays.
I would just suggest the authors to present values of the saturation voltages of each dielectric
configuration in order to just have idea of how they perform their tests from the saturation. And
since saturation is also connected with material degradation it should be nice to have this info.
In conclusion I suggest publication after considering the above comment.

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
5
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript. Make sure it is clear in your data accessibility statement how the data
can be accessed;
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article
so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Please note that Royal Society Open Science charge article processing charges for all new
submissions that are accepted for publication. Charges will also apply to papers transferred to
Royal Society Open Science from other Royal Society Publishing journals, as well as papers
submitted as part of our collaboration with the Royal Society of Chemistry
(http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/chemistry).
If your manuscript is newly submitted and subsequently accepted for publication, you will be
asked to pay the article processing charge, unless you request a waiver and this is approved by
Royal Society Publishing. You can find out more about the charges at
http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/page/charges. Should you have any queries, please
contact openscience@royalsociety.org.

(2) I would just suggest the authors to present values of the saturation
voltages of each dielectric configuration in order to just have idea of
how they perform their tests from the saturation. And since saturation is
also connected with material degradation it should be nice to have this
info.
Response:
We fully understand the concern from the reviewer. As one of our
design rules, the EFD devices should always working at the ideal
Young-Lippmann region which is far below the threshold voltage of
EW saturation. To confirm this, the electrowetting performance for two-
phase fluids open system of oil/water (as shown in Fig.2, we placed
10µL DI water droplet in decane) on the single AFX & ParyleneC/AFX
was measured. It is clear that, the driving voltage (30V) of EFD is stillfar
away from the EW saturation voltage of each dielectric configuration
(as shown in Fig.2, the saturation voltages of single AFX and
ParyleneC/AFX are around 118V and 100V respectively),which means
the EFD devices were all working in the linear Young-lippmann
region[30].The above information was also added into our revised
manuscript(see page6 line19).
Fig2. Electrowetting profiles for two-phase fluids open system of
oil/water on Single AFX (1359nm) and ParyleneC/AFX (AFX: 835nm,
ParyleneC: 503nm) coatings. The applied voltage was increased in steps
of 2V/s from 0V to 250V.
