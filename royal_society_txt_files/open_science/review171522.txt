The manuscript reports the use of CNT@SnO2@Ni nanostructures for lithium ion batteries. The
as prepared electrodes deliver a high capacity along with good long term stability. I recommend
its publication after the authors address the following points through minor revisions.
1. The motivation of using Ni is not clear. The authors should further address this in the
introduction section.
2. The capacity decays very quickly during the first 10 cycles. Please comment on this.
3. Please provide the rate stability test results.
4. The electrode material was described as CNT@SnO2@Ni. The use of @ would imply that this is
a core shell structure. To avoid misleading, please change it to CNT/SnO2/Ni.

In this work carbon fibers @ SnO2 @ Ni nanostructures have been used for Li ion battery
application. Authors claim that the nanocomposite exhibits good lithium ion storage capacity and
stability. The manuscript need to be revised before it can be considered for publication.
1. Authors need to provide detailed growth mechanism with supported experiments by
performing controlled experiments stepwise.
2. Quality of the figures are poor. Scale bars in the figure are not visible. Low and high
magnification FESEM images of the composites after different steps should be provided.
3. Authors need to focus on the Li ion storage performance of the composites instead of providing
so many figures on characterization in the main text. All the characterization data should be
included in supporting information. Elemental and Raman mapping should be carried out to
3
confirm the uniform distribution of the elements and pure phase formation.
JCPDS data need to be plotted in Fig. 4.
4. The present work need to be compared with other nanocomposites of PANI and SnO2 for Li
ion storage. The obtained data should be compared and highlighted. A table with all the
comparison may be useful.
5. Systematic and comparative energy storage performance of all the combinations of PANI-
SnO2, Carbon-SnO2, Carbon-PANI etc. should be studied.
6. Mechanisms involved in achieving enhanced Li ion storage performance need to be provided
with supported experiments. The samples should be characterized by spectroscopic techniques
after long cycling tests to get insights on the mechanism.

Many thanks for your helpful comments on our manuscript entitled “Facile Synthesis of
Hierarchical CNF/SnO2/Ni Nanostructures via Self-Assembly Process as Anode Materials for
Lithium Ion Batteries”. These comments are very helpful for improving our paper, as well as
the important guiding significance to our future research work. The comments have been
studied carefully and the responses are as follows:
1. The motivation of using Ni is not clear. The authors should further address this in the
introduction section.
Response: We thank the Reviewer for the good suggestion. The motivation of using Ni can
be attributed to two factors. One contribution of Ni nanoparticles are the successful
supression of Sn coarsening during cycling and consequent enhancement of the stability of
the reversible conversion reactions. The other factor is that Ni nanocrystals can be served as
an effective catalyst for decompositon of Li2O as well as oxidation of metallic Sn from SnO2.
Meanwhile, we added two sentence and the related reference to explain it in the main text, as
follow: “Fourthermore, Ni nanocrystals can not only play as a buffer to relieve the mechanical
stress induced by the large volume changes upon cycling, but also are the successful
supression of Sn coarsening during cycling and consequent enhancement of the stability of
the reversible conversion reactions”(Please see the section of introduction, line 21-24, p1)
2. The capacity decays very quickly during the first 10 cycles. Please comment on this.
Response: We thank the Reviewer for the good suggestion. As a matter of fact, Sn-based
materials have a high theoretical discharge capacity (~990 mAh g-1). However, the serious
volume changes (>300%) of pure Sn during lithium insertion/extraction process will lead to
electrode pulverization and fast capacity fade upon extended cycling. The CNF/SnO2/Ni
nanostructures alleviate the change of the cell unit of Sn in a certain degree. Then the capacity
decays very quickly during the first 10 cycles can be originated from SEI formation. The
disproportionate formation of the SEI layer on these samples results in numerous
consumption of Li+ and increase of inner electrode resistance, which leads to initial capacity
fading during initial cycles.
3. Please provide the rate stability test results.
Response: We thank the Reviewer for the good suggestion. The rate stability test can be
found in the revised supplementary information. These results indicate that the
CNF/SnO2/Ni nanostructures shows good rate capability tests under the same
discharge/charge current density ranging from 100 mA to 5 A g-1 (as shown in Fig. S9). These
results indicate that both the electrical conductivity and structure of electrodes play an
important role in determining the rate capability in LIBs. The newly added rate stability test
results are put as Fig. S9 and the corresponding descriptions are added as follows: “The
CNF/SnO2/Ni electrode shows good rate capability tests at low discharge/charge current
density (as shown in Fig S9). However, at high current density, the CNF/SnO2/Ni electrode
cannot retain the capacity retention of 50% compared to the retention at 0.2A g-1, which can
be attributed to the small surficial area and low porosity.” (Please see line 6-9, p4 and Fig. S9
in pS-7)
Fig. S9 The capacity over cycling at different rates (0.1 Ag-1 ~ 5 Ag-1) of milling the mixture
of CNF/SnO2 and Ni powder with weight ratio 10:1 and 4:1.
4. The electrode material was described as CNT@SnO2@Ni. The use of @ would imply
that this is a core shell structure. To avoid misleading, please change it to CNT/SnO2/Ni.
Response: We thank the Reviewer for the good suggestion. The symbol of “ @ ” have been
changed to “ / ” in the revised manuscript.
5. Authors need to provide detailed growth mechanism with supported experiments by
performing controlled experiments stepwise.
Response: We thank the Reviewer for the good suggestion. “The fabrication process of the
CNF/SnO2/Ni nanocomposite is illustrated in Fig. 1. A series of experiment have been
conducted to optimize the structure, morphology and electrical property. It can be found that
monodispersed PAN/Sodium alginate can be obtained via dispersing monodispersed PAN in
water and heating the mixture at the temperature ranging from 70<U+F0B0>C to 90<U+F0B0>C. However, it
cannot be obtained at room temperature, which indicates that heating process can effectively
activate the surficial group to link sodium alginate. Then, PAN/tin-alginate nanocomposite
can form via ion exchange process through dispersing PAN/Sodium alginate into solution of
SnCl2 with stirring for 3 hours at room temperature due to that divalent metal ion can be
abundantly immobilized into alginate. Next, the as-synthesized products were calcined at
450 <U+2103> for 2h in a muffle furnace at a heating rate of 1 <U+2103>/min in nitrogen atmosphere to
form the carbon nanofiber/SnO2 composites (CNF/SnO2). Finally, the CNF/SnO2/Ni
nanostructures can be obtained by ball milling the mixture of CNF/SnO2 and Nickel (Ni)
powder with different weight ratio in air atmosphere for 15h at room temperature. Finally, the
Ni nanoparticles can be assembled into the CNF/SnO2 nanostructure by means of ball milling
treatment.” Such descriptions have been added in line41-52, p2.

6. Quality of the figures are poor. Scale bars in the figure are not visible. Low and high
magnification FESEM images of the composites after different steps should be provided.
Response: We thank the Reviewer for the good suggestion. The low and high magnification
FESEM images of the composites after different steps have been provided and rearrangement
in the section of Results and Discussion. The scale bars were added in the inset of Fig. 2.

with layer structure, (c) surficial groove structure of CNF/SnO2 nanocomposite.
7. Authors need to focus on the Li ion storage performance of the composites instead of
providing so many figures on characterization in the main text. All the characterization
data should be included in supporting information. Elemental and Raman mapping should
be carried out to confirm the uniform distribution of the elements and pure phase
formation. JCPDS data need to be plotted in Fig. 4.
Response: We thank the Reviewer for the good suggestion. We have increased the section
about the Li ion storage performance in the main text.
The relationship between performance and structure will be deeply discussed. The
corresponding TG, Raman and nitrogen adsorption-desorption data are relocated to the
supporting information. In addition, Elemental mapping have been conducted as shown in
supporting information, confirming the uniform distribution of elements. (as shown in Fig. S2)
JCPDS data have been plotted in Fig.4.
This result shows that Ni nanoparticles can be assembled into CNF/SnO2 to generate
CNF/SnO2/Ni nanocomposites via ball milling process. In addition, the energy dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of CNF/SnO2/Ni samples have been performed to
investigated the distribution of C, Sn, Ni, and O element (Fig. S2a, b). These results show that
the elements can uniformly distributed in the samples.

8. The present work need to be compared with other nanocomposites of PANI and SnO2 for
Li ion storage. The obtained data should be compared and highlighted. A table with all
the comparison may be useful.
Response: We thank the Reviewer for the good suggestion. It is significant to compare with
nanocomposties of PANI and SnO2 for Li ion storage. However, it is difficult to obtain
relative data in short term. We will immedately synthetize the nanocomposites of PANI and
SnO2 and investigate the electrochemical performance of them.
9. Systematic and comparative energy storage performance of all the combinations of
PANI-SnO2, Carbon-SnO2, Carbon-PANI etc. should be studied.
Response: We thank the Reviewer for the good suggestion. The PANI is suitable for being as
electrode due to its good conductance. However, it is difficult to obtain relative data in short
term. We will immedately synthetize the nanocomposites of PANI and SnO2 and investigate
the electrochemical performance of them. Subsequently, systematic and comparative energy
storage performance of all the combinations of PANI-SnO2, Carbon-SnO2, Carbon-PANI etc.
will be studied.
10. Mechanisms involved in achieving enhanced Li ion storage performance need to be
provided with supported experiments. The samples should be characterized by
spectroscopic techniques after long cycling tests to get insights on the mechanism.
Response: We thank the Reviewer for the good suggestion. In order to describe the
mechanism of enhanced Li ion storage performance, we systematically compare the energy
storage performance of SnO2, CNF/SnO2, as well as CNF/SnO2/Ni and corresponding data
can be found in supporting information. Furthermore, the samples have been characterized by
TEM and SEM techniques after long cycling tests and the corresponding data can be found in
supporting information. This result suggests that the morphology of CNF/SnO2/Ni remains
literally unchanged after 100 discharge/charge cycles.
