This paper describes total synthesis of [15N]-labelled C6-substituted purines from [15N]-
formamide – easy preparation of isotopically-labelled cytokinins and derivatives. Significant
efforts have been devoted to the project, and some new chemistry data have been reported. The
results are reasonable and support the conclusions. It fits well in the scope of RSOS, and it will be
suitable for publication after careful revision.
Comments:
1. References section is listed in alphabetical order, thus the references cited in the text is in a very
unusual format, not starting from 1. Is this format RSOS requires?
2. Too many references are cited in this manuscript, it might decrease the novelty of the work,
making it an improvement of the synthetic approach.
3. References 71 and 72 seem not in alphabetical order. Please double check.
4. For solid compounds, it is better to give mp data.
5. For 1H NMR data, it is better to give the proton assignments.
6. HRMS, it is noted that the calcd value is exactly same with found value for several compounds.
Please double check.
7. Within 11 compounds prepared, clearly point out how many new compounds and known
compounds in Results and Discussion section.
8. Page 14, Scheme 2 caption, there are some format issues: Italic, Superscript, Subscript; and
compound number should be Bold.

is not relevant to your paper, please nevertheless include the heading and explicitly state that it is
not relevant to your work. We have included a screenshot example of the end statements for
reference.
• Ethics statement
Please clarify whether you received ethical approval from a local ethics committee to carry out
your study. If so please include details of this, including the name of the committee that gave
consent in a Research Ethics section after your main text. Please also clarify whether you received
informed consent for the participants to participate in the study and state this in your Research
Ethics section.
*OR*
Please clarify whether you obtained the necessary licences and approvals from your institutional
animal ethics committee before conducting your research. Please provide details of these licences
and approvals in an Animal Ethics section after your main text.
*OR*
Please clarify whether you obtained the appropriate permissions and licences to conduct the

• Acknowledgements
Please acknowledge anyone who contributed to the study but did not meet the authorship
criteria.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript before 27-Sep-2018. Please note that the revision deadline
will expire at 00.00am on this date. If you do not think you will be able to meet this date please let
me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Best wishes,
Dr Laura Smith, MRSC

Reviewer is right, mp data are usually given for solid
compounds. On the other hand, it is not so common to
measure mp for labelled compounds, as the method is
destructive. However, we added mp data for the compounds
where bigger quantities are available, as well as
comparison with literature data for unlabelled
counterparts.

proton assignments.
Added as requested.

We double checked the original HR MS files and for some
compounds the difference between calculated and measured
value is really 0 ppm.
