The authors clearly describe steps during data analysis and acquisition affecting the precision
and reliability of barcode-based biodiversity assessment. The manuscript is of high importance in
the field and describes various problems people working on barcodes are faced with.
Some minor modifications are recommended:
- Normally barcoding is associated with the mtCOI and the database BOLD. Please also mention
that COI is normally used for barcoding of most animals
- OTU is mentioned in the first paragraph of the Introduction and is described in the second
paragraph. Please write operational taxonomic unit in the first paragraph
- Suppl. Table 3: 43 Chromadoridae (it is marked in yellow)
- I would recommend to write that you potentially found novel species (Page 9; Section 3.2.)

label_comment_2
Holovachov et al. present an interesting comparison of three taxonomy assignment methods. The
manuscript provides a nice overview of the different categories (alignment-based, probabilistic,
tree-based and phylogeny-based), although it would have been better to see one method from all
four categories in this study. The main thing, which I am rather concerned about, is the fact that
the authors evaluate included methods based on successfully assigned OTUs and “successful
assignment” here is solely based on a list of criteria for scores, monophyly etc. How the authors
can know that meeting their criteria would automatically mean that the OTU would be correctly
3
identified? I understand that it is not possible to link sequences to specimens in studies relying on
sequencing bulk samples, but at the very least, the authors should provide a very good
justification and references for their criteria. Currently, it seems that the criteria have simply been
decided by the authors and thus are very subjective.
Another thing, which requires better justification, is the authors’ decision to use 18S rRNA gene.
Why 18S was preferred over, for instance, 28S or CO1 (which includes the standard barcode
region for animals)? In addition, how well marine nematode species and OTUs based on 18S
match in general? This could be either mentioned in the Introduction or discussed.
Minor comments:
Introduction:
- Page 2, line 14: Should colon be replaced with comma?
- Page 2, line 21: “Effective” could be defined more precisely.
- Page 2, line 36 (and other places): “anonymous metabarcodes (operational taxonomic units,
OTUs)” I think this is misleading because metabarcode and OTU don’t mean the same thing.
Also, I don’t like “anonymous” and would prefer “unidentified”. Perhaps “anonymous
metabarcodes (operational taxonomic units, OTUs)” could be replaced with “unidentified
putative species (operational taxonomic units, OTUs)”.
- Page 2, line 54: “Although, it would..” Please remove comma.
- Page 3, line 24: “For technical reasons, none of these tools are included in this comparison” Did
the authors try PROTAX (Somervuo et al. 2016, Bioinformatics)? If it works, maybe it could be
added.
- Page 3, line 33 (and other places): I would recommend replacing “cladogram” with
“phylogram” because cladogram generally refers to a tree only showing branching order with all
branches having equal length.
- Page 5, 2.2. Morphology-based analysis of samples: Please mention how experienced the person
who identified the specimens is. Were some specific keys or guides etc. used?
- Page 6: Why preliminary taxonomic assignment using QIIME was necessary? How many OTUs
entered this phase?
- Page 6, line 53: Should “nucleotide” be “sequence”?
- Page 7, lines 10-12: “but only the results based on LCA range of 2% were retained for further
analysis and comparison.” Why? Please add justification.
- Page 7, line 34: “The reference dataset was trimmed to the barcoding region” How long were
these sequences?
- Page 9, line 44: “These examples shows” Please replace “shows” with “show”.
- Page 11, line 1: “most of the identified OTUs were assigned to the same families” I assume that
the authors mean that many family identifications were congruent among the methods, but this is
not clear and the sentence needs to be clarified.
- Page 11, lines 41-44: “Among families with available reference sequences barcode-based
identification failed to identify the families Phanodermatidae, Leptosomatidae, Trefusiidae,
Epsilonematidae, Draconematidae, Monoposthiidae and Sphaerolaimidae.” Why so many
families failed? Perhaps this could be discussed.

Reviewer: 1
Normally barcoding is associated with the mtCOI and the database BOLD. Please also mention that COI
is normally used for barcoding of most animals
Response: Section "2.3. Sequencing procedures" of the "2. Materials and methods" was expanded in
order to address this comment and similar comment of the second reviewer.
OTU is mentioned in the first paragraph of the Introduction and is described in the second paragraph.
Please write operational taxonomic unit in the first paragraph
Response: Corrected, the first paragraph now reads: sequences of unidentified putative species
(operational taxonomic units, OTUs).
Suppl. Table 3: 43 Chromadoridae (it is marked in yellow)
Response: Corrected.
I would recommend to write that you potentially found novel species (Page 9; Section 3.2.)
Response: This point is addressed in the Section 3.1. – last sentence of each paragraph mentions that
we found species new to science and lists genera to which these novel species belong. Publication
describing some of these new species was accepted by the European Journal of Taxonomy, but was not
published yet, therefore we can not add names of these new species to the manuscript.
Reviewer: 2
The main thing, which I am rather concerned about, is the fact that the authors evaluate included
methods based on successfully assigned OTUs and “successful assignment” here is solely based on a list
of criteria for scores, monophyly etc. How the authors can know that meeting their criteria would
automatically mean that the OTU would be correctly identified? I understand that it is not possible to link
sequences to specimens in studies relying on sequencing bulk samples, but at the very least, the
authors should provide a very good justification and references for their criteria. Currently, it seems that
the criteria have simply been decided by the authors and thus are very subjective.
Section 2.5 was modified as follows: It is based on the study published by [42], who defines 99%
identity of SSU equal to species, 96.5% – genera, 90% – families, and 84% as equivalent to orders (or
1%, 3.5%, 10% and 16% difference per position) using single linkage clustering. The chosen threshold
was further confirmed by [43], who found that 90% identity score is usually sufficient to assign OTUs
(based V1-V2 region of 18S rRNA) of marine nematodes to families.
Following text was added to the section 2.6: OTUs were assigned to the families when they are placed
within monophyletic and highly supported clades (bootstrap support of 70% or higher [49-50]),
equivalent in their composition to family-level taxonomic category or below (subfamily, genus), following
the same principles that are used when species are classified in supraspecific taxa using the results of
phylogenetic analysis [51].
Section 2.7 was modified as follows: Taxonomic assignments to family level taxonomic categories were
based either on high likelihood (above the 95% threshold) of a single placement, or on high cumulative
likelihood (above the 95% threshold) of multiple placements all of which are within a single strongly
supported monophyletic clade equal to a family (see Section 4.4 for explanation). 95% similarity
threshold is the default used by the Evolutionary Placement Algorithm.
Another thing, which requires better justification, is the authors’ decision to use 18S rRNA gene. Why
18S was preferred over, for instance, 28S or CO1 (which includes the standard barcode region for
animals)? In addition, how well marine nematode species and OTUs based on 18S match in general?
This could be either mentioned in the Introduction or discussed.
Response: Nematode sequences used in this publication were generated as part of a larger NGS-based
meiofauna survey [Haenel, Q., Holovachov, O., Jondelius, U., Sundberg, P. & Bourlat, S.J. (2017). NGS-
based biodiversity and community structure analysis of meiofaunal eukaryotes in shell sand from Hållö
island, Smögen, and soft mud from Gullmarn Fjord, Sweden. Biodiversity Data Journal 5: e12731],
which included sequencing and comparative analysis of both COI and V1-V2 variable region of 18S rRNA
markers. Section "2.3. Sequencing procedures" of the "2. Materials and methods" was expanded in order
to address this comment and similar comment of the first reviewer.
Following text was added: Several different markers are used in barcoding and metabarcoding of biota,
including mitochondrial COI [34], ITS rRNA [35], multiple regions of 18S rRNA [1] and 28S rRNA [24,
36]. Nematode sequences used in this publication were generated as part of larger NGS-based
meiofauna survey [6], which included sequencing and comparative analysis of both standard animal
barcode COI [34] and marker encompassing V1-V2 variable region of 18S rRNA gene originally proposed
for barcoding of nematodes [37]. 18S rRNA sequence was chosen for subsequent analysis for the
following reasons: (1) 18S rRNA (V1-V2) region had higher sequencing success rate in nematodes with
139 OTUs versus only 22 COI OTUs generated using two different sets of primers [6]; (2) reference
dataset for marine nematodes includes over 300 high quality 18S sequences obtainable from GenBank,
whereas only about 60 COI barcodes of marine nematodes are available in BOLD; (3) this particular
genetic marker is commonly used in metabarcoding studies of marine meiofauna [2-3, 6, 38] and
plankton [39].
Page 2, line 14: Should colon be replaced with comma?
Response: Corrected.
Page 2, line 21: “Effective” could be defined more precisely.
Response: Corrected, replaced with "provides highest number of identified OTUs".
Page 2, line 36 (and other places): “anonymous metabarcodes (operational taxonomic units, OTUs)” I
think this is misleading because metabarcode and OTU don’t mean the same thing. Also, I don’t like
“anonymous” and would prefer “unidentified”. Perhaps “anonymous metabarcodes (operational
taxonomic units, OTUs)” could be replaced with “unidentified putative species (operational taxonomic
units, OTUs)”.
Response: Corrected. This section now reads "OTUs". More detailed definition of OTUs was moved to the
first paragraph following the recommendations of Reviewer 1, and reads: sequences of unidentified
putative species (operational taxonomic units, OTUs).
Page 2, line 54: “Although, it would..” Please remove comma.
Response: Corrected.
Page 3, line 24: “For technical reasons, none of these tools are included in this comparison” Did the
authors try PROTAX (Somervuo et al. 2016, Bioinformatics)? If it works, maybe it could be added.
Response: Unfortunately, at the time of analysis, PROTAX was not available yet. This software requires
manual creation of reference dataset to work. This task can not be accomplished within the limited
timeframe given to us by the editors of Royal Society Open Science for manuscript resubmission.
Therefore, we will not evaluate PROTTAX in this particular manuscript, but we will definitely try it in the
future.
Page 3, line 33 (and other places): I would recommend replacing “cladogram” with “phylogram” because
cladogram generally refers to a tree only showing branching order with all branches having equal
length.
Response: Corrected.
Page 5, 2.2. Morphology-based analysis of samples: Please mention how experienced the person who
identified the specimens is. Were some specific keys or guides etc. used?
Response: Morphology-based analysis of samples was done by the first author (as indicated in the
"Authors contributions" section), who is an expert on nematode taxonomy and systematics. His scientific
record includes over 110 publications on nematode taxonomy (including identification keys and book
chapters), over 100 new species and nine new genera. He is an editor for ZOOTAXA, and expert for the
WoRMS. World Register of Marine Species database and for NeMys. World Database of Free-Living
Marine Nematodes. We deeply respect the concerns of the reviewer, however, we feel it would be ill-
mannered to include such information in the text of the manuscript. Interested readers can access this
data using ORCID ID for the first author. As for the identification keys used in the process, the list is
overwhelming, and includes many original species descriptions.
Page 6: Why preliminary taxonomic assignment using QIIME was necessary? How many OTUs entered
this phase?
Response: Nematode OTUs were generated as part of the broader analysis of meiofaunal communities.
The sentence was modified and now reads: Preliminary taxonomic assignment was done using the
QIIME [41] script assign_taxonomy.py against the SILVA database [33] release 111 in order to identify
and separate nematode OTUs from the total of 1472 18S OTUs of meiofauna generated during previous
step [6].
Page 6, line 53: Should “nucleotide” be “sequence”?
Response: The phrase "Nucleotide collection" is a term used by the NIH NCBI web site:

Page 7, lines 10-12: “but only the results based on LCA range of 2% were retained for further analysis
and comparison.” Why? Please add justification.
Response: Results based on LCA range of 2% provided the highest number of identified OTUs. The
sentence was modified and now reads: The results based on LCA range of 2% provided the highest
number of identified OTUs and were retained for further analysis and comparison.
Page 7, line 34: “The reference dataset was trimmed to the barcoding region” How long were these
sequences?
Response: Following sentence was added: The final alignment was 433 bases long.
Page 9, line 44: “These examples shows” Please replace “shows” with “show”.
Response: Corrected.
Page 11, line 1: “most of the identified OTUs were assigned to the same families” I assume that the
authors mean that many family identifications were congruent among the methods, but this is not clear
and the sentence needs to be clarified.
Response: The sentence was modified as follows: Despite such a broad success rate, the family
identifications were in most cases congruent among different approaches – most of the identified OTUs
were assigned to the same families (Supplementary Table 8), with the following exceptions:
Page 11, lines 41-44: “Among families with available reference sequences barcode-based identification
failed to identify the families Phanodermatidae, Leptosomatidae, Trefusiidae, Epsilonematidae,
Draconematidae, Monoposthiidae and Sphaerolaimidae.” Why so many families failed? Perhaps this
could be discussed.
Response: The most likely explanation for this is that sequencing of the nematodes from these families
failed to produce OTUs, however, we have no data to try to explain what caused this or at what stage in
the process. Following sentence was added: One of the likely explanations is that nematodes from these
families failed to amplify or that barcode sequences produced during sequencing failed quality control.
