The paper focuses on the evolutionary development of GRO chemokines using various database-
related tools and analyses. Basically, I see nothing wrong with the manuscript and only have a
few minor suggestions for the authors to consider.
1 Abstract and introduction promise insights into the evolution-structure-function relationship,
maybe this is a bit of an overstatement.
2 The authors spend quite some time to discuss the GAG binding interface of the chemokines.
This is interesting, however, a secondary effect compared to the receptor binding of the
molecules. I have two suggestions: First, focus more on the evolutionary aspects of the receptor
binding domain and discuss consequences that arise from that. Second, motivate a bit better why
GAG binding is so relevant for these molecules. A figure showing the residues important for
receptor and GAG binding would help.
3 The usage of English language should be improved, many sentences read very cumbersome,

The paper entitled “Mechanistic Insights into Molecular Evolution of Species
Specific Differential Glycosaminoglycan Binding Surfaces in
GRO Chemokines” is about an interesting topic, the CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL3 evolution in
mammals and the identification of codons evolving under positive selection. However, the data
analyses have not been performed correctly and show severe inconsistencies.

Pedro Esteves, CIBIO, University of Porto, Portugal
In my opinion the most likely scenario to explain the CXCL1,2 and 3 evolution is the duplication
of these genes in the mammalian ancestral and then we have different evolutionary patterns in
each group. In the cetoartyodactila group we see high levels of gene conversion and in the
primates and rodents these genes underwent independent evolution patterns. The authors did
not discuss this properly in the paper. Moreover, the lagomorpha (rabbit) is more closely related
with the rodents than to cetoartyodactila, indeed lagomorphs and rodents belong to the
superorder Glires. Nonetheless, it has been shown that rodents have suffered an acceleration of
the mutation rate and as such may show as a basal group in phylogenies, apart from lagomorphs.
What cannot be is a rabbit sequence grouping with other cetoartiodactyla apart from the
remaining rabbit sequences. Something must be very wrong with the rabbit CXCL3 sequence.
My major problem in the paper is the usage of the PAML to evaluate positive selection: the gene
sequences should be evaluated independently (a set only with CXCL1 sequences, a set with
CXCL2 sequences and a set with only CXCL3); all sequences that suffered gene conversion
should be removed, the authors should confirm if the sequences suffered gene conversion using
specific software like RDP.
For all of these reasons I am not favorable to the publication of this paper as is. The data analyses
should be rethinked and reperformed. I suggest that the authors contact another group with
experience in the study of evolutionary patterns, in the detection of gene conversion and positive
selection in Chemokines and chemokine ligands.

We thank the reviewer for praising the work.
1 Abstract and introduction promise insights into the evolution-structure-function relationship,
maybe this is a bit of an overstatement.
Considering the reviewer’s suggestion, we have modified the statement(s) in the abstract and
introduction.
2 The authors spend quite some time to discuss the GAG binding interface of the chemokines.
This is interesting, however, a secondary effect compared to the receptor binding of the
molecules. I have two suggestions: First, focus more on the evolutionary aspects of the receptor
binding domain and discuss consequences that arise from that. Second, motivate a bit better why
GAG binding is so relevant for these molecules. A figure showing the residues important for
receptor and GAG binding would help.
As suggested, we have modified the related paragraphs emphasizing the importance of GAG
binding and elaborated the importance of these evolutionary events on receptor binding. A figure
(Fig. 1F) showing the residues important for both the receptor and GAG binding has been added
in the revised manuscript.

The paper entitled “Mechanistic Insights into Molecular Evolution of Species
Specific Differential Glycosaminoglycan Binding Surfaces in GRO Chemokines” is about an
interesting topic, the CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL3 evolution in mammals and the identification
of codons evolving under positive selection. However, the data analyses have not been
performed correctly and show severe inconsistencies.
We thank the reviewer for thought provoking comments and recognizing the importance of the
proposed work.
In my opinion the most likely scenario to explain the CXCL1,2 and 3 evolution is the duplication
of these genes in the mammalian ancestral and then we have different evolutionary patterns in
each group. In the cetoartyodactila group we see high levels of gene conversion and in the
primates and rodents these genes underwent independent evolution patterns. The authors did not
discuss this properly in the paper.
We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to incorporate the point on mammalian ancestral
gene of GRO chemokines and different evolutionary patterns in the successor genes. To study
this feature, we analyzed the evolutionary history of mammalian species (Sfig. 1,
Supplementary material of revised manuscript).
The two superorder branches of boreoeutheria (euarchontoglires and laurasiatheria),
showed distinguishable evolutionary pattern for GRO chemokines. In primates and rodents,
orthologs are closer than paralogs implying that GRO genes of primates and rodents have
duplicated before their diversification i.e., duplication of GRO genes in euarchonotoglires is pre-
speciation event. These facts indicate that the ancestor gene for GRO chemokines that are
observed in rodents, lagomorpha and primates is present in superorder euarchontoglires.
In case of perissodactyla, cetoartiodactyla and carnivora species, CXCL1, CXCL2 and
CXCL3 are more similar to their paralogs as compared to orthologs. This implies that the
duplication of GRO genes in ferreungulata is probably a post-speciation. Moreover, the number
of species annotated for all the three GRO chemokine genes are limited for laurasiatheria. Hence,
identifying the ancestral origin of GRO chemokines for laurasiatheria with current set of data is
essentially difficult. Full genome annotation of more mammalian species under laurasiatheria is
required to consider magnoorder boreoeutheria as the most probable ancestor for duplicated
2
GRO gene family. All the discussion regarding the ancestral gene and the role of gene
conversion has been discussed in detail in the revised manuscript.
Moreover, the lagomorpha (rabbit) is more closely related with the rodents than to
cetoartyodactila, indeed lagomorphs and rodents belong to the superorder Glires. Nonetheless, it
has been shown that rodents have suffered an acceleration of the mutation rate and as such may
show as a basal group in phylogenies, apart from lagomorphs. What cannot be is a rabbit
sequence grouping with other cetoartiodactyla apart from the remaining rabbit sequences.
Something must be very wrong with the rabbit CXCL3 sequence.
We do agree with the reviewer that lagomorpha species are closely related to rodents
compared to cetoartiodactyla. However, the phylogeny analysis of GRO genes yielded a slightly
distinct pattern to that of species evolutionary trend. As suggested by reviewer, we have cross
checked the rabbit CXCL3 sequence with the database, and also with the earlier published
literature (Ref 16 in Revised MS). Our results suggested that CXCL1, 2 and 3 of rabbits
(lagomorpha) and uungulates (cetoartiodactyla and perissodactyla) form one clade. Further,
within rabbit GRO genes, CXCL3 shows different behavior and is very close to the bovine
CXCL2, resulting in single node (Fig. 2, Revised MS). Modi et al have reported same topology
for mammalian/rabbit GRO genes by cloning the GRO chemokines of rabbit and some species of
artiodactyla (Ref 16 in Revised MS).
My major problem in the paper is the usage of the PAML to evaluate positive selection: the gene
sequences should be evaluated independently (a set only with CXCL1 sequences, a set with
CXCL2 sequences and a set with only CXCL3); all sequences that suffered gene conversion
should be removed, the authors should confirm if the sequences suffered gene conversion using
specific software like RDP. For all of these reasons I am not favorable to the publication of this
paper as is. The data analyses should be rethinked and reperformed.
As suggested by the reviewer, the data analysis has been re-performed. In the revised
version apart from PAML, we have analyzed the selection results using different selection
modules of “DATAMONKEY”. Further, we have presented the comprehensive analysis, which
include the selection for individual CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3 chemokines and also for the
analysis for total set of GRO chemokines (Table 1, Revised MS). Additional positive selection
sites are included and the results regarding the GRO chemokine selection has been corrected
accordingly.
The gene recombination & conversion phenomenon of GRO chemokines had been
analyzed using Genetic Algorithm Recombination Detection (GARD) approach and
GENECONV module of RDP4 program. No statistically significant gene conversion is observed
in GRO genes, this is similar to the behavior of chemokine ligands of CC receptors as reported
by de Matos et al (Ref. 58 in revised MS). We have discussed all these observations in the
revised MS.
