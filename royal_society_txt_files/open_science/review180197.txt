This paper examines the roles of behavior and environment on the range expansion of an
invasive species. The question is important and timely, and in general the paper is well written.
The study itself is sound and will make a good contribution to the field.
My comments are few and primarily editorial to clarify some points. Also, the introduction and
discussion could be streamlined-again, primarily to clarify the key points being made and also to
remove text that is digression or not fully supported by the data (see below).
Specific comments:
Lines 96-105: the rationale for linking climate factors to behavior is a bit vague and could be
better clarified. The end of this paragraph is even more confusing: the rational and specific
predictions of tadpole development should either be better developed or this section could be
dropped.
Line 119-129: Are the predicted patterns for Hawai’i (and those that were observed) paralleling
patterns observed in Australia? Some of the natural history details are hard to follow and a
concise statement would help.
Line 140: What constitutes 3 samples sites within a population (or to put it another way, how big
is a population so that 3 sites were sampled?)
Line 178: Mean temperatures are given—is that +/- SD or SE? Sd would be most useful for
providing insight into variation.
Line 214: Why separate tests for behavior versus a multivariate or principal component
approach?
Line 256-265: I’m not sure the data justify such a focus on plasticity (and this discussion seems a
unnecessary tangent to the study’s key results). Evolution can be rapid (see Grant and Grant,
Hendry, etc.) and in terms of generation times, time of separation is sufficient to produce the
results, depending on strength of selection and genetic variation. In other words, without a
compelling data, plasticity does not need to be invoked to explain divergence between
populations (and indeed, the authors undercut the argument in the subsequent paragraph).

Summary:
This study aimed to identify whether there has been any population divergence in behavior
between four populations of non-native cane toads that were introduced into the Hawaiian
islands back in the 1930’s. Specifically, this study aimed to determined whether possible
behavioral divergence of these populations was driven by climatic difference at the sites of
introduction or by range expansion. Here, the study took advantage of replicate invasions of cane
toads that occurred simultaneously onto the wet and dry side of two islands (Big Island/Hawaii
and Oahu). The authors quantified three behaviors of individuals from all four populations:
exploratory behavior, boldness and neophobia. Results indicated that toads from Hawaii were
less exploratory than individuals from Oahu, but there was no effect of climate on differences
observed in exploratory behavior. Additionally, individuals collected from the dry side of Hawaii
were more bold than those collected on the wet side, as well as different from both sides of Oahu.
Authors conclude that there is evidence of behavioral divergence between populations, but not
due to climate. They argue that divergence in these two behaviors is due to pressure for rapid
dispersal.
In general, I found this to be a straightforward study comparing multiple populations of a
notorious (and fascinating!) invader that has shown divergence in multiple traits following
invasion in Hawaii. The replicate invasions of the cane toad onto Hawaiian Islands is a nice
opportunity more test more general hypotheses about this species’ invasion. The design was
simple, straightforward and the experiments and analyses equally straightforward and well
done. The paper was also well written and easy to follow. My concerns are primarily with the set-
up of the study in the introduction and the interpretation and discussion of the results. Below I
relay my concerns and suggestions for revisions.
Introduction
In general, I found that much of the introduction sets the reader up for a comparison of
populations from both Hawaii and Australia, which eventually you realize is not the case. For
example:
Line 85-86: “We need a study system with multiple invasive populations that differ in whether or
not they are undergoing range expansion.”
Lines 106-118: This paragraph outlines the differences between Australia and Hawaii with
regards to the history of colonization and range expansion. If I understand the paragraph
correctly, Australia clearly has seen major range expansions of cane toads, whereas Hawaii
hasn’t. Again this sets the reader up for a comparison of Australia vs. Hawaii.
4
I’d suggest that the authors draw on Australia’s invasion pattern to demonstrate that behavioral
divergence has occurred in this species, but refocus the intro on Hawaii’s invasion history and
pattern. Furthermore, since there hasn’t been any range expansion on the Hawaiian islands, I’d
suggest focusing on the question of whether climatic differences may drive behavioral
divergence. I’d suggest drawing more broadly on the literature on how climate can generate
geographic variation in traits. In other words, I’d consider focusing on the “climate-driven”
hypothesis outlined in lines 119-129. To evaluate alternative hypotheses (climate vs. range
expansion), a comparison of the two continents would need to more formally happen. I think the
authors can discuss this and that it’s likely that the patterns of divergence between Australia and
Hawaii are due to different mechanisms, but should be cautious to set the study up as if it’s
formally doing this.
Methods:
This section is really nicely written & clear. My only suggestion might be to give a bit more detail
on the novel object used. For example, what color was it? Is there any concern with the color used
relative to the behavior it might have elicited, e.g. red can elicit certain behaviors not intended by
the assay. Additionally, why did the authors us a moving object? Maybe explain this.
Analyses: It might be interesting to examine whether there were any correlations between the
behaviors measured on the individuals, e.g. boldness vs. exploration, boldness vs. neophobia, etc.
Results:
Unless the journal discourages this, I’d suggest including the stats reported in Table 2 in the text
of the results as well. Or report means and SEs of the behaviors for each population x island side
and then report the p-value to indicate significance.
Discussion:
The introduction sets the reader up for a study that examined whether climate or range
expansion might have caused behavioral divergence in cane toads on two Hawaiian islands. The
focus on the discussion is largely on differences in behaviors between the two islands. While the
data does warrant some discussion of island differences (following the conclusion that climate
didn’t drive differences), I’d encourage the authors to be more cautious with this conclusion.
There was a significant difference in exploratory behavior between the islands, but the difference
in boldness was dependent upon the side of the island. All other behaviors measured were not
different between the islands. Basically only there was only an overall island difference in one
behavior. This may suggest some differences between the islands, but why didn’t the other
behaviors differ? It might be worthwhile to discuss the lack of a difference in the other behaviors
measured, but also tone back the conclusion given that the difference in boldness was dependent
in climate. Furthermore, the study design really wasn’t meant to examine island differences.
Rather, it seemed like testing populations from multiple islands was meant more for replication
purposes, e.g. ability to draw broader conclusions about climate by having replicate invasions
into wet/dry sides of the island. Again, there’s just a mismatch between the introduction, what
the study actually tested and what focus of the discussion.
The authors conclude that the results strongly falsify the hypothesis that climate drives
differences in behavior. On the Big Island, boldness did differ between the two sides of the island.
I think this result warrants some discussion and consideration. Again, I’d suggest scaling back
the strength of the conclusions being drawn in the discussion.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
Dear Dr. Gruber,
I have now received the comments from two reviewers with great expertise in this field. As you
will see both had a generally positive impression of your manuscript, and felt it was clear and
strait-forward. Reviewer 1 had only minor (mostly editorial) comments. Reviewer 2 had a few,
more substantial, comments that I believe you will be able to address. Both reviewers felt that
your introduction and discussion needed a little more work. Reviewer 2 also raised some issues
related to your interpretations and potential limitations of your study. Please pay careful
attention to these comments if you choose to revise this manuscript for RSOS.

Editor comments:
Reviewer 2 raises some very strong concerns that I think will take some time to address --
perhaps more than our "revise" timeframe. So the "r/r" decision partly reflects this, and also the
need for the authors to rethink the approach to several aspects of their manuscript. Thanks for
submitting.

The authors were very thorough and thoughtful about their revisions of the manuscript. I very

My main two concerns with the original manuscript were: 1) set up the introduction, and 2)

The introduction more strongly sets up the study's main research question (to examine the effects
of climate on behavioural divergence) and no longer leads the reader to expect a comparison of

My only suggestion now with the introduction is to maybe try and tighten up the new material
and be a bit more concise with the discussion of the literature on how climate variation affects

The authors also satisfied my concerns with the discussion. I have no further comments.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
Dear Dr. Gruber, I have now received the comments from two reviewers with great expertise
in this field. As you will see both had a generally positive impression of your manuscript, and
felt it was clear and strait-forward. Reviewer 1 had only minor (mostly editorial) comments.
Reviewer 2 had a few, more substantial, comments that I believe you will be able to address.
Both reviewers felt that your introduction and discussion needed a little more work. Reviewer
2 also raised some issues related to your interpretations and potential limitations of your
study. Please pay careful attention to these comments if you choose to revise this manuscript
for RSOS.
Editor comments: Reviewer 2 raises some very strong concerns that I think will take some
time to address -- perhaps more than our "revise" timeframe. So the "r/r" decision partly
reflects this, and also the need for the authors to rethink the approach to several aspects of
their manuscript. Thanks for submitting.

This paper examines the roles of behavior and environment on the range expansion of an
invasive species. The question is important and timely, and in general the paper is well
written. The study itself is sound and will make a good contribution to the field.
My comments are few and primarily editorial to clarify some points. Also, the introduction
and discussion could be streamlined-again, primarily to clarify the key points being made
and also to remove text that is digression or not fully supported by the data (see below).
Specific comments:
Lines 96-105: the rationale for linking climate factors to behavior is a bit vague and could be
better clarified. The end of this paragraph is even more confusing: the rational and specific
predictions of tadpole development should either be better developed or this section could be
dropped.
<U+F0B7> To clarify the rationale for looking at geographic climate variation and its effect on
dispersal-related behaviour, we have added extensive detail to the Introduction of how
variation in climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation can affect
behaviour and lead to geographic divergence in behavioural traits across a specie’s
range. We have also provided examples from the literature of how variation in climate
affects phenotypic traits including behaviour, and given details of why amphibians
may be particularly sensitive to climate differences across their range (L97-205).
Line 119-129: Are the predicted patterns for Hawai’i (and those that were observed)
paralleling patterns observed in Australia? Some of the natural history details are hard to
follow and a concise statement would help.
<U+F0B7> We have added a statement to the Introduction to clarify that the aim of this research
was to begin teasing apart the causal factors driving behavioural variation in invasive
populations of cane toads by examining the effect of wet and dry climates on
behavioural traits in the absence of prolonged range expansion as a stand-alone study,
which had no direct comparison to the Australian climate (L170-172).
Line 140: What constitutes 3 samples sites within a population (or to put it another way, how
big is a population so that 3 sites were sampled?)
<U+F0B7> As mentioned in the manuscript, Hawai’ian toads are mostly confined to relatively
small anthropogenically created habitats such as golf courses and parks. Hence, the
three sub-sample sites were separately located parks and golf courses within the four
main populations (i.e., Oahu dry-side, Oahu wet-side, Big Island dry-side, Big Island
wet-side). We have added this information to the Materials and Methods section
(L216-219).
Line 178: Mean temperatures are given—is that +/- SD or SE? Sd would be most useful for
providing insight into variation.
<U+F0B7> We have added that the mean temperature measure was +/- SD to the Materials and
Methods section (L255).
Line 214: Why separate tests for behavior versus a multivariate or principal component
approach?
Prior to building our final models, we used Spearman’s <U+03C1> correlation analysis to examine
pairwise correlations between behavioural traits from different trial types. Our analysis
revealed that only two of the six correlations were significant (Time spent moving –
Movement rate - Spearman’s <U+03C1>, 0.22, P = 0.02; Time spent moving – Time spent with novel
object - Spearman’s <U+03C1>, 0.29, P = 0.002), revealing that the behavioural variables were
largely describing different components of behaviour. Hence, we decided to analyse each of
our behavioural measures separately. We have now included details of the Spearman’s <U+03C1> test
in the Statistical Analysis section of the Materials and Methods (L299-300), details of the
results in the Results section (L331-340) and a table of the Spearman’s pairwise correlation
results (Table 3).
Line 256-265: I’m not sure the data justify such a focus on plasticity (and this discussion
seems a unnecessary tangent to the study’s key results). Evolution can be rapid (see Grant
and Grant, Hendry, etc.) and in terms of generation times, time of separation is sufficient to
produce the results, depending on strength of selection and genetic variation. In other words,
without a compelling data, plasticity does not need to be invoked to explain divergence
between populations (and indeed, the authors undercut the argument in the subsequent
paragraph).
We have removed the paragraph on plasticity from the Discussion.

Comments to the Author(s)
Summary:
This study aimed to identify whether there has been any population divergence in behavior
between four populations of non-native cane toads that were introduced into the Hawaiian
islands back in the 1930’s. Specifically, this study aimed to determined whether possible
behavioral divergence of these populations was driven by climatic difference at the sites of
introduction or by range expansion. Here, the study took advantage of replicate invasions of
cane toads that occurred simultaneously onto the wet and dry side of two islands (Big
Island/Hawaii and Oahu). The authors quantified three behaviors of individuals from all four
populations: exploratory behavior, boldness and neophobia. Results indicated that toads
from Hawaii were less exploratory than individuals from Oahu, but there was no effect of
climate on differences observed in exploratory behavior. Additionally, individuals collected
from the dry side of Hawaii were more bold than those collected on the wet side, as well as
different from both sides of Oahu. Authors conclude that there is evidence of behavioral
divergence between populations, but not due to climate. They argue that divergence in these
two behaviors is due to pressure for rapid dispersal.
In general, I found this to be a straightforward study comparing multiple populations of a
notorious (and fascinating!) invader that has shown divergence in multiple traits following
invasion in Hawaii. The replicate invasions of the cane toad onto Hawaiian Islands is a nice
opportunity more test more general hypotheses about this species’ invasion. The design was
simple, straightforward and the experiments and analyses equally straightforward and well
done. The paper was also well written and easy to follow. My concerns are primarily with the
set-up of the study in the introduction and the interpretation and discussion of the results.
Below I relay my concerns and suggestions for revisions.
Introduction
In general, I found that much of the introduction sets the reader up for a comparison of
populations from both Hawaii and Australia, which eventually you realize is not the case.
For example:
Line 85-86: “We need a study system with multiple invasive populations that differ in
whether or not they are undergoing range expansion.”
Lines 106-118: This paragraph outlines the differences between Australia and Hawaii with
regards to the history of colonization and range expansion. If I understand the paragraph
correctly, Australia clearly has seen major range expansions of cane toads, whereas Hawaii
hasn’t. Again this sets the reader up for a comparison of Australia vs. Hawaii.
I’d suggest that the authors draw on Australia’s invasion pattern to demonstrate that
behavioral divergence has occurred in this species, but refocus the intro on Hawaii’s
invasion history and pattern. Furthermore, since there hasn’t been any range expansion on
the Hawaiian islands, I’d suggest focusing on the question of whether climatic differences
may drive behavioral divergence. I’d suggest drawing more broadly on the literature on how
climate can generate geographic variation in traits. In other words, I’d consider focusing on
the “climate-driven” hypothesis outlined in lines 119-129. To evaluate alternative hypotheses
(climate vs. range expansion), a comparison of the two continents would need to more
formally happen. I think the authors can discuss this and that it’s likely that the patterns of
divergence between Australia and Hawaii are due to different mechanisms, but should be
cautious to set the study up as if it’s formally doing this.
<U+F0B7> We thank this reviewer for their detailed and useful suggestions on how to re-frame
the Introduction; the implementation of these suggestions has improved the clarity of
the manuscript. As suggested, we have re-structured the Introduction to clarify that
the focus of the research is to examine the effects of wet and dry climates on
behavioural divergence in Hawai’ian cane toads as a stand-alone study (as opposed to
an Australia versus Hawai’i comparison). We have also added extensive detail to the
Introduction of how variation in climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation
can affect behaviour and lead to geographic divergence in behavioural traits across a
specie’s range. We have provided examples from the literature of how variation in
climate affects phenotypic traits including behaviour, and given details of why
amphibians may be particularly sensitive to climate differences across their range
(L97-205).
Methods:
This section is really nicely written & clear. My only suggestion might be to give a bit more
detail on the novel object used. For example, what color was it? Is there any concern with the
color used relative to the behavior it might have elicited, e.g. red can elicit certain behaviors
not intended by the assay. Additionally, why did the authors us a moving object? Maybe
explain this.
<U+F0B7> In our pilot studies, we tested the response of toads to moving lures of a variety of
colours including red, green, yellow and blue, and black and white. We found that
toads did not vary in their responses to different coloured lures hence, we had no
concerns about the colour of the lure eliciting unwanted behaviours in the assay. We
chose to use a moving lure as we wanted to simulate a novel prey item and to ensure
that the toads (whose vision is acutely tuned to prey movement, as opposed to just the
presence of a static prey item) could easily see that there was a novel object inside the
transparent pod. We have added this detail to the Materials and Methods section
(L257-258, L281-283).
Analyses:
It might be interesting to examine whether there were any correlations between the behaviors
measured on the individuals, e.g. boldness vs. exploration, boldness vs. neophobia, etc.
<U+F0B7> As mentioned in our response to a similar query from Reviewer 1, prior to running
our final models, we used Spearman’s <U+03C1> correlation analysis to examine pairwise
correlations between behavioural traits from different trial types. Our analysis
revealed that only two of the six correlations were significant (Time spent moving –
Movement rate - Spearman’s <U+03C1>, 0.22, P = 0.02; Time spent moving – Time spent
with novel object - Spearman’s <U+03C1>, 0.29, P = 0.002), revealing that the behavioural
variables were largely describing different components of behaviour. We have now
included details of the Spearman’s <U+03C1> test in the Statistical Analysis section of the
Materials and Methods (L299-300), details of the results in the Results section (L331-
340) and a table of the Spearman’s pairwise correlation results (Table 3).
Results:
Unless the journal discourages this, I’d suggest including the stats reported in Table 2 in the
text of the results as well. Or report means and SEs of the behaviors for each population x
island side and then report the p-value to indicate significance.
We do not think that it is allowable to include statistics in the text section of the Results that
are already presented in a results Table (Table 2). However, if the journal deems that it is
appropriate to make an exception in this case, we are happy to make this change.
Discussion:
The introduction sets the reader up for a study that examined whether climate or range
expansion might have caused behavioral divergence in cane toads on two Hawaiian islands.
The focus on the discussion is largely on differences in behaviors between the two islands.
While the data does warrant some discussion of island differences (following the conclusion
that climate didn’t drive differences), I’d encourage the authors to be more cautious with this
conclusion. There was a significant difference in exploratory behavior between the islands,
but the difference in boldness was dependent upon the side of the island. All other behaviors
measured were not different between the islands. Basically only there was only an overall
island difference in one behavior. This may suggest some differences between the islands, but
why didn’t the other behaviors differ? It might be worthwhile to discuss the lack of a
difference in the other behaviors measured, but also tone back the conclusion given that the
difference in boldness was dependent in climate. Furthermore, the study design really wasn’t
meant to examine island differences. Rather, it seemed like testing populations from multiple
islands was meant more for replication purposes, e.g. ability to draw broader conclusions
about climate by having replicate invasions into wet/dry sides of the island. Again, there’s
just a mismatch between the introduction, what the study actually tested and what focus of the
discussion.
The authors conclude that the results strongly falsify the hypothesis that climate drives
differences in behavior. On the Big Island, boldness did differ between the two sides of the
island. I think this result warrants some discussion and consideration. Again, I’d suggest
scaling back the strength of the conclusions being drawn in the discussion.
Again, we thank this reviewer for their suggestions which have improved the
Discussion and its link to the Introduction of this manuscript. As suggested, we have altered
the Discussion to be more in-line with the Introduction by focussing on a comparison of
dispersal-related behaviour between wet and dry climates as opposed to a comparison of the
two Hawai’ian islands. We have included discussion of the potential reasons why behavioural
traits did not differ between toads from wet and dry climates and we have toned back the
strength of our conclusion that our results strongly falsify an effect of climate on behaviour
(L345-426).

20 Abstract
21
22 Invasive species must deal with novel challenges, both from the alien environment and from
23 pressures arising from range expansion per se (e.g., spatial sorting). Those conditions can
24 create geographic variation in behaviour across the invaded range, as has been documented
25 across regions of Australia invaded by cane toads; range-edge toads are more exploratory and
26 willing to take risks than are conspecifics from the range core. That behavioural divergence
27 might be a response to range expansion and invasion per se, or to the different environments
28 encountered. Climate differs across the cane toad’s invasion range from the wet tropics of
29 Queensland to the seasonally dry climates of northwestern Western Australia. The different
30 thermal and hydric regimes may affect behavioural traits via phenotypic plasticity or through
31 natural selection. We cannot tease apart the effects of range expansion versus climate in an
32 expanding population but can do so in a site where the colonising species was simultaneously
33 released in all suitable areas, thus removing any subsequent phase of range expansion. Cane
34 toads were introduced to Hawai’i in 1932; and thence to Australia in 1935. Toads were
35 released in all major sugarcane-growing areas in Hawai’i within a 12-month period. Hence,
36 Hawai’ian cane toads provide an opportunity to examine geographic divergence in
37 behavioural traits in a climatically diverse region (each island has both wet and dry sides) in
38 the absence of range expansion subsequent to release. We conducted laboratory-based
39 behavioural trials testing exploration, risk-taking and response to novelty using field-caught
40 toads from the wet and dry sides of two Hawai’ian islands (Oahu and Hawai’i). Toads from
41 the dry-side of Oahu had a higher propensity to take risks than did toads from the dry-side of
42 Hawai’i. Toads from Oahu were also more exploratory than were conspecifics from the
43 island of Hawai’i. However, toads from wet versus dry climates were similar in all
44 behaviours that we scored, suggesting that founder effects, genetic drift, or developmentally
45 plastic responses to ecological factors other than climate may have driven behavioural
46 divergence between islands.

64 Introduction
65
66 At the range-front of an ongoing invasion, vanguard individuals encounter novel ecological
67 and evolutionary pressures that are not experienced by conspecifics from long-colonised
68 areas (Phillips et al. 2010). There are two broad reasons why we might expect to see
69 distinctive behavioural phenotypes in an invasive population. The first is that they are
70 encountering novel ecological challenges (e.g., climate, habitat, predators and prey), best
71 dealt with by specific behaviours such as a propensity to explore, engage with novel objects
72 and take risks. The second explanation involves the process of range expansion, which may
73 lead to higher frequencies of traits at the range front as a result of natural selection, plasticity
74 and non-adaptive processes such as spatial sorting (increased dispersal rates due to assortative
75 mating of fast-dispersing individuals: Shine et al. 2011) and surfing of deleterious mutations
76 (Excoffier et al. 2009; Travis et al. 2007).
77 Individuals with dispersal-enhancing behavioural traits such as high levels of exploration,
78 neophilia (an attraction to novelty) and risk-taking are predicted to be more common in
79 invasion-front than in long-colonised populations both because they enhance an individual’s
80 ability to find food and shelter in novel environments (Cote et al. 2010a; Chapple et al. 2012;
81 Sih et al. 2012) and because these traits increase dispersal rates (Dingemanse et al. 2007;
82 Fraser et al. 2001). In keeping with this prediction, dispersal-enhancing behavioural traits are
83 associated with range-expansion and invasion success in several species (Table 1). A key
84 question in invasion biology is whether variation in behavioural traits during an invasion is a
85 consequence of encountering novel environments, such as new climatic conditions, or due to
86 the pressures imposed by range expansion? To answer this question, we need a study system
87 with multiple invasive populations that differ in whether or not they are undergoing range
88 expansion.
89 The cane toad (Rhinella marina, [Linnaeus 1758]) is a notoriously successful invasive
90 species (Lever 2001). Originally from Central and South America, cane toads were
91 introduced to the Caribbean in an attempt to control pests in sugar cane plantations before
92 being introduced to Hawai’i in 1932 (Lever 2001; Pemberton 1949). Cane toads from the
93 Hawai’ian population were introduced to Australia in 1935 (Easteal 1981; Turvey 2009). The
94 ongoing cane toad invasion in Australia has been accompanied by divergence in behavioural
95 traits across the invasion range. Invasion-front toads are more exploratory and more willing
96 to take risks than are conspecifics from long-colonised populations (Gruber et al. 2017a).
97 Such behavioural divergence across the cane toads’ Australian invasion range may be related
98 to range expansion, or to other factors such as variation in climate between the range-edge
99 and the range-core. Precipitation decreases from the north-east to the north-west of the cane
100 toad’s Australian invasion range (Trumbo et al. 2016). Cane toads from long-colonised
101 populations in north-eastern Australia experience a monsoonal climate with a warm wet
102 season followed by a cooler dry season, whereas cane toads at the invasion front in north-
103 western Australia experience long periods of intense heat and aridity (Trumbo et al. 2016).
104 Such climatic differences could plausibly lead to divergence in cane toad behaviour via
105 adaptation (if there is a differential fitness benefit of dispersal-enhancing behavioural traits
106 across the range) or through plastic behavioural responses to changing climates.
107 Climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation can have profound effects on an
108 organism’s physiology, morphology, life-history and fitness (Davenport and Hossack 2016).
109 Geographic variation in climate has been linked to divergence in phenotypic traits across
110 species ranges in many taxa. For example, cold temperatures lead to larger body size
111 (Bergmann’s rule or the temperature-size rule, Abrams et al. 2017; Atkinson et al. 1994) in
112 birds (Ashton 2002), insects (Abrams et al. 2017; Moiroux et al. 2015), and chelonian reptiles
113 (Ashton and Feldman 2003). And water uptake in two species of anuran Rhinella humbolti
114 and Leptodactylus fuscus is slower in individuals from wet versus environments compared to
115 conspecifics from dry environments (Cruz-Piedrahita et al. 2017). And low temperature and
116 precipitation leads to smaller thicker leaves, less trichomes and dwarf phenotypes compared
117 to conspecifics inhabiting warmer areas with more rainfall in one of Hawai’i’s most common
118 tree species, Metrosideros polymorpha (Tsujii et al. 2016).
119 Variation in climate across a species range Climatic factors may also affect behavioural traits.
120 For example, individuals may respond to sub-optimal temperatures or precipitation by
121 behavioural thermoregulation, reducing energetically costly dispersal behaviours such as
122 exploration and risk-taking (Abrams et al. 2017; Brown et al. 2011; Dupoué et al. 2017;
123 Moiroux et al. 2015). Temperature and rainfall also may influence dispersal-related
124 behaviours by constraining the available habitat and thus, influencing an individual’s ability
125 to disperse out of their home range (Cruz-Piedrahita et al. 2017). For example, in dry regions
126 where rainfall is infrequent, dispersal-enhancing traits such as exploration, risk-taking and
127 seeking novelty neophilia may be selected against and philopatry to known water and food
128 resources may be favoured (Astrom and Part 2013). In contrast, in areas where rainfall is high
129 and aseasonal, dispersal-enhancing behaviours al traits may be favoured as the risks of
130 desiccation with dispersal are low and dispersing individuals may benefit from accessing new
131 resource patches (Brown et al. 2013).
132 Amphibians are acutely sensitive to the temperature and humidity of their local climate
133 because of the challenges they face maintaining optimal body temperatures and water balance
134 with their permeable skin, and because they rely on water bodies for survival and
135 reproduction (Brown et al. 2011; Wells 2010). Environmental factors such as temperature,
136 moisture and water quality can substantially modify developmental trajectories of anuran
137 amphibians (Ducatez et al. 2016; Indermaur et al. 2010). Several anuran species are known to
138 exhibit behavioural adaptations to climate, particularly in response to arid conditions. For
139 example, specialised behaviours allowing individuals to seek out and remain within close
140 proximity to humid refugia, are common in anurans (Navas et al. 2002). Cane toads from the
141 seasonally arid areas of their Australian invasion range exhibit behavioural plasticity in
142 response to climatic conditions; exhibiting higher philopatry to water sources in dry versus
143 wet conditions (Brown et al. 2011; Florance et al. 2011). Models developed to predict the
144 future expansion of the cane toad’s Australian invasion range predict that climate limits range
145 expansion by restricting movement in cooler southern areas and the availability of water for
146 breeding in arid regions (Kearney et al. 2008). There is also evidence of a link between
147 climate and divergence in behavioural traits across the invasion range; toads from the arid
148 range-edge maintain higher locomotor performance under desiccating conditions than do
149 conspecifics from the wetter range-core (Tingley et al. 2012). Hence, the geographic
150 divergence of dispersal-related behaviours such as exploration, risk-taking and neophilia
151 evident in cane toads across their Australian invasion range (Gruber et al. 2017a) may be
152 driven by responses to the profoundly different climates experienced by individuals
153 inhabiting the range-edge versus the range-core. Because the cane toad’s Australian invasion
154 is still expanding, it is difficult to distinguish the effects of climate from those of range
155 expansion. To disentangle the effects of range expansion versus climate on behavioural
156 divergence in cane toads, we need an invasive population that occurs across geographically
157 divergent climates, but that has not undergone a period of extended range expansion.
158 In Hawai’i, cane toads were distributed to all sugarcane-growing areas on the main islands
159 within a brief period (> 100,000 individuals released from 1933 to 1934; Pemberton 1949).
160 Subsequent dispersal has been minimal, due to the arid volcanic mountains that separate the
161 wet and dry-sides of the Hawai’ian islands (Lever 2001; Turvey 2009; Ward-Fear et al.
162 2016). In contrast, cane toads were introduced (from Hawai’i) to Australia at about the same
163 time (1935) but in only one area (along the northeast coast), and have since spread out >
164 3,000 km to the west (Urban et al. 2007). Like Australia, the Hawai’ian islands exhibit
165 profound spatial heterogeneity in climate; but in Hawai’i, that heterogeneity involves the
166 contrast between a wet (leeward) and dry (windward) side on each island (Sanderson 1993).
167 Here, we used standardised laboratory-based behavioural assays to test dispersal-related
168 behaviour of toads from wet and dry areas on two Hawai’ian islands, allowing us to
169 investigate if behavioural divergence is driven by climate in this species.
170 The Hawai’ian landscape is rugged with porous volcanic soil. Rainfall differs between the
171 eastern windward (wet) and western leeward (dry) sides of the Hawai’ian islands; wet-sides
172 have high levels of aseasonal rainfall, whilst rain-shadows lead to extreme aridity on the dry-
173 sides of each island (Sanderson 1993; Ward-Fear et al. 2016). Cane toads that inhabit the dry
174 side of each island are mostly confined to anthropogenically-created oases within an
175 otherwise arid and hostile landscape. In contrast, on the wet-side of each island where
176 rainfall is frequent, the landscape is more homogenous and there is ground moisture and
177 vegetation cover, enabling toads to disperse more freely (Sanderson 1993; Ward-Fear et al.
178 2016). Hence, toads on the dry-side of each island may be no more water-stressed than are
179 conspecifics in wet areas (as they inhabit well-watered areas such as parks and gardens), but
180 dispersal of dry-side toads may be restricted by the lack of rainfall and the arid matrix. In
181 keeping with this prediction, toads are widely dispersed across the wet-sides of each island,
182 but are restricted to well-watered parks and golf-courses on the dry-sides (Ward-Fear et al.
183 2016).
184 Precipitation and its effect on landscape matrix permeability can have profound effects on
185 movement and dispersal behaviour (Astrom and Part 2013). For example, Dispersal-
186 enhancing behavioural traits may be selected against in individuals inhabiting a small habitat
187 patch that provides resources such as food, water and shelter in a low rainfall area, within an
188 otherwise arid matrix (Zug and Zug 1979). This is because the costs of dispersal outweigh the
189 benefits (such as decreased competition and access to new resource patches) (Evans et al.
190 2017). Behavioural traits that enhance exploration and dispersal out of the home range may
191 be particularly costly for cane toads inhabiting the dry-sides of each Hawai’ian island
192 because in the surrounding matrix food is scarce and standing water-bodies for breeding and
193 rehydration are rare (Ward-Fear et al. 2016).
194 Hence, we predict that toads inhabiting the dry-sides of each island will exhibit low levels of
195 exploration, risk-taking and neophilic behavioural traits due to the concentration of essential
196 resources and the costs associated with dispersal from these human-created oases. In contrast,
197 we predict that toads on the wet-sides of each island will exhibit high levels of exploration,
198 risk-taking and neophilic behavioural traits as the high and aseasonal rainfall allows dispersal
199 across the landscape, providing access to new resource patches.

205 hand from four populations (30 toads/population): the wet (leeward) side and the dry
206 (windward) side of Oahu, and the wet (leeward) side and dry (windward) side of Hawai’i
207 (henceforth referred to as the Big Island, to avoid confusion). Mean annual rainfall averages
208 are between 3,550 – 7,850 mm at the “wet” sites both on Oahu and the Big Island, and
209 between 204 and 2,750 mm in the “dry” sites of both islands (average rainfall for the 30-year
210 period, 1978-2007 - Giambelluca et al. 2013). Fifteen toads of each sex were collected from
211 each of four sample populations (Oahu dry-side, Oahu wet-side, Big Island dry-side, Big
212 Island wet-side) and toads were collected from three sub-sample sites (mostly constituting
213 separate parks and golf courses) within each population. Toads > 90 mm snout-urostyle
214 length [SUL]) were classified as adults and their sex was determined by the absence of
215 nuptial pads on the fore-limbs and lack of a ‘release call’ when held (only males have nuptial
216 pads and are able to make release calls in this species: Bowcock, Brown & Shine, 2008).
217 Toads were weighed to the nearest 0.1 g on a digital scale, and measured (SUL) to the nearest
218 0.01 mm using digital calipers. They were transported in moist calico bags to an animal-
219 holding facility near the town of Hilo on the Big Island, where they were immediately
220 released into their housing tubs and provided with water.
221 Toads were housed in 70 L plastic tubs (measuring 645 mm x 413 mm x 397 mm) in groups
222 of three to four individuals per tub. Each tub had a substrate of wood-chip bedding and
223 contained two opaque plastic shelters, and a large shallow water dish. Toads were fed store-
224 bought crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) or mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) every two days and
225 water was provided ad libitum. Because adult toads are most active at night (Lever 2001),
226 room lights were activated from 03:30 – 15:30 h each day, to allow behavioural trials to be
227 carried out in the dark phase between 1530 and 2200 h. Toads showed no signs of stress or
228 illness and ate well, either maintaining or gaining weight during their time in captivity.
229 General Methods
230 Each toad was tested in three different behavioural trials: (1) Exploration, (2) Risk-taking
231 (emergence from a shelter into the test arena), and (3) Neophilia (response to a novel
232 stimulus). Trials ran for 30 minutes and four trials with one toad per trial arena were
233 conducted simultaneously in each trial round. It took five trial rounds (of four toads running
234 simultaneously) to run 20 toads in one day, and six days to run all animals through each trial
235 type. Toads were randomly selected from each population and sex group, with the proviso
236 that an equal number of toads from each population and each sex were represented in each
237 trial round (e.g., in any one round, an equal number of randomly selected males and females
238 from the wet and dry Oahu or wet and dry Big Island were represented). Each toad had two
239 days of rest between trial types (while the other sets of 20 toads were assayed). Toads from
240 the two islands (Oahu and the Big Island) were assayed consecutively rather than
241 simultaneously due to logistical and space constraints.
242 Trial arenas were large (120 x 120 x 83 cm) hexagonal pens made from waterproof fabric
243 with an open top to allow filming from above (Figure 1). All trials were filmed using CCTV
244 cameras under low-level red light and we scored videos using Ethovision XT10 behavioural
245 analysis software (ensuring that blind methods were used to score the videos). Researchers
246 left the room at the start of trials to minimize interference. The PVC substrates (and shelters,
247 etc.) of each arena were wiped down with diluted ethanol before each trial to eliminate scent
248 from previous trials. We measured the arena substrate temperature before each trial (mean:
249 28±2 SD °C). At the start of a trial, toads were placed under shelters for five minutes before
250 the refuge was removed. During “neophilia” trials, toads were presented with a novel object
251 (a blue and red silicone squid-mimic fishing lure that moved in a bobbing motion every 2 s to
252 simulate a novel prey item) inside a clear plastic container. Because toads may have
253 approached and settled next to the container to seek a hiding place (rather than out of interest
254 in the novel object), we included an empty container in all trials to disambiguate hiding
255 behaviour from interest in novel object (for consistency in the layout of the arena, empty
256 containers were also included in exploration and emergence trials; Figure 1).
257 Behavioural Trial Protocols
258 Exploratory Trial - To test exploration and space-use in a novel environment (Cote et al.
259 2010b; Fraser et al. 2001; Wilson et al. 1993), we measured time spent moving and rate of
260 movement (Milot, Bégout and Chatain, 2009; Adriaenssens & Johnsson 2010). Toads were
261 given five minutes’ rest under a shelter before the shelter was removed and trials began. An
262 empty container and a shelter were placed at one end of the arena (Figure 1). The shelter gave
263 toads the option to hide during the trial, allowing us to distinguish bold exploratory behaviour
264 from fear-driven escape behaviour (see Realé et al. 2007).
265 Emergence Trial - To score risk-taking behaviour, we recorded whether or not a toad
266 emerged from its shelter, and latency to emerge (s). Two empty containers were placed at the
267 opposite end of the arena to the shelter (Figure 1). The entrance to the shelter was initially
268 covered, and toads were given five minutes’ rest under the shelter before the entrance cover
269 was removed and trials began. A shorter latency to emerge from the shelter indicates higher
270 risk-taking propensity in animals generally (Brodin et al. 2013; Cote et al. 2010b; Yoshida et
271 al. 2005). We defined emergence into a novel environment from a safe shelter as a measure
272 of risk-taking, whereas exploration behaviour is defined as space-use in a novel environment
273 (Verbeek et al. 1994; Wilson et al. 1993).
274 Novel Object Trial - To test an individual’s attraction or aversion to a moving novel object
275 (intended to simulate a moving novel prey item), we added a red and blue silicone fishing
276 lure (20 x 10mm, mimicking a squid) driven by a small motor to move up and down in a
277 fixed position every 2 s (Figure 1). The novel object was inside a container to prevent the
278 toad from consuming the plastic lure. Toads were given five minutes’ rest under a shelter,
279 which was placed at the opposite end of the arena to the novel object, before the shelter was
280 removed and trials began. We measured whether or not the toad approached the novel object,
281 the latency to approach the novel object, and the time the toad spent within 2 cm of the novel
282 object.
283 Statistical Analysis
284 We used general linear models to analyse the effects of island (Oahu-Big Island), climate
285 (wet-dry) and their interaction on behavioural traits. The potentially confounding factors sex,
286 mass (g), arena and trial number were included as main effects in all models. We ran separate
287 models for all behavioural traits. Prior to building our final model, we ran investigatory
288 models comparing the three sub-populations within each main population (Oahu dry, Oahu
289 wet, Big Island dry, Big Island wet) to look for variation in behavioural traits. We found that
290 sub-populations did not differ significantly in any behavioural traits within each main
291 population, thus we grouped sub-populations together to increase the power of our final
292 models. We used Tukey’s post hoc tests to run pairwise comparisons to interpret the nature of
293 trait variation as appropriate. We also used Spearman’s <U+03C1> correlation analysis to examine
294 pairwise correlations between behavioural traits from different trial types. All data were
295 checked for normality and homoscedasticity and log-transformed to meet these assumptions
296 as required. All data were analysed using the “car” package (Fox and Weisberg 2011) in R (R
297 Core Team, 2017). We used generalised linear models (‘glm’ function in R) with a binomial
298 logit link function to compare whether or not toads emerged during risk-taking trials and
299 whether toads approached within 2cm of the novel object during neophilia trials.
300 The behavioural traits measured for each trial type were: 1.) total time spent moving, and rate
301 of movement (as quantified by the residual scores from a general linear regression of total
302 distance moved against total time spent moving; exploratory trials); 2.) emergence (binomial,
303 whether or not individuals emerged during trials) and latency to emerge (emergence trials);
304 and 3.) whether or not toads approached to within 2 cm of the novel object (binomial),
305 latency to approach and time spent within 2 cm of the novel object novel object trials).
306
307 Results
308
309 Toads from Oahu spent more time moving during exploration trials than did conspecifics
310 from the Big Island (Table 2, Figure 2a). We found no interaction effect between island and
311 climate, nor an effect of any other factors on the time toads spent moving during exploration
312 trials (Table 2). Similarly, there was no effect of an interaction between island and climate,
313 island and climate alone, nor sex, mass or trial number on the rate of toad movement (Table
314 2). There was an effect of arena on movement rate; toads trialed in arena number one had a
315 higher rate of movement than did toads in any of the other three arenas (Table 2). However,
316 this significant effect occurred only for this behavioural measure.
317 We found an interaction effect of island and climate on the latency of toads to emerge from
318 the shelter during risk-taking trials; toads from the dry side of the Big Island took
319 significantly longer to emerge than did toads from the dry side of Oahu (Table 2, Figure 2b).
320 During risk-taking trials, similar proportions of Oahu and Big Island toads from both wet and
321 dry climates emerged and had similar emergence latencies (Table 2). Toads from each island
322 and climate type also responded in a similar way to the novel object during neophilia trials
323 (Table 2). Other factors such as sex, mass, arena and trial number had no significant effect on
324 any behavioural traits during risk-taking or neophilia trials (Table 2). Spearman’s <U+03C1> analysis
325 showed significant correlations between only two of the six pairwise correlations of
326 behavioural variables measured from different trial types (exploration, risk-taking and
327 neophilia), suggesting that the different trial types largely measured different components of
328 behaviour (Table 3). The two significant correlations were between time spent moving in the
329 exploration trial and time spent with the novel object during the neophilia trial, and between
330 time spent moving and rate of movement (both measured during the exploration trial; this
331 result may reflect the fact that we calculated rate of movement using residuals from a
332 regression of time spent moving and distance moved: Table 3).
333
334 Discussion
335 We found that the brief period of separation (slightly more than 80 years) of the four
336 populations of cane toads that we sampled has been accompanied by divergence in
337 behavioural traits. In our trials, toads from the dry-side of Oahu were bolder; that is, they
338 were quicker to emerge from a shelter than were conspecifics from the dry-side of the Big
339 Island. Toads from both wet and dry sides of Oahu were also more exploratory (spent more
340 time moving in a novel environment) than were conspecifics from the Big Island. Contrary to
341 our prediction, behavioural traits of cane toads did not differ between populations from wet
342 versus dry climates.
343 Why didn’t behaviour differ between toads from wet versus dry climates? There is a marked
344 disparity in hydric regimes between the wet (windward) and dry (leeward) sides of each
345 island (Sanderson 1993; Osborn 2016). For example, mean annual rainfall averages are
346 between 3,550 – 7,850 mm at the ‘wet’ sites both on Oahu and the Big Island, and between
347 204 - 2,750 mm on the ‘dry’ sites of both islands (Giambelluca et al. 2013). Frequent rainfall
348 on the wet sides of both islands may allow toads to disperse through the landscape between
349 favourable habitat patches, whereas such dispersal is unlikely on the dry-side of each island
350 (Ward-Fear et al. 2016). Hence, we predicted that behavioural divergence among populations
351 would reflect this dichotomy in hydric regimes, not through physiological water-stress per se
352 (as dry-side toads often inhabit well-watered human-created landscapes) but because the
353 hydric environment restricts toad movement and dispersal on the dry sides of the islands.
354 The hypothesis that toad behaviour evolves in response to hydric regimes predicts that toads
355 from the leeward side of each island should be more similar to each other than they are to
356 toads from windward sites on the same island (and vice versa). Our data did not support this
357 prediction. First, the behavioural divergence we saw in Hawai’ian toads was in exploration
358 behaviour between islands and in risk-taking behaviour between the dry sides of each island,
359 not between ‘wet’ and ‘dry’ habitats (Figure 2). Clearly, then, effects or adaptations related to
360 water availability cannot explain the behavioural divergence that has accumulated in invasive
361 populations of cane toads over the last 80 years.
362 The lack of significant effects of climate on behavioural traits may be due to similarities in
363 the local environment in the areas toads inhabit on the wet and dry sides of each island. Cane
364 toads in Hawai’i mostly inhabit well-watered anthropogenically-created landscapes such as
365 parks and golf courses, hence toads from both wet and dry climates experience similar local
366 hydric regimes (Ward-Fear et al. 2016). We predicted that toads on the dry side of the islands
367 would be less exploratory, risk-taking and neophilic because of the costs of dispersal and
368 movement restrictions enforced by the arid landscape surrounding these human-tended home
369 ranges. However, toads may not need to venture beyond their human-created oases in order to
370 access resources such as food, mates and shelter, favouring similar behaviours in all
371 locations.
372 Although we found no effect of wet versus dry climates on toad behaviour, we did find a
373 difference in exploration behaviour between the two islands. Toads from Oahu spent more
374 time moving than did Big Island conspecifics. Risk-taking behaviour also differed between
375 toads from the dry-sides of each island; Oahu toads were quicker to emerge from a shelter
376 than were Big Island toads. The dry-side of Oahu has a higher average annual rainfall than
377 does the dry-side of the Big Island, while average annual rainfall on the wet-side of Oahu is
378 lower than on the wet-side of the Big Island (dry-side average annual rainfall: Oahu 499 mm,
379 Big Island 234 mm; wet-side average annual rainfall: Oahu 2473 mm, Big Island 3500 mm;
380 Giambelluca et al. 2013). The higher rainfall on the dry-side of Oahu may provide more
381 windows of opportunity for toads to explore beyond their home ranges, compared to those of
382 toads inhabiting lower rainfall areas on the dry-side of the Big Island. However, we doubt
383 that variation in climate drives behavioural divergence as we did not find significant
384 behavioural differences between populations with the most acute opposites of climate: that is,
385 populations from the wet versus the dry sides of each island. The most parsimonious
386 explanation for between-island differences in behaviour may be genetic drift. That
387 explanation, however, is weakened by the fact that founding populations at each site
388 contained large numbers of individuals (reducing stochastic effects on allele frequencies:
389 Lockwood, Cassey & Blackburn, 2005) and the putative lack of gene flow between
390 populations on the ‘wet’ and ‘dry’ sides of each island. If divergence was due to genetic drift,
391 we would not expect parallel evolution in the two isolated sides of each island. All we can
392 suggest is that some as-yet-undocumented ecological difference between Oahu and the Big
393 Island (such as prey availability, habitat complexity or predation pressure) has generated
394 differences in toad behaviour, either as an adaptation or as a phenotypically plastic response.
395 Alternatively, the geographic divergence in exploration behaviour (between cane toads from
396 Oahu versus the Big Island) and risk-taking behaviour (between cane toads from the dry-
397 sides of each island) might be genetically based, despite the short time-frame of their
398 isolation. Over the same period, and despite a continuous distribution, populations of cane
399 toads across tropical Australia have diverged in many phenotypic traits; and the same
400 divergences are seen in offspring raised in “common garden” experiments (Brown et al.
401 2014; Brown et al. 2015; Phillips 2009; Gruber et al. 2017b). Cane toads are, therefore,
402 capable of evolving heritable differences within the timespan over which populations in the
403 two Hawai’ian islands have been isolated from each other.
404 Further research could usefully explore the ecological context of cane toad ontogeny at a
405 range of Hawai’ian sites, to clarify the as-yet-unexplained pattern of consistency in some
406 behavioural traits within but not between islands. It would also be informative to compare
407 factors that may affect behaviour such as resource availability, population densities and
408 competition between wet and dry sites; and to study the mechanistic basis for inter-island
409 divergence in exploration and risk-taking traits by raising offspring in common garden
410 experiments (as has been done for Australian populations: Gruber et al. 2017b; Phillips 2009;
411 Hudson et al. 2016). Even without answering these further questions, however, our data show
412 that 80 years of genetic isolation has been accompanied by significant divergence of
413 exploration and risk-taking behavioral traits between, but not within, the two Hawai’ian
414 islands that we studied. Our results reinforce the ability of invasive populations to diverge
415 rapidly, even in the absence of evolutionary pressures associated with prolonged range
416 expansion.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Alexander Ophir):
Dear Dr. Gruber,
I have just received the review from one of your original referees and and pleased to recommend your
manuscript for acceptance in RSOS. Thank you for your contribution. You will see that the reviewer
noted that you could shorten your introduction, which is much improved but quite long. I agree that it
is quite long and would be beneficial if you can accomplish this, however, I do not see a need to send
this out for further review.
Kind regards,
Alex Ophir
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 2
The authors were very thorough and thoughtful about their revisions of the manuscript. I very much
appreciated the effort they put in. It clearly shows!
My main two concerns with the original manuscript were: 1) set up the introduction, and 2)
interpretation and discussion of the results.
The introduction more strongly sets up the study's main research question (to examine the effects of
climate on behavioural divergence) and no longer leads the reader to expect a comparison of
populations across both Australia and Hawaii. In particular, lines 152-156 really help to make it
clear why the focus of the study is on populations from Hawaii (e.g. " because Australia's invasion is
still expanding, difficult to distinguish the effects of climate from range expansion). My only
suggestion now with the introduction is to maybe try and tighten up the new material and be a bit
more concise with the discussion of the literature on how climate variation affects traits.
The authors also satisfied my concerns with the discussion. I have no further comments.
Authors’ response to Reviewer and Associate Editor’s comments:
<U+F0B7> We have shortened the length of the Introduction by tightening-up the new material
discussing the effect of climate variation on traits, and by removing some sections to make
the Introduction more concise. We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. To allow the
reviewer and editor to see the changes we have made throughout the Introduction, we have
provided a version of the manuscript which has the omitted sections of the Introduction
highlighted and scored through (L99-185).
