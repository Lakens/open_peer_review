Comments:
Author synthesized acid sensitive 20(S)-O linked ester derivative of camptothecine with
norcantharidine acid, which improved its solubility and shows comparable activity against
various tumor cell lines. The work would be suitable for publication in RSOS provided the author
addresses the following concerns.
Complete revision and resubmission of the manuscript is advised.
1. There are so many typos in the manuscript,
for example;
Page1: line no.41-pentacyclicer; line no.42-assymetricalcent
Page 5: line no. 6- 122-123 0C;
Line no.7 and 16 - MHz value for 1H NMR and author should provide MHz values for every
1H and 13C NMR.
Line no. 13 and 14- 25ml- 25 ml and 10ml- 10 ml ; spacing in value and unit required everywhere.
Line no.16 and 17- Spacing between d values and brackets required everywhere.
Line no.33 - 2.44mmol- 2.44 mmol
Line no-56 - 400HMz- 400 MHz
2. Author should recheck complete experimental section for spacing and font size, and provide
IR, HRMS and MP atleast for new compounds. Also MHz and J values wherever not provided.
3. In the target molecule synthesis the data is not matching: 1H for compound no. 6 and 13C for
Compound I. It looks like there is some mismatch or integration in not done properly.
Author should also provide MP, HRMS and IR for these compounds.
4. All the structures on the spectra should be numbered according to the manuscript.
5. Author also missed some relevant and important references like

The reviewed manuscript RSOS-170842 is interesting from organic and medicinal chemistry point
of view and theme of the article meets the scope of the journal. Work is performed at sufficient
scientific level and has good quality; the results of investigation are professionally interpreted.
The manuscript may be considered for publication in Royal Society Open Science after minor
revision. Prior publication of this manuscript following points needs to be addressed:
1) Specific comments raise NMR spectra. Coupling constants should be given for all multiple
signals (doublets, triplets, etc). 13C NMR should be to 1 dp, but not to 2 dp
2) There are grammatical/typing and orthographical errors in the manuscript.
My decision is minor revision.

Authors have done a commendable job and included all the corrections that we had suggested. It
is interesting to see that the acid sensitive 20(S)-O linked ester derivative of camptothecine with
norcantharidine acid improves the solubility and also shows comparable activity against various
tumor cell lines. Now the work has been property supported by analytical data and literature
citations. The work would be suitable for publication in RSOS provided the author addresses the
following minor concerns.
Minor revisions are:
1. Compound no 4- there is a mismatch in the count for no of hydrogen in the 1H NMR data
2. Final compound I: number of carbons is less than required in 13C. May be overlapping, but
check and mention.

form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.

Appendix A
Response to reviewers:
Reviewer 1:
1: All of the typos in the manuscript have been corrected.
2: IR, Mp and HRMS are supplemented for the new compounds and
coupling costants J are also caculated for all compounds.
3: In the target molecule synthesis, , 1HNMR spectrum for compound 6
13
and CNMR spectrum for target molecule I have been integrated again.
4. All the structures in spectra have been numbered according to the
manuscript.
5. The literature that the reviewer suggested have been added.
Reviewer 2:
1. Coupling constants and have been given for all multiple signals.
2. Some grammatical errors in the manuscript have been corrected.
Appendix B
Response to reviewers
Reviewer 1: 1. Compound no 4- there is a mismatch in the count for no of hydrogen
in the 1H NMR data
Response: The 1H NMR data for compound 4 has been corrected carefully in
manuscript. And now it matches the structure absolutely.
Reviewer 1: 2. Final compound I: number of carbons is less than required in 13C.
May be overlapping, but check and mention.
Response: For final compound I, I check the carbon spectrum carefully and find that
the number of carbons (24) is actually less than required (28) in carbon
spectrum. This may be caused by overlapped as the reviewer said. And this
has been mentioned in manuscript. Actually it is also difficult to identify
which of carbons are overlapped.
