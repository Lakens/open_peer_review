The authors synthesized new compounds using known approaches to the preparation of the
heterocycles indicated by them. The novelty of the work lies in the application of the sonication
method, which allows to significantly increase the yield of the target compounds. The work will
certainly be of interest to specialists working in the field of medical chemistry. As a wish, I would

The authors report a new one-pot protocol for sono-synthesis of bis-[1,2,4]-triazol-3-yl amines
and bis-2-iminothiazolines from bis-1,3-disubstituted thioureas and an efficient methodology to
sono-synthesize of bis-isoxazolthiobarbiturates and bis-imidazoles from bis-1,3-disubstituted
thioureas as well. However, some statements are obviously exaggerated such as “the other
advantages of this novel sonochemical protocol are no tedious work-up and varied functional
group tolerance”.
(1) As described in the Experimental section, the synthesis and work-up process of new
compounds seemed to be basically the same as normal procedure except for an ultrasonic
process. The improvements of the ultrasonic process should be discussed in more detail.

(2) The authors claimed that “The products regioselectivity correlate well with the pKas of the
parent amines”. However, there are only two kinds of R group and two kinds of R’ group be
introduced as is shown in Table 2. Thus, more functional groups should be explored if possible.

In this manuscript (RSOS-181963), Wael and coworker reported the synthesis of polysubstituted
bis-1,2,4-triazoles, bis-2-iminothiazolines and bis-thiobarbiturates from bis-N,N-disubstituted
thioureas under ultrasound irradiation. The influence of the pKas of the parent amines was
discussed to explain the regioselectivity of products. Further derivatization of the resulting
products also provided some new heterocycles. While this work is correctly done, one major
problem is that the same authors have previously reported the similar reactions (ref. 40, RSC
Adv., 2018, 8, 10516). The major novelty of this work has been covered in their previous report,
making the present study a derivative work. Thus I regret not to support the publication of this
work in RSOS. Other more specific journal such as Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry is more
suitable for this work.
Additional comments:
1. The substituents in Scheme 1 are not correct. “benzyl” and “allyl” should be “Ph” and
“CH=CH2” respectively.
2. The data in Table 3 should be revised. Two significant digit is recommended for the product
yield and AE (e.g. entry 1: “98.13%” should be “98%”).
3. I am not quite sure about the authors’ names. In the author list, the last name of the
corresponding author is “Arafa”, while in the cited references the last name is “Wael” (also see
other papers published by the same authors). The authors should check this information.
