This is good piece of work, well performed and experimental data well interpreted whatever be
XPS data of N, C and V states, or IR spectra. My main concern is that . the subject is not really
new and the improvement of catalyst performances is rather small and expected from previous
works using Ce as additive in many reactions of selective oxidation and hydroxylation.
Moreover, the pioneered work by G. Panov from Boreskov Institute of catalysis in Novosibirsk,
Russia, in the 1990s of benzene hydroxylation to phenol with N2O as oxidant on Fe-MFI zeolite
is even not mentionned. The process was industrialized by Solutia, long time ago, in industrial
sites were N2O was available from H2SO4 plants.
The use of H2O2 as an oxidant is interesting, but the authors should realize that its synthesis is
absolutely not environmentally friendly (use of superoxides) unless it is produced in situ, as
suggested by Hutchings et al on gold catalysts.
In conclusion, I am not very enthusiastic about publication although no scientific mistakes or
misinterpretation of experimental data were present.
If the editor accepts the paper, I suggest that the autors improve the industrial prospectives and
past parts of the reaction and catalysts.

Answer: Thank the reviewer for the suggestion. The work suggested by the referee (J.
Mol. Catal. 1993, 84, 117-124) has been added and cited as reference 6 in the
Introduction part on page 1 and in the References part in the revised manuscript.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors present work on Cerium promoted V-g-C3N4 as highly efficient
heterogeneous catalysts for the direct benzene hydroxylation. The subject is of interest.
The hydroxylation of benzene is important from the industrial point of view. The
article is publishable in R. Soc. Open. Sci. after minor revision. My remarks are listed
below:
1. What is the mechanism of the reaction?
Answer: According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added the possible
mechanism of the reaction on page 5,“A possible reaction mechanism of benzene
hydroxylation is proposed based on literature work [22]. Benzene is chemically
absorbed onto the surface of g-C3N4, and then the surface dispersed V4+ species are
oxidized by H2O2 to produce V5+-O-O• radicals and H2O. The main active V5+-O-O•
radicals are rapidly activated and reacted with absorbed benzene to gain the target
phenol and V5+ is reduced to V4+. At the same stage, the redox V5+/V4+ is supported by
Ce3+/Ce4+ to accelerate the reaction into the next recycle.”
2. What is the oxidation state of Ce? Is the XPS analysis of Ce was collected?
Answer: We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. The Ce XPS analysis of
Ce0.07-0.07V-g-C3N4 and recovered Ce0.07-0.07V-g-C3N4 has been supplied in Figure
S6 in the supporting information. Also, more discussion has been added on page 5 in
the revised manuscript, “Comparing with Ce0.07-0.07V-g-C3N4, the recovered
Ce0.07-0.07V-g-C3N4 catalyst has small amount of Ce4+ species with the appearance of
Ce4+ fingerprint (Fig. S6) [43]. The existence of Ce3+/Ce4+ is confirmed, which
promotes the formation of low state vanadium.”
3. How TOF was determined? Which method was used to determine the number of
metal atoms?
Answer: Thank the reviewer’s comment. Turnover frequency (TOF) is calculated as
the molecules of generated phenol per metal atom per hour, and the content of metals
(V and Ce) of all catalysts were detected by ICP-AES. Actually, there is no effective
method for direct measuring the surface exposed metal content at this stage. For the
catalysts in this manuscript, the metals with low loading content is highly dispersed in
the g-C3N4. Hence, we reasonably to use total metal content instead of surface metal
content to determine the number of metal atoms and calculate the TOF value.
4. The carbon balance values should be added to the table 1.
Answer: Thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We add the carbon balance values in
the revised Table 1. Also, more discussion has been added on page 2 in the revised
manuscript,“Moreover, the carbon balance values shown in Table 1 are >99% over
the three Ce-containing catalysts, indicating a high carbon yield with negligible side
reactions.”
