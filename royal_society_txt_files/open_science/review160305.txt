The authors conduct an interesting and novel assessment of brain perfusion throughout the
hominin lineage by measuring the the size of the carotid canals in preserved fossil crania. They
come to the interesting and potentially important conclusion that, through hominin evolution,
perfusion rates have increased faster than brain volume, implying an increase in the per-gram
metabolic demand through hominin evolution accompanying the well known increase in size.
The analysis is sound and the study will be of interest and use to researchers in hominin
evolution, brain evolution, fossil analyses, and other subdisciplines in the life sciences. My
primary concerns are the reliability with which one can translate carotid canal size -> carotid
radius -> perfusion. Some of my concern may be addressed by a more detailed accounting of the
data in reference 16 and others. For non-experts, this will otherwise require taking the authors
word for many of the critical links.
Perfusion via the posterior arteries is low in humans, but can this be confidently assessed in
fossils? Isn't it at least possible that the increase in ICA size represents a shift to having a greater
proportion of blood flow via the ICA's and away from the vertebral arteries?
ICA blockage due to plaques is a common medical concern. I am not an expert in this area, but as
I understand it people with plaques blocking a considerable percentage of the ICA are
nonetheless able to perfuse their brains just fine. Wouldn't that observation challenge the direct
link between ICA radius and cerebral perfusion? ie, reducing ICA radius via a plaque does not
appear to reduce perfusion to the brain, as other vessels (presumably the vertebral) take up the
slack.
Has the relationship between ICA radius and carotid canal size been validated in species besides
mice and humans? I understand that the ICA is essentially alone in traversing the carotid canal,
but differences among species and/or individuals will surely have some affect on this
relationship.
line 33 I believe this is meant to be a conditional statement suggesting a hypothesis. As such it
would read more clearly as "...imply that the human brain COULD BE, at a neurological..."
line 51 is there any other validation of the low flow rate for the posterior vessels? It is stated that
they carry less than 10% of the flow based on their radii, which is then used to justify an analysis
of ICA contribution based on their radii... If radii aren't sufficiently precise and reliable indices of
flow rate, then this line of reasoning begins to come apart a bit.
line 105 how does uncertainty in body mass estimates for the fossil hominins affect results here?
And is there any evidence that the (essentially 2 point) regression from humans and mice is
reliable and accurate within more closely related species?
Lastly, I would note that recent work on human vs ape brain metabolomics (Sherwood;
Bauernfeind) and metabolism (Pontzer et al) might be examined here in the Discussion, as these
papers provide a complementary set of analyses supporting the hypothesis that the human brain
is uniquely metabolically active.

Given the established facts that arterial anatomy relates to its function, vessel diameter to its flow
rate and blood flow rate to metabolic rate, the present study relates the diameter of the passages
through which arteries must pass to reach the brain to make an assessment of changes in cerebral
metabolic rate during hominin evolution. The conclusion is that foramen diameter, hence the
blood flow it can accommodate and the brain metabolic rate that this flow can support, did not
scale with brain volume with expected exponents of 0.76 or 1.0. Yes, there are assumptions with
the calculations, but the difference in the actual scaling coefficient (1.41) is so profound that it
must negate any small errors introduced by the assumptions that were used.
The data are convincing. The article is concisely, clearly and cleanly written. The figures are
essential and present the data accurately.
Furthermore, the inference that a disproportionate increase in blood flow to the cerebral cortex
throughout hominin evolution is associated with an increase in the number of synapses per
neuron or greater synaptic activity seems reasonable from our current understanding of cerebral
metabolic rate and synaptic activity.
I have no major comments
Minor comments
A potential source of error is that if the fossil specimens are worn - the foramen will have a larger
diameter, which would inflate the flow estimate. While wear and tear could be related to age of
the specimen (would tend to reduce the actual difference that was measured), this does not have
be so (it depends on the extent of weathering and not just time for weathering). The reader needs
to be assured of how this potential artifact was controlled, besides just selecting the ‘best
preserved’ foramen when two were present.

Please consider the following modification. “This is probably associated with increased
interneuron connectivity, synaptic activity and cognitive function, which all ultimately depend
on metabolic capacity.”
Around L27. You might want to mention that blood flow imaging studies are often used by
cognitive researchers to infer areas of the brain that are turned on during cognitive activity.

Done. The validating information has been amplified with the addition of a few more references to
support the assumptions.
Perfusion via the posterior arteries is low in humans, but can this be confidently assessed in fossils?
Isn't it at least possible that the increase in ICA size represents a shift to having a greater proportion
of blood flow via the ICA's and away from the vertebral arteries?
Yes, this is a possibility that we have now introduced into the Discussion of the revised manuscript.
ICA blockage due to plaques is a common medical concern. I am not an expert in this area, but as I
understand it people with plaques blocking a considerable percentage of the ICA are nonetheless
able to perfuse their brains just fine. Wouldn't that observation challenge the direct link between
ICA radius and cerebral perfusion? ie, reducing ICA radius via a plaque does not appear to reduce
perfusion to the brain, as other vessels (presumably the vertebral) take up the slack.
Yes, this is true. Rather than discussing this medical problem, we have inserted a statement that
cerebral perfusion can occur with reduced or absent ICA, which is an extreme case. This is backed by
two new references.
Has the relationship between ICA radius and carotid canal size been validated in species besides
mice and humans? I understand that the ICA is essentially alone in traversing the carotid canal, but
differences among species and/or individuals will surely have some affect on this relationship.
The methods now have a longer section on the validation of the calculations, as requested by the
referee. Now the species that have been validated include humans, rats and mice.
line 33 I believe this is meant to be a conditional statement suggesting a hypothesis. As such it would
read more clearly as "...imply that the human brain COULD BE, at a neurological..."
This has been changed.
line 51 is there any other validation of the low flow rate for the posterior vessels? It is stated that
they carry less than 10% of the flow based on their radii, which is then used to justify an analysis of
ICA contribution based on their radii... If radii aren't sufficiently precise and reliable indices of flow
rate, then this line of reasoning begins to come apart a bit.
We presently do not have any data from other species, but they would be more distant from
hominin evolution than recent humans. We believe that vessel lumen radius is a good index of
blood flow. This is the basis of our measurements which have been validated. No changes made
here.
line 105 how does uncertainty in body mass estimates for the fossil hominins affect results here?
And is there any evidence that the (essentially 2 point) regression from humans and mice is reliable
and accurate within more closely related species?
Body mass estimates are from the literature. They are only data we have. Over the body mass
range of 22 – 100 kg, shear stress differs by 35%, increasing in the smaller species. The allometry of
ICA blood flow would be even steeper if a constant shear stress were used. We have made no
change.
Lastly, I would note that recent work on human vs ape brain metabolomics (Sherwood; Bauernfeind)
and metabolism (Pontzer et al) might be examined here in the Discussion, as these papers provide a
complementary set of analyses supporting the hypothesis that the human brain is uniquely
metabolically active.
We found papers by these authors and have referred to the review by Bauernfriend (who refers to
Sherwood). These led us to other germane papers that are incorporated into the new manuscript.
However, Pontzer’s recent papers concern whole body metabolism and are only distantly related to
brain metabolic rate. We are working on developmental brain perfusion in humans and will
incorporate more on the protraction of juvenile stages in humans later.

We have now better explained in the Material and methods of our revised manuscript that only
those skulls in which foramina were in acceptable condition were used in the study, and that in
these specimens there were no obvious signs of wear through the canal of the internal carotid
foramen. In any case, wearing of the opening would be expected to be more pronounced in the
older, smaller skulls, which would have amplified, rather than reduced the trends we show.
Please consider the following modification. “This is probably associated with increased interneuron
connectivity, synaptic activity and cognitive function, which all ultimately depend on metabolic

In addition to the changes suggested by the referees, we have thoroughly revised the paper for
