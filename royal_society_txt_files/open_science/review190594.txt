Review comments of the paper entitled “Intensive study on structure transformation within
muscovite single crystal under high dose <U+03B3> ray irradiation and mechanism speculation”
In this work, the authors studied the mechanism of structural transformation with gamma-
irradiation on muscovite single crystal. Their aim was to explore the sensibility of muscovite at
high dose irradiation and to understand mechanism for defects formation within matrix of clay.
However, Minor revision is required before publication.
Abstract:
• Abstract is described very well but, it will be better if it can rewrite in short and more
effective words
Introduction
• It is recommended to discuss about the conventional materials used for the detection of
high dose radiation.
• It will be better if the authors can refer and discuss the works clay composites of Andrzej
Nowicki et al. Thierry Allard et al. R Celis e tal. Karger Kocis et al. Runcy et.al, Poornima Vijayan
et.al, Thomaskutty et.al and S.Anilkumar et.al, Hanna J Maria et al. Ranimol Stephen et al. and
R. F. Kamalieva et al. and Claudio Colombo et al. in nanostructures and nano-objects)
• Altogether the introduction part is explained well by the authors
Materials and methods
• The authors satisfactorily explained the materials preparation and characterisation
techniques.
Result and discussion
• Page 10 fig 1. Please name the insight Raman spectra graph shown.
• Page 14 line 41, the absence of Si-OH peak in the FTIR transmission spectrais explained by
the difference in methods and sample structure, it would be nice if it can support with literatures.
• Page 15. Line 32, “partial Si-OH bonds can be generated coupled with Al-OH bonds
generation”is there any other characterisation possible to support the regeneration of Si-OH bond
at higher gamma dose.
• It is appreciated that the authors concluded the FTIR and Raman analysis well
• The XRD analysis support the dehydroxylation effect of the FTIR result.
• The TGA analysis shows volatilisation of H2O in the material. At higher dose
1000kGywhat is the reason for increasing in volatilisation of H2O compare to 500kGy
• The contact angle analysis shows decrease in hydrophilicity for low dose irradiation. But it
is almost same for 500 and 1000kGy, why? It is contradicting the above TGA studies
• It is appreciated that the mechanism was explained very well by the authors by using
equations and schematic diagrams
• Conclusion is written well by the authors, however it will be nice if it can explain much
shorter words.
Altogether, the authors made a good attempt to understand the influence of gamma irradiation
on muscovite single crystal. This papercan be accepted with minor correction.

This is an interesting paper and the data provided will be useful. However, the language is poor
in any places and needs to be refined/improved.
The following mandatory revisions are suggested
1. In the discussion on contact angle it is important that the authors provide actual surface
roughness values. AFM images of the surfaces will add to the quality o interpretation..
2. The SEM images in figure 7 make no sense. Nothing is visible. Authors should provide better
quality images.
3.In the discussion on interlayer spacing,d, the change is attributed to lattice shrinkage. What
about strain? It also appears that the relative intensities of the various peaks are changing with
irradiation. Can the authors comment on this?
With these minor revisions the paper can be accepted for publication.

Abstract:
(1) Abstract is described very well but, it will be better if it can rewrite in short and
more effective words
Thanks very much for your kind reading, your suggestion is constructive. This time,
we revise the abstract carefully, partial sentences were deleted, and partial sentences
were rewritten, trying to make the abstract more succinct and informative.
Additionally, other parts were also revised to make the manuscript succinct.
Introduction
(2) It is recommended to discuss about the conventional materials used for the
detection of high dose radiation.
Thanks very much for your suggestion, your suggestion is beneficial for realizing
research in this field, which is meaningful. After reading literature, a paragraph was
added in this revision in page 4-5 as “……Nowadays, numerous materials have been
evaluated such as polymer, semiconductor (silicon), glass, calcium fluoride (CaF2),
etc [11]. However, they are probably improper for shortcomings. For instance,
polymer is easy to degrade and be heated by irradiation [12-14], semiconductor is
easy to conduct electricity [12], the composition of glass is complex, CaF2 is easy to
generate toxic gas under irradiation [12]. In this case, designing material which is
suitable for detecting high dose irradiation is still challenging. Except for low cost
and stability, muscovite has partial advantages such as nice electric insulation, heat
isolation [15] and transparency. These advantages are beneficial for storing
accumulated effects and observing ion track especially for ion irradiation [5, 16]. It
may have a potential application in high dose irradiation detection [17]. Thus, a
clear cognition on its sensibility at high dose irradiation is meaningful ……”. We
hope these descriptions could make the manuscript more informative.
(3) It will be better if the authors can refer and discuss the works clay composites of
Andrzej Nowicki et al. Thierry Allard et al. R Celis e tal. Karger Kocis et al. Runcy
et.al, Poornima Vijayan et.al, Thomaskutty et.al and S.Anilkumar et.al, Hanna J
Maria et al. Ranimol Stephen et al. and R. F. Kamalieva et al. and Claudio Colombo
et al. in nanostructures and nano-objects)
Thanks very much for your kind reading, your suggestion is constructive. You have
read numerous literatures, all their works are on clay structure or applications. We
are very appreciated for your hard work. After realizing their works, we have a more
clear cognition on clay structure and its application in engineering material
manufacture, environmental science, medical science, etc. A clear description on clay
application would make the manuscript more plentiful. In this case, several sentences
were added in page 5 as “……In reality, for low cost, nice fire resistance and
nontoxic, clay is widely used in material, environmental and medical science as
engineering material manufacture [36-41], sewage treatment or environmental
remediation [42-44], drug delivery [45], etc.……”.
(4) Altogether the introduction part is explained well by the authors
Thanks very much for your kind reading, hard work and positive comment.
Materials and methods
(5) The authors satisfactorily explained the materials preparation and characterisation

Thanks very much for your kind reading, hard work and positive comment.
Result and discussion
(6) Page 10 fig 1. Please name the insight Raman spectra graph shown.
Thanks very much for your kind reading, your suggestion is constructive. This time,
the inside graph was named and described carefully in page 10 as “……Seeing
spectra in macro, it might imply great variation in 1000 kGy-irradiated sample for
weak intensity. However, that is incorrect as shown inside graph. The inside graph
(1000 kGy-irradiated sample) is generally similar to curves of other samples. ……”.
(7) Page 14 line 41, the absence of Si-OH peak in the FTIR transmission spectra is
explained by the difference in methods and sample structure, it would be nice if it can
support with literatures.
This is a very good suggestion. In reality, we have tried our best to search some
literatures to support this viewpoint. However, little literatures were found. This is
due to some difficulties. Normally, for FT-IR transmission-model experiment, the
propagation direction of photon is vertical to sample surface, the angle of projection
is 90º. For FT-ATR experiment, the propagation direction of photon inclines to
sample surface normally with an angle of projection as 45º. Main difference within
these two methods is that the angle of projection is different. If we can alter the angel
of projection, the spectrum might vary obviously and certify this viewpoint. However,
main angle of projection for commercial FT-IR spectrum instrument is constant as the
sample stage is fixed. The FT-IR spectrum instrument with rotatable sample stage is
not common. In this case, literature on peak intensity vs the angle of projection is rare.
Nevertheless, the orientation of OH can be realized. According to literature, the
C*-OH angle can be considered as less than 30º (0~30º). This can be seen in
manuscript on page 15 as “……For muscovite, its OH vector in z direction is strong
(the included angel between z-direction and OH is less than 30º) [71], and Si-OH
vibration is weaker compared to Al-OH……”. In this case, it can be explained as
follows. To have a clear understanding, two figures will be shown.
Fig. 1 shows a scheme for interaction with OH vibration and projected photon in
FT-ATR experiment. Line a represents the propagation direction of projected photon,
which inclines to surface with an angle as 45º. The surface could be described as X-Y
plane, z-direction is vertical to this plane. According to literature, the OH vector is
close to z-direction with an angel less than 30º. Assuming the angle is 30º, which
could be described as line b. In this case, the vector <U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7> <U+0001D442><U+0001D43B> could represent OH
orientation in sample. This vector can be described as two vectors overlay
<U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7> =<U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7>
(<U+0001D442><U+0001D43B> <U+0001D442><U+0001D440> + <U+0001D440><U+0001D43B> <U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7> ). As the propagation direction of projected photon is in line a, the
vibration orientation can be described in line a’ plane. In this case, only the vector
for OH vibration in line a’ plane can interact with photon, leading spectrum
absorption. On aforementioned assumption, the included angle for OH vector and
line a’ plane can be described as 15º (45º-30º). Assuming the intensity for OH
vibration as I0, the intensity for OH vibration in <U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7> <U+0001D442><U+0001D440> orientation as I1, thus,
I1=I0cos15º=0.97I0, That means the intensity for OH vibration which can interact
with projected photon is very strong close to 100%. In other words, the signal in
FT-ATR spectrum would be intense. The OH absorption spectrum would be obvious.
Fig. 1 A scheme for interaction with OH vibration and projected photon in FT-ATR
experiment.
Fig. 2 A scheme for interaction with OH vibration and projected photon in FT-IR
transmission experiment.
Fig. 2 shows a scheme for interaction with OH vibration and projected photon in
FT-IR transmission experiment. Line a represents X-Y plane, which could represent
sample surface. The propagation direction of projected photon is in z-direction, which
is vertical to sample surface (line a). As the included angle for OH vector with
z-direction is close to 30º, thus, line b could describe the orientation for OH vector.
That means vector <U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7>
<U+0001D442><U+0001D43B> could represent orientation of OH in sample. This vector can
be described as two vectors overlay (<U+0001D442><U+0001D43B> <U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7> =<U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7>
<U+0001D442><U+0001D440> + <U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7>
<U+0001D440><U+0001D43B> ). As the propagation direction
of projected photon is in z-direction, the vibration orientation for photon can be
described in line a’ plane (X-Y plane). In this case, only the vector for OH vibration
in line a’ plane or normal to this plane can interact with photon, leading spectrum
absorption. On aforementioned assumption, the included angle for OH vector and
z-direction can be described as 30º. Assuming the intensity for OH vibration as I0, the
intensity of OH vibration in <U+0001D440><U+0001D43B> <U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7><U+20D7> orientation as I1, thus, I1=I0sin30º=0.5I0. That
means the intensity for OH vibration which can interact with projected photon is 50
percent whole intensity.
Seeing aforementioned analysis, for muscovite in FT-ATR experiment, the intensity
for OH interacting with projected photon is close to whole intensity. Nevertheless, in
FT-IR transmission-model experiment, the intensity for OH interacting with projected
photon is 50 percent whole intensity. That means for constant sample the OH
vibration absorbance in FT-ATR spectrum would be more intense compared to FT-IR
transmission spectrum. In other words, the OH signal in FT-IR transmission-model
experiment would be weaker compared to that in FT-ATR spectrum for muscovite.
Normally, seen from formula-KAl2(AlSi3O10)(OH)2 and structure, the OH should
be Al-OH, none Si-OH bond should be observed. Nevertheless, for partial defects
existence, Si-OH bond can be observed in silicate such as SiO2, in this case, Si-OH
vibration can be observed. Normally, the amount for Si-OH bond is tiny, the majority
for OH is displayed as M-OH bond. In this work, the majority is Al-OH bond. For its
tiny amount, probably less than 1%, its orientation wasn’t reported. In most cases, it
was reported as OH orientation didn’t showing distinguish. As the signal for Al-OH
vibration in FT-IR transmission-model experiment is weaker compared to that in
FT-ATR experiment, assuming the orientation for OH linked to Si atom is close to that
linked to Al. In this case, the signal for Si-OH vibration in FT-IR transmission-model
experiment would be very weak. Additionally, its orientation might in z-direction. In
this case, the signal for Si-OH vibration might disappear in FT-IR transmission
spectrum. These explanations could probably explain why Si-OH band wasn’t
observed in FT-IR transmission-model experiment. Generally, a clear cognition on
orientation for OH linked to Si atom is difficult because of low amount.
Simultaneously, for low amount, its signal can be weak. A clear exploration is
meaningful and the suggestion is constructive.
(8) Page 15. Line 32, “partial Si-OH bonds can be generated coupled with Al-OH
bonds generation” is there any other characterisation possible to support the
regeneration of Si-OH bond at higher gamma dose.
Thanks very much for your kind reading, your question is meaningful and very
scientific. A clear answer to this question is challenging, which needs more research.
Huge difficulty exists in solving this problem.
Firstly, the linkage break between tetrahedron and octahedron sheet is the break
of Al-O-Si or Al-O-Al bond in nature. Under Al-O-Si bond break, Al-O• and Si•
radicals or Al• and Si-O• radicals would be generated. If the Al-O• or Al• radicals
form Al-OH bond, to make system stable, the Si• or Si-O• radicals might transform to
Si-OH bond finally. This is the meaning of-“partial Si-OH bonds can be generated
coupled with Al-OH bonds generation”. These reactions are in micro and the broken
part is tiny for low linear energy transfer effect for <U+03B3> ray irradiation. Finally, the extra
introduced OH amount would be tiny. Simultaneously, Al-O-Al bond might be
destroyed forming Al-OH bond. In reality, during irradiation process, we cannot
assure whether Al-O-Si or Al-O-Al bond occurred break but could assure the
probability for Al-OH formation deriving from linkage break is higher compared to
Si-OH bond formation. That means the amount for Si-OH introduced would be tiny.
For tiny amount, a clear cognition on orientation for extra introduced Al-OH bond is
difficult. In this case, a clear cognition on Si-OH bond would be more difficult.
Secondly, the reaction for <U+03B3> ray with framework atom is random. For vacancy
existence, the orientation for extra introduced Si-OH bond may be various as the
position for H• or OH• radicals cannot be assured. Thirdly, the tetrahedron sheet can
be destroyed and introduced Si-OH bond. The orientation for these Si-OH bonds
might be random. In this case, it is difficult to assure the Si-OH bond has constant
orientation. In this case, it is very difficult to distinguish whether the Si-OH bond is
originally existed or derived from linkage break or tetrahedron destruction from
orientation difference. A clear distinguish on this variation in molecule level is
difficult. Maybe this procedure can be observed in future in situ, which needs huge
advance in technology. If this procedure can be observed in situ, the viewpoint can be
certified more accurately.
Normally, the wave number can be constant as it seems independent on orientation.
In this case, FT-IR spectrum can describe Si-OH bond variation. Although, we cannot
distinguish the difference, we can have a qualitative cognition on structure variation.
Except for FT-IR, NMR can be used to describe micro condition difference for Si
element. However, Si-OH bond originally exists. Even after irradiation, none extra
signal probably can be observed as Si-OH bond originally existed in tetrahedron
sheet or deriving from linkage break may show similar split. It is difficult to assure
which signal derives from linkage break.
Generally, having a clear observation in micro and observing this procedure in
situ is difficult. However, this question is beneficial for micro procedure cognition,
which is important. Solving this problem needs technology advance and efforts. We
think this question can be answered in future.
(9) It is appreciated that the authors concluded the FTIR and Raman analysis well.
Thanks very much for your kind reading, hard work and positive comment.
(10) The XRD analysis support the dehydroxylation effect of the FTIR result.
Thanks very much for your kind reading, hard work and positive comment.
(11) The TGA analysis shows volatilisation of H2O in the material. At higher dose
1000 kGy what is the reason for increasing in volatilisation of H2O compare to 500
kGy.
Thanks very much for your kind reading, this is a good question. In reality, seen
from TGA curves, the residue mass for 1000 kGy-irradiated sample is lesser
compared to 500 kGy-irradiated sample. That means the volatilization of H2O in 1000
kGy-irradiated sample is higher than 500 kGy-irradiated sample. That means H2O
amount in 1000 kGy-irradiated sample is higher than that in 500 kGy-irradiated
sample. This can be explained as follows. Normally, the procedure for H2O amount
variation is complex. Upon irradiation, two procedures occurred synchronously. One
is chemical bond break such as the break of Al-OH bond shown as dehydroxylation,
raising H2O amount. The other is extra group’s introduction related to H2O radiolysis,
reducing H2O content. They had opposite effects on H2O amount variation. At low
dose, framework break is dominant and H2O radiolysis can be promoted by dose
increase. In this case, H2O amount could reduce obviously. At high dose, extra
irradiation probably results in more break of Al-OH, and H2O can be regenerated. In
this case, H2O amount could be close to that in pristine sample. In this case, 500
kGy-irradiated sample could have lower H2O amount compared to 1000
kGy-irradiated sample. Generally, that is probably because 500 kGy-irradiated
sample has more intense H2O radiolysis level compared to 1000 kGy-irradiated. In
this case, H2O amount in 500 kGy-irradiated sample could be lower than that in 1000
kG-irradiated sample.
This question has been discussed carefully in manuscript in pages 23-24 as “It
seems H2O amount in 500 kGy-irradiated sample is lower than that in 1000
kGy-irradiated sample and H2O amount in 1000 kGy-irradiated sample is close to
that in pristine sample. These results can support FT-IR analysis commendably as 500
kGy-irradiated has the most intense signal for OH vibration (Fig. 3). Simultaneously,
if we assume lattice plane shrink is completely ascribed to extra OH introduction, in
this case, 500 kGy-irradiated sample has the most intense shrink in lattice plane. In
other words, it has the largest amount of OH introduction. The extra introduced OH
dues to H2O radiolysis. Thus, 500 kGy-irradiated sample should have lower H2O
amount compared to pristine sample. TGA analysis certified this assumption. That
means TGA results supported XRD analysis indirectly. The reason for 500
kGy-irradiated sample has lower H2O amount compared to pristine and 1000
kGy-irradiated samples can be explained as follows. Upon irradiation, two
procedures occurred synchronously. One is chemical bond break such as the break of
Al-OH bond shown as dehydroxylation. The other is extra group’s introduction related
to H2O radiolysis. The former procedure would raise H2O amount, the latter would
reduce H2O amount. Finally, mechanism for H2O amount variation is complex. At low
dose, framework break is dominant and H2O radiolysis can be promoted by dose
increase. At high dose, extra irradiation probably results in more break of Al-OH, and
H2O can be regenerated. In this case, 500 kGy-irradiated sample might have lower
H2O amount compared to pristine and 1000 kGy-irradiated samples and H2O amount
in 1000 kG-irradiated sample can be close to that in pristine sample. This
phenomenon is normally observed as radiation effect isn’t linearly with absorbed dose
such as radiation crosslinking of ultra-high molecule weight polyethylene sheet [65].
After a threshold, the degree of cross-linking would be constant or smaller.”
(12) The contact angle analysis shows decrease in hydrophilicity for low dose
irradiation. But it is almost same for 500 and 1000kGy, why? It is contradicting the
above TGA studies
Thanks very much for your kind reading, this is a very good question. Seen from
contact angle analysis, the hydrophilicity declined at low dose while at high dose such
as at 500 and 1000 kGy is similar. Seen from TGA analysis, 500 kGy-irradiated
sample had lower H2O amount compared to 1000 kGy-irradiated sample. In other
words, it has more intense H2O radiolysis level. Finally, it had more extra OH
introduction. This conclusion can be certified by FT-IR spectrum as 500
kGy-irradiated sample had more intense OH signal compared to 1000 kGy-irradiated
sample. Generally, seen from FT-IR and TGA analysis, 500 kGy-irradiated sample
had more extra OH introduction compared to 1000 kGy-irradiated sample, while the
hydrophilicity for these two samples were similar. It seems confusing. This can be
explained as follows. Firstly, the extra introduced OH might exist in octahedron sheet
as seen from FT-IR spectrum. In reality, the effect for this introduction on elevating
surface hydrophilicity is weak as surface hydrophilicity mainly relies on surface
structure (e.g. tetrahedron sheet, interlayer ions). Secondly, extra OH can be
introduced on tetrahedron sheet, which could promote surface hydrophilicity. Thirdly,
the surface destruction cannot be avoided. These procedures might even have
opposite effect on surface hydrophilicity variation. Finally, the procedure for
hydrophilicity is complex. In this case, although 500 kGy-irradiated sample had more
intense H2O radiolysis level compared to 1000 kGy-irradiated sample, their surface
hydrophilicity can be similar.
In reality, surface hydrophilicity variation has a complex mechanism involving OH
amount variation, tetrahedron sheet destruction, roughness variation, etc. Finally, the
variation maybe in-linearly with OH amount variation or absorbed dose. Additionally,
for hydrophic material, after a threshold, the hydrophilicity wouldn’t increase with
OH amount increase. For instance, radiation grafting polyacrylic acid to increase
surface hydrophilicity of a polymer or CNTs, after a threshold, the CA wouldn’t
decrease or even increase with increase of degree of grafting. This phenomenon could
also explain why the surface hydrophilicity for these samples was similar. These
explanations could probably explain the conflict.
(13) It is appreciated that the mechanism was explained very well by the authors by
using equations and schematic diagrams.
Thanks very much for your kind reading, hard work and positive comment.
(14) Conclusion is written well by the authors, however it will be nice if it can
explain much shorter words.
Thanks very much for your kind reading, hard work and positive comment. We
have revised it carefully to make it more succinct and informative.
(15) Altogether, the authors made a good attempt to understand the influence of
gamma irradiation on muscovite single crystal. This paper can be accepted with minor
correction.
Thanks very much for your kind reading, hard work and positive comment. We
have revised it completely. All suggestions are constructive, benefiting improving the
manuscript and research. Except for these suggestions, other parts or errors were
also corrected. Additionally, in this response, partial viewpoint should be certified by
literature, we have tried this strategy. However, this introduction would make the
description confusing as partial revised part of main manuscript is displayed in this
file. Quoting can be seen. If we extra cite partial literature, the file would be difficult
to read. Generally, the explanation is plentiful and assured. Via considering these
questions, we have a deeper realization on our work, which improved our research
sufficiently. We would show our appreciation to you for your hard work and help
once again!

Comments to the Author(s)
(1) This is an interesting paper and the data provided will be useful. However, the
language is poor in any places and needs to be refined/improved.
Thanks very much for your kind reading, hard work and pertinent comment. The
language is our shortcoming as english isn’t our native language. Although we have
studied english for several years, trying to use english to communicate with other
people or write articles with completely correct grammar or native words is still
difficult. Normally, improving the english communication level is a hard work, which
needs long time training and accumulation. This is our shortcoming, we will try our
best to improve english level, trying to make the communication more relevant. This
time, we revise our manuscript carefully, main part has been rewritten, trying to make
the manuscript easily understandable and accurate. We will try our best to improve
english communication skill in future. Thanks very much for your suggestion.
(2) In the discussion on contact angle it is important that the authors provide actual
surface roughness values. AFM images of the surfaces will add the quality
interpretation.
Thanks very much for your kind reading and suggestion. The suggestion is
constructive and meaningful to realize variation in micro. In this case, AFM
experiments were performed and roughness values were calculated and discussed and
shown in pages 9 and 29-33 in this revision. For revision, Figs. 8 and 9 were added.
Main revision can be displayed as follows.
Page 9 shows experimental method as “Atomic force microscopic (AFM). AFM
experiments were performed on a NTEGRA Prima instrument (NT-MDT Co.). Prior
to measurement, a thin layer of double faced adhesive tape was fixed on glass slide,
then, film was fixed on tape. Tapping mode of scanning was adopted and datum was
analyzed by Nova-px software.”
Pages 29-33 discussed results as “To observe morphology more clearly, AFM
experiments were performed. Fig. 8 shows AFM images for surface of pristine and
irradiated samples. Generally, variation in z-direction is tiny as in nanometer scale,
implying smooth. To have a clear realization on difference in z-direction, an area is
chosen randomly as shown in green color in image (Fig. 8). Then, height in
z-direction after cropping vs distance along green line is displayed and shown in Fig.
9. Seeing Fig. 9a, variation range after cropping for pristine sample is close to ±2
nm except for partial section. Seeing Figs. 9b-d, variation ranges after cropping for
100 kGy-irradiated, 200 kGy-irradiated and 500 kGy-irradiated samples can be
considered as ±0.7, ±0.2 and ±0.6 nm, respectively. Seeing Fig. 9e, variation
range after cropping for 1000 kG-irradiated sample is close to ± 1.5 nm. For
pristine sample (Fig. 9a), partial section shows large variation range. This is
probably dues to defect originally existed as sample is natural and in sheet form. In
this case, surface might exist bump or depression induced by mining. Additionally,
film is peeled randomly. If sample contains defects in internal, partial sections can be
broken during peeling. In this case, partial bump or depression can be observed.
Except for that region, sample is generally smooth with a variation range close to ±
2 nm in z-direction in chosen part. For 100 kGy-irradiated, 200 kGy-irradiated and
500 kGy-irradiated samples, the variation ranges are close to ±0.7, ±0.2 and ±
0.6 nm. They are very tiny, showing smooth. In reality, the size of T-O-T structure in
z-direction is close to 1.2-1.5 nm, chemical bond length for K-O ionic bond or
Si-O/Al-O bond is close to 0.2 nm. Seeing value especially for 200 kGy-irradiated
sample, the variation range is close to ±0.2 nm, which is close to the length of
chemical bond as K-O ionic bond or Si-O bond. Normally, the distribution of
interlayer ion (e.g. K+ ion) is random, in this case, the variation in z-direction at atom
level may be close to 0.2 nm. In this work, the variation range is close to this scale.
That means the surface is very smooth.
Generally, for all samples, the variation range in z-direction after cropping is less
than ±2 nm. The range is tiny. Normally, variation range induced by artificial factor
is large, which can be in um scale or larger. Trying to induce variation in nanometer
scale by artificial technology is difficult. In reality, this tiny variation needs special
instrument or technology, which should be processed precisely such as by etching of
laser. For sample peeled by manual, this tiny variation can be endured. Generally,
this tiny variation indicates sample is smooth, which further certified SEM results.
Although sample is smooth, variation range for pristine sample seems larger than
other samples. That means it seems rougher than other samples as roughness can be
described by variation range in z-direction. The reason can be ascribed to sample
preparation or difference. For irradiated samples, they seem smoother compared to
pristine sample especially for 200 kGy-irradiated sample. That cannot be ascribed to
irradiation as it is difficult to prepare sample with constant surface structure by
manual. Simultaneously, we cannot assure the defect in sheet is uniform. Additionally,
variation induced by irradiation in z-direction would be very tiny seen from
aforementioned explanations (SEM part). Its variation maybe covered by sample
preparation or difference. In this case, apparent roughness difference cannot be
ascribed to irradiation process. If we consider pristine sample has largest roughness
and all samples have similar chemical structure in surface, in this case, irradiated
samples should have larger CAs especially for 200 kGy-irradiated sample as this
sample seems have the smallest roughness. Nevertheless, obtained CA is contrary to
this expectation. They have close CAs (Fig. 6). That means great variation existed in
chemical structure. In other words, CA variation wasn’t aroused by surface
morphology difference but to chemical structure variation, which means
aforementioned analysis on chemical structure is probably suitable.
Generally, seen from SEM and AFM analysis, it concludes the CA variation was
attributed to intrinsic structure difference not to artificial factor. In reality, numerous
procedures could affect surface hydrophilicity such as framework break, Si-OH
removal or regeneration, roughness variation, etc. They might show offset effects on
CA variation. Finally, CA didn’t vary linearly vs absorbed dose.
Generally, low dose irradiation sufficiently declined hydrophilicity while extra
irradiation recovered. Irradiation almost had none effects on surface morphology.”

(3) The SEM images in figure 7 make no sense. Nothing is visible. Authors should
provide better quality images.
Thanks very much for your kind reading, and constructive suggestion. This
suggestion is important. In reality, we have tried our best to make the image more
clearly. However, partial difficulties exist. This can be illustrated as follows. In reality,
we have observed surface morphology by SEM several times and obtained numerous
images by an advanced instrument. The instrument has high resolution. However, the
images are similar. That means the quality for image wasn’t up to instrument or staff
skills but to sample intrinsic characteristic. This can be explained as follows. Firstly,
the sample is electric insulation and transparent, it is difficult to conduct charge. In
this case, numerous charges are deposited showing highlight. This phenomenon is
common in SEM characterization. If the material has better electrical conductivity,
the image would be dark. Secondary, the sample is smooth and uniform. There is no
great difference in composition or size in height. If the surface has different
composition in distinct position, the charging effect would be different. In this case,
the image would have huge contrast. This phenomenon is common in composite.
Simultaneously, if the surface has great variation in size of height, the charging effect
would also different. In this case, huge contrast can also be observed. This
phenomenon is common in observing cross-section for sample after break under
stress or composite. As sample with poor electrical conductivity, transparent, and
uniform composition and smooth surface, the contrast is small. In this case, the image
is highlight and seems show none great difference. These descriptions could probably
explain the obtained image with tiny contrast.
In reality, this phenomenon is meaningful, the obtained image is informative. If
there were cracks or grooves or impurities on sample surface, the contrast would be
huge. In this case, partial parts would be dim. The highlight image with tiny contrast
means none cracks, grooves or impurities (e.g. particles) exist on sample surface,
which is expected.
(4) In the discussion on interlayer spacing, d, the change is attributed to lattice
shrinkage. What about strain? It also appears that the relative intensities of the various
peaks are changing with irradiation. Can the authors comment on this?
Thanks very much for your kind reading and hard work. This is a very good
question. Seen from XRD analysis, the interlayer space d became smaller under
irradiation, meaning shrink. Under 500 kGy irradiation, interlayer space d for (004)
lattice plane shrunk near 0.5%, which is close to 0.02 Å. In reality, the variation
range is strain. In this case, we could consider the strain for (004) lattice plane under
500 kGy irradiation as 0.5%. This can be seen in XRD analysis in page 18 as “……
Generally, under 500 kGy irradiation, (004) lattice plane shrunk near 0.5%, closing
to 0.02 Å (4.985 (± 0.002) - 4.962 (± 0.002) = 0.023 (± 0.002) Å).……”. Except for
strain, partial stress might exist. Seeing XRD analysis, after irradiation, diffraction
angle became larger compared to pristine sample showing shrink, meaning tension
force existed. This is normal as hydrogen bond formation strengthens the interlayer
force between tetrahedron and octahedron sheet. Generally, tension stress existed,
which is expected. Finally, shrinkage was observed.
Seen from XRD patterns, relative intensities for various peaks varied after
irradiation. This is interesting, and can be explained as follows. Normally, for sample
irradiated by <U+03B3> ray, the crash between photon and framework is random. In this case,
which bond occurred break and position is uncertain. For instance, we cannot assume
the destruction mainly in (002) lattice plane or (004) lattice plane. In reality, (002),
(004), (006) and (008) lattice planes are in z-direction, and similar and parallel. The
variation may be random because of layered structure. Simultaneously, the variation
part is tiny. Additionally, the variation can even be recovered during irradiation
process. In this case, the reason for relative intensity for peak variation is difficult to
explain. Although, the variation in relative intensity is difficult to explain, the
variation in diffraction angle is interesting. For instance, if the diffraction angle
becomes larger meaning shrink, if the diffraction becomes smaller meaning expansion.
Additionally, if the interval position appears peak meaning serious decomposition or
phase transformation. These variations are essential for realizing radiation damage,
which is of great significance. Generally, variation trend is similar. In this case, we
could conclude sample occurred shrink after irradiation.
(5) With these minor revisions the paper can be accepted for publication.
Thanks very much for your kind reading, hard work and positive comments.
Almost all suggestions were adopted, they are important to improve our research.
Simultaneously, partial extra parts were revised and almost the whole manuscript
was rewritten. We hope it could be easily understandable and more accurate. In
reality, in this file for answer to question, partial literatures should be cited to make
the answer more plentifully. We have tried this strategy, however, which makes the
description confusing as partial revised main text in this file. Numerous literatures
were numbered in that part. In this case, if we cite extra literature, the file would be
difficult to read. Generally, the answer is plentiful and assured. Generally, via
answering these questions, we have a deeper realization on our shortcoming and our
work, which improved our research sufficiently. We would make the research more
deeply and systematically in future. We hope we could obtain your guidance and help
more, trying to improve our academic level finally. We would show our appreciation
to you for your hard work once again!
