1) A major concern in the previous round of review was that other possible combinations of
"distantly related" species, such as pse-ana, pal-mel and pse-mel, were not examined. Although
the authors answered as "we view this as an important next step in future work, as we state in the
Discussion (Lines 303-325 and 349-353)", I don't think these parts are not directly related to this
concern. I appreciate the new Fig. 4, but I can't find any statements referring to it in the main text.
Why not include the following statements not only in the response to review but also into the
manuscript?
"As can be seen in this new figure Fig. 4, D. ananassae was not more or less aggressive overall
than other species, such as D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. atripex. Furthermore, the level
and direction of aggression (heterospecific vs. conspecific) depended on the opponent species—
e.g., the level of conspecific aggression was higher when species were paired with more distantly
related species for D. ananassae, D. melanogaster, and D. simulans. Thus, it does not appear that
the species-pair interactions that include D. ananassae are what solely drive the main patterns of
our results. It will be important in future work to investigate broader sets of species, and in all
combinations of species-pair interactions, in order to evaluate these trends in aggression behavior
more broadly. It will be important in future work to investigate broader sets of species, and in all
combinations of species-pair interactions, in order to evaluate these trends in aggression behavior
more broadly."
2) I enjoyed the supplemental videos, and noticed that D. sim males were rigorously courting D.
mel males in the Video S2. I suspect it induced more heterospecific aggression from D. mel males
towards D. sim males. Because it suggests a possibility that non-aggressive behavior affects the
results, I hope to see some explanations in the main text. "Mis-directed courtship toward
heterospecific males" could be a kind of reproductive interference if it happens under the natural
condition.

All my concerns have been addressed. The paper is clearer, and the figures are much improved.
This study is a valuable contribution to our understanding of heterospecific aggression. I do think
it's curious that there seems to be some interactive or condition-dependent effect of the species
pair and conspecific aggression. I'm not sure what can be said about this, but it's interesting.

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
5
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript. Make sure it is clear in your data accessibility statement how the data
can be accessed;
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article
so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.

thank the reviewer for this comment and suggestion. In response to the first question

uscript. In response to the suggestion to include text that addresses the reviewer’s concern
ut differential levels of aggression among the species, we have included a revised version of
quoted text from above in the revised version of the manuscript. This quoted text was taken
m our previous response to review in the last submission, and we have revised it slightly to fit
the main text of the revised manuscript on lines 206-209.
