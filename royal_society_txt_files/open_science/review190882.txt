The authors proposed that report for tetrabasic lead sulfate was synthesized from scrap lead
paste that was formed through the production process of the lead-acid batteries. The effectiveness
lead-acid batteries adding of 4BS was evaluated, and the 100 % charge-discharge cycle life of the
new battery (523 times) was about 1.4 times higher than that of general lead-acid batteries (365
times). The results are reasonable and the manuscript is well-organized. However, there are some
minor problems about the manuscript, therefore I suggest this paper for "minor revision".

moreover, I still don't see how the results in fig2 are obtained, supporting info on how and based

Comments:
1. The schematic of Fig 1 is not beautiful. The authors shall make it
good.
Respond to comment: Thanks for the referee’s kind suggestion.
In the manuscript we submitted earlier, the schematic of Figure 1 was
really not beautiful enough , so we made modification to the schematic of
Figure 1.
2.In the introduction the authors may consider more energy storage
material related references for broader readership.
Respond to comment: Thanks for the referee’s kind suggestion
In the introduction, we supplemented some references related to
energy storage materials for broader readership([27] and [28]).
3.The image quality of Fig 5 and Fig 6 are not good enough and suggest
that the author modified them of re-capture to make good
presentation.(Fig 5. Too small font size)
Respond to comment: Thanks for the referee’s kind suggestion.
I think what I have done before is really not good enough. According to
the reviewer’s suggestion, Fig.4(Fig 5 on the originally submitted version
of manuscript) and Fig 5(Fig 6 on the originally submitted version of
manuscript) are modified in order to present the experimental results
better.
Reviewer: 2
Comments:
This paper is regarding to the use of tetrabasic lead sulfate for positive
materials additives in lead-acid battery use. As for the materials
innovative and battery evaluation, the work is far less strong sa
publishable results. The materials characterization are limited, the
battery evaluation need to be given as an average results as evaluated
from multiple cells. SEM are blurred, TEM are suggested to add and the
XPS data are missing. The results and discussion need to be expanded
and provide sound explanation.
Respond to comment: Thank you for your valuable comments.
It is really true as Reviewer suggested that the materials characterization
is limited. In fact, in this paper we have focused on comparing the
electrochemical performance and the cycle life of lead-acid batteries that
used the positive active material synthesized by adding 4BS and without
4BS. And by means of morphology analysis through SEM, it is verified
that the addition of 4BS to the positive active material resulted in the
refinement of particles and the homogenization of structure and it can be
assumed that the improved performance is close related to the formation
of the homogeneous structure with fine particles.
Review’s valuable comments will become the important guiding to our
researches. According to the reviewer's good instruction, we are able to
make a great effort to provide sufficient evidence for the materials
characterization by means of effective analytical approach such as TEM
and XPS.
Reviewer: 3
Comments:
1.Experimental data needs to be provided to demonstrate the validity of
Figure 2 and Figure 3.
Respond to comment: Thank you for your valuable comments.
In order to demonstrate the validity of Figure 2 and Figure 3(on the
originally submitted version of manuscript), we made modification to the
Figure 2 and give experimental data in order to better understand the
results.
2.In table 2, wt%(a-PbO) in battery 2 is less than that battery 1, how
come wt%(4BS) in battery 2 is more than that of battery 1?
Respond to comment: Thank you for your valuable comments.
In the process of curing, positive electrode material is transformed into
tribasic lead sulfate (3BS) and tetrabasic lead sulfate (4BS) lead sulfate.
4BS is synthesized by the following reactions:
PbSO4 + 4PbO <U+2192> 4PbO · PbSO4(4BS)
Or
PbO · PbSO4(1BS) + 3PbO <U+2192> 4PbO · PbSO4(4BS)
As shown the above reaction, PbO plays an important role in the
generation of 4BS. And adding 4BS as crystal seeds promote the
generation of 4BS in the lead paste during the curing process. Therefore,
adding 4BS as crystal seeds into positive active materials is efficient
likely to increase the 4BS content in the plate after curing. Based on the
above theory, we have reinterpreted this part.
3.Fig.4 is not clear to read?
Respond to comment: Thank you for your valuable comments.
Figure 3(Figure 4 on the originally submitted version of manuscript ) has
been modified.
4.Fig.5 cannot be used to distinguish different phases of PbO2, BSD or
other data should be giver, also, the calculation process to get thouse
weight ratio in table 2 & 3 should be outlined.
Respond to comment: Thank you for your valuable comments.
XS. Lang et al.[8] was briefly calculated the purity of 4BS with the XRD
data and Materials Studio software. According to a method provided by
them, we also analyzed the purity of 4BS. The calculation results were
shown in the Figure 4. The results shown that the content of 4BS is
achieved ca. 98.6%, and this means that the purity of the synthesized
4BS is very high.
5.The language in paper should be organized furthermore to present the
work clearly and systematically.
Respond to comment: Thank you for your valuable comments.
Referring to the suggestion of the reviewer, we tried our best to improve
the manuscript and made some changes in the manuscript. These
changes will not influence the content and framework of the paper.
We appreciate for Editors/Reviewers’ warm work earnestly, and hope
that the correction will meet with approval.
Once again, thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.

Respond to comment: Thank you for your valuable comments.
As the reviewer mentioned, we are not giving sufficient evidence for the
results of Figure 2. So we removed this part (including Figure 2), and we
guarantee that this will not affect the overall content of the paper.
In our paper, We calculated the content of 4BS synthesized by sintering
at temperature of 450 °C and hold time of 7 h using the XRD data and
Materials Studio software, the results are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3
of the revised version.
We tried our best to improve the manuscript and made some changes in
