Dunn et al. demonstrated the construction of an autonomous rotary DNA nanomotor, which
holds interest for the field of DNA nanotechnology and beyond. As a prototype, though without
a direct observation of rotation, I think the design is solid, and characterizations indirectly
confirmed the strand displacement modulated DNA nanomotor rotation. Therefore I recommend
the publication of this work without further revision.

The authors provide interesting aspects in building a rotary apparatus from DNA and using
strand displacement reactions to operate it. However, I have several concerns regarding the
work, please see below:
- The authors should characterize their square structures by using AFM or TEM. The authors
mention in the text that they cannot discriminate the unfolded and folded squares with agarose
gel electrophoresis. Therefore, it is even more crucial to see the actual shape of the structures and
the motor (squares connected).
- The gel electrophoresis image in Fig. 4d is extremely hard to interpret and the gel bands do not
look convincing. Even with the analysis in the Supporting information the image is not easily
interpreted.
- I suggest that the authors add schematic and simple figures for describing each step in the
operating procedure (for the gels and for the QCM-D measurements) rather than just acronyms
that are hard to interpret.

- I'm not sure if it is a good strategy to speculate with the further measurements at this level in the
paper without performing them (sections 3d-f). Moreover, I suggest to remove Fig. 5 since that
kind of motor has not been demonstrated in the paper. However, if the authors decide to keep the
speculation of how to realize the motor by using DNA origamis (or other nanostructures), I
would suggest that the authors cite some recent reviews that summarize the currently available
methods to build with DNA at the nanoscale.

Dunn et al describe design and characterization of a DNA nanomotor. This is an interesting study
worthy of publication.
However, there is one main concern. While the title states that the manuscript describes a rotary
motor, the authors do not demonstrate that their construct is indeed rotating (as they themselves
admit, see section d).
Their results, either QMC-D and electrophoresis (not definitive), only show that the system is
capable to go from state 1 (wheel that contains the tape hybridized) to a final state (the unfolded
tape from the wheel staples that form a ds tape), but do not demonstrate that the interconversion
process is a stepwise, rotary process.
Moreover, there are features of the construct that could enable alternative pathways other than
the rotary pathway they describe. For instance, as the tapes (T and T*) are complementary, the
corresponding staples (that make up the wheel) are complementary too (for example St74 and
Str47). Therefore, after strand displacement, when the first bit of both of the staples is released
from T (and T*), these ssDNA segments could also act as a toehold on an alternative strand
displacement route e.g. opening up the wheel, etc. This would, in theory, inhibit the rotary
pathway proposed.

I believe these points need addressing prior to publication either by being upfront about the lack
of proof of rotation, e.g. changing the title to “ A… study of a putative ….” or by additional
experiments.

presence of nickel. Consequently, most of the images
were unclear, but it was possible to discern a small
number of objects that were approximately the right size
and shape. The structures were not well-resolved,
presumably because they were bound poorly to the mica.
As a result, the data has not been included in the
manuscript itself, but is presented below.
The reviewer highlighted the finding that it was not
possible to discriminate between unfolded and folded
squares using agarose gel electrophoresis. To allay any
concerns in this respect, polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis has now been used to characterize the
structures. For small structures, polyacrylamide gels offer
better resolution than agarose gels, and the results
obtained did show a clear difference between the bands
corresponding to unfolded and folded structures, as
expected. This gel is included in Figure 4 and discussed
further in the context of the next point.
To supplement the new characterization of the structures,
the Supplementary Information now contains the results
of simulations performed using the online tool NUPACK.
This data demonstrates that each domain should primarily
bind to its intended target, offering further support for the
claim that the structures fold well.

powers many synthetic linear DNA motors. Unlike other
examples of rotary DNA machines, the device described
here is designed to be capable of autonomous operation
after it is triggered. The experimental results are
consistent with operation of the motor as expected, and
future work on an enhanced motor design may allow
rotation to be observed at the single molecule level.'
The last paragraph in the ‘Background’ now states:
This paper describes the experimental study of the
putative mechanism of an autonomous rotary DNA
motor, through a series of experiments in which the
underlying principles were tested and a prototype of the
motor was examined. The motor is designed to be driven
by sequential strand displacement reactions, and the
concept is explained in the Methods section, in which the
experimental procedures are also described. […] The
experimental results were consistent with the motor
operating as intended, but the methods used here did not
allow rotation to be seen directly. The aims of the
present study were (a) to validate the hypothesis that
sequential strand displacement reactions could catalyse
significant structural rearrangement in a folded DNA
construct on a surface and (b) to construct a rotary
motor prototype based on this idea, confirming that it
undergoes a structural transition as a result of strand
displacement. Further experiments on an enhanced
motor design may build on this work by imaging
rotation with single-molecule resolution, and this is
discussed towards the end of the paper.’
The concluding section now begins: ‘This paper has
described an experimental study of the putative
mechanism of a prototype synthetic rotary motor made
from DNA. The motor was designed to be driven by
strand displacement and to be capable of autonomous
operation after the brake was released.’
The record in the Dryad data repository has been updated
to reflect the changes. As indicated, additional
experiments may form the basis of follow-up projects.

(b), (d): AFM images of Square B (b) and assembled motor (d). Each sample was prepared as
for the polyacrylamide gel experiment, and 10<U+F06D>L was deposited on freshly cleaved mica that
had been washed with 10<U+F06D>L of 50mM NiCl2. The mica was swirled to distribute structures
across the surface and the specimen was left for several minutes for surface adsorption. AFM
imaging was then performed in tapping mode in fluid using a Bruker Bioscope Resolve, with
Bruker SNL probes (cantilever C). The imaging buffer is given in the figures. Images were
processed using the program Gwyddion, employing plane levelling, row alignment, contrast
adjustment, shifting minimum data value to zero and profile extraction. The line graphs show
the height profile along the lines indicated in the accompanying image.
Discussion of AFM data provided after figures.
Discussion of AFM data
As noted above, the structures were not well-resolved. Furthermore, very few structures were
observed, despite the comparatively high concentration (1-2<U+F06D>M) and the presence of nickel,
which usually aids adhesion. The low resolution and the scarcity of structures to image were
both attributable to poor adhesion to the mica, due to the small size of the structures.
However, taking into account the effects of tip broadening, poor adhesion and flexibility
within the structures, the shape and size of the objects seen in the AFM images are consistent
with expectations.
Assuming that a DNA helix is 2nm in diameter, the squares and motor would be expected to

between 2 and 4 nm in height, consistent with the prediction.
