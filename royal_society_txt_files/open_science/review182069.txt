The manuscript presents the investigation of the complex interrelations among microorganisms,
embedded microstructures and non-radioactive chemicals in a single microfluidic platform. The
authors have carried out characterization of physical and chemical effects by analysis of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 PAO1-GFP biofilm growth and eradication by low
concentrations of CsCl and SrCl2. The manuscript is well written, quite interesting and
informative. Experimental results support well with the authors conclusion. The manuscript can
be accepted after addressing the following minor comments.
1. How did you determine the optimal concentration of CsCl and SrCl2?
2. While representing the types of embedded microstructures as CM2, SM2, HM2 and TM2; and
CM4, SM4, HM4 and TM4, what does the labels 2 and 4 represent?
3. Check that the following statement “The thickness of the biofilm was measured at the inlet,
middle, and outlet portions of the microfluidic channel. In each position, the height and the
standard deviation were obtained by measuring at both wall portions and the middle portion.
The effect of CsCl and SrCl2 was also measured by the same method.” is repeated twice in the
3
same paragraph of the Results and Discussion Section.
4. Why does the triangular microstructure exhibit least eradication?
5. Check the inconsistent usage of SrCl2 and SrCl2 and typographical errors throughout the
article.

data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.

This MS has an interesting story, but the authors should improve English
nificantly throughout the text. In the abstract, do not use abbreviations without full
mes.
ponse) According to your comment, we modified our mistake to do not use
reviations in the abstract section, and it was also corrected by a company specialized
nglish proofing (Editage.com, Job code: YNURS_119, Green color).

manuscript presents the investigation of the complex interrelations among
roorganisms, embedded microstructures and non-radioactive chemicals in a single
rofluidic platform. The authors have carried out characterization of physical and
mical effects by analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 PAO1-GFP biofilm
wth and eradication by low concentrations of CsCl and SrCl2. The manuscript is
l written, quite interesting and informative. Experimental results support well with
authors conclusion. The manuscript can be accepted after addressing the following
or comments.
How did you determine the optimal concentration of CsCl and SrCl2?
ponse) Methods for determining the optimal concentrations of CsCl and SrCl2 are
en in page 6 (lines 201-204). However, References were added for introducing
ailed processes (i.e. Petri dish method) how to determine the optimal concentrations
f CsCl and SrCl2.
e 6 (lines 201-204): “The optimal CsCl and SrCl2 concentrations for the microfluidic
ices were pre-determined using a Petri dish-based system. After that, various
centrations were injected directly into the PAO1-GFP biofilm, and the range of CsCl
SrCl2 concentrations was finally determined during this process [33]”
While representing the types of embedded microstructures as CM2, SM2, HM2 and
2; and CM4, SM4, HM4 and TM4, what does the labels 2 and 4 represent?
ponse) Labels 2 and 4 are arbitrary numbers and there is a difference in diameter.
ailed information is provided on page 4 (Line 144-146).
e 4 (Line 144-146): “The micro-fabricated microstructures in this study had
meters of 172±8.0µm (i.e. CM2, SM2, HM2, and TM2) and 132±6.5µm (i.e. CM4, SM4,
4, and TM4)”
Check that the following statement “The thickness of the biofilm was measured at
inlet, middle, and outlet portions of the microfluidic channel. In each position, the
ght and the standard deviation were obtained by measuring at both wall portions
the middle portion. The effect of CsCl and SrCl2 was also measured by the same
thod.” is repeated twice in the same paragraph of the Results and Discussion Section.
ponse) We thank you for pointing out our mistakes and corrected the problems
ge 5, Line 178-185).
Why does the triangular microstructure exhibit least eradication?
ponse) It is an important part of our manuscript. We confirmed that the triangular
rostructure exhibited the worst effect among the four different shapes of
rostructures in biofilm eradication using experimental and numerical methods (i.e.
D). The average wall shear stress (tWD) shown in Eq. (1) is affected by the flow
ocity. It is known that the increase in shear stress will promote biofilm detachment
ause high flow rates are preferred at all times to reduce the buildup of bacterial
films [1]. In the case of the triangular microstructure, the flow velocity was observed
e the slowest among the four microstructures [2] and the average wall shear stress
D) was proved to be the smallest through CFD analysis.
