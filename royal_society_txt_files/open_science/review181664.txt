Title: Fabrication and characterization of capric acid/reduced graphene oxide decorated
diatomite composite phase change materials for solar energy storage
The authors fabricated a novel type of CPCMs with CA and rGO decorated diatomite using
vacuum impregnation. The structure, morphology and thermal properties of CPCMs had been
studied in depth. The characterization and explanation made sense. I recommend publication in
Royal Society Open Science after minor revisions. Some comments are provided as follows:
(1) Configuration and arrangement of figures are poor. There are so many figures in the draft
manuscript. It is suggested some of the figures (e.g. Figure 6 (a) and (b), Figure 9 and 10) be
combined.
(2) More details of the diatomite sample are required.
(3) The determination of the transition temperatures from the DSC thermograms should be
specified (were they determined at the peak maximum ?).

In this study, DI-based CPCMs with good shape stability and high thermal conductivity were
well designed. The microstructures, chemical compatibility, thermal conductivity,
3
thermophysical properties and shape-stability and were discussed in detail. This is a
comprehensive and informative research and has certain significance in improving the properties
of PCMs. However, there are some problems in the manuscript that should be further explained
for publication in the present form. The following points need to be noticed:
1. The language must be improved, and there are too many shorts for materials throughout the
full text made it difficult to understand.
2. The article emphasizes the DI-based CPCMs aims in solar energy storage but is not reflected in
the manuscript. How can this material used in solar energy storage? And there also should make
a comparison between this new DI-based CPCMs and the other current materials.
3. The authors studied shape-stability of the composite PCMs by leakage tests. What was the
package capacity of composite PCMs without obviously liquid leakage? For the discussion in 4.2,
what’s the reason for the conclusion expressed as “Thus, the impregnation ratio of DI was
improved through alkali treatment, and CA/rGO-DI (60wt.%: 40wt.%) was considered the
optimum combination for producing CPCM.”?
4. The reasons why CA/rGO-DI CPCMs exhibited the highest thermal conductivity should be
further analyzed and clarified.
5. A more comprehensive and clearly conclusion should be supplemented.

This paper mainly reports that diatomite–based composite phase change materials (DI-based
CPCMs) were fabricated by the vacuum impregnation of capric acid (CA) into reduced graphene
oxide decorated diatomite (rGO-DI).Results shows that the CPCMs of this manuscript have the
potential to be used in solar energy storage systems. On the whole, the experiments in the
manuscript support the arguments well and this paper is reasonable in structure and expression
basically. The photographs are all reasonably processed and exhibit legible information. In my
opinion, this manuscript can be accepted for publication after revising.

List of Responses
Dear Editor:
Thank you for the opportunity to resubmit our revised manuscript
entitled “Fabrication and characterization of capric acid/ reduced
graphene oxide decorated diatomite composite phase change materials
for solar energy” (ID: RSOS-181664). We have studied comments from
you and reviewers carefully and have made correction. Those comments
are all valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our paper,
as well as the important guiding significance to our researches. The
main corrections in the paper and the responds to the reviewer’s
comments are as flowing:
Reviewer #1:
Response to comment 1: Configuration and arrangement of figures are
poor. There are so many figures in the draft manuscript. It is suggested
some of the figures (e.g. Figure 6 (a) and (b), Figure 9 and 10) be
combined.
Response: Considering the reviewer’s suggestion, several figures in this
paper has been redrawn (Fig. 2(c), Fig. 3, Fig. 5, Fig. 6) and combined
(Fig. 9 and 10). The intensity of CA is too high, if combine Fig. 6 (a)
and (b), the Fig.6 will turned the following picture.
Response to comment 2: More details of the diatomite sample are
required.
Response: We are sorry for our negligence. We added the details of the
diatomite sample in Section 3.1, Table 1

Response to comment 3: The determination of the transition
temperatures from the DSC thermograms should be specified (were they
determined at the peak maximum?).
Response: Generally, the phase change temperature of PCMs were the
onset temperature in DSC curves as the below shown, the peak
temperature was corresponding the endothermic/ exothermic peak
temperature.
DSC curves of pure CA.
Special thanks to you for your good comments
Reviewer #2:
Response to comment 1: The language must be improved, and there are
too many shorts for materials throughout the full text made it difficult
to understand.
Response: The language of our manuscript has been refined and
polished by a professional editing company.
Response to comment 2: The article emphasizes the DI-based CPCMs
aims in solar energy storage but is not reflected in the manuscript. How
can this material used in solar energy storage? And there also should
make a comparison between this new DI-based CPCMs and the other
current materials.
Response: Considering the reviewer’s suggestion, the illustration of
PCM used in solar energy storage areas has been added in “Section 2
Introduction”.
We had made a comparison between the DI-based CPCMs and other
DI-based CPCMs in previous manuscript (Table 3) and considering the
reviewer’s suggestion, we made a comparison between the DI-based
CPCMs and other clay-based CPCMs in the revision manuscript (Table
4). In previous research, the phase change latent of clay-based
composite PCM is an important factor in solar energy storage. The
excellent thermal properties of CA/rGO-DI FSPCMs could potentially
be used as solar energy storage material.
Response to comment 3: The authors studied shape-stability of the
composite PCMs by leakage tests. What was the package capacity of
composite PCMs without obviously liquid leakage? For the discussion
in 4.2, what’s the reason for the conclusion expressed as “Thus, the
impregnation ratio of DI was improved through alkali treatment, and
CA/rGO-DI (60wt.%: 40wt.%) was considered the optimum
combination for producing CPCM.”?
Response: In this study, the highest content of PCM was 60wt.% with
no leakage happening, in Fig.3 we can find that the composite PCMs
were agglomerate when the content of CA was higher than 60wt.%, the
composite PCMs were leaked after heating under CA content of 65wt.%.
In order to indicate the package capacity of composite PCMs without
obviously liquid leakage more obviously, the Fig.3 was redrawn, the
mass loss of composite PCMs during the melting process was tested and
the discussion in 4.2 was rewritten. The results as following:
4.2 Exudation stability of CA/DI and CA/rGO-DI CPCM
The macroscopic photographs of CA/DI and CA/rGO-DI-2 CPCM with
different content of CA were shown in Fig.3(a), it is obvious that the
composite PCMs were agglomerate when the content of CA was
65wt.%. In order to investigate the exudation stability, CA/DI and
CA/rGO-DI-1 CPCM the were heated to 80<U+2103> for 0-2h, the residual
quantity of CA/DI and CA/rGO-DI-1 CPCM were shown in Fig.3(b).
The mass loss during the heating process can be neglected when the
content of CA was 55wt.% and 60wt.%. Yet significant mass loss (about
10wt.%) occurred for CA/DI and CA/rGO-DI-1 CPCM when the
content of CA was 65wt.%. Thus, the optimum mass fraction of CA in
composite without leakage is 60wt.%.
Fig. 3 Photographs of CA/DI and CA/rGO-DI-1 CPCM (a); The
residual quantity of the composite PCMs during the heating
process(b).
Response to comment 4: The reasons why CA/rGO-DI CPCMs
exhibited the highest thermal conductivity should be further analyzed
and clarified.
Response: Considering the reviewer’s suggestion, we further analyzed
the reasons why CA/rGO-DI CPCMs exhibited the highest thermal
conductivity.
Response to comment 5: A more comprehensive and clearly conclusion
should be supplemented.
Response: We had rewritten the conclusion.
Special thanks to you for your good comments
Reviewer #3:
Response to comment 1: In Fig. 2(c), it would be more convenient if
you put 170<U+2103> to 250<U+2103> intervals with two vertical dashed lines.
Response: Considering the reviewer’s suggestion, two vertical dashed
lines at 170<U+2103> and 250<U+2103> had been added in Fig. 2(c)
Response to comment 2: In Fig. 3,Some of the pictures have shadows,
so you can make them more clearly. The luminescence properties of
phosphors mentioned in your title is not complete, please add more.
Response: Considering the reviewer’s suggestion, we had redrawn the
Fig. 3 and rewritten the “Section 4.2”. In addition, the illustration of
PCM used in solar energy storage areas has been added in “Section 2
Introduction”
Response to comment 3: In Fig.5, please add the legend.
Response: We are sorry for our negligence, the legend has been added
in Fig.5
Response to comment 4: In Fig.6, If there is a standard card of a single
phase of CA, please put it in the picture for comparison.
Response: The Fig.6 has been rewritten, the diffraction peaks of pristine
CA and DI has been showed in Fig.6. However, we had not found the
standard card of a single phase of CA in previous paper and standard
PDF card. In this paper, compared the XRD curves of CA, DI and
CA/DI, the diffraction peaks of CA and DI were observed in CA/DI,
which suggested that CA was successfully loaded into the supporting
materials (DI or rGO-DI).
Special thanks to you for your good comments
We tried our best to improve the manuscript and made some changes in
the manuscript. These changes will not influence the content and
framework of the paper.
We hope that the revised manuscript is now acceptable for publication.
We look forward to hearing from you.
Once again, thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.
