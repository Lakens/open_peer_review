Purser et al. Depression chains in seafloor of contrasting morphology, Atacama Trench margin. A
comment on Marsh et al. (2018).
This paper provides additional evidence to suggest that the ballast-collection hypothesis
presented by Marsh et al. was flawed. I agree wholeheartedly with this sentiment.
I believe several reviewers (myself included) suggested that the original paper (submitted to
other journals prior to its publication) should omit this material – pointing out that this was not
supported by the biology of the animals themselves (negatively buoyant near the surface and
more so at depth). This recommendation was not followed. I therefore very much recommend
that this note is published, but suggest that the paper could say a little more (in discussion) about
the lack of support for this hypothesis:
For instance, there is nothing in the ‘observations’ presented by Marsh et al. that supports
ingestion of coarse material as ballast, and there is a distinct lack of support for this hypothesis
within the literature. The relative paucity and variety of material ingested by deep-diving whales
better supports accidental ingestion during foraging than intentional ingestion for ballast (Walker
et al. 2002 documents only 2 of 20 stomachs of beaked whales containing stones, Nemoto & Nasu
1963 show various items in sperm whale stomachs). Articles referred to by Taylor (1993) suggest
that gastroliths are found predominately in marine vertebrates with hydrofoil limbs (plesiosaurs,
penguins, otariid pinnipeds) but not those with caudal fins (i.e. not cetaceans).
In fact, beaked whales appear to be negatively buoyant. Miller et al (2016) demonstrate negative
tissue buoyancy for northern bottlenose whales (a species of beaked whale) in seawater. So it is
unclear why increasing their negative buoyancy (by ingesting rocks) would be useful to them.
(They already can and do change their buoyancy by altering diving lung volume.) Ingestion of
ballast is not a convincing reason for whales diving 4 km to further decrease their buoyancy.

diving gas volume of the northern bottlenose whale (Hyperoodon ampullatus). Journal of
Experimental Biology 219, 2458-2468.
Other than this, I have only minor corrections/comments:
Abstract: delete last sentence ‘and therefore impacts of this deep diving foraging behaviour on
deep seafloor communities’
Results.
P2l12. It would be useful to state how long these chains were (looks from figure as approx.
300m?)
P2l18. ~8.5m. Perhaps worth noting that this is around a single body length of either sperm
whale or Cuvier’s beaked whale.

Discussion.
P3l20. Should be “observed (i.e. tagged) diving to the seafloor depths”
P3l24. Reference 13 is not relevant to this statement.
P3l30. Replace ‘seems’ with ‘is’ to read ‘to function in the role of gastroliths, is highly unlikely’.
Please add additional material discussed above to further substantiate this statement, e.g.
“Furthermore the paucity and variety of material ingested by deep-diving whales better supports
accidental ingestion during foraging than intentional ingestion for ballast (Walker et al.
documents only 2 of 20 stomachs of beaked whales containing stones). Beaked whales have
negative tissue density in seawater, i.e. they are negatively buoyant (Miller et al 2016), which also
suggests no benefit to ingestion of ballast.”
P3l41. “Observed” in Woodside et al. (rather than ‘hypothesised’)
P3l55. “quite some time” – please be more specific.
P3l57. Delete “Possibly opportunistic grazing of the benthic environment is made prior a return
to the surface”
References. Please check titles – should be lower case. Kenyon – should be Cuvier’s.
Figures.
Figure 1. Unclear that this figure is necessary. What is a? What is b? What are stars? Location of
current study is not clear (this is not circled – it is perhaps the filled star?). Are other locations
relevant – were marks observed at all of these?
Figures 2,3, and 4 should be merged into a composite single figure – and show part of fig 2. That
is expanded into Fig 4 and Fig 3. (It is not apparent that Fig 4 adds much – what is green and
grey part in centre?)
Figure 5. f) Unknown incirrate octopus (not octopi… there is only one in this image).

It is very exciting to see the growing body of data on deep water prey distribution, and
strengthened evidence of benthic habitat use by cetaceans, that these newer survey technologies
are providing. Thank you so much for taking the time to highlight this small, but important,
finding. You do a good job of supporting what I think is a sound hypothesis for the formation of
these depression chains while tactfully refuting the "ballast collection" hypothesis, which seemed
dubious at best.
I have provided some fairly minor comments in the attached document (Appendix A). Perhaps
the most significant change I would suggest relates to incorporating a more recent, and quite
comprehensive, publication on dietary preferences of Cuvier's beaked whales into your
discussion. I think this can improve your concluding remarks, and it also underscores the
importance of your findings and the value of your survey methodology to our general
understanding of this sensitive and data-deficient species.

Appendix A
Reviewer’s comments for RSOS-182053
1. Summary
a. Page 1, Line 47: I would consider revising the final statement of this
summary along the following lines: Given that both cruises found
these depression chains in contrasting physical regions of the East
Pacific, they may have a more ubiquitous distribution than just
these sites. Thus, the impacts of cetacean foraging behaviour on
deep seafloor communities, and the potential relevance of these
prey sources to deep diving species, should be considered.
2. Introduction and Methodology
a. Page1, Lines 57-58: Recommend adding complete names for all
acronyms upon first use (e.g. HADES-ERC and AWI OFOBS), both
here and throughout the document.
3. Results
a. Page 2, Line 12: If “SO261/109-1” (in parentheses) is an identifier, I
would add that for clarification (e.g. “survey ID SO261/109-1”).
b. Page 2, Line 16: add a comma after [3] and change “area were” to
“area was”
c. Page 2, Lines 27-37: Given the detailed descriptions of relevant
features in figure S1 provided here, I would consider indicating
these on the figure itself. I found it difficult to discern them without
being more familiar with this type of imagery.
4. Discussion
a. Page 2, Line 54: Suggest replacing “missed” with “not detected” or
“not detectable”
b. Page 2, Line 56: Since you use the phrase “differed greatly” to
contrast the seafloor characteristics between these two surveys,
were there other differences besides the presence/absence of
polymetallic nodules?
c. Page 3, Line 41: Replace comma after [19] with semicolon
d. Page 3, Line 57 through end: I would rewrite this section a bit, and
consider adding some discussion of findings in West et al. (2017)
(below), as they pertain to the “grazing” hypothesis. They note the
presence of crustaceans in stomach contents of Cuvier’s beaked
whales in the North Pacific and elsewhere, and while they don’t
indicate which (if any) of the species were benthic, it may help
support your argument that whales “graze” on benthic organisms
when the opportunity presents itself. Given the energetic
investment in commuting to such depths to feed, it does make
sense that whales would take advantage of these low-cost
predation opportunities, especially if they encounter lower densities
of more desirable prey on a given dive. Also, while benthic prey may
not form a significant portion of the typical diet, they may be of
higher importance for some whales (e.g. younger animals that may
be less successful at foraging on more active targets, individuals
that are stressed or physiologically compromised in some way, or
whales experiencing acoustic disturbances that impede their ability
to pursue more active prey species). I think this would both
strengthen your basic hypothesis of the etiology of depression
chains, and also increase the relevance of your paper to the field of
deep-water cetacean ecology.

5. Figures
a. Figure Caption 1: "a" and "b" are not indicated in the panel. A
clearer explanation of what the stars represent would be helpful
(e.g. “stars mark approximate locations of OFOBS deployments”).
The caption suggests there should be a circled deployment, but
there isn’t one- I assume this should actually be the black star?
b. Figure Caption 2: There should be a period after (2018).
c. Figure caption 3: I would revise the first sentence to read “Image of
a depression feature taken from 1.5 m altitude”.
d. Figure caption 4: This caption is a little confusing, but I don’t
understand it well enough to suggest a revision.
e. Figure caption 5: correct “sp..” to “spp.”, add “)” after “b”, replace
comma with period after “mound” for consistency with other
formatting.

RE: Comment submission – Manuscript ID RSOS-182053
Dear RSOS team,
Thank you for the swift review of the initial draft of our comment manuscript,
particularly over the festive period!
We were greatly pleased to receive such a positive review to the initial draft,
supported by really excellent and useful suggestions by the reviewers. The
great majority of these have been integrated into the new version, as can be
seen in the attached ‘track changes’ version of the manuscript. To further
assist in this, we have provided a detailed response to each of the reviewer
comments on the following pages of this letter.
We would like to thank again you and the reviewers for the time taken to
consider this submission, and particularly the care taken by those reviewers
in providing constructive suggestions.
Yours sincerely,
Autun Purser (on behalf of all authors).
DETAILED RESPONSE TO REVIEWER COMMENTS:
REVIEWER TEXT IN BLACK, OUR RESPONSE GIVEN IN RED
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
Purser et al. Depression chains in seafloor of contrasting morphology,
Atacama Trench margin. A comment on Marsh et al. (2018).
COMMENT: This paper provides additional evidence to suggest that the
ballast-collection hypothesis presented by Marsh et al. was flawed. I agree
wholeheartedly with this sentiment.
I believe several reviewers (myself included) suggested that the original
paper (submitted to other journals prior to its publication) should omit this
material – pointing out that this was not supported by the biology of the
animals themselves (negatively buoyant near the surface and more so at
depth). This recommendation was not followed. I therefore very much
recommend that this note is published, but suggest that the paper could say
a little more (in discussion) about the lack of support for this hypothesis:
For instance, there is nothing in the ‘observations’ presented by Marsh et al.
that supports ingestion of coarse material as ballast, and there is a distinct
lack of support for this hypothesis within the literature. The relative paucity
and variety of material ingested by deep-diving whales better supports
accidental ingestion during foraging than intentional ingestion for ballast
(Walker et al. 2002 documents only 2 of 20 stomachs of beaked whales
containing stones, Nemoto & Nasu 1963 show various items in sperm whale
stomachs). Articles referred to by Taylor (1993) suggest that gastroliths are
found predominately in marine vertebrates with hydrofoil limbs (plesiosaurs,
penguins, otariid pinnipeds) but not those with caudal fins (i.e. not
cetaceans).
RESPONSE: These useful comments have now all been incorporated into
the manuscript, and appropriately referenced, such as in the last paragraph
of the discussion. We favour the idea that these stones, when they have
been found, are accidental results of the benthic opportunistic feeding, and
we believe we have made this opinion clearer in this draft.
In fact, beaked whales appear to be negatively buoyant. Miller et al (2016)
demonstrate negative tissue buoyancy for northern bottlenose whales (a
species of beaked whale) in seawater. So it is unclear why increasing their
negative buoyancy (by ingesting rocks) would be useful to them. (They
already can and do change their buoyancy by altering diving lung
volume.) Ingestion of ballast is not a convincing reason for whales diving 4
km to further decrease their buoyancy.

RESPONSE: This comment, and the associated reference, now form the
initial section of paragraph 4 ofthe discussion.
Other than this, I have only minor corrections/comments:
COMMENT: Abstract: delete last sentence ‘and therefore impacts of this
deep diving foraging behaviour on deep seafloor communities’
RESPONSE: The last sentence of the abstract has been rewritten.
Results.
COMMENT: P2l12. It would be useful to state how long these chains were
(looks from figure as approx. 300m?)
RESPONSE: The lengths of the chains is now discussed in the first
paragraph of the results in more detail.. up to 500 m in our data.
COMMENT: P2l18. ~8.5m. Perhaps worth noting that this is around a single
body length of either sperm whale or Cuvier’s beaked whale.
RESPONSE: The comparison of this depression spacing to a beaked whale
length is now added in the first paragraph of the results.
Discussion.
COMMENT: P3l20. Should be “observed (i.e. tagged) diving to the seafloor
depths”
RESPONSE: This change has been made as suggested.
COMMENT: P3l24. Reference 13 is not relevant to this statement.
RESPONSE: Removed as suggested.
COMMENT: P3l30. Replace ‘seems’ with ‘is’ to read ‘to function in the role of
gastroliths, is highly unlikely’. Please add additional material discussed
above to further substantiate this statement, e.g.
“Furthermore the paucity and variety of material ingested by deep-diving
whales better supports accidental ingestion during foraging than intentional
ingestion for ballast (Walker et al. documents only 2 of 20 stomachs of
beaked whales containing stones). Beaked whales have negative tissue
density in seawater, i.e. they are negatively buoyant (Miller et al 2016), which
also suggests no benefit to ingestion of ballast.”
RESPONSE: The wording ‘seems’ has been changed as suggested. Our
opinion that where stones have been consumed, it as as accidental
consumption, rather than an intended result of deep diving, has been made
clearer in the revised draft.
COMMENT: P3l41. “Observed” in Woodside et al. (rather than
‘hypothesised’)
RESPONSE: This change has been made as suggested.
COMMENT: P3l55. “quite some time” – please be more specific.
RESPONSE: This embarrassingly unspecific timeframe has been changed
to ~50 mins, as shown in the figures from the cited paper.
COMMENT: P3l57. Delete “Possibly opportunistic grazing of the benthic
environment is made prior a return to the surface”
RESPONSE: This sentence has been changed to match the suggestions of
the other reviewer, giving more info on why the whales may in some
instances be utilising these benthic food sources.
COMMENT: References. Please check titles – should be lower
case. Kenyon – should be Cuvier’s.
RESPONSE: Cuvier to Cuvier’s has been corrected. As to the other
formatting issues, we used the RSOS template here in the reference
managing software, so I presume all is now correct for the journal?
Figures.
COMMENT: Figure 1. Unclear that this figure is necessary. What is
a? What is b? What are stars? Location of current study is not clear (this is
not circled – it is perhaps the filled star?). Are other locations relevant –
were marks observed at all of these?
RESPONSE: We have modified the legend to this figure to address the star
issue, and also to comment that at only one of these sites sidescan data was
collected with our device. We wanted to place our location clearly
geographically, as it is coincident with historical reports of whale
observations and interactions, and also shows what may be an interesting
relationship with the trench flanks, should future work show a preference for
such activities in such areas. We are also happy to remove if necessary.
COMMENT: Figures 2,3, and 4 should be merged into a composite single
figure – and show part of fig 2. That is expanded into Fig 4 and Fig 3. (It is
not apparent that Fig 4 adds much – what is green and grey part in centre?)
RESPONSE: We have improved the legends of Figs 3 and particularly 4.
The reason we did not combine into on composite image is that we wanted
to upload these figures in near native resolution, as the interested reader can
actually get quite a lot of information on fauna and topography by zooming in
on these, if they are interested to do so. If we made a composite image,
some of this data would be lost.
COMMENT: Figure 5. f) Unknown incirrate octopus (not octopi… there is
only one in this image).
RESPONSE: This change has been made as suggested.

Comments to the Author(s)
COMMENT: It is very exciting to see the growing body of data on deep
water prey distribution, and strengthened evidence of benthic habitat use by
cetaceans, that these newer survey technologies are providing. Thank you
so much for taking the time to highlight this small, but important, finding. You
do a good job of supporting what I think is a sound hypothesis for the
formation of these depression chains while tactfully refuting the "ballast
collection" hypothesis, which seemed dubious at best.
RESPONSE: We believe that the depression chains are sufficiently robust in
our sidescan data to draw further attention to them as indicators of major
seafloor interactions. We additionally believe that the general readers have
jumped on the whale / nodule association with undue vigour following the
publication of the original paper – despite this being only part of the story in
that paper. Given the sensitivity of the nodule mining topic, we consider it
paramount our observations of the same sort of depression chains in nodule
free areas are published ASAP before the idea that deep diving whales
‘need’ nodule fields becomes an accepted paradigm.
I have provided some fairly minor comments in the attached document.
Perhaps the most significant change I would suggest relates to incorporating
a more recent, and quite comprehensive, publication on dietary preferences
of Cuvier's beaked whales into your discussion. I think this can improve your
concluding remarks, and it also underscores the importance of your findings
and the value of your survey methodology to our general understanding of
this sensitive and data-deficient species.
Reviewer’s comments for RSOS-182053 – imported from review .pdf:
1. Summary
COMMENT: a. Page 1, Line 47: I would consider revising the final statement
of this summary along the following lines: Given that both cruises found
these depression chains in contrasting physical regions of the East Pacific,
they may have a more ubiquitous distribution than just these sites. Thus, the
impacts of cetacean foraging behaviour on deep seafloor communities, and
the potential relevance of these prey sources to deep diving species, should
be considered.
RESPONSE: This sentence has been reworded to better integrate the
comments of both reviewers.
2. Introduction and Methodology
COMMENT: a. Page1, Lines 57-58: Recommend adding complete names
for all acronyms upon first use (e.g. HADES-ERC and AWI OFOBS), both
here and throughout the document.
RESPONSE: This has been done… though HADES itself just refers to the
oceanic depth at which the majority of the project work is conducted, rather
than being an acronym.
3. Results
COMMENT: a. Page 2, Line 12: If “SO261/109-1” (in parentheses) is an
identifier, I would add that for clarification (e.g. “survey ID SO261/109-1”).
RESPONSE: These references to the particular survey have been changed
throughout the document as suggested.
COMMENT: b. Page 2, Line 16: add a comma after [3] and change “area
were” to “area was”
RESPONSE: This has been done as suggested.
COMMENT: c. Page 2, Lines 27-37: Given the detailed descriptions of
relevant features in figure S1 provided here, I would consider indicating
these on the figure itself. I found it difficult to discern them without being
more familiar with this type of imagery.
RESPONSE: This has been done as suggested.
4. Discussion
COMMENT: a. Page 2, Line 54: Suggest replacing “missed” with “not
detected” or “not detectable”
RESPONSE: This has been done as suggested.
COMMENT: b. Page 2, Line 56: Since you use the phrase “differed greatly”
to contrast the seafloor characteristics between these two surveys, were
there other differences besides the presence/absence of polymetallic
nodules?
RESPONSE: The environmental characteristics of the two sites are now
described better, with the abundance of hard substrate at one, and the
absence at the other, now presented more clearly in the text.
COMMENT: c. Page 3, Line 41: Replace comma after [19] with semicolon
RESPONSE: This has been done as suggested.
COMMENT: d. Page 3, Line 57 through end: I would rewrite this section a
bit, and consider adding some discussion of findings in West et al. (2017)
(below), as they pertain to the “grazing” hypothesis. They note the presence
of crustaceans in stomach contents of Cuvier’s beaked whales in the North
Pacific and elsewhere, and while they don’t indicate which (if any) of the
species were benthic, it may help support your argument that whales “graze”
on benthic organisms when the opportunity presents itself. Given the
energetic investment in commuting to such depths to feed, it does make
sense that whales would take advantage of these low-cost predation
opportunities, especially if they encounter lower densities of more desirable
prey on a given dive. Also, while benthic prey may not form a significant
portion of the typical diet, they may be of higher importance for some whales
(e.g. younger animals that may be less successful at foraging on more active
targets, individuals that are stressed or physiologically compromised in some
way, or whales experiencing acoustic disturbances that impede their ability
to pursue more active prey species). I think this would both strengthen your
basic hypothesis of the etiology of depression chains, and also increase the
relevance of your paper to the field of deep-water cetacean ecology.

RESPONSE: These useful observations are now incorporated into the
discussion, along with the recent reference.
5. Figures
COMMENT: a. Figure Caption 1: "a" and "b" are not indicated in the panel.
A clearer explanation of what the stars represent would be helpful (e.g. “stars
mark approximate locations of OFOBS deployments”). The caption suggests
there should be a circled deployment, but there isn’t one- I assume this
should actually be the black star?
RESPONSE: This figure caption is improved.
COMMENT: b. Figure Caption 2: There should be a period after (2018).
RESPONSE: This has been done as suggested.
COMMENT: c. Figure caption 3: I would revise the first sentence to read
“Image of a depression feature taken from 1.5 m altitude”.
RESPONSE: This has been done as suggested.
COMMENT: d. Figure caption 4: This caption is a little confusing, but I don’t
understand it well enough to suggest a revision.
RESPONSE: This figure caption has been wholly rewritten for clarity.
COMMENT:e. Figure caption 5: correct “sp..” to “spp.”, add “)” after “b”,
replace comma with period after “mound” for consistency with other
formatting.
RESPONSE: This has been done as suggested.
