This paper addresses a sparsely investigated, yet very interesting, area of research pertaining to
the influence of pressure on the symmetry of zeolites prepared by using 18-crown-6 ether as an
organic additive. Three zeolites, that is Na-X, RHO and ZK-5 have been studied, along with their
empty analogs (zeolites for which the crown ether has been removed by thermal treatment). A
systematic study of their crystal structure performed by high-pressure X-ray diffraction revealed
that the synthesis of zeolites has a significant impact on their crystal structure and, consequently,
on the flexibility of their networks. In particular, the authors suggest that the crown ether
molecule acts as a geometric template in the synthesis of RHO and ZK-5 zeolites, behavior which
is not displayed in the synthesis of the Na-X zeolite. Such a behavior has been tentatively ascribed
to the body-centered structure of the zeolites whereby compression of the structural framework is
allowed without influencing the rigidity of the networks. Based upon the experimental results,
the authors postulate that such a behavior will be absent in the case of non-body-centered
aluminosilicate zeolites. The manuscript is well-articulated, the discussion and conclusions being
well supported by the experimental data. Perhaps it will be useful for the reader to know what is
the experimental error in the determination of the unit cell parameters and cell volumes with the
pressure. based upon the foregoing, I recommend the publication of this manuscript after the
authors address the comments indicated above.

Dear Authors,
This a great work in zeolites world. I have a couple thoughts to share.
First, do you think the discrepancy of compressibility betweeen ZK-5, RHO, and NaX is simply
due to the larger beta-cage, that is 12-ring vs. 8-ring? Also, it's well accepted that the zeolite pores
do possess certain flexibility, it would be nice to reference some simulation or other experimental
data for comparison.
Thanks.

This paper addresses a sparsely investigated, yet very interesting, area of research pertaining

whereby compression of the structural framework is allowed without influencing the rigidity

behavior will be absent in the case of non-body-centered aluminosilicate zeolites. The
manuscript is well-articulated, the discussion and conclusions being well supported by the
experimental data. Perhaps it will be useful for the reader to know what is the experimental
error in the determination of the unit cell parameters and cell volumes with the pressure.
based upon the foregoing, I recommend the publication of this manuscript after the authors
address the comments indicated above.
We thank the reviewer for their positive comments and their recommendation. To address their
comment regarding the errors in unit cell parameters and cell volumes we have edited the
manuscript as follows:
In the Materials and Methods section we have included the following sentences:
“The error in the calculated unit cell parameters were determined in the TOPAS Academic
software. It was seen that the errors were consistently <0.004 Å and had negligible influence on
the trends observed. Tables containing the full list of calculated errors for the unit cell
parameters and cell volumes are contained in the Supplementary Information (SI).”
As mentioned, we have thus updated the supplementary information (SI) to include tables of
the error of the unit cell parameters and volumes calculated. For completion, we have also
made mention of the experimental error in the pressure determination, and included these
errors in the SI as well. The added sentence in the Materials and Methods section is as follows:
“The experimental error in pressure was estimated at 0.1 GPa in the 0.0-3.0 GPa region of the
compression cycle. Above 3.0 GPa, and throughout the entirety of the decompression cycle the
error was estimated at 0.4 GPa.”

Dear Authors,
This a great work in zeolites world. I have a couple thoughts to share.
First, do you think the discrepancy of compressibility betweeen ZK-5, RHO, and NaX is simply
due to the larger beta-cage, that is 12-ring vs. 8-ring?
We thank the reviewer for their compliments and the issues they raise. The difference in
compressibility is due to the different aperture and cavity sizes present in zeolites Na-X, ZK-5
and RHO. Due the larger cavity in zeolite Na-X there is more space available for the 18C6. In
order to clarify this point that we were trying to make we have included the following sentence
to the Discussion section:
“This is believed to be due to the fact that zeolite Na-X has a larger aperture (12-ring) and
cavity size compared to zeolites RHO and ZK-5, meaning there is more available space for the
18C6 molecule. Furthermore, this suggests that in the assembly of zeolite Na-X the 18C6
express weak interactions with the framework, indicative of a space-filling species.”
Also, it's well accepted that the zeolite pores do possess certain flexibility, it would be nice to
reference some simulation or other experimental data for comparison.
We thank the reviewer for noting this. Indeed, we have included multiple references regarding
zeolite framework flexibility, and a mixture of simulated and experimental work. For example:
We have compared how extra-framework content influences compression [11, 13, 25-28, 49,
50], how the data compares to what has been seen previously for the same zeolites [15-17, 26,
52], how the flexibility windows of the zeolites compare to another zeolite (EMC-2) made with
18-crown-6 ether [33]. In Table 2, we have also made numerous citations to experimental and
simulated work on cubic zeolites.
To improve the amount of referencing and comparison in the manuscript we have made the
following changes:
1) In the Zeolite Na-X section, we have added the following sentence: “The linear unit cell
compression is comparable to the results seen by Colligan et al. [26] for other FAU-type
zeolites of varying Si/Al ratio in different pressure-transmitting media.”
2) We have included an additional reference ([34] in the manuscript), referring to a
previous high pressure study on zeolite EMC-2.. This reference has been added to the
Introduction, Zeolite Na-X and Zeolite ZK-5 sections, in order to further compare the
flexibility and compression behaviour with the occlusion of 18C6. In the zeolite Na-X
section a sentence has been adjusted to state as follows: “This mirrors the predictions of
Fletcher et al. [33] from geometric simulations and our previous high pressure study of
the EMT framework containing the 18C6 molecule [34].”
3) In the Discussions section we have included some further discussion comparing the
flexibility and phase transitions seen in ANA-type zeolites and zeolites RHO and ZK-5.
The nature of all the symmetry transitions are summarised in table 2. The included
discussion is as follows: “This is even true when the ambient space group differs
between zeolites of the same framework type, as is the case for the ANA-type zeolites
[20-23]. For ANA-type zeolites the lower symmetry form is consistently triclinic, and
according to geometric simulations by Wells et al. [24] it is the edge of the flexibility
window which controls these pressure-induced symmetry changes. However, herein for
the higher symmetry/low pressure forms of zeolites RHO and ZK-5 we see the pressure-
induced symmetry change before the window edge is reached.”
