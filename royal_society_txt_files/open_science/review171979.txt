In this paper, through blending PVDF with a triblock copolymer additive, the authors fabricated
a membrane with hydrophilic and oleophobic wettability. The as-prepared membrane owns self-
cleaning property and is able to achieve the separation of oil/water emulsions with high
efficiency. Moreover, the material can also be applied in real oily wastewater treatment. The
whole work is relatively complete. Thus, I think the work should be published in this journal
after minor revisions, the suggestions are listed below:
1. Some of the characters could not be disaplyed in the article, such as °C. The author should
corrected them in the revised manuscript carefully.
2. There was no error bar in some figures including Figure 1a and 1b, Figure 2a and Figure 6, the
authors should retested and add the error bars in the revised manuscript.

This manuscript reports a prepared hollow fiber membranes for efficient oil/water separation.
The authors have studied the filtration conditions, including the cross flow rate, feed temperature
and trans-membrane pressures, under the optimized conditions. The membranes show a good
oil/water separation performance. Especially, different types of oily samples with a wide range
of oil concentrations were tested, all of them could tolerate to the filtration and very low
permeate concentration (below 5 mg·L-1 of TOC) were obtained. In general the work is carried
3
out carefully and presented well. The manuscript is recommended to be accepted with minor
revisions.
There are some problems and errors need to be corrected.
1. In first sentence of the abstract, the author mentioned that “the triblock copolymer additive AP
has a A+B+C structure…”, but in the latter of the paper, I did not find the chemical structure of it.
I found that the polymer AP was not first reported in this paper, but was already reported in the
previous paper (reference 20). And, this work mainly focused on the engineering application of
the membrane in the oil/water separation. I suggest the author revise this sentence, because it
seems that the first sentence is too long and no necessary in the abstract part.
2. In section 4.5, during the continuous test, the author described that the experiments were
carried out by using the prepared palm oil wastewater, although the separation results were
summarized in the figures, but there was no description of the wastewater sample, eg. oil
concentration or TOC/COD values of the palm oil wastewater.
3. In section 4.1, paragraph 2, line 7, some gramma errors, “…did gradually decreased…” should
be revised.
4. In section 4.2, paragraph 4, line 8, typo error “cress-flow” must be corrected, and in the whole
draft, “cross flow” and “cross-flow” both appear, it is suggested to be unified.

Appendix A
Response to Referees
Thank you so much for the comments on the article (RSOS-171979).
Response to Reviewer 1:
1. According to the referee’s suggestion, all the centigrade symbols have been carefully check
and revised, all the revisions have been highlighted.
2. In the revised edition, the error bars have been added into the figures 1a, 1b, and figure
6; the referee also suggested to add error bar for figure 2a, but figure 2 is the SEM photos,
we think there may be some mistake. All the revised figures have been inserted in the
articles and listed in the separate Figure files.
Response to Reviewer 2:
1. The first sentence of the abstract part has been reduced carefully, and the revisions have
been highlighted.
2. Thanks for the referee’s careful remind, although the oil concentration of the wastewater
were listed in the supplementary material, it was not mentioned in the original manuscript.
The feed concentration is around 330 mg/L in terms of TOC. We have added the data into
the article, and was highlighted.
3. The error has been corrected and highlighted.
4. It has been unified as “cross-flow” through the whole manuscript, and the revisions have
been highlighted.
Appendix B
Response to Editors
(RSOS-171979.R1)
1. As for your concerns “how the error bars were determined?”
In the previous revised edition, the error bars were added in the figures 1a, 1b and figure
6. In the newly revised edition, error bars were also added in figures 1c and 1d.
Technically, the error data were added in the ORIGIN software.
Theoretically, the error data were the standard deviations (SD,s) calculated by the data
collected from repeated tests, according to the following formula:
<U+0001D45B>
1
s = v <U+2211>(<U+0001D465><U+0001D456> - <U+0001D707>)2
<U+0001D45B>
<U+0001D456>=1
where, n is the number of data recorded;
the average value (µ) of all the recorded data (xi) can be calculated, and the average
value was the reported value in the paper, this has been already explained in the manuscript,
section 3. Materials and methods.
In the original edition, we didn’t add the error bars into the figures, although we had
already calculated. Thank you for your reminding, we have added them in the revised edition.
And we have explained some in the Materials and Methods parts, the revision has been
highlighted in the manuscript.
For example, in section 3.3.1. Surface wetting properties, after the last sentence “Each
sample was measured for 10 times at different locations on the surface and the average value
of these measurements was reported as the representative value in this paper”, was added
“The corresponding errors (standard derivations) were also calculated and presented.”
No error bar was added for the other figures including 3, 4 and 8, because we only want
to show the variation trend of the water flux vs. time or temperature in the graphs.
And, we didn’t explain very detail in the revised manuscript how the SD were calculated
(such as the formula), because normally it is a common sense for the experts.
In addition, you can find the corresponding data for each figure in the Supplementary
Material.
2. After carefully check, we find the lack of description on how the water permeability
and the pore size were tested, so, after section 3.3.1, “Water permeability and pore size
measurement” was added as newly section 3.3.2. The revision was also highlighted in the
revised edition.
3. A new reference [34] was added to refer to the test of the maximum pore size of the
membrane, so the number of the other references were also corrected.
4. Some grammar error and other mistakes were also revised and highlighted in the
manuscript. For example, in section 2. Introduction part, line 14, “has” was revised to “have”.
5. All the figures were saved as jpg file and put in a separate word file “Figures”. And all
the data for the figures were listed in the supplementary material. If necessary, the ORIGIN
files can be afforded.
Thank you so much for your kind concern.
