Review of RSOS-180448, Data availability, reusability, and analytic reproducibility: Evaluating
the impact of a mandatory open data policy at the journal Cognition
Summary: In this article, the authors are interested in determining to what extent a mandatory
open data policy at a specific journal, Cognition, impacts whether the data are available, whether
they’re curated in a way that makes them useable, and whether the primary results of studies
reported in the journal are reproducible. They adopted one-group interrupted time-series design
to examine these things both before and after the new open data policy was adopted in March
2015.
Overall, this is an interesting and important effort, one that is relevant to the readership of Royal
Society Open Science. This clearly was a Herculean effort given the large number of empirical
articles assessed, the number of coders and analysis pilots/co-pilots necessary to wrangle the
data and reproduce analyses, and the careful attention the authors paid to transparency in this
endeavor. These positive aspects of the work are offset a bit by a methodological limitation,
namely the absence of a comparison journal similar to Cognition but without introduction of an
open data policy, and questions about coding reliability. Ultimately, however, I believe the paper
could make a useful contribution to the literature despite these issues.
Below I provide specific questions and comments about this manuscript; I hope they are helpful
to the editor and authors. Please note that I have written this review in two phases. In the first
phase, I read only the introduction and method sections so that my evaluation of the premise of
the work and its methodological rigor would be unaffected by the pattern of results and the
authors’ interpretation therein.
Phase 1: Introduction and Method (without reading Abstract, Results, or Discussion)
1. The introduction nicely frames the relevant theoretical issues. By the end, the reader
understands that the data on which empirical studies are based are rarely made publicly
accessible and, even when the data are made publicly accessible, they’re often curated in a way
that makes them essentially useless to those who may wish to reproduce reported results.
2. Study 1 Method:
a. The authors clearly acknowledge potential limitations, including the notion that the open data
policy coincided with introduction of a new editor-in-chief (EIC) at Cognition, and the notion that
announcement of the new EIC may have led to anticipatory changes in data sharing prior to the
March 1, 2015 start date of the open data policy.
b. To what extent does an imbalance in available articles from before (n = 417) to after (n = 174)
instituting the open data policy affect conclusions that can be drawn? The smaller of the two
numbers is still rather large, thus perhaps it doesn’t.
c. Coders demonstrated 90% agreement with a gold standard coding of 5 articles prior to coding
3
the articles to be included in the analyses for this paper. Percent agreement doesn’t, of course,
take into account agreement by chance. The authors might consider using a different method of
assessing interrater reliability that takes into account chance agreement.
d. With a one-group interrupted time-series design, changes in instrumentation (in this case,
coders) represent a threat to internal validity. Can the authors please clarify the procedures they
used to prevent or evaluate coder drift? Among the batch of 20 articles received by coders each
time, were there roughly even numbers of articles from the pre- and post- policy periods?
e. It would strengthen the study’s internal validity if the authors had a comparison journal of
some kind, one that has similar features to Cognition but did not adopt an open data policy on
March 1, 2015.
3. Study 2 Method:
a. The authors describe a reasonable set of variables and procedures to evaluate analytic
reproducibility of 35 articles for which the data were available. It’s possible I missed it, but I
didn’t see reported whether the articles in question were published before or after the
introduction of the open data policy at Cognition. A reader might reasonably wonder whether
analytic reproducibility was higher after.
b. Edited after reading results and discussion sections: A reader may wonder whether the 35
articles selected for evaluation of analytic reproducibility are representative of the larger group of
articles from which they were selected (35+61 = 96); a selection bias could influence outcome
estimates. For example, if the 35 articles selected for evaluation in Study 2 are more
“straightforward” than the remaining 61, estimates of reproducibility may be inflated.
Phase 2: Results, Discussion, and Abstract
Results
4. The reporting of results in both studies is both complete and clear.
5. I love the figures.
6. One question is whether the 50-day binning is necessary in Figure 1, Figure C1, and Figure D1
for “ease of presentation”. I found myself wanting to see the actual individual-article
observations.
7. Figure 3 seems superfluous.
Discussion
8. I love this analogy: “Conducting an analytic reproducibility check without an analysis script is
rather like assembling flat pack furniture without an instruction booklet: one is given some
materials (categorised and labelled with varying degrees of helpfulness), and a diagram of the
final product, but is missing the step-by-step instructions required to convert one into the other.”
9. The discussion section provides a good summary of the work and makes reasonable
conclusions based on the results. It also addresses (and dispels) some alternative explanations for
the results, and considers interesting implications of the findings.
Abstract
10. The abstract provides a reasonable summary of the work.
Thank you for the opportunity to review this work. I am signing this review for the sake of
transparency.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This is an interesting, and costly effort, but it is not as easy to read or process as it should.
I struggled and did not read it as closely as it would like given how costly it was to parse the
information. If I complain about something that you already address, assume you are not
addressing it in an easy enough to understand way.
My most important comment is that in its present form the paper is alarmist. To a casual reader
(e.g., a journalist, or the 90% of readers that will just skim it), it tells that a large share of scientific
findings are not reproducible. But the evidence is much weaker than that, it is merely that a large
share of scientific papers contain at least one secondary results that appear to have an error.
Specific comments.
1) Abstract
My guess, partially because of base rates, partially because the paper is hard to read, is that few
people will get through the paper. My forecast is that upon publication readers will get through
the abstract and just use it as a justification to argue there is a reproducibility crisis, saying things
like "37% of articles are not reproducible even with author assistance" (Hardwicke et al).
There is a distinction between inconsequential errors that can be introduced at copy-editing say,
or the result of a minor act of sloppiness, and errors in execution of research that truly invalidate
a paper.
The abstract, and the figures in the papers, what readers will consult without reading the rest,
should be unambiguous. The authors should actively revise their paper keeping in mind the
sensationalist journalist or careless readers who will put words in their mouths.
The authors do have this line in the abstract "Importantly, original conclusions did not appear to
be seriously impacted." But it does not sufficiently, for my taste, downplay the alarmist message
of the previous line. Something like this seems more accurate a summary "While none of the
5
articles had errors that seriously impact the conclusions, we were unable to account for
inconsequential differences in results, even with authors assistance, in 37% of articles"
That’s less punchy a claim, but I think a more accurate one.
2) Too many procedural details
The paper feels too detailed in things that are not that key, e.g., exactly how the studies were
selected, the co-piloting rules, etc. Most readers won't worry about those things. You can provide
general reassurances in the text that allows readers to evaluate if the study selection was fair and
unbiased, and delegate the details of execution to the supplement. e.g., Study 1 Sampling frame
could be shorten to a single line of text
3) Study 1 is needed, but not super important.
The idea that when a journal requires something, it happens more often, is not that interesting, I
do think the authors should report Study 1, but there is no need to get into the weeds, discuss
possible confounding factors, etc. Nobody really doubts that requiring something makes it more
prevalent, and the exact point estimate is probably context specific and not particularly
consequential (e.g., who the editor was). We don't want to read quotes from the Cognition
editorial, etc etc. I would say 1-2 pages for Study 1 are more than enough. We just want to know
"so did more people do it? Yes, about 30-50% increase" ok. Done. So I would suggest the authors
get more promptly to Study 2, the one that's much more interesting and policy relevant. You can
say, "we deployed various analytical approaches and our estimates of the policy ranged from x%
to y%, see Supplement X for details. Readers will be happier, and less likely to put the article
down before they get to more valuable Study 2.
Similarly, the discussion in page 15-18 would make more sense in a setting where we did not
obviously expect requiring something to make it more prevalent, or where a point estimate was
intrinsically important. I would drop almost if not all of it, though obviously it is the authors' call.
Nobody doubts some causal effect, nothing really hinges on it being 17% vs 35% , say.
4) Say more about IPR
The "IPR" is a very important construct, there are many ways to construct it, and reading the
paper I don't get a very good sense of how it was done, how subjective it was, etc. I would
expand this to a full page, and tabulate more details.
5) Results for Study 2 are hard to parse
I had a really hard time processing the results from Study 2. In part because I am not used to
having magnitude be represented by the size of an X, perhaps an actual number will be better.
Also, one does not get a sense of how important the errors were, and to what extent they are
independent from one another. If the original authors dropped one observation they shouldn't
have, they will have the wrong mean, confidence interval, p-value, effect size, and fill the tables
for Study 2 with red crosses. Maybe worth counting actions that cause errors rather than
consequences of such actions (if this is reasonably easy to do), and simply tabulate how many
independent origin of errors are present in each paper. Then maybe say something about those
origins and how they can be avoided
6) Figure 3 provides no information beyond reporting three %s. It feels too "People magazine" to
me. It almost guarantees an alarmist unjustified read of the evidence presented in this paper. It
almost guarantees a journalist will claim this paper found that 1/3 studies failed to be
reproduced (which is technically true, but readers will assume that what failed to be reproduced
is something that mattered rather than a detail that may be irrelevant).
7) Say more about what it meant to require author assistance, for instance, did the authors explain
6
something you should have known? Or did they indicate something that is critical and nobody
could possibly figure out without contacting them?
8) The writing is tedious also in terms of reporting everything in a very formulaic way, for
instance, we don't need to convert to % and report a confidence interval every single time a
frequency is reported. We should be able to say simply "We encountered errors in 24 of the 35
statements", without then converting that to a % and putting the 95% confidence interval. Also,
you can probably just say once all confidence interval are 95%, and not print "95%" 53 times in the
paper.
The algorithmic way of reporting results makes it hard for humans to get through the results,
consider for example this paragraph: "
519 The errors broken down by outcome type are displayed in Figure 4. Of the major
520 errors, 17 (27%, 95% CI [16, 39]) were standard deviations or standard errors, 17 (27%, 95%
521 p-values, 10 (16%, 95% CI [5, 28]) were test statistics, such as t and F
522 values, 8 (12%, 95% CI [2, 25]) were effect sizes such as Cohen’s d or Pearson’s r values, 4
523 (6%, 95% CI [0, 19]) were means or medians, 4 (6%, 95% CI [0, 19]) were degrees of freedom,
524 1 (2%, 95% CI [0, 14]) was a count or proportion, 1 (2%, 95% CI [0, 14]) was a confidence
525 interval, and 2 (3%, 95% CI [0, 16]) were other miscellaneous values."
You could also do a bar chart, but if you keep it in text, I would just report the frequencies.
9) The 5-6 pages of discussion at the end are a lot. A good figure is worth 1000 discussion words. I
personally think papers should be mostly about establishing facts; this is not an editorial.
Moreover, much of the discussion qualifies factual matters, such as the type of errors you
uncovered and how consequential they were. That type of analysis belongs in the meat of the
paper, belongs in the tables and figures. One should avoid presenting factual information that is
possibly misleading, and then address the possibly misleading facts in the discussion. The tables
and figures themselves should be created in ways that the most natural interpretation of the facts
there presented is correct. In this paper, the most natural interpretation of the summary stats and
figures is alarmist ("Jesus, it's all irreproducible") and then the discussion calms you down a bit
('well, but not the stuff that matters').
10) Appendix E contains important information. The authors can probably create a table that
summarizes it.

Editor's comments (Chris Chambers):
Comments to the Author:
Three reviewers have now assessed the manuscript. All judge the project to be of importance,
however some substantial revisions are necessary to ensure accuracy and clarity. Reviewer 1 is
overall positive and asks for a number of clarifications mainly to the methodological procedures.
Reviewer 2 is more critical, highlighting two chief concerns: that the main message of the paper is
obscured in amongst the reporting of detail (which the reviewer criticizes as repetitive and
"tedious" in places), and that the framing is overly alarmist.
As editor I am always reluctant to recommend that authors remove key methodological details
from a paper, and I am happy to entertain a rebuttal on these issues - but I do think Reviewer 2
makes a number of astute points. There is risk that readers will lose their way as they navigate
the paper. I would therefore encourage the authors to consider ways of streamlining the key
messages without reducing information that is necessary to evaluate quality or replicability. The
reviewer recommends the use of supplementary information, especially for Study 1. An
alternative may be clear interim summaries and highlighting of important points.
Reviewer 2's main concern is with the risk of an alarmist intepretation of the findings, and this
will need to be thoroughly addressed in a revision.
Reviewers 1 and 2 reach opposite conclusions about the validity of the Discussion, with Reviewer
1 praising the completeness of the summary and coverage of alternative explanations, while
Reviewer 2 favours a tighter presentation and suggests that steps to prevent alarmist
interpretations of the results should come sooner. My steer here is that the Discussion is generally
acceptable in length but I agree with Reviewer 2 that it would better to head off some of the
interpretative concerns earlier in the manuscript (perhaps reiterating them in the Discussion, but
in slightly streamlined form).
I am including Reviewer 3's assessment for completeness; however the review is perfunctory and
of limited use, therefore the authors need not respond to these comments.

Review of RSOS-180448, Data availability, reusability, and analytic reproducibility: Evaluating
the impact of a mandatory open data policy at the journal Cognition
Summary: In this article, the authors are interested in determining to what extent a mandatory
open data policy at a specific journal, Cognition, impacts whether the data are available, whether
they’re curated in a way that makes them useable, and whether the primary results of studies
reported in the journal are reproducible. They adopted one-group interrupted time-series design
to examine these things both before and after the new open data policy was adopted in March
2015.
Overall, this is an interesting and important effort, one that is relevant to the readership of Royal
Society Open Science. This clearly was a Herculean effort given the large number of empirical
articles assessed, the number of coders and analysis pilots/co-pilots necessary to wrangle the
data and reproduce analyses, and the careful attention the authors paid to transparency in this
endeavor. These positive aspects of the work are offset a bit by a methodological limitation,
namely the absence of a comparison journal similar to Cognition but without introduction of an
open data policy, and questions about coding reliability. Ultimately, however, I believe the paper
could make a useful contribution to the literature despite these issues.
Below I provide specific questions and comments about this manuscript; I hope they are helpful
to the editor and authors. Please note that I have written this review in two phases. In the first
phase, I read only the introduction and method sections so that my evaluation of the premise of
the work and its methodological rigor would be unaffected by the pattern of results and the
authors’ interpretation therein.
Phase 1: Introduction and Method (without reading Abstract, Results, or Discussion)
1. The introduction nicely frames the relevant theoretical issues. By the end, the reader
understands that the data on which empirical studies are based are rarely made publicly
accessible and, even when the data are made publicly accessible, they’re often curated in a way
that makes them essentially useless to those who may wish to reproduce reported results.
2. Study 1 Method:
a. The authors clearly acknowledge potential limitations, including the notion that the open data
policy coincided with introduction of a new editor-in-chief (EIC) at Cognition, and the notion that
announcement of the new EIC may have led to anticipatory changes in data sharing prior to the
March 1, 2015 start date of the open data policy.
b. To what extent does an imbalance in available articles from before (n = 417) to after (n = 174)
instituting the open data policy affect conclusions that can be drawn? The smaller of the two
numbers is still rather large, thus perhaps it doesn’t.
c. Coders demonstrated 90% agreement with a gold standard coding of 5 articles prior to coding
the articles to be included in the analyses for this paper. Percent agreement doesn’t, of course,
take into account agreement by chance. The authors might consider using a different method of
assessing interrater reliability that takes into account chance agreement.
d. With a one-group interrupted time-series design, changes in instrumentation (in this case,
coders) represent a threat to internal validity. Can the authors please clarify the procedures they
used to prevent or evaluate coder drift? Among the batch of 20 articles received by coders each
time, were there roughly even numbers of articles from the pre- and post- policy periods?
11
e. It would strengthen the study’s internal validity if the authors had a comparison journal of
some kind, one that has similar features to Cognition but did not adopt an open data policy on
March 1, 2015.
3. Study 2 Method:
a. The authors describe a reasonable set of variables and procedures to evaluate analytic

“straightforward” than the remaining 61, estimates of reproducibility may be inflated.
Phase 2: Results, Discussion, and Abstract
Results
4. The reporting of results in both studies is both complete and clear.
5. I love the figures.
6. One question is whether the 50-day binning is necessary in Figure 1, Figure C1, and Figure D1
for “ease of presentation”. I found myself wanting to see the actual individual-article
observations.
7. Figure 3 seems superfluous.
Discussion
8. I love this analogy: “Conducting an analytic reproducibility check without an analysis script is
rather like assembling flat pack furniture without an instruction booklet: one is given some
materials (categorised and labelled with varying degrees of helpfulness), and a diagram of the
final product, but is missing the step-by-step instructions required to convert one into the other.”
9. The discussion section provides a good summary of the work and makes reasonable
conclusions based on the results. It also addresses (and dispels) some alternative explanations for
the results, and considers interesting implications of the findings.
Abstract
10. The abstract provides a reasonable summary of the work.

do think the authors should report Study 1, but there is no need to get into the weeds, discuss
possible confounding factors, etc. Nobody really doubts that requiring something makes it more
prevalent, and the exact point estimate is probably context specific and not particularly
consequential (e.g., who the editor was). We don't want to read quotes from the Cognition
editorial, etc etc. I would say 1-2 pages for Study 1 are more than enough. We just want to know
"so did more people do it? Yes, about 30-50% increase" ok. Done. So I would suggest the authors
get more promptly to Study 2, the one that's much more interesting and policy relevant. You can
say, "we deployed various analytical approaches and our estimates of the policy ranged from x%
to y%, see Supplement X for details. Readers will be happier, and less likely to put the article
down before they get to more valuable Study 2.
Similarly, the discussion in page 15-18 would make more sense in a setting where we did not
obviously expect requiring something to make it more prevalent, or where a point estimate was
intrinsically important. I would drop almost if not all of it, though obviously it is the authors' call.
Nobody doubts some causal effect, nothing really hinges on it being 17% vs 35% , say.
13
4) Say more about IPR
The "IPR" is a very important construct, there are many ways to construct it, and reading the
paper I don't get a very good sense of how it was done, how subjective it was, etc. I would
expand this to a full page, and tabulate more details.
5) Results for Study 2 are hard to parse
I had a really hard time processing the results from Study 2. In part because I am not used to
having magnitude be represented by the size of an X, perhaps an actual number will be better.
Also, one does not get a sense of how important the errors were, and to what extent they are
independent from one another. If the original authors dropped one observation they shouldn't
have, they will have the wrong mean, confidence interval, p-value, effect size, and fill the tables
for Study 2 with red crosses. Maybe worth counting actions that cause errors rather than
consequences of such actions (if this is reasonably easy to do), and simply tabulate how many
independent origin of errors are present in each paper. Then maybe say something about those
origins and how they can be avoided
6) Figure 3 provides no information beyond reporting three %s. It feels too "People magazine" to
me. It almost guarantees an alarmist unjustified read of the evidence presented in this paper. It
almost guarantees a journalist will claim this paper found that 1/3 studies failed to be
reproduced (which is technically true, but readers will assume that what failed to be reproduced
is something that mattered rather than a detail that may be irrelevant).
7) Say more about what it meant to require author assistance, for instance, did the authors explain
something you should have known? Or did they indicate something that is critical and nobody
could possibly figure out without contacting them?
8) The writing is tedious also in terms of reporting everything in a very formulaic way, for
instance, we don't need to convert to % and report a confidence interval every single time a
frequency is reported. We should be able to say simply "We encountered errors in 24 of the 35
statements", without then converting that to a % and putting the 95% confidence interval. Also,
you can probably just say once all confidence interval are 95%, and not print "95%" 53 times in the
paper.
The algorithmic way of reporting results makes it hard for humans to get through the results,
consider for example this paragraph: "
519 The errors broken down by outcome type are displayed in Figure 4. Of the major
520 errors, 17 (27%, 95% CI [16, 39]) were standard deviations or standard errors, 17 (27%, 95%
521 p-values, 10 (16%, 95% CI [5, 28]) were test statistics, such as t and F
522 values, 8 (12%, 95% CI [2, 25]) were effect sizes such as Cohen’s d or Pearson’s r values, 4
523 (6%, 95% CI [0, 19]) were means or medians, 4 (6%, 95% CI [0, 19]) were degrees of freedom,
524 1 (2%, 95% CI [0, 14]) was a count or proportion, 1 (2%, 95% CI [0, 14]) was a confidence
525 interval, and 2 (3%, 95% CI [0, 16]) were other miscellaneous values."
You could also do a bar chart, but if you keep it in text, I would just report the frequencies.
9) The 5-6 pages of discussion at the end are a lot. A good figure is worth 1000 discussion words. I
personally think papers should be mostly about establishing facts; this is not an editorial.
Moreover, much of the discussion qualifies factual matters, such as the type of errors you
uncovered and how consequential they were. That type of analysis belongs in the meat of the
paper, belongs in the tables and figures. One should avoid presenting factual information that is
possibly misleading, and then address the possibly misleading facts in the discussion. The tables
and figures themselves should be created in ways that the most natural interpretation of the facts
14
there presented is correct. In this paper, the most natural interpretation of the summary stats and
figures is alarmist ("Jesus, it's all irreproducible") and then the discussion calms you down a bit
('well, but not the stuff that matters').
10) Appendix E contains important information. The authors can probably create a table that
summarizes it.

I continue to think this paper is well-conceived and will make a nice contribution to the literature.
Moreover, the authors have revised this paper to my satisfaction, at least for the most part. A
holdover issue for me is about coder drift. The response letter notes that random assignment of
articles to coders assuages concerns about systematic errors abetting the conclusion that the
policy led to more data available statements and in principle reusable data. I agree that this is
true to the extent that each batch of 20 of the randomly-assigned articles ended up containing
roughly even numbers of pre and post policy articles for all coders.In that case, drift would affect
pre and post periods to the same degree. A statement addressing this in the manuscript would be
welcome.
A few minor points about things I did not catch first time around (sorry):
1. Figure 1 shows nonlinear prediction/estimate lines but the interrupted time series analysis
does not appear to have modeled anything but linear effects. The curved lines are fine in
principle but it is probably worth noting in the figure caption that the depiction deviates from the
analysis it parallels. (Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the logistic regression models;
in that case, consider clarifying in text how nonlinearities were possible.)
2. I don't believe the paper indicates whether Study One coders were blind to hypotheses. As
such, a reader may wonder whether DAS and IPR rates could be affected by coder expectancies.
This bears noting in the method section (lines 166-171). If coders were not blind, this also bears
comment in the "threats to validity" section of the discussion (lines 279-296).
3. Line 365: "reproducible" should be "reproducibility"
4. Line 688: Should "underestimate" be "overestimate"? Given the context of the paragraph, I
believe so but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the referent. In that case, it would be good to clarify
wording.
Thank you for the opportunity to review this interesting work. I'm signing this review for the
sake of transparency.

Overall the paper got better in the directions proposed by the review team. In most instances
when the authors deviated from what was suggested they provide a justification, the editor can
adjudicate those disagreements which are largely stylistic. Lots of great improvements i should
say.
A few additional comments
1) I think the abstract could use further edits to avoid misunderstandings.
Maybe the abstract could read something like: "In a sample of 35 articles we attempted to
reproduce a total of XXX reported statistical results (means, d.f., t-tests, etc). For 11 articles we
successfully reproduced all XXX results we attempted to reproduce, for another 11 we required
some assistance to do so for at least one, and for the remaining 13 articles there was at least one
reported result we were unable to reproduce even with assistance. None of the discrepancies
reverse the studies' conclusions."
So making it clear what is being compared, how many are being compared, and that if one is not
reproduced, the entire paper counts as non-reproduced.
1.1) In the statement "there were no clear indications that original conclusions were seriously
impacted" has two qualifiers "clear" and "serious". Are they necessary, don't you have all the
information needed to say something more concrete like "no conclusions were affected". That's an
honest question, if you don't have the goods, i understand the need for hedged language. But i
would have thought that you did have the goods.
1.2) I would prefer it if the abstract also included examples of the discrepancy, so maybe the
abstract could follow: "For example, one article did a heteroskedasticity correction which was not
reported and another incompletely specified a regression model" (ideally for the latter the authors
will explain just how it is that it was incompletely specific, missing a covariate?)
I am using actual examples reported in the paper page 31, lines 550-566.
When i hear non-reproducible what i have in mind is someone reports b=2.99, p=.001, but when
you run the code, you get b=.07, p=.37, i am trying to make sure readers don't come up with the
wrong impression i do.
2) i would turn the %s reported in page 31 into a figure, so that readers quickly have access to
information on the types of discrepancies we are talking about. I find interesting that there were 8
cases of incomplete or corrupt data files.
3) perhaps the authors could also quantify the magnitude of the discrepancies, something like
17
"the median deviation between reported and reproduced results, for results that were not fully
reproducible, was xx%")

Summary: In this article, the We thank the reviewer for their feedback – we
authors are interested in will address the comments about a control
determining to what extent a journal and coder reliability below.
mandatory open data policy at a
specific journal, Cognition,
impacts whether the data are
available, whether they’re
curated in a way that makes them
useable, and whether the primary
results of studies reported in the
journal are reproducible. They
adopted one-group interrupted
1 time-series design to examine
these things both before and after
the new open data policy was
adopted in March 2015.
Overall, this is an interesting and
important effort, one that is
relevant to the readership of
Royal Society Open Science.
This clearly was a Herculean
effort given the large number of
empirical articles assessed, the
number of coders and analysis
pilots/co-pilots necessary to
wrangle the data and reproduce
analyses, and the careful
attention the authors paid to
transparency in this endeavor.
These positive aspects of the
work are offset a bit by a
methodological limitation,
namely the absence of a
comparison journal similar to
Cognition but without
introduction of an open data
policy, and questions about
coding reliability. Ultimately,
however, I believe the paper
could make a useful contribution
to the literature despite these
issues.
Below I provide specific
questions and comments about
this manuscript; I hope they are
helpful to the editor and authors.
Please note that I have written
this review in two phases. In the
first phase, I read only the
introduction and method sections
so that my evaluation of the
premise of the work and its
methodological rigor would be
unaffected by the pattern of
results and the authors’
interpretation therein.
Phase 1: Introduction and N/A
Method (without reading
Abstract, Results, or Discussion)
1
1. The introduction nicely
frames the relevant theoretical
issues. By the end, the reader
understands that the data on
which empirical studies are based
are rarely made publicly
accessible and, even when the
data are made publicly
accessible, they’re often curated
in a way that makes them
essentially useless to those who
may wish to reproduce reported
results.
2. Study 1 Method:
a. The authors clearly
acknowledge potential
limitations, including the notion
that the open data policy
coincided with introduction of a
new editor-in-chief (EIC) at
Cognition, and the notion that
announcement of the new EIC
may have led to anticipatory
changes in data sharing prior to
the March 1, 2015 start date of
the open data policy.
b. To what extent does an We believe there are a sufficient number of
imbalance in available articles articles in both the pre- and post- policy
from before (n = 417) to after (n periods: the confidence intervals reflect
reasonable certainty in the point estimates. An

numbers is still rather large, thus group. Extending data collection too long after
perhaps it doesn’t. policy introduction would dilute the extent to
which we can infer the observed trend is
caused by the policy, rather than other events
that we are unaware of or cannot control.
c. Coders demonstrated 90% We recognize the limitations of inter-rater

coding the articles to be included https://bit.ly/2I8mYTz). Firstly, the data

relatively straightforward and generally leaves

course, take into account (except perhaps for the determination of data
agreement by chance. The ‘understandability’). Secondly, options such
authors might consider using a as “other” and “unclear” were provided to
different method of assessing limit any guess-work. Thirdly, inter-rater
agreement exceeded 90% for the training
interrater reliability that takes articles for all coders. Thus, any correction for
into account chance agreement. guesswork is unlikely to serious diminish our
confidence in coder reliability.
Note that only training articles were double-
coded. The actual data were single coded. We
believe this is reasonable given the
straightforwardness of data extraction (above).
d. With a one-group Thank you for flagging this issue. Although
interrupted time-series design, drift might introduce some errors, we are not
changes in instrumentation (in concerned about systematic errors from drift
that would bias our conclusions because all

authors please clarify the
procedures they used to prevent

or evaluate coder drift? Among
the batch of 20 articles received
by coders each time, were there
roughly even numbers of articles

March 1, 2015.
We describe potential threats to validity and
how a single-group interrupted time-series
design can address them in the Study One
discussion (pages 16-17). For example, it
could be that the observed trend is influenced
by something intrinsic changing about the
population of authors submitting to Cognition
(a ‘maturation’ threat). However, this would
not explain the abrupt change at the point of
intervention.
Similarly, the observed trend could be due to
some external event, such as an influential
academic society endorsing data sharing.
However, again, a candidate event would have
to be time-locked to the point of intervention
to explain the abrupt change. We are not
aware of such an event, although it remains
possible that one occurred.
The addition of a control journal could help to
rule this out more definitively. However, some
relevant data can be acquired from the
Kidwell et al. study
(https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002456)
which measured data availability at several
control (psychology) journals up to May 2015.
As the Cognition data policy was introduced
in March 2015, there is some overlap here of
the critical post-policy period. No discernable
increase in data availability was observed in
the control journals. This observation
reinforces the conclusion that it was the
introduction of Cognition’s open data policy
rather than some external event that drove the
observed changes.

likely to introduce selection bias) at length in

starting “It is important to note that Study

selection bias undermines our conclusions, but
it does places an important limitation on the
generalizability of our findings – which we
acknowledge in the manuscript. Ideally, future
studies should also seek to examine a broader
range of analyses, including complex
analyses.

that original conclusions were affected.
Some other caveats given in the text are
below:
After reporting the reproducibility findings in
2 the abstract, we were sure to immediately add
the caveat that “Importantly, original
conclusions did not appear to be seriously
impacted”. We have now combined the caveat
with the result into the same sentence, so it is
less likely a reader would miss it: “In 13
(37%) articles we could not reproduce some
target outcomes despite author assistance, but
importantly there were no clear indications
that original conclusions were seriously
impacted.”
Similarly, in the Study Two Discussion: “In
37% of articles reproducibility issues could
not be entirely resolved. Crucially, however,
there were no clear indications that original
conclusions based on the target outcomes
were seriously undermined by the
reproducibility issues we encountered. We
arrived at this determination through careful
consideration of multiple factors…” (page 32)
We also discuss the nuances of interpreting
the findings: “Similarly, it was not always
clear whether the non-reproducible target
outcomes are actually erroneous (i.e.,
originally calculated/reported incorrectly) or
are accurate and cannot be reproduced (i.e.,
originally calculated/reported correctly but the
analysis pipeline to recreate them cannot be
reconstructed)” (page 33)
We reinforce this again: “Assessing the
implications of our findings is complex and
they could be viewed positively or negatively
from different perspectives. The fact that
almost two-thirds of the cases were eventually
reproduced successfully, and none of the
original conclusions based on the target
outcomes appears to have been seriously
undermined, suggests a sub-optimal but
reasonably healthy situation with regards to
the credibility of the original findings.” (page
36)

For Study 2 Procedure (page 25), we have
added:
“At least two members of our team attempt to
reproduce the target outcomes for each article
by repeating the reported analysis. When any
reproducibility issues were encountered, we
attempted to resolve them through contact
with the original authors. Further procedural
details are outlined below.”

section, as it contains the most pertinent
information.

More generally, we disagree with the
reviewer’s assessment of the impact of
policies on behavior (even requirements). It is
not obvious that when a journal requires
something all authors will comply, as our
findings demonstrate. The fact that not all
articles in the post-policy period shared data,
and that, among those that did, they often did
not share reusable data, shows that the policy
was only partially successful. This
information can inform refinement of the
policy to improve its effectiveness, and also
highlight issues that other journals should be
aware of when implementing similar
initiatives.
More broadly, our findings suggest that open

curation of data files is necessary to enable
their re-use.

Reviewer 2
R2_1: Comments to the Author(s)
Overall the paper got better in the directions proposed by the review team. In
most instances when the authors deviated from what was suggested they
provide a justification, the editor can adjudicate those disagreements which
are largely stylistic. Lots of great improvements i should say.
A few additional comments
1) I think the abstract could use further edits to avoid misunderstandings.
Maybe the abstract could read something like: "In a sample of 35 articles we
attempted to reproduce a total of XXX reported statistical results (means, d.f.,
t-tests, etc). For 11 articles we successfully reproduced all XXX results we
attempted to reproduce, for another 11 we required some assistance to do so
for at least one, and for the remaining 13 articles there was at least one
reported result we were unable to reproduce even with assistance. None of the
discrepancies reverse the studies' conclusions."
So making it clear what is being compared, how many are being compared,
and that if one is not reproduced, the entire paper counts as non-reproduced.
Authors: We appreciate the reviewer’s attention to this important issue and
have made the following adjustments to the relevant section of the abstract:
For 35 of the articles determined to have reusable data, we attempted to
reproduce 1324 target values. Ultimately, 64 values could not be reproduced
within a 10% margin of error. For 22 articles all target values were
reproduced, but 11 of these required author assistance. For 13 articles at least
one value could not be reproduced despite author assistance.
R2_2: 1.1) In the statement "there were no clear indications that original
conclusions were seriously impacted" has two qualifiers "clear" and
"serious". Are they necessary, don't you have all the information needed to
say something more concrete like "no conclusions were affected". That's an
honest question, if you don't have the goods, i understand the need for hedged
language. But i would have thought that you did have the goods.
Authors: We think these qualifiers are necessary. Firstly, there were three
cases where we could not complete the analysis. This creates uncertainty
about whether the original conclusions were affected. Secondly, there were
cases where effect sizes were lower than those reported. This should have
some impact on the conclusions, although given the size of the differences, we
think it is reasonable to say that this impact is not serious.
R2_3: 1.2) I would prefer it if the abstract also included examples of the
discrepancy, so maybe the abstract could follow: "For example, one article
did a heteroskedasticity correction which was not reported and another
incompletely specified a regression model" (ideally for the latter the authors
will explain just how it is that it was incompletely specific, missing a
covariate?)
I am using actual examples reported in the paper page 31, lines 550-566.
When i hear non-reproducible what i have in mind is someone reports
b=2.99, p=.001, but when you run the code, you get b=.07, p=.37, i am trying
to make sure readers don't come up with the wrong impression i do.
Authors: We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion, however the word limit
for the abstract prevents us including additional content. We have now
indicated in the abstract (see above, R2_1) that we used a 10% margin of error
to define non-reproducible values which hopefully makes our approach more
explicit to the reader.
R2_4: 2) i would turn the %s reported in page 31 into a figure, so that readers
quickly have access to information on the types of discrepancies we are
talking about. I find interesting that there were 8 cases of incomplete or
corrupt data files.
Authors: These data (causes of non-reproducibility) are displayed in Figure 4
to quickly convey the overall pattern of results. Counts and percentages are
provided in the text for readers interested in more detail.
R2_5: 3) perhaps the authors could also quantify the magnitude of the
discrepancies, something like "the median deviation between reported and
reproduced results, for results that were not fully reproducible, was xx%")
Authors: Thank you for this suggestion. For the 1324 target values we
evaluated, we assessed the percentage error (PE) and recorded whether there
was a minor or major error. However, we did not actively record the PE. It
would technically be possible to return to our reproducibility reports and
manually extract the PE for each value, but this would take a considerable
amount of time. Furthermore, we do not think such an analysis would be
straightforward to interpret given the range of PE across different value types:
p-values for example, typically had very large percentage error. Overall, we
do not think it is worthwhile to pursue this data collection and analysis given
the time investment relative to information yield.
Reviewer 1
R1_1: Comments to the Author(s)
I continue to think this paper is well-conceived and will make a nice
contribution to the literature. Moreover, the authors have revised this paper
to my satisfaction, at least for the most part. A holdover issue for me is about
coder drift. The response letter notes that random assignment of articles to
coders assuages concerns about systematic errors abetting the conclusion that
the policy led to more data available statements and in principle reusable
data. I agree that this is true to the extent that each batch of 20 of the
randomly-assigned articles ended up containing roughly even numbers of pre
and post policy articles for all coders.In that case, drift would affect pre and
post periods to the same degree. A statement addressing this in the manuscript
would be welcome.
Authors: We have now modified the following sentence in the methods
section: ‘Articles were randomly selected and assigned to coders in order to
ameliorate selection bias and ensure that any coder drift would affect pre-
policy and post-policy articles evenly.’ (Lines 174-176)
R1_2: A few minor points about things I did not catch first time around
(sorry):
1. Figure 1 shows nonlinear prediction/estimate lines but the interrupted time
series analysis does not appear to have modeled anything but linear effects.
The curved lines are fine in principle but it is probably worth noting in the
figure caption that the depiction deviates from the analysis it parallels.
(Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the logistic regression models;
in that case, consider clarifying in text how nonlinearities were possible.)
Authors: Thank you for flagging this potential source of confusion. The
model and the fitted line are the same. The model is linear on the logit scale
whereas the Y-axis of the figure is on the probability scale, which is a
nonlinear transformation of the logit. So linear on the logit implies nonlinear
on the probability scale. We have added a note to the figure 1 caption to make
this explicit.
R1_3: 2. I don't believe the paper indicates whether Study One coders were
blind to hypotheses. As such, a reader may wonder whether DAS and IPR
rates could be affected by coder expectancies. This bears noting in the method
section (lines 166-171). If coders were not blind, this also bears comment in
the "threats to validity" section of the discussion (lines 279-296).
Authors: Coders were not blind to the hypotheses. We agree with the
reviewer that this is an important issue, but we believe the potential for bias is
low because the coding scheme mostly involves questions that have objective
answers and leave little room for subjective interpretation to creep in – for
example, either the data is available or it is not available.
We now comment on this in both the method and discussion section.
Specifically:
“Coders were not blind to the study hypotheses, however the data extraction
protocol mostly left little room for subjective interpretation (see
https://osf.io/qr6e4/).” (lines 173-174)
“An additional source of bias worth noting is that coders were not blind to the
study hypotheses. However, because the data extraction protocol mostly left
little room for subjective interpretation, we consider the potential for bias to
be low.” (line 305-307)
R1_4: 3. Line 365: "reproducible" should be "reproducibility"
Authors: Changed, thank you.
R1_5: 4. Line 688: Should "underestimate" be "overestimate"? Given the
context of the paragraph, I believe so but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the
referent. In that case, it would be good to clarify wording.
Authors: Yes, we meant overestimate and have clarified the wording. Thanks
for spotting.
