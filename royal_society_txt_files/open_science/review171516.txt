The idea of the paper is interesting, but is important to deep in the analysis and conclusions of the
work. The paper is very short and is difficult to understand the contribution of each one of the 10
authors. In the same way, there are to many references(44) for a short paper. The figure 3 is
unnecessary, the authors do not discussed any point over the basis of the critsalline structure of
ZrN. The reaction of oxidation of NO to NO2 is very favorable, how do you support that NO2
was not formed in the process?.Figure 5 is not understood, do you refer to the concentration of
NO?..why the concentration is increased with the time of radiation? The authors write in the
paper "To elucidate the microscopic structure of the ZrN sample, we conducted a detailedTEM
investigation"...but this study is limited only to two images. The morphology is described as
"plates", but the unique image of the particles shows an irregular shape.

In this manuscript, ZrN powders were synthesized by gas–solid reactions of Zr under a N2 gas-
flow for elimination of nitric oxide. The topic reported sounds to be quite interesting. This work
could be published. However, it needs to undergo revisions beforehand.
Below are my recommendations:
- How about the reaction temperature on the NOx elimination performance?
- Are there any differences for the elimination performance of NO and NO2?
- The specific surface area and pore structure must have effects on the NOx elimination
performance? It should be clarified in this work.
- Most recently, the development of highly-efficient catalysts attracts great interest for elimination
of nitric oxide, e. g. Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research 2018, 57, 521-531; Nanoscale
2017, 9, 5648–5657; Materials Research Bulletin 2018, 97, 369-378; ACS Appl Mater Inter 2017, 9,
2581-2593; J Phys Chem C 2017, 121, 25243-25254. These recent publications should be involved in

Please find the following Response to the comments of referees:
Response to the Reviewer’s Comments
Referee 1
1. The paper is very short and is difficult to understand the contribution of each one of
the 10 authors.
Responds: Thanks for your kind suggestion. The 10 authors have equal contributions,
thus all mentioned in the manuscript. Ning Chen, Jigang Wang and Wenyan Yin
conducted the experiment. Jigang Wang and Zhen Li wrote the manuscript. Peishen Li,
Ming Guo, Qiang Wang, Chunlei Li, Changzheng Wang and Shaowei Chen discussed
and reviewed the manuscript.
2. In the same way, there are to many references(44) for a short paper.
Responds: Thanks for your gentle reminder. We have deleted some not very relevant
references (i.e. 5, 21, 23, 25, 26, 28, 32, 41, 42 and 44) and now the number of
references is 35. Also, we added new Ref 32 for XPS characterization in Page 5.
3. The figure 3 is unnecessary, the authors do not discussed any point over the basis of
the critsalline structure of ZrN.
Responds: Thanks for your constructive suggestions. We note it's not very relevant to
this manuscript and have deleted the Figure 3 and relevant description in revised
manuscript.
4. The reaction of oxidation of NO to NO2 is very favorable, how do you support that
NO2 was not formed in the process?
Responds: Thanks a lot. In this work, we only detected the concentration of nitric
oxide and nitrogen during the reaction by gas chromatography. In the following work,
we would further study the possible transformation of NO to NO2 during the NO
elimination.
5. Figure 5 is not understood, do you refer to the concentration of NO? Why the
concentration is increased with the time of radiation?
Responds: I am sorry for that. In Fig. 5, there are three reaction curves relevant to
400 <U+F0B0>C, 500 <U+F0B0>C and 600 <U+F0B0>C, respectively. The Y axis is only referred as the relative
value of the NO concentration.
As depicted in Fig. 5, ZrN performed different degree of NO removal at 400 <U+F0B0>C,
500 <U+F0B0>C and 600 <U+F0B0>C. During the first part, there was no NO introduced before 126th
min. The different height of those three curves before 126th min is only for
comparison. After that, a gas flow containing 500 ppm NO balanced with N2 was
introduced into the reactor. When the reaction temperature increased from 400 to 600
<U+F0B0>C, the conversion rate of NO increased markedly, which can be read from the height
difference in Fig. 5. Noting that at 400 <U+F0B0>C, the relative concentration of NO rising
rapidly and the concentration at the outlet was always equal to that in the inlet after
126th min, suggesting no NO was eliminated at this temperature. With the reaction
temperature increasing to 500 <U+F0B0>C, the amount of NO at the outlet decreased slightly,
which indicated that the relative concentration of NO was decreased comparing with
that of 400 <U+F0B0>C and NO was partially eliminated by ZrN. However, when the
temperature was further raised to 600 <U+F0B0>C, no NO was detected at the outlet. The
relative concentration of NO kept constant value until about 1090th min and no height
change could be observed, which implied that NO was completely eliminated by ZrN
at 600 <U+F0B0>C. At the point of 1090th min, ZrN powders were used up and the increasing
trend of relative concentration for NO could be found obviously.
6. The authors write in the paper "To elucidate the microscopic structure of the ZrN
sample, we conducted a detailed TEM investigation", but this study is limited only to
two images.
Responds: Thanks for your suggestions. Owing to the highly similarity of the series
of TEM images for ZrN powders, only two images were chosen in Figure 3.
7. The morphology is described as "plates", but the unique image of the particles
shows an irregular shape.
Responds: Thanks for your gentle reminder. We are sorry to make you confused on
the morphology of ZrN. More TEM images of ZrN powders are accurate identified
and analyzed, the unique image of the particles surely shows an irregular shape. To
avoid any controversy, we have revised the description on morphology in the revision.
Referee 2
1. The sentence “A new low-cost, highly efficient and green elimination of NO using
zirconium nitride (ZrN) was firstly reported”; should be changed to “A new low-cost,
highly efficient and green elimination of NO using zirconium nitride (ZrN) has been
reported for the first time”.
Responds: Thanks for your constructive suggestions. We have rewritten according to
your kind advice.
2. The manuscript has been written in poor English and should be rewritten.
Responds: Thanks for your gentle reminders. In order to increase the fluency of the
manuscript, we have rewritten and polished our manuscript.
3. The term Competing interests should be changed to conflict of interest.
Responds: Thanks for your suggestions. We have changed in the corresponding
position.
Referee 3
1. How about the reaction temperature on the NOx elimination performance?
Responds: In our work, the optimal temperature for elimination of NO was 600 <U+F0B0>C.
The NO elimination performance was measured at 400 <U+F0B0>C, 500 <U+F0B0>C and 600 <U+F0B0>C,
respectively. In Figure 4, the conversion rate of NO to N2 over ZrN reactants
increased markedly with the temperature increasing from 400 to 600 <U+F0B0>C. There is no
NO removed at 400 <U+F0B0>C, partial elimination at 500 <U+F0B0>C and nearly complete elimination
at 600 <U+F0B0>C, those results suggest that the best elimination rate of NO was detected at
600 <U+F0B0>C.
2. Are there any differences for the elimination performance of NO and NO2?
Responds: We appreciate the insightful suggestion from you. The processes of
removing NO and NO2 into N2 are all reduction reaction. But in this work, we only
focused on the elimination for NO and haven't explored the elimination of NO2. In the
coming days, we would take further research on NO2 elimination to improve the
systematically work on elimination of NOx.
3. The specific surface area and pore structure must have effects on the NOx
elimination performance? It should be clarified in this work.
Responds: Thanks for your constructive suggestions. The ZrN powders were
prepared at high temperature (1200 °C) and be used to eliminate NO at different
temperature (400 °C ~ 600 °C). All the ZrN powders had similar specific surface
area and pore structure. In fact, we have ever performed the nitrogen
adsorption/desorption isotherms of ZrN (Fig a.), and only found that the ZrN
possessed very small BET surface area (i.e. 6.6926 m2/g) and irregular pore size
distribution (Fig b.). In combination with the reaction mechanism, such value can be
hardly associated with the synergistic effect between the BET of ZrN and the NOx
elimination so we haven't discussed it in the manuscript.

4. Most recently, the development of highly-efficient catalysts attracts great interest
for elimination of nitric oxide, e. g. Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research
2018, 57, 521-531; Nanoscale 2017, 9, 5648-5657; Materials Research Bulletin 2018,
97, 369-378; ACS Appl Mater Inter 2017, 9, 2581-2593; J Phys Chem C 2017, 121,
25243-25254. These recent publications should be involved in the background of this
work.
Responds: Thanks for your kind suggestions. We have referenced above recently
published work in revised manuscript, and above papers were cited as the Ref 6, 2, 3,
9, 4, respectively.
