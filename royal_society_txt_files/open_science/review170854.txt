This manuscript from Monteiro et al. reports the biotransformation of halimane and labdane
acids by employing Fusarium oxysporum or Myrothecium verrucaria. Six oxidized derivatives
were obtained, including four new and two known metabolites, and all the compounds including
starting compounds were also assayed for anticholinesterase inhibition towards AChE and BChE,
through ICER-IT-MS/MS screening. Although the biological activities are not good enough, the
manuscript provides a new method to obtain structurally diverse derivatives of valuable
chemical and biological relevance. The experiments were well designed and the results are
concisely described and reasonably explained. Hence I recommend this interesting and high-
quality manuscript to publish in this journal after minor improvements.
1. The references should be added in the Page 1, right column, last paragraph.
2. I suggest the authors provide the target compounds content of extracts before purification by
semi-preparative HPLC, which seems to be important to investigate the capability of microbial
transformation.

The literature search was not done properly. A nice review delineating several aspects of
biotransformation entitled " Isolation, Chemical, and Biotransformation Routes of
Labdane-type Diterpenes" (Chem. Rev, 2011,111, 4418-4452) should have been included.
It is worthy to mention that two parent labdane based terpenes halimane (1) and labdane (2)
acids were subjected to microbial oxidation which were never done before. The product
distribution from compound 1 was interesting. Though formation of 6 and 4 was less appealing
as it involves the oxidation of -CH2OH group to respective aldehyde and acids. On the contrary
formation of 3 and 4 was interesting as it involves "-CH" oxidation and can be categorized
microbial -CH activation which is very hot and demanding topic. Only concern could be the
3
yield? The isolated yield of 3 and 4 was not mentioned in the experimental section. It should have
been mentioned.
The absolute configurations were predicted based on 2D-NOESY correlations and it is acceptable.
But as all the compounds are solid did the author have tried for single crystal analysis? But as the
amount of compound is less that may not be a practical and feasible option. But that would have
been much more direct evidence.

Dear Dr. Hackett,
We are glad to submit the revised version of the manuscript ID RSOS-170854 -
Biotransformation of labdane and halimane diterpenoids by two filamentous fungi strains.
As you will see in the highlighted version of the manuscript (corrections and additions in
yellow), we have addressed all the points raised by the reviewers as outlined below.

Thank you very much for your comments.
1. The references should be added in the Page 1, right column, last paragraph.
References 1 and 8 were added (p 1, c 2, l 56) to support the statement regarding
biotransformation studies of labdane-type diterpenoids.
2. I suggest the authors provide the target compounds content of extracts before
purification by semi-preparative HPLC, which seems to be important to investigate the
capability of microbial transformation.
We have included a sentence (p 6, c 1, l 27) describing the use of HPLC-DAD to
qualitatively investigate the microbial transformation capability during the incubation
course, in order to detect and monitor the formation of diterpenoid derivatives.

Comments to the Author(s)
The literature search was not done properly. A nice review delineating several aspects
of biotransformation entitled "Isolation, Chemical, and Biotransformation Routes of
Labdane-type Diterpenes" (Chem. Rev, 2011,111, 4418-4452) should have been
included.
An extensive literature search was done to support the biotransformation aspects which
drives the work. The recommended review from Frija et al. (Chem. Rev., 2011, 111,
4418-4452) has been the first reference cited (Ref. 1) in the text and we have now
invoked it in the paragraph delineating the biotransformation of labdane substrates (p 1,
c 2, l 56).
It is worthy to mention that two parent labdane based terpenes halimane (1) and labdane
(2) acids were subjected to microbial oxidation which were never done before. The
product distribution from compound 1 was interesting. Though formation of 6 and 4 was
less appealing as it involves the oxidation of -CH2OH group to respective aldehyde and
acids. On the contrary formation of 3 and 4 was interesting as it involves "-CH" oxidation
and can be categorized microbial -CH activation which is very hot and demanding topic.
Only concern could be the yield? The isolated yield of 3 and 4 was not mentioned in the
experimental section. It should have been mentioned.
Thank you very much for your comments. We do not see the yield of the
biotransformation products as a concern since we were more interested in isolation of
the metabolites as soon as they could be detectable and their production could be
optimized by varying incubation time and starting amounts from substrates. Moreover,
the yield of metabolites 3 (8%) and 4 (4%) have been mentioned in p 6, c 1, l 52 and l
55, respectively.
The absolute configurations were predicted based on 2D-NOESY correlations and it is
acceptable. But as all the compounds are solid did the author have tried for single crystal
analysis? But as the amount of compound is less that may not be a practical and feasible
option. But that would have been much more direct evidence.
Thank you very much for your suggestion. The absolute configurations of parent
compounds have been established in a previous work (Monteiro et al. 2015, Reference
6) by means of Raman Optical Activity, which allowed us to use NOESY correlations to
derive the configurations from the bioproducts. We have not tried to apply single crystal
analyses since we attempted to employ Vibrational Circular Dichroism to determine the
configurations from the additional stereogenic centers in derivatives 7 and 8. However,
we did not succeed by using this chiroptical technique probably because of amount
limitations.
