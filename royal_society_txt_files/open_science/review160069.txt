This is a highly interesting and solid study of human grandparenting, using an unusually rich
data set from Guatemala in 1995. Studies of grandparenting from high fertility and low income
populations have, as the authors point out, usually measured only child survival, and been
criticised for not being able to assess the proximate mechanisms involved. That this study does
not find much influence of the possible proximate mechanisms – contact frequency, advice or
financial assistance to the mother – is highly useful since it questions many of the ad hoc
interpretations provided.
The data allows the authors to separate the influences of grandparental investment on height by
both gender and lineage and includes detailed information on grandparental and parental status.
My only major concern in this regard is the cross-sectional nature of the data, which should be
stressed much more throughout; also more information about the time span the investment
measures cover would be helpful in interpreting the results, as detailed below.
The introduction and discussion in their current form could also benefit from slight rewriting.
While the main analysis is very clear and informative, these two parts are not yet fully “in sync”
with each other and have some inconsistencies (detailed below). Especially the question of kin
competition and resource competition could be mentioned more in the Introduction, since it has
bearing on the results. If you wish to relate the whole discussion more to general cooperative
breeding theory, a useful reference is:

Discussion:
Page 15 line 339: “Overall, our results support previous research finding that maternal
grandmothers tend to be beneficial for their grandchildren. “ – no you don’t – cf Table 3? Only
infrequent contact is positively related to height, and for children. The maternal grandfathers
(coresiding) have a similar and stronger effect.
The last sentence, “However, Guatemalan children fare very poorly by world
standards of nutrition meaning that even small amounts of support from grandparents can have
a meaningful impact on child health.” – you probably mean this in a positive way, i.e. meaningful
and beneficient impact? This is problematic since as you show, the “small amount of support”
can have negative effects also.

By contrast, your finding that there is a “limit” to the good effects of grandparental involvement
(as in good to meet, not very good to coreside) is crucial and ties into the theoretical discussion
about kin altruism / resource competition and also with results from other societies.
The limitations – especially the cross-sectionality – should also be discussed here as a limitation
of the data. Since effects of height take at least several months among children, financial assistant
rendred to the mother of e.g. a 5 year old child does not impact his or her current height.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors use data from a RAND corporation study of family health in rural Guatemala to
assess the relationship between grandparental support and child health. Specifically the study
reports on associations between height for age z-scores and markers of frequency of contact with
grandparents, and whether advice or financial support was received from grandparents.
It is noted that the study data were collected over 20 years ago, and may not be reflective of
current child health in Guatemala, although the issue of inadequate nutrition and stunted growth
remains significant in Guatemala. It is also noted that the survey was not specifically designed to
test the hypotheses of these papers, and this is a secondary analysis of a pre-existing data set.
5
I would like to see some aspects of the study design clarified. In particular it was not clear to me
from the paper or the supporting documentation on the EGSF referred to in the paper whether
child height or maternal height and weight were measured in the survey or were self-reported.
It is also important to note that height for age is a proxy measure of child health that can have
individual variation. While the overall distribution of child height for age scores in this sample is
clearly indicative of nutritional insufficiency and growth restriction, there is imprecision when
using this at an individual level, as there is natural variability in child heights, and individual
children do tend to grow in spurts compared with the smooth growth curve of an average
population. It could be the case that even those children with higher height for age z-scores are
growth restricted compared with the height they may have attained in an unrestricted nutritional
environment.
The issue of multiple testing should be considered in the paper. I'm not suggesting that a formal
statistical adjustment need be applied. However, it should be noted that there are a large number
of regression co-efficients presented in Table 3 and in the supplementary spreadsheet, most of
which are not statistically significant. When a large number of models are fitted and many co-
efficients are presented, it is expected that a small proportion will appear statistically significant
by chance alone. As there are only a small number of significant effects presented, this possibility
needs to be acknowledged.
It also needs to be acknowledged that the study was not specifically designed to test hypotheses
of grandparental influence on child health, and more detailed questions about grandparental
influences may have been asked had this been the case. The study does appear to have a broad
range of information about other factors that could be related to child health and child growth. In
particular, it looks like there is information about breastfeeding initiation and duration,
supplemental feeding in infancy and childhood, and pregnancy complications. These factors
could be considered in the analysis both in terms of mechanisms underpinning growth restriction
in the population, and also in terms of elucidating whether grandparental influences have any
impact on feeding and nutrition, as likely pathways to influencing growth outcomes. Paternal
absence has been included in the presented models, but it is not clear to me why this factor
specifically, among a number of possibilities from the survey data, has been included.
Finally I think it is also important to acknowledge that in an observational study it is possible that
there are systematic differences between the groups being compared that are associated with the
risk factors and outcomes being assessed. For instance, it is possible that families with greater
resources are more likely to be able to afford to live independently while those with more limited
resources may not be able to, and this could influence both contact with grandparents and child
health outcomes.

By contrast, your finding that there is a “limit” to the good effects of grandparental involvement (as
in good to meet, not very good to coreside) is crucial and ties into the theoretical discussion about
kin altruism / resource competition and also with results from other societies.
The limitations – especially the cross-sectionality – should also be discussed here as a limitation of
the data. Since effects of height take at least several months among children, financial assistant
rendred to the mother of e.g. a 5 year old child does not impact his or her current height.
We have written a new section on limitations of the study, in the discussion, acknowledging this
valid point, and also the comments made by reviewer 2.
Tables 3: to my taste, it makes more sense to present results by lineage not by gender (i.e. first
MGm, MGf, then PGM, PGf)
We did think about this but decided to organise it by sex as it is easier to compare maternal and
paternal grandmothers, which is most common in the literature.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors use data from a RAND corporation study of family health in rural Guatemala to assess
the relationship between grandparental support and child health. Specifically the study reports on
associations between height for age z-scores and markers of frequency of contact with
grandparents, and whether advice or financial support was received from grandparents.
It is noted that the study data were collected over 20 years ago, and may not be reflective of current
child health in Guatemala, although the issue of inadequate nutrition and stunted growth remains
significant in Guatemala. It is also noted that the survey was not specifically designed to test the
hypotheses of these papers, and this is a secondary analysis of a pre-existing data set.
I would like to see some aspects of the study design clarified. In particular it was not clear to me
from the paper or the supporting documentation on the EGSF referred to in the paper whether child
height or maternal height and weight were measured in the survey or were self-reported.
We say that mothers and children were measured on page 8 (line 181)
It is also important to note that height for age is a proxy measure of child health that can have
individual variation. While the overall distribution of child height for age scores in this sample is
clearly indicative of nutritional insufficiency and growth restriction, there is imprecision when using
this at an individual level, as there is natural variability in child heights, and individual children do
tend to grow in spurts compared with the smooth growth curve of an average population. It could
be the case that even those children with higher height for age z-scores are growth restricted
compared with the height they may have attained in an unrestricted nutritional environment.
We completely agree. However we are not able to consider growth spurts with these cross-
sectional data. Height for age z-scores are commonly used as a proxy for child health in developing
contexts.
The issue of multiple testing should be considered in the paper. I'm not suggesting that a formal
statistical adjustment need be applied. However, it should be noted that there are a large number of
regression co-efficients presented in Table 3 and in the supplementary spreadsheet, most of which
are not statistically significant. When a large number of models are fitted and many co-efficients are
presented, it is expected that a small proportion will appear statistically significant by chance alone.
As there are only a small number of significant effects presented, this possibility needs to be
acknowledged.
We have added a section on limitations of the study where we discuss this, and the next two
comments.
It also needs to be acknowledged that the study was not specifically designed to test hypotheses of
grandparental influence on child health, and more detailed questions about grandparental
influences may have been asked had this been the case. The study does appear to have a broad
range of information about other factors that could be related to child health and child growth. In
particular, it looks like there is information about breastfeeding initiation and duration,
supplemental feeding in infancy and childhood, and pregnancy complications. These factors could be
considered in the analysis both in terms of mechanisms underpinning growth restriction in the
population, and also in terms of elucidating whether grandparental influences have any impact on
feeding and nutrition, as likely pathways to influencing growth outcomes. Paternal absence has been
included in the presented models, but it is not clear to me why this factor specifically, among a
number of possibilities from the survey data, has been included.
Finally I think it is also important to acknowledge that in an observational study it is possible that
there are systematic differences between the groups being compared that are associated with the
risk factors and outcomes being assessed. For instance, it is possible that families with greater
resources are more likely to be able to afford to live independently while those with more limited
resources may not be able to, and this could influence both contact with grandparents and child
health outcomes.
