The authors describe the tactile perception of a range of materials and rationalise the data mainly
on the basis of corresponding measurements of their friction using a urethane resin probe. In
particular, they argue that the difference between the static and dynamic values of the friction are
an important contributory factor. Some of the differences are negative so that the meaning is not
clear. The concept of a static friction is nebulous and is often only associated with extended
contact times prior to sliding. To be convincing, the effect of this delay time should have been
examined. In any case, the frictional characteristics of a finger pad are complex and cannot be
satisfactorily mimicked by a probe. This is due to the extent of moisture accumulation in the
contact region that is associated with an increase in the friction [e.g. Dzidek et al., 2017. Why pens
have rubbery grips. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 114, pp.10864-10869.] This so called occlusion effect is
absent on rough surfaces and the friction reduces with sliding time for absorbent surfaces such as
paper and probably some fabrics [Adams et al., 2013. Finger pad friction and its role in grip and
touch. J. Roy. Soc. Interf., 10, p.20120467.] It will also be seen in this latter reference that the
adhesion, due for example to capillary forces, is negligibly small compared to the applied normal
forces. Consequently, an explanation based on capillary adhesion (eq. 4) is not correct. I suggest
that the authors review the extensive literature on finger pad friction in order to provide a more
convincing explanation of their data.

“Shittori feel” is an interesting topic.
The authors conducted the multiple regression analyses of different materials.
The authors analyzed the relationship between the physical properties and the moist/smooth
feels to show how subjects felt certain feels simultaneously.
However, the following problems must be paid attention to.
1. Suggest that you add these diagrams and tables (figure S1, figure S2, figure S3, table S1…) to
the proper place of the text so that the reader can understand them better.
2. For similar lists, recommend using tables.
3. The references in the past five years account for less than one sixth. Hope to refer to more
recent articles.

The paper is clearly written, the figures are easy to read and the information flows nicely. The
authors followed a systematic and comprehensive approach to understanding what contributes
to the shittori feel, by comparing how perceptual evaluations of material properties and materials
properties relate to each other and to the overall assessment of the shittori effet.
Specific comments:
- The variations in responses amongst participants are not shown nor discussed. It seems the
score and values are the means across all participants but that is not clearly stated. I would really
like to see the distribution of results across participants and a detailed explanation on how
exactly the scores were computed.
- The images, the equipment used for measurements and the sample preparation are very
detailed, however, I don’t think the raw data of individual responses to all the questions asked in
the experiment is accessible and I think the journal requires it.
- It is unclear if the responses to Q2, Q4 and follow-up questions about when the effect was felt
4
were analyzed or discussed in the paper. It would be good to add that or make it more explicit.
- I would suggest adding a bit more detail on the importance of the “Shittori” feel.
- Could you please specify the type/model of the load cells used to measure the frictions forces?
- I would remove the variable “delay time”. It’s not super common and it doesn’t add to your
analysis.
- I would probably remove the capillary force equation since you just state it without going
further. It would also make the text flow more instead of breaking it up as it is currently.
- Did the participants all know the shittori effect? Were they provided with a definition at the
beginning of the experiments to ensure consistency in reporting across all participants?

Dear Editors,
This submission contains the revised version of our manuscript (ID RSOS-190039)
tled ‘Physical origin of a complicated tactile sensation: “Shittori feel”’. We thank you and
eviewers for giving us some important suggestions. We changed the manuscript according
o reviewer’s advices. We believe that the revised paper is suitable to be published in Royal
ociety Open Science.
eviewer 1:
I would like to appreciate your suggestive comments. In the present paper, we have
evised these points.
“Some of the differences are negative so that the meaning is not clear. The concept of a
tatic friction is nebulous and is often only associated with extended contact times prior to
liding. To be convincing, the effect of this delay time should have been examined.”
The contact probe was in contact with the material for 30 seconds prior to sliding. As
he reviewer mentioned, the static friction coefficient depends on the conditions of sliding.
n particular, the contact time between the contact probe and materials before sliding can
ring a significant effect on the static friction. Therefore, we confirmed that the static and
ynamic friction coefficients were almost the same even if the contact time was changed
rom 30-300 seconds (section 2.4 p. 10 line 22- p.11 line 3). However, it was difficult to
how the effect of delay time, because the time was only 0.05-0.06 seconds and was too short
o check the effect precisely. We will conduct systematic analysis to show the effect of the
elay time after developing a more precise evaluation method.

“In any case, the frictional characteristics of a finger pad are complex and cannot be
atisfactorily mimicked by a probe. This is due to the extent of moisture accumulation in the
ontact region that is associated with an increase in the friction [e.g. Dzidek et al., 2017.
hy pens have rubbery grips. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 114, pp.10864-10869.] This so called
cclusion effect is absent on rough surfaces and the friction reduces with sliding time for
bsorbent surfaces such as paper and probably some fabrics [Adams et al., 2013. Finger pad
riction and its role in grip and touch. J. Roy. Soc. Interf., 10, p.20120467.] It will also be
een in this latter reference that the adhesion, due for example to capillary forces, is
egligibly small compared to the applied normal forces. Consequently, an explanation based
n capillary adhesion (eq. 4) is not correct. I suggest that the authors review the extensive
terature on finger pad friction in order to provide a more convincing explanation of their
ata.”
The hypothesis based on the capillary adhesion force may be too simple to explain
he phenomena that occur on the actual skin surface. In future, we will propose more suitable
odel of interfacial phenomena on human skin. For example, as the reviewer mentioned, the
xtent of moisture accumulation in the contact region is associated with an increase in the
riction [38]. The morphology of the sliding surface in the powder bed is complex: During
he sliding process the powder is packed into the groove of the fingerprint, which lowers the
riction significantlly [39]. The uneven surface of the paper absorbs sweat and changes the
riction characteristics drastically [40]. Dussaud et al. measured flows within the fine
hannels on the human skin surface and demonstrated that this network can act as a
icrofluidic device to allow the surface transport of liquids. [41]. The description was added
n page 23 lines 4-12.
eviewer 2:
We thank you for appreciating our manuscript very much.
“Suggest that you add these diagrams and tables (figure S1, figure S2, figure S3, table S1…)
o the proper place of the text so that the reader can understand them better.”
In the revised paper, Figure S1, S2, and S6 are added in the main text (Figure 1, 2,
able1). Others are remained in SI because they are figures of instructions and data.

“For similar lists, recommend using tables.”
The images and chemical composition of 12 materials, which were described in Figure
1 and section 2.1. in the previous version, are shown in Table 1.
“The references in the past five years account for less than one sixth. Hope to refer to more
ecent articles.”
Some recent papers on modeling of tactile texture and tribology of human skin were
dded as references [8], [9], [13], [14], [38], and [44].
eviewer 3:
I would like to appreciate your suggestive comments. In the present paper, we have
evised these points.
“The variations in responses amongst participants are not shown nor discussed. It seems
he score and values are the means across all participants but that is not clearly stated. I
ould really like to see the distribution of results across participants and a detailed
xplanation on how exactly the scores were computed.”
In the revised paper, shittori score of all subjects, means and standard deviations are
escribed in Figure 2 and Table S1 to show the distribution of results across participants. The
eans are arithmetic averages. The descriptions are added in page 14 lines 2-12.
“The images, the equipment used for measurements and the sample preparation are very
etailed, however, I don’t think the raw data of individual responses to all the questions
sked in the experiment is accessible and I think the journal requires it. ”
The raw data of individual responses to all the questions are added in Table S1-3. The
escriptions were added in the section 3.2. In the comments of Q2 and 4, the words
oncerning sticky or moist feel are appeared with relatively high probability for powders A
nd B. On the other hand, the words related to dry feel were described for cloths K and L
ith the lowest score of shittori feel (Table S2,3 and Fig. S4).
“It is unclear if the responses to Q2, Q4 and follow-up questions about when the effect was
elt were analyzed or discussed in the paper. It would be good to add that or make it more
xplicit. ”
The comments and appearance rate of the words on each tactile dimension in the
ubject's comment were added in Table S2, S3 and Figure S4. In the comments of the subjects
f Q2 and 4, the words concerning sticky or moist feel appeared with relatively high
robability for powders A and B. On the other hand, the words related to dry feel were
escribed for cloths K and L with the lowest score of shittori feel. These descriptions were
dded in the section 3.2 page 14 lines 9-12.
“I would suggest adding a bit more detail on the importance of the “Shittori” feel. ”
In the field of cosmetics, Shittori feel is the most important evaluation item for many
ormulators, because the feeling is the characteristic texture of healthy skin with high water
3 / 4
olding capacity, desirable lotions and lipsticks [2-4]. In the case of textile, this feel is related
o the favorability. Tanaka and Sukigara found that the stronger shittori feel was
ccompanied with either the warm or soft [5]. These references were added in introduction
page 2 lines 18-23).
“Could you please specify the type/model of the load cells used to measure the frictions
orces? ”
The friction force applied to the contact probe 1Fx and the forces applied to the material
Fx and Fz were detected by strain gauge type load cells, which are order-made. The
easurement range of the friction forces were as follows: 1Fx = 2Fx = 0.06–9.9 N and Fz =
.06–9.8 N. In contrast, the detection limits of 1Fx, 2Fx, Fz = 0.02 N. These descriptions are
dded in the section 2.4 page 10 lines 5-8.
“I would remove the variable “delay time”. It’s not super common and it doesn’t add to
our analysis. ”
Although <U+F064> is not common, we add this parameter for the analysis, because we found that
his parameter reflects some characteristic friction phenomena on soft matter surfaces in
ome previous studies [22, 23]. This description was added in the section 2.4 (page 11 lines
3-15).
“I would probably remove the capillary force equation since you just state it without going
urther. It would also make the text flow more instead of breaking it up as it is currently. ”
As you mentioned, the equation (4) was deleted in the revised paper.
“Did the participants all know the shittori effect? Were they provided with a definition at
he beginning of the experiments to ensure consistency in reporting across all participants? ”
hittori feel is a very common word in Japanese, and listed as almost the same meanings in typical
ictionaries. We did not explain the meaning before evaluation, because all subjects were native Japanese
peakers.
I thank the referees for their comments and hope the manuscript is now suitable for
ublication in Royal Society Open Science.
