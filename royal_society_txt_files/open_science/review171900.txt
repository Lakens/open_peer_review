This manuscript reports the results of phylogenetic analyses of relationships among 43 of the 160
recognized species of the subgenus Melanoconion of Culex based on molecular sequence data for two
nuclear genes and a mitochondrial gene. The research is original and the methodology seems to be in good
order. The manuscript is generally well written, but it contains some grammatical errors, inconsistencies,
poor word choices and taxonomic misconceptions, and suffers from a number of troublesome issues.
Corrections, suggested improvements and comments are tracked in the attached PDF of the manuscript.
Important comments include:
1. The study is taxon limited, i.e. it includes sequence data for only about 26% of the currently recognized
species of the subgenus. Species are not included for some informal groups and subgroups. Thus, some of
the conclusions and statements made about relationships and classification are not justifiable and are likely
to prove to change with the inclusion of more species. This should be made clear in the manuscript. For
example, the statement that “The ML topology (Figure 2) confirmed both the monophyly of the two
sections” would be better stated as “The ML topology (Figure2), based on the available data, supports the
monophyly of the two sections”.
2. The authors appear to misunderstand the concept of monophyly. For example, they state that the
Spissipes Group is monophyletic despite the group being comprised of only one species. A group cannot
be shown to be monophyletic unless it is represented by two or more species. This also applies to the
Pereyrai Subgroup and the Distinguendus Group, each of which is only comprises a single species.
3. The authors state that the Crybda Group is monophyletic based on a clade composed of crybda, pedroi
and pereyrai, but pedroi is not listed in Table 1. This must refer to the sp. nr. pedroi, which is listed
separately from the other two species.
4. The paragraph on page 15 that begins with “Other monophyletic clades…” is problematic. It states that
Cx. aliciae is grouped as sister to …”. What about the other two species of the Conspirator Group included
in the analyses? What does the recovered relationship say about the group? This paragraph is confusing
because the listed clades are comprised of species of different groups with no indication of those groups.
Why are the sp. nr. rabelloi and rabelloi listed as members of different groups in Table 1? A logical
assumption would be that these exhibit morphological affinities which would place them in the same
group. This applies to other species listed in Table 1. For example, Cx. theobaldi is placed as sister to the
Atratus Group + Cx. clarki, but what about the sp. nr. Theobald?
5. The paragraph at the top of page 17 states that “meanwhile the phylogenetic relationships with the
Melanoconion Section are mainly dissimilar to what have been previously proposed using morphological
characters”. It is difficult to accept that the relationships are “mainly dissimilar” based on the limited
number of species include in the analyses, merely about 22% of the species currently included in the
Section.
6. The statement at the bottom of page 17 that “the Melanoconion Section demands a rearrangement” is
overstated and unjustifiable. The data are too limited and preliminary to make changes to the current
classification. The authors have misconstrued the classification of the Intrincatus Group. As presented, the
authors give the impression that the group is monophyletic based on the pairing of eastor, idottus and
intrincatus, and therefore misionensis and equinoxialis, which are not united with those three species,
should be removed from the group. The authors fail to consider or mention that the five species belong to
different subgroups of the Intrincatus Group – misionensis and equinoxialis are members of the Intrincatus
Subgroup, which includes intrincatus; eastor is the sole member of the Eastor Subgroup and idottus is one
of five species of the Idottus Subgroup. Removing two species from the Intrincatus Subgroup while
retaining a third one and considering it and species from two other subgroups to represent the Intrincatus
Group is illogical and reflects poorly on the rationality of the authors. By the way, according to Table 1,
equinoxialis was not included in the study.
7. The sentence at the bottom of page 18 makes one wonder if the authors are fully versed with taxonomic
principles. The sentence states “Among the challenges, it is clear that some species currently assigned as
3
senior synonyms are in fact valid.” All senior synonyms are names of currently valid species, so what
possibly can this sentence mean?
8. Some wording on page 19 is disturbing. For example, “our findings will lead [to] an improved
classification” and “first comprehensive molecular phylogeny” are absurd. From item 6 above, weak
support for some clades and limited taxon sampling, changes to the current classification are not justifiable
and certainly do not provide for an improved classification. Seriously, how can the results of the study be
considered to provide a “comprehensive molecular phylogeny”?
9. Table 1 is confusing and misleading. First of all, the names of the sections should only be listed once, not
repeated for each group and subgroup. Likewise, each group and subgroup should only be listed once. The
table would be less cluttered and visually easier to deal with. That aside, there are some problems with the
listing of species. Why are aureonotatus and sp. nr. aureonotatus listed as members of different groups?
Why is the sp. nr. pedroi not listed as a member of the Pedroi Subgroup along with crybda? The same
question pertains to intrincatus and misionensis; spissipes/Culex near spissipes; and Culex near vomerifer
and Culex near portesi, which are separated from three species of the Vomerifer Group. The table seems to
more closely reflect the results of the study rather than the established classification of the subgenus.
10. Tables 2 and 3 could be provided as supplementary information.

Melanoconion based on similarities and dissimilarities of nucleotide sequences for two nuclear genes and a
mitochondrial gene. The research is original and the methodology seems to be in good order with the
12
exception that the methods of analysis employed are phenetic methods of comparison, not phylogenetic
methods that elucidate shared derived characters. The manuscript contains grammatical errors,
inconsistencies, poor word choices and misconceptions/misinterpretations. Corrections, suggested
improvements and comments are tracked in the attached PDF. Major shortcomings are as follow.
1. The summary is excessively long and includes information that is irrelevant to the purpose and results of
the study. It is not necessary to repeat the name of the subgenus after first mention as it is understood to be
the subject of the study. This applies to the text of the paper as well.
2. The methods of investigation, contrary to what is usually accepted, are not methods for resolving
phylogenetic relationships. They merely assess the degree of relatedness based on the constitution of
nucleotide sequences. For this reason, the words “phylogenetic”, “monophyly|”, etc. have been stuck out
or replaced in the PDF. The emphasis of the manuscript is on assessing the integrity of groups recognized
on the basis of shared morphological traits, i.e. does shared DNA sequence data support or cast doubt on
the morphology-based groups? This reviewer recommends revision of the results and discussion sections
to indicate this, with removal of some redundancy regarding the Vomerifer and Crybda groups.
3. The choice of outgroup based on reference 18, published 22 years ago, is not justifiable. Phylogenetic
principle stresses that outgroup taxa should be as closely related as possible to the ingroup taxa. The study
of Harbach et al. (2012) supports a closer relation of Melanoconion with other Neotropical subgenera. It
appears that the actual justification for the choice of outgroup is the availability of data for the chosen taxa.
Some clarification is needed.
4. The inferences about the integrity of the Vomerifer and Crybda groups is based on irrational reasoning,
i.e. they are judged to be unnatural groups because females that by admission cannot be reliably identified
to species, and were identified as species “near” to recognized species but not classified in the groups with
those apparently related species, were not united with those species in the map of relationships. By virtue
of not being considered members of the groups, the assumption that the groups are not natural
assemblages is not justifiable. See comment 7.
5. One wonders if relationships recovered in the study of Navarro and Weaver (2004) are relevant to the
results and discussion sections. The paper is mentioned without revealing whether the results of the
reported study support or refute the integrity of the Vomerifer and Crybda groups. And what is the
relevance of the “molecular data of other Melanoconion species” to the results and discussion?
6. The paper essentially ignores the potential of morphology for resolving relationships, with an
underlying assumption that this can only be achieved with molecular studies. Why cite only molecular
studies, most of which were severely taxon limited. What about the larger study of Harbach et al. (2012,
Zoologica Scripta) based on morphology, which, among other subgenera, included three species of
Melanoconion? Those species indicated a paraphyletic relationship between the Spissipes and
Melanoconion sections. Are there other morphological studies that should be mentioned or discussed?
7. Logically, specimens of doubtful or questionable identification should not have been included in the
study, i.e. those species identified as “near” other species, especially adult females whose identification is
problematic. Readers are likely to wonder what results would be obtained if only positively identified
"good" species of known group placement were included. For this reason, this reviewer strongly
recommends that the analyses be run again without the specimens identified as "near" species. Doing so is
likely to produce results that could be discussed more rationally.

Response to Referees
Manuscript title: "Molecular phylogeny of Culex subgenus Melanoconion (Diptera:
Culicidae) based on nuclear protein coding genes and COI mitochondrial barcode"
Responses for Reviewer #1
The authors appreciate the time and help of the reviewer to improve this manuscript
and present the corresponding responses below each comment:
1. The study is taxon limited, i.e. it includes sequence data for only about 26% of the
currently recognized species of the subgenus. Species are not included for some
informal groups and subgroups. Thus, some of the conclusions and statements
made about relationships and classification are not justifiable and are likely to prove
to change with the inclusion of more species. This should be made clear in the
manuscript. For example, the statement that “The ML topology (Figure 2) confirmed
both the monophyly of the two sections” would be better stated as “The ML topology
(Figure2), based on the available data, supports the monophyly of the two sections”.
Response: The manuscript has been reviewed and language improved. The
statement highlighted by the reviewer has been corrected following his/her
suggestion.
2. The authors appear to misunderstand the concept of monophyly. For example,
they state that the Spissipes Group is monophyletic despite the group being
comprised of only one species. A group cannot be shown to be monophyletic unless
it is represented by two or more species. This also applies to the Pereyrai Subgroup
and the Distinguendus Group, each of which is only comprises a single species.
Response: Authors appreciate all corrections. The text has been reviewed and
improved.
3. The authors state that the Crybda Group is monophyletic based on a clade
composed of crybda, pedroi and pereyrai, but pedroi is not listed in Table 1. This
must refer to the sp. nr. pedroi, which is listed separately from the other two species.
Response: The text was modified to address this issue. The species listed in Table 1
should be considered as a list of individuals to be analyzed. Given that Table 1 is
included in the methodology, we believe the species list should reflect only a sample
of the species previous to the phylogenetic analyses.
4. The paragraph on page 15 that begins with “Other monophyletic clades…” is
problematic. It states that Cx. aliciae is grouped as sister to …”. What about the
other two species of the Conspirator Group included in the analyses? What does the
recovered relationship say about the group? This paragraph is confusing because
the listed clades are comprised of species of different groups with no indication of
those groups. Why are the sp. nr. rabelloi and rabelloi listed as members of different
groups in Table 1? A logical assumption would be that these exhibit morphological
affinities which would place them in the same group. This applies to other species
listed in Table 1. For example, Cx. theobaldi is placed as sister to the Atratus Group
+ Cx. clarki, but what about the sp. nr. Theobald?
Response: The paragraph indicated in the reviewer's comment specifically refers to
the monophyletic clades found in the analyses. In the referred section, the authors
are highlighting the species found as sister groups in the BA and ML topologies.
Consequently, a number of groupings (such as Conspirator Group within
Melanoconion Section) were considered as either polyphyletic or paraphyletic
groups. The text was modified in order to specifically indicate that Cx. dyius did not
cluster with Cx. aliciae.
In response to the questions regarding the listing of species in Table 1, this table is
part of the methodology of the manuscript; the authors are simply listing the
individuals that were included in the study. The taxonomical classification that is
represented in such table corresponds to a state previous to the analyses. Please
note that Table 1 is part of the methodology and, consequently, no elements of the
results and discussion were incorporated. Readers can appreciate the relationships
of the different individuals included in the sample when the topologies are presented
in Figures 2-6 (Fig. 5 and 6 are included in supplementary data).
5. The paragraph at the top of page 17 states that “meanwhile the phylogenetic
relationships with the Melanoconion Section are mainly dissimilar to what have been
previously proposed using morphological characters”. It is difficult to accept that the
relationships are “mainly dissimilar” based on the limited number of species include
in the analyses, merely about 22% of the species currently included in the Section.
Response: The authors are aware of the limitations of the sample but also of the
significance of the current contributions by generating DNA sequences of nuclear
genes (CAD and Hunchback) for 69 individuals of at least 25 species classified in
different groups of Melanoconion Section. Though great strides are still to be made, our
sample should be considered in the following context: In 2004, Navarro and Weaver
used ITS2 sequences (rDNA) of 9 species to study phylogenetic relationships for the
Vomerifer and Pedroi groups of subgenus Melanoconion; in 2011 Williams & Savage
developed a technique (Multiplex PCR) to identify the eight species occurring in the
southern United States; additionally, studies by Demari-Silva et al.(2011) and
Vesgueiro et al. (2011) included a sample of species of Culex Melanoconion (five
species) when analyzing COI and ITS2 sequences, respectively, for phylogenetic
studies. When taken in context, it is expected that steps forward and achievements in
the biological field rely on the available funding and biological material.
6. The statement at the bottom of page 17 that “the Melanoconion Section demands
a rearrangement” is overstated and unjustifiable. The data are too limited and
preliminary to make changes to the current classification. The authors have
misconstrued the classification of the Intrincatus Group. As presented, the authors give
the impression that the group is monophyletic based on the pairing of eastor, idottus
and intrincatus, and therefore misionensis and equinoxialis, which are not united with
those three species, should be removed from the group. The authors fail to consider or
mention that the five species belong to different subgroups of the Intrincatus Group –
misionensis and equinoxialis are members of the Intrincatus Subgroup, which includes
intrincatus; eastor is the sole member of the Eastor Subgroup and idottus is one of five
species of the Idottus Subgroup. Removing two species from the Intrincatus Subgroup
while retaining a third one and considering it and species from two other subgroups to
represent the Intrincatus Group is illogical and reflects poorly on the rationality of the
authors. By the way, according to Table 1, equinoxialis was not included in the study.
Response:
The text is stating that the discussion on the groups and subgroups of the subgenus
Melanoconion is based on the available information.
Regarding Cx. equinoxialis: the species was not included in Table 1 as such table
includes only the individuals for which the authors had a multi-loci data sequence in
order to conduct the analyses. However, the text states " Taxa obtained for COI and
CAD genes surpassed the number of sequences available for the three-gene
collection and are listed/described in the supplementary data 1." Thus, Cx.
equinoxialis was included in the list of species with detailed information provided by
supplementary data 1.
7. The sentence at the bottom of page 18 makes one wonder if the authors are
fully versed with taxonomic principles. The sentence states “Among the challenges, it
is clear that some species currently assigned as senior synonyms are in fact valid.”
All senior synonyms are names of currently valid species, so what possibly can this
sentence mean?
Response: The manuscript has been reviewed and corrections were made.
8. Some wording on page 19 is disturbing. For example, “our findings will lead [to]
an improved classification” and “first comprehensive molecular phylogeny” are
absurd. From item 6 above, weak support for some clades and limited taxon
sampling, changes to the current classification are not justifiable and certainly do not
provide for an improved classification. Seriously, how can the results of the study be
considered to provide a “comprehensive molecular phylogeny”?
Response: The word "comprehensive" has been replaced in the text for "most
inclusive". The authors are aware of the number of species represented in the
sample and we consider such sample significant and valuable. Though it may not
contain the total number of species of the subgenus known to date (this number may
change in the future), the new information generated in this study will help
researchers understand the relationships among the species of the subgenus.
9. Table 1 is confusing and misleading. First of all, the names of the sections
should only be listed once, not repeated for each group and subgroup. Likewise,
each group and subgroup should only be listed once. The table would be less
cluttered and visually easier to deal with. That aside, there are some problems with
the listing of species. Why are aureonotatus and sp. nr. aureonotatus listed as
members of different groups? Why is the sp. nr. pedroi not listed as a member of the
Pedroi Subgroup along with crybda? The same question pertains to intrincatus and
misionensis; spissipes/Culex near spissipes; and Culex near vomerifer and Culex
near portesi, which are separated from three species of the Vomerifer Group. The
table seems to more closely reflect the results of the study rather than the
established classification of the subgenus.
Response: All corrections to the format of the table were considered and introduced.
As previously mentioned, table 1 is part of the methodology of the manuscript, the
authors are listing the individuals that were included in the study. The taxonomical
classification in table 1 corresponds to a state previous to the analyses. Please note
that Table 1 is part of the methodology and, consequently, no elements of the results
and discussion were incorporated. Readers can appreciate the relationships of the
different individuals of the sample when the topologies are presented in Figures 2-6
(Fig. 5 and 6 are included in supplementary data).
10. Tables 2 and 3 could be provided as supplementary information.
Response:
We feel that the information included in Tables 2, 3 and 4 are essential for the
readers to understand the experimental procedures of the study; therefore we would
like to keep them as part of the main text.
Response to comments inside the text - presumably from Reviewer #1
This paper does not present a phylogeny of the subgenus because is includes fewer
than 30% of the currently recognized species of the group.
Response:
The authors believe that though the sample of DNA sequences used to conduct the
analyses does not represent the total number of species known to date, the sample
included in our study is in fact the most inclusive so far. The title of the manuscript
refers to all the methodological procedures taken to answer the question that
motivated our research: Are the two major sections of subgenus Melanoconion
monophyletic groups?. The phylogenetic analyses employed in this research can be
applied to small and large groups of data. Our data is a relevant sample, of 97
individuals (all of them with COI, CAD and HB sequences) belonging to 43 species
of the subgenus Melanoconion. All methodological procedures were applied
following the phylogenetic principles and therefore we consider the title is indicative
of the type of analyses conducted with the sample at hand.
This cannot be explicitly concluded based on the limited number of species included
in the analyses.
Comment attached to the following paragraph: "....meanwhile the phylogenetic
relationships within the Melanoconion Section are mainly dissimilar to what have
been previously proposed using morphological characters."
The text was reviewed and modified.
Only one species of each of these groups is included in the analyses, so referral to
"non-monophyletic groups" does not apply.
Comment attached to the paragraph stating that "Several non-monophyletic groups
were evident in our phylogenetic inference, such as: Conspirator, Erraticus,
Educator, Inhibitator and Bastagarius Groups"
Response: The authors reviewed the number of species included in each of the
above mentioned groups to evaluate the validity of the statement included in the text:
Conspirator Group: the study includes two species (Cx. aliciae and Cx. dyius),
Erraticus Group: the study includes two species (Cx. clarki and Cx.aurenotatus),
Educator Group: the study includes three species (Cx. eknomios, Cx. theobaldi and
Cx. vaxus)
Inhibitator Group: the study includes four species (Cx. serratimarge, Cx. inhibitator,
Cx. oedipus and Cx. rabelloi)
Bastagarius Group: the study includes two species (Cx. bastagarius and Cx.
corentynensis)
All of the listed groups include two or more species; therefore conclusions about their
monophyly based on the analyses apply.
This brings into question how accurately species were identified for the present
study.
Comment attached to the text for the following sentence: " the challenge of reaching
an accurate identification of the species is as current as it was in 1950 when
Rozeboom and Komp [59] published the first revision on the subgenus"
Response: The authors conducted morphological and molecular studies (based on
the COI gene) to reach the identification of the species. All methodological
procedures are carefully included in the corresponding section. Previous work by the
authors of the present manuscript are in support of their experience in taxonomical
studies of the subgenus Melanoconion.
Responses for Reviewer #2
All the annotated corrections regarding English usage were accepted. For those
comments containing questions or requesting explanations, responses are given
below:
1. Can you address morphological apomorphies used to separate the two sections?
Response:
Yes, the morphological apomorphies, as requested by the reviewer, were included in
the second paragraph of the Discussion,
2. Did you do analyses using amino acids?
Response:
Yes, as section "2.2.3 Sequence analyses" states, we translated all data to amino
acid sequences to check their identity (expected protein according to the target
gene) and to verify coding sequences (absence of stop codons).
3. Please define / explain or give reference (comment attached to a paragraph
providing description of the molecular markers utilized in the study: hunchback gene)
Response:
When describing the hunchback gene in the methodology, the authors consider
there is enough information for the readers:
"HuncHBack (HB) is a gap gene [41] that is involved in anterior-posterior polarity
determination in embryos [42,43]. It encodes a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor
whose primary function is to regulate the expression of other genes involved in the
embryo development."
This section briefly explains the known function of this coding unit and provides three
different references in which readers will find additional information about the gene.
4. What is your rationale for choosing the outgroup species?
Response:
The authors have modified the text to include the rational requested by the reviewer.
5. "The HB dataset consisted only of forward strands with variable size (470 - 540
bp), as all the different approaches attempted to obtain the R strand for hunchback
failed" ...... Explain in methods.
Response:
The authors included all methodological procedures to amplify and sequence a
fragment of the hunchback gene; however the fact that we only obtained forward
strands is in fact a result. We feel it is fair to inform the readers what was obtained
from the experimental procedures while attempting to sequence HB gene. This is
why we believe this information belongs to the Results section.
6. I'm not familiar with this method. Please consider if it would be helpful to others to
explain what it all means
Response: Yes, this methodology was given a reference in section 2.2.3 Sequence
analyses, in methodology:
..."likelihood mapping analysis was implemented with the TREE PUZZLE software to
better understand the phylogenetic content of each data set as described in
Strimmer and von Haeseler [51]"...
Additionally, we introduced a brief explanatory sentence in the Results section:
..."A likelihood mapping analysis, known as a method to visualize the phylogenetic
content of a sequence alignment, is shown in Figure 1." The underlined sentence
was added to the text.
7. A summary of the informal groups would be very helpful in the introduction.
Response:
We included the recent work in which such summary has been provided (Torres-
Gutierrez and Sallum, 2015). The text is cited: "Each one of these sections is further
divided into groups and subgroups [17]."
8. Explicit labeling on one of the trees would be helpful, or a new composite tree,
which would be easier to read
Response:
We used colors in the edited figures provided to highlight the clades mentioned in
the Discussion.
9. What is meant here? Their catalog republished illustrations from the literature.
The literature is inadequate?
Response:
The manuscript has been reviewed and corrections were made.

Appendix B
Response to Referee´s comments regarding the first version of the manuscript
Manuscript title: "Molecular phylogeny of Culex subgenus Melanoconion (Diptera:
Culicidae) based on nuclear protein coding genes and COI mitochondrial barcode"
The authors greatly appreciate the time and suggestions made by the reviewers. We believe
they have contributed to vast improvement of this manuscript. In the new version, authors
accepted most suggestions proposed by R#1 and R#2 and made substantial changes in the
manuscript to correct errors and ambiguities pointed by referees during the first and second
evaluation rounds.
Responses to R#1:
1. The study is taxon limited, i.e. it includes sequence data for only about 26% of the
currently recognized species of the subgenus. Species are not included for some informal
groups and subgroups. Thus, some of the conclusions and statements made about
relationships and classification are not justifiable and are likely to prove to change with the
inclusion of more species. This should be made clear in the manuscript. For example, the
statement that “The ML topology (Figure 2) confirmed both the monophyly of the two
sections” would be better stated as “The ML topology (Figure2), based on the available data,
supports the monophyly of the two sections”.
The reviewer makes a valid point. We have decided to be more thorough and expand on the
strengths and weaknesses of our manuscript. Rather than adding the five words “based on
the available data’ suggested by the reviewer, we have expanded on this topic in the
manuscript as follows:
Lines 289-306 in the clean manuscritp - Results of the current phylogenetic analyses
provided robust support for the monophyly of both the Spissipes and Melanoconion sections.
Moreover, our results are consistent with most of the morphological classification of the
Spissipes Section; while the phylogenetic relationships within the Melanoconion Section
are somewhat incongruent with morphology-based groups. The incongruence might be
caused by the small percentage of taxa included from the taxa-rich Melanoconion Section.
The taxonomic status of the Spissipes Section is better supported than that of the
Melanoconion Section. Currently the Spissipes Section includes 23 species separated into
2
eight groups and three subgroups [2]. Results of the phylogenetic analyses of the
concatenated three-gene matrix did not support the monophyly of morphologically similar
groups of the Spissipes Section included in the study, the Vomerifer Group and the Crybda
Group. However, it is plausible to hypothesize that the specimens identified as Cx. near
gnomatos and Cx. near portesi might belong to as-yet undescribed species that belong to
those two groups. There are undescribed Melanoconion species, including in the Spissipes
Section, that have been mentioned by Hutchings et al. [58] in the Amazon forest. Some of
them are morphologically like species of the Spissipes Section. Considering that the
classification into groups and subgroups depends primarily on features of the male genitalia,
the identification of specimen Cx. near portesi and Cx. near gnomatos was preliminary as it
was based on external morphology of field-collected females.
2. The authors appear to misunderstand the concept of monophyly. For example, they state
that the Spissipes Group is monophyletic despite the group being comprised of only one
species. A group cannot be shown to be monophyletic unless it is represented by two or more
species. This also applies to the Pereyrai Subgroup and the Distinguendus Group, each of
which is only comprises a single species.
Authors greatly appreciate this comment. We made substantial changes throughout the ms to
correct errors in definitions and interpretation of results of phylogenetic analyses including
the following:
Lines 201-205 clean manuscript - The ML tree (Figure 2), based on the available DNA
sequence data, supported the monophyly of the Spissipes (aLRT = 8.88) and Melanoconion
(aLRT = 28.19) sections within the subgenus Melanoconion with robust statistical support
(aLRT = 388.45). Specimens identified as Cx. spissipes and Cx. near spissipes clustered
together in a clade sister of remaining species of the Spissipes Section.
3. The authors state that the Crybda Group is monophyletic based on a clade composed of
crybda, pedroi and pereyrai, but pedroi is not listed in Table 1. This must refer to the sp. nr.
pedroi, which is listed separately from the other two species.
Authors greatly appreciate your comment. We made changes to correct the error. In the new
version we changed as follows:
3
Lines 208-211 in the clean manuscript- The monophyly of the Vomerifer Group and Crybda
Group were not confirmed because Cx. near portesi of the Vomerifer Group was found sister
of Cx. pereyrai of the Crybda Group, and one specimen of Cx. near gnomatos clustered into
a clade that includes Cx. near pedroi and Cx. crybda of the Crybda Group.
Lines 226-229 clean manuscript - Results of the Bayesian (Figure 4) and ML analyses
(Figure S1 of electronic supplemental information) employing the DNA sequences of only the
CAD nuclear gene were consistent in showing the Crybda Group of the Spissipes Section as a
polyphyletic lineage [(Cx. crybda + Cx. ribeirensis) + Cx. near gnomatos + Cx. near pedroi
+ (Cx. near portesi + Cx. pereyrai)].
4. The paragraph on page 15 that begins with “Other monophyletic clades…” is problematic.
It states that Cx. aliciae is grouped as sister to …”. What about the other two species of the
Conspirator Group included in the analyses? What does the recovered relationship say about
the group? This paragraph is confusing because the listed clades are comprised of species of
different groups with no indication of those groups. Why are the sp. nr. rabelloi and rabelloi
listed as members of different groups in Table 1? A logical assumption would be that these
exhibit morphological affinities which would place them in the same group. This applies to
other species listed in Table 1. For example, Cx. theobaldi is placed as sister to the Atratus
Group + Cx. clarki, but what about the sp. nr. Theobald?
Authors greatly appreciate the comment above. We changed the text as follows:
Lines 230-251 clean manuscript, page 10: Other monophyletic clades were recovered within
the Melanoconion Section in the ML tree tree (Figure 2), and their placement were consistent
with the groupings recovered in the bayesian tree (Figure 3) . For instance: 1) Cx. aliciae is
grouped as sister to (Cx. bastagarius + Cx. evansae) + (Cx. eknomios + Cx. vaxus) + Cx.
corentynensis. 2) a cluster comprised of (Cx. eastor, Cx. idottus and Cx. intrincatus), as a
sister to (Cx. near inhibitator, Cx. near rabelloi, Cx. oedipus, Cx. serratimarge and Cx.
rabelloi) (BPP = 0.86). Culex rabelloi of the Inhibitator Group was recovered outside the
clade composed of (Cx. near inhibitator, Cx. near rabelloi, Cx. oedipus, Cx. serratimarge) in
the ML tree (Figure 2), whereas in bayesian tree (Figure 3), Cx. rabelloi was clustered
together remaining species of the Inhibitator Group, corroborating the monophyly of the
group. 3) in both bayesian and ML topologies, Cx. aurenotatus and Cx. near aureonotatus
within the Melanoconion Section do not form a monophyletic group. Specimens preliminary
4
identified as Cx. near aureonotatus were recovered within the clade composed of Cx.
eknomios and Cx. vaxus, whereas Cx. aureonotatus GO1_108 and Cx. aureonotatus SP35_1
clustered together, however, in separate clade, depending on the phylogenetic approach
adopted. In the bayesian topology (Figure 3), Cx. aurenotatus was recovered as sister of a
major clade that includes species of the Conspirator, Bastagarius, Evansae, Educator,
Intrincatus and Inhibitator groups. In the ML topology (Figure 2), Cx. aureonotatus
GO1_108 and Cx. aureonotatus SP35_1 and Cx. rabelloi PA1_2 were recovered as sisters
(aLRT = 6.34), 4) within a clade that includes species of the Intrincatus and Inhibitator
groups. A few monophyletic clades were consistent in both, bayesian and ML topologies, with
Cx. misionensis sister to the Pilosus Group and the phylogenetic placement of Cx. theobaldi
and Cx. near theobaldi as sister to the Atratus Group, with a high bayesian posterior
probability.
5. The paragraph at the top of page 17 states that “meanwhile the phylogenetic relationships
with the Melanoconion Section are mainly dissimilar to what have been previously proposed
using morphological characters”. It is difficult to accept that the relationships are “mainly
dissimilar” based on the limited number of species include in the analyses, merely about 22%
of the species currently included in the Section.
Authors agreed with referee´s comment and made changes that we believe have improved the
manuscript. Thus, we changed:
Lines 252 – 257in clean manuscript: The phylogenetic relationships of the sampled species in
most of the informal groups currently recognized in the Melanoconion Section had a
clustering pattern different from the known classification based on morphology. In all the
recovered topologies, Cx. aliciae and Cx. dyius (representatives of Conspirator Group) were
recovered as branches of different clades. Similarly, Cx. clarki and Cx. aurenotatus
(representatives of Erraticus Group) were recovered as members of different clades.
Lines 295 – 358 in clean manuscript. The taxonomic status of the Spissipes Section is better
supported than that of the Melanoconion Section. Currently the Spissipes Section includes 23
species separated into eight groups and three subgroups [2]. Results of the phylogenetic
analyses of the concatenated three-gene matrix did not support the monophyly of
morphologically similar groups of the Spissipes Section included in the study, the Vomerifer
Group and the Crybda Group. However, it is plausible to hypothesize that the specimens
identified as Cx. near gnomatos and Cx. near portesi might belong to as-yet undescribed
5
species that belong to those two groups. There are undescribed Melanoconion species,
including form the Spissipes Section, that have been mentioned by Hutchings et al. [58] in the
Amazon forest. Some of them are morphologically similar to species of the Spissipes Section.
Considering that the classification into groups and subgroups depends primarily on features
of the male genitalia, the identification of specimen Cx. near portesi and Cx. near gnomatos
was preliminary as it was based on external morphology of field-collected females.
The taxonomic systematization of the Melanoconion Section is challenging. This section
encompasses 137 species, and the last revision based on morphology is that by Sirivanakarn
in 1983 [16]. Even though the relationships within the Melanoconion Section need further
investigation, our results clearly support the monophyly of the section. For the Melanoconion
Section we included representatives of ten groups: Distinguendus Group, Conspirator Group,
Atratus Group, Educator Group, Bastagarius Group, Intrincatus Group, Inhibitator Group,
Erraticus Group, Evansae Group and Pilosus Group (Table 1). We found support for
monophyly of the Atratus Group and Pilosus Group. All other groups included in the study
were found to be either polyphyletic or paraphyletic. The ML and Bayesian statistical support
for the monophyly of the Pilosus and Atratus groups is strong and consistent independent of
the method of analysis that was adopted, and the data set employed for the analyses. The
results of this study open a discussion regarding biological systematization of the
Melanoconion Section, though do not give conclusive answers as the taxonomic
representation of the diversity of the taxon-rich Melanoconion section species was limited.
Moreover, results of the phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that the current hypothesis of
classification of the Spissipes and Melanoconion Sections demands rearrangement to reflect
the monophyletic groups within each section. The ML and Bayesian topologies based on the
three concatenated genes recovered monophyletic groups and thus any future change should
be based on these findings. According to the current classification, the Intrincatus Group
consists of 25 species arranged into six subgroups. In the current study, four species were
included (five species in the CAD only topology), which clustered into two monophyletic
groups. The support for (Cx. eastor, Cx. idottus and Cx. intrincatus) is high (aLRT = 69.28
and BPP = 1), indicating a smaller group of closely related species. Other species of the
Intrincatus Group (Cx. misionensis and Cx. equinoxialis - the latter in the CAD only
topology) did not cluster together to support the monophyly of the group. It is important to
conduct further studies with a better taxon sampling and other high-resolution molecular
sequence data to resolve the phylogenetic relationships of species of the Spissipes and
Melanoconion sections.
6
Several non-monophyletic groups were evident in our phylogenetic inference, such as:
Vomerifer, Crybda, Conspirator, Erraticus, Educator, Inhibitator and Bastagarius Groups.
All these groups need a further investigation with a greater representation of the taxonomic
diversity within the group. As has been documented for other insect groups [34,59],
combining morphological and molecular data may solve problematic relationships as the
ones we found for the Melanoconion Section. Despite the existence of an illustrated catalog
of the species of the subgenus Melanoconion [1], and keys to the non-formal categories
included in this Section [16], the challenge of reaching an accurate identification of the
species is as current as it was in 1950 when Rozeboom and Komp [60] published the first
revision on the subgenus. Some of the illustrations contained in the catalog by Pecor et al.
[1] are poorly descriptive and might prevent a correct identification of some of the species.
The lack of a taxonomical revision of the Melanoconion Section creates a huge gap that
should be overcome in future investigations.
The ML and BA analyses of the multi-loci data set were highly informative and consistent in
showing the monophyly for both sections of the subgenus and recovering most of the
groupings currently known for Spissipes Section. Moreover, our findings coupled with
additional studies should lead an improved classification of the Melanoconion Section, as we
recovered some monophyletic groups and determined which groups need further studies. We
presented here the most inclusive molecular phylogeny of the subgenus Melanoconion with
evidence to support both sections as natural groups within the subgenus.
6. The statement at the bottom of page 17 that “the Melanoconion Section demands a
rearrangement” is overstated and unjustifiable. The data are too limited and preliminary to make
changes to the current classification. The authors have misconstrued the classification of the
Intrincatus Group. As presented, the authors give the impression that the group is monophyletic
based on the pairing of eastor, idottus and intrincatus, and therefore misionensis and
equinoxialis, which are not united with those three species, should be removed from the group.
The authors fail to consider or mention that the five species belong to different subgroups of the
Intrincatus Group – misionensis and equinoxialis are members of the Intrincatus Subgroup,
which includes intrincatus; eastor is the sole member of the Eastor Subgroup and idottus is one
of five species of the Idottus Subgroup. Removing two species from the Intrincatus Subgroup
while retaining a third one and considering it and species from two other subgroups to represent
7
the Intrincatus Group is illogical and reflects poorly on the rationality of the authors. By the
way, according to Table 1, equinoxialis was not included in the study.
Authors greatly appreciate the comment above and made changes in the text to be more
precise and clear for potential readers. We changed the text as follows:
Lines 321 – 333 in the clean manuscript: Moreover, results of the phylogenetic analyses
demonstrate that the current hypothesis of classification of the Spissipes and Melanoconion
Sections demands rearrangement to reflect the monophyletic groups within each section. The
ML and Bayesian topologies based on the three concatenated genes recovered monophyletic
groups and thus any future change should be based on these findings. According to the
current classification, the Intrincatus Group consists of 25 species arranged into six
subgroups. In the current study, four species were included (five species in the CAD only
topology), which clustered into two monophyletic groups. The support for (Cx. eastor, Cx.
idottus and Cx. intrincatus) is high (aLRT = 69.28 and BPP = 1), indicating a smaller group
of closely related species. Other species of the Intrincatus Group (Cx. misionensis and Cx.
equinoxialis - the latter in the CAD only topology) did not cluster together to support the
monophyly of the group. It is important to conduct further studies with a better taxon
sampling and other high-resolution molecular sequence data to resolve the phylogenetic
relationships of species of the Spissipes and Melanoconion sections.
Regarding Cx. equinoxialis, we clarify that the species is not included in Table 1 because the
sequences obtained for this species correspond to the COI gene. Table 1 shows the new
sequences generated for the study, that had a complete collection of the three genes used for
the analyses. However, all the species included in the molecular procedures are listed in
Table S1 in electronic supplemental information.
7. The sentence at the bottom of page 18 makes one wonder if the authors are fully versed
with taxonomic principles. The sentence states “Among the challenges, it is clear that some
species currently assigned as senior synonyms are in fact valid.” All senior synonyms are
names of currently valid species, so what possibly can this sentence mean?
Authors must apologize for our errors and for not being clear in the text. We greatly
appreciate your comments.
We made substantial changes in the text. In this new version R2 we changed as follows:
8
Lines 295 - 303 in clean manuscript: The taxonomic status of the Spissipes Section is better
supported than that of the Melanoconion Section. Currently the Spissipes Section includes 23
species separated into eight groups and three subgroups [2]. Results of the phylogenetic
analyses of the concatenated three-gene matrix did not support the monophyly of
morphologically similar groups of the Spissipes Section included in the study, the Vomerifer
Group and the Crybda Group. However, it is plausible to hypothesize that the specimens
identified as Cx. near gnomatos and Cx. near portesi might belong to as-yet undescribed
species that belong to those two groups. There are undescribed Melanoconion species, that
have been mentioned by Hutchings et al. [58] in the Amazon forest. Some of them are
morphologically similar to species of the Spissipes Section.
8. Some wording on page 19 is disturbing. For example, “our findings will lead [to] an
improved classification” and “first comprehensive molecular phylogeny” are absurd. From
item 6 above, weak support for some clades and limited taxon sampling, changes to the
current classification are not justifiable and certainly do not provide for an improved
classification. Seriously, how can the results of the study be considered to provide a
“comprehensive molecular phylogeny”?
Authors must apologize again for being imprecise. However, we respectfully disagree about
some of the strongest criticism. This is the first study focusing on phylogenetic relationships
within Culex (Melanoconion). All other studies included a smaller taxon sampling because
the major focus was not on phylogeny of Culex (Melanoconion) – we point out that previous
work in this group has only included 2 – 9 species of Melanoconion. No phylogenetic study is
exhaustive, and yet this does not make such studies minor or not important. Ideally a
phylogenetic study should include all known species of the group in focus, and individuals of
all possible population and subpopulations of a species and all the genome information. Of
course, this ideal sampling is impossible and would stop the advancement of the taxonomical
knowledge of the group. Therefore, most studies use a certain number of specimens that are
representative of the diversity of a taxa. It is far from ideal, but the statistical analyses
employed in phylogenetic studies are robust, and a taxonomist can use results to make
inferences and propose phylogenetic hypothesis that can be corroborated or rejected in
further investigations. The taxon sampling employed in the study encompasses 43 species of
Culex (Melanoconion) that represents 27% of valid species.
9
For precision and clarity authors changed the statement as follows:
Lines 317-320 in the clean manuscript: The results of this study open a discussion regarding
biological systematization of the Melanoconion Section, though do not give conclusive
answers as the taxonomic representation of the diversity of the taxon-rich Melanoconion
section species was limited.
Lines 361-375 in the clean manuscript: Our phylogenetic studies found robust support for the
two major sections of subgenus Melanoconion, the Spissipes Section and the Melanoconion
Section. The Vomerifer and the Crybda Groups of the Spissipes Section are not monophyletic
lineages. Consequently, further investigations are required because the specimens of Cx.
near gnomatos and Cx near portesi were field-collected females that may be misidentified
due to constraints in identifying adult females in this group. It will be of fundamental
importance to have male and female specimens linked to larva and pupa for an accurate
identification and to expand the currently available keys for this group. Based on the current
classification of the subgenus Melanoconion a few groups and subgroups were recovered as
non-monophyletic lineages, highlighting the need for further investigations using other genes
and a more representative taxon sampling of all groups and subgroups current included in
the subgenus. Our data showed that CAD gene can be considered a valuable marker for
phylogenetic inference within Culex (Melanoconion), and likely other Culex subgenera. The
phylogenetic inference based on two nuclear genes and one mitochondrial gene was
informative and the DNA sequences generated by this study will facilitate future
classification of the species of the subgenus Melanoconion.
9. Table 1 is confusing and misleading. First of all, the names of the sections should only be
listed once, not repeated for each group and subgroup. Likewise, each group and subgroup
should only be listed once. The table would be less cluttered and visually easier to deal with.
That aside, there are some problems with the listing of species. Why are aureonotatus and sp.
nr. aureonotatus listed as members of different groups? Why is the sp. nr. pedroi not listed as
a member of the Pedroi Subgroup along with crybda? The same question pertains to
intrincatus and misionensis; spissipes/Culex near spissipes; and Culex near vomerifer and
Culex near portesi, which are separated from three species of the Vomerifer Group. The table
seems to more closely reflect the results of the study rather than the established classification
of the subgenus.
10
Authors greatly appreciate the comment #9 regarding Table 1. To improve it we changed its
format to clarify to potential readers the species the subgenus Melanoconion of Culex that
have been used in the study and their current classification. The complete list of species,
including those in the outgroup are in Table S1. We also improved Table S1, including Culex
quinquefasciatus information. We must apologize for not including the GB code of a few
sequences that will be deposit in GB as soon as possible.
Table 1. List of specimens of the subgenus Melanoconion of the genus Culex included in the
study, taxonomic classification, number of specimen used in the analysis, and specimen
identification code.
10. Tables 2 and 3 could be provided as supplementary information.
Authors agreed with R#1 and provided Tables 2 and 3 as supplemental information. Table 4
was excluded from the manuscript.
Response to comments inside the text - presumably from Reviewer #1
Authors carefully checked the comments annotated in the manuscript. We already responded
all of them in our responses to comments #1-#10. Thus, to avoid being repetitive, we
respectfully clarify that our responses for comments annotated inside the manuscript are in
the previous paragraphs.

Responses for Reviewer #2
Authors greatly appreciate the evaluation by R#2. To improve that manuscript authors
accepted all suggestion and corrected errors in English.
1. Can you address morphological apomorphies used to separate the two sections?
Authors added in the manuscript morphological apomorphies used to separate the two
sections. They are as follows:
Lines 276 - 290 in the clean manuscript: The Spissipes and Melanoconion sections can
be recognized by morphological features of the male genitalia using the available
illustrations in [1], female, fourth instar larva and pupa based on identification keys
proposed by Sirivanakarn [16]. These characters and character states may represent
synapomorphies for each section; however, they need to be tested in further
phylogenetic analyses of the whole group, including other Culex subgenera. According
to Sallum and Forattini [2] and Sirivanakarn [16] species of the Spissipes Section can
be distinguished from those of the Melanoconion Section based on the shape and
distribution of decumbent, narrow and broad scales on both male and female vertex and
occiput, and the shape of the aedeagal sclerite and its connection to the lateral plate in
the male genitalia (narrow and curved in the Melanoconion Section and broad and
curved in the Spissipes Section, in lateral view). Based on the fourth instar larva, both
sections can be distinguished by the shape of the siphon, siphonal index and distribution
of the 1S setae as well, whereas in the pupa, the 8-VIII seta arises from the angle of the
VIII segment in the Spissipes Section, but it is displaced anteroventrally in species of the
Melanoconion Section. Results of the current phylogenetic analyses provided robust
support for the monophyly of both the Spissipes and Melanoconion sections.
2. Did you do analyses using amino acids?
Authors did not use the amino acid sequences in the analyses because the number of
variable characters was low. We translated the DNA sequences into amino acid
sequences and aligned them to careful check for potential errors and to orientate the
alignment of DNA sequences.
12
In lines 147-163 in the clean manuscript, in the materials and methods, we added the
following: Sequences were manually edited using Geneious version R 9.0 (Biomatters
Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand) and Mesquite v3.2 [47]. Primer sequence regions were
removed from all sequences. The chromatograms of each DNA sequence were
visualized to verify which sequences were optimal and which needed to be re-processed,
and BLASTed (using megablast, blastn, and blastx) to sequences in NCBI's NR
database and to the Culex quinquefasciatus reference genome to confirm homology
[48]. Polymorphic sites in the single copy nuclear genes were coded as ambiguous
sites. Sequence alignments were done for both nucleotides and amino acids for each of
the three gene data sets. All alignments were made using Clustal W, implemented in
Geneious version R 9.0 (default parameters), and adjusted manually to remove
alignment artifacts.
The data set was further explored following four steps: 1) best-fitting model of
nucleotide substitution and frequencies was determined using jModeltest version 2
(considering the Akaike Information Criterion, AIC) [49]; 2) distance matrices, number
of variable sites, conserved sites and parsimony informative sites were determined
using MEGA v. 6.0.6 [50]; 3) likelihood mapping analysis was implemented with TREE
PUZZLE to address the phylogenetic content of each data set as described in Strimmer
and von Haeseler [51], and 4) DNA sequences were translated to amino acid sequences
to verify their identity (expected protein according to the target gene) and to verify
coding sequences and absence of stop codons.
3. Please define / explain or give reference (comment attached to a paragraph providing
description of the molecular markers utilized in the study: hunchback gene)
Authors added the following information with citations of previous papers that have
used the HB gene in phylogeny:
Lines 112-118. Previous phylogenetic studies addressing different groups of insects
have used CAD gene [26, 27, 28]. HuncHBack (HB) is a gap gene [41] that is involved
in anterior-posterior polarity determination in embryos [42, 43]. It encodes a C2H2
zinc finger transcription factor whose primary function is to regulate the expression of
other genes involved in the embryo development.
13
4. What is your rationale for choosing the outgroup species?
We added the following information:
Lines 91 – 94 in the clean manuscript: The outgroup was composed of one specimen of
Culex (Culex) quinquefasciatus and two specimens of Culex (Culex) mollis. The
selection of Culex (Culex) species as outgroup taxa was based on the hypothesis of a
close phylogenetic relationship shared by the subgenera Culex and Melanoconion [18].
5. "The HB dataset consisted only of forward strands with variable size (470 - 540 bp),
as all the different approaches attempted to obtain the R strand for hunchback failed"
...... Explain in methods.
In the manuscript authors stated the following:
Lines 134 – 136 in the clean manuscript: For HB we performed several strategies that
involved three different sets of primers; thus, when the M13 tailed primers were used
for PCR reactions, the sequencing for HB used only the M13 primes (Table S2).
Lines 192 – 194 in the clean manuscript: The HB gene sequence alignment consisted of
the forward strands only because all different approaches adopted to obtain the R
strand failed. The HB DNA sequences ranged from 470 to 540 bp in length, unreliable
regions were masked, leaving 483 bp in the final alignment.
6. I'm not familiar with this method. Please consider if it would be helpful to others to
explain what it all means
Authors added the following information in the manuscript:
Lines 159 – 161 in the clean manuscript: 3) A maximum likelihood graphical mapping
method implemented in TREE PUZZLE was used to address the phylogenetic content of
each set of aligned sequences as described in Strimmer and von Haeseler [51].
Lines 195 –200, in the clean manuscript: Results of a likelihood mapping analysis are
shown in Figure 1. The triangles include different quarters showing the partly resolved,
unresolved and fully resolved quarters for each data set separate. Fully resolved
14
quarters, indicated by the regions 1, 2 and 3, correspond to moderately high
percentages for all three single-gene alignments (COI: 95.9%, CAD: 69.7%, and HB:
71.7%), showing that there is good phylogenetic signal in the data. The partly resolved
quarters and unresolved quarters were low for all datasets.
7. A summary of the informal groups would be very helpful in the introduction.
We greatly appreciate R#2 suggestion and included the information in Table 1.
8. Explicit labeling on one of the trees would be helpful, or a new composite tree, which
would be easier to read
Authors improved the trees by using colors in trees to highlight the clades recovered in
the analyses and stated in the discussion.
9. What is meant here? Their catalog republished illustrations from the literature. The
literature is inadequate?
Authors are in debt to referee #2 for the comment, and we must apologize for our bad
error regarding Pecor´s et al (1992) catalog, and Rozeboom and Komp´s (1950)
article. The taxonomic and biological importance of both publications is
unquestionable.
We changed the text as follows:
Lines 342 – 351 in the clean manuscript: In 1950, Rozeboom and Komp [60] published
the first revision on the subgenus and provided an identification key that greatly
improved the knowledge about the subgenus and helped entomologists to define new
species. More recently, Pecor et al. [1] published a catalog with hundreds of
illustrations of male genitalia and taxonomic information of each Melanoconion
species. It is noteworthy that in the catalog, authors provided illustrations of the senior
and junior synonymous in addition to those of the same species, however, from distinct
geographical localities. Unfortunately, the lack of a taxonomical revision of the
15
Melanoconion Section that includes detailed description and identification keys for all
life stages creates a huge gap that should be overcome in future investigations.
Comments regarding the second evaluation round
Reviewer #1
Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_13
1) An initial examination of the reply to the reviewers’ comments and changes to the
manuscript is baffling and confusing. I am willing to critically review the manuscript
again, but only if the enormous number of changes are integrated to facilitate careful
analysis.
Authors deeply apologize for not correcting and showing the corrections in the R1
version of the manuscript. As you will see we made substantial changes in the current
R2 version of the manuscript in order to accomplish suggestions made by R#1 in the
first and second revision round. They are highlighted in the new R2 version. We also
provided a not marked R2 version of the same manuscript. We greatly appreciate the
time and effort of the R#2 on both evaluation processes. We believe that the manuscript
has been improved.
All of the reviewers should be conscientiously addressed. I note in particular some of
my comments seem to have misunderstood and/or slapdash responses have been given
for some concerns. For example, it is said that Table 1 is “part of the methodology of
the manuscript”, yet it lacks one of the species, which is accounted for by reference to
“supplementary data 1”. All species analysed in the study should be listed in the table
as part of the material examined.
Authors apologize for not taking into consideration all suggestions and comments, and
for having a defensive attitude. In the R2 version we believe that we considered all
suggestions carefully made by R#1.
16
Furthermore, the classification of the species listed in Table 1 should serve as the basis
for comparing the results and substantiating the statement that “meanwhile the
phylogenetic relationships with the Melanoconion Section are mainly dissimilar to what
have been previously proposed”. How are readers to assess this dissimilarity?
Authors have changed Table 1, we believe that it looks better and more clear. We also
provided a supplemental table Table S1 in which we added all species used in the study,
including the GeneBank accession codes.
If it is firmly believed that the current classification (that in Table 1) should be
modified, then a table listing the new classification should be noted in the Discussion
and included (as supplementary data?) for future use and point of reference.
Authors did not propose a new classification for the subgenus, because we agreed that
new investigations will be necessary to provide a robust, strongly supported
phylogenetic hypothesis. We hope we can continue the study in the future.
The reply to comment 7 concerning the Introduction, states ‘We included the recent
work in which such summary has been provided (Torres-Gutierrez and Sallum, 2015).
The text is cited: "Each one of these sections is further divided into groups and
subgroups [17, i.e. Harbach, 2011]."’ The problem here is that there is no reference in
the Material and methods or in the legend to Table 1 to indicate the source of the
internal classification used in Table, which should be the existing classification, not the
one suggested by the results of the study. The classification in the table should be either
that of Harbach (2011) or Torres-Gutierrez and Sallum (2015), and not based on the
results of the study.
Authors appreciate the suggestion and provided a reference concerning the
classification used in Table 1.
Table 1. List of specimens of the subgenus Melanoconion of the genus Culex included in
the study, taxonomic classification, number of specimen used in the analysis, and
specimen identification code according to Harbach (2011).
17
It is difficult to critically comment on the manuscript when it is cluttered with numerous
tracked changes.
Authors included a new non-marked (clean) version of the manuscript, a marked
version and a list of changes in the response letter. We believe that in doing this, the
manuscript is better readable.
Reviewer: 2
Responses to R#2/second revision
Authors greatly appreciate the comments and suggestion made by R#2. We also
apologize for our errors and for not being clear in several parts of the first and second
versions of the manuscript. In the current R2 version, we considered all suggestions
made by R#1 and R#2.
Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_14
The manuscript is a significant contribution to the field, and the results are clear and
easy to understand. I found only a few very minor issues to consider.
1) Introduction, line 21 could read "to a wide spectrum of vertebrates that includes
humans."
Authors rewrote the introduction as follows:
Lines 47-75 in the clean manuscript: The subgenus Melanoconion is one of 26
subgenera of Culex. The majority of the species occur in the Neotropical Region [1, 2],
in different ecological regions, which vary from conserved and pristine forests to highly
modified, anthropic environments [2, 4, 5, 6]. As blood feeders, Melanoconion species
display a wide variety of hosts (birds, mammals, including rodents, reptiles), with many
species competent to transmit viral pathogens to a wide spectrum of vertebrates that
include humans. Several studies have documented species of the subgenus as potential
and effective vectors of Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis complex (including Venezuelan
Equine Encephalitis virus, Everglades virus, Mucambo virus), West Nile virus and
Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].
18
The subgenus Melanoconion includes 160 species [15], which are separated into two
major sections: Melanoconion and Spissipes [16]. Each section is further divided into
several groups and subgroups [17]. Sallum and Forattini [2] reviewed the Spissipes
Section, and provided morphological identification keys to species, and information on
bionomics, medical importance, and geographical distribution of all species included in
the section. Unlike Spissipes Section, there is not a recent taxonomic revision for
species included in the Melanoconion Section, and the available literature has made
little progress in studying the phylogenetic relationships of subgenus Melanoconion
[17]. A few contributions to the study of the phylogeny of the subgenera of Culex, are
studies by Miller et al. [18], Navarro and Liria [19], Navarro and Weaver [20],
Vesgueiro et al. [21] and Demari-Silva et al. [22]; all of them argue in favor of the
monophyly of Melanoconion, however their conclusions are based on a very small
number of species (ranging from 2 to 9) distributed throughout the subgenus
Melanoconion.
The search for appropriate molecular markers to infer phylogenetic relationships is an
important step of any study [23]. Previous phylogenetic analyses have recommended
nuclear single-copy genes [24, 25, 26]. Among eight nuclear genes explored for
different invertebrate taxa, CAD (also called rudimentary) has been referred to as one
of the most informative and easy to amplify genes [26,27,28]. Studies using nuclear
genes in mosquito species have been used mainly on Anopheles species [29, 30, 31, 32].
Studies by Besansky and Fahey [33], and more recently by Reidenback et al. [34] have
used protein coding nuclear genes, including HuncHBack (HB) and CAD, to solve
phylogenetic questions about different groups of Culicidae.
2) Page 7. The statement: "Specimens of species obtained for COI and CAD genes only
surpassed the number of sequences with a three-gene collection and are listed in the
supplementary data 1." still isn't clear to me.
Authors made sure to introduce the detailed content of the experimental datasets in the
Supplementary table S1, in which a complete list of species is presented, informing as
well the number of molecular markers that were obtained (e.g. which of the three genes
were employed for the analyses). As the text explains, in lines 192-194 (The HB gene
sequence alignment consisted of the forward strands only because all different
19
approaches adopted to obtain the R strand failed). The HB gene was challenging during
the experimental procedures (amplification and sequencing); which resulted in a
dataset of 97 HB sequences. On the contrary, for the COI and CAD datasets, the
authors obtained 120 and 112 sequences respectively (the inventory of species vs. genes
is given in Table S1).
3) Page 16, line 38, change "for each sections" to "for each section".
Please note that the number of lines in the text have changed given that a sound
revision was done to the manuscript. During this major revision, language has been
improved in all sections of the paper and the correct phrase "for each section" was
applied.
4) Page 17, new text, please write out numbers (1-9).
After the major revision of the text, this issue has been corrected.
Appendix C
Responses to Referee #1
1. The summary is excessively long and includes information that is irrelevant to the purpose
and results of the study. It is not necessary to repeat the name of the subgenus after first
mention as it is understood to be the subject of the study. This applies to the text of the paper
as well.
Authors: The summary has been rewritten according to R#1. The new version can be seen in
the revised manuscript.
2. The methods of investigation, contrary to what is usually accepted, are not methods for
resolving phylogenetic relationships. They merely assess the degree of relatedness based on
the constitution of nucleotide sequences. For this reason, the words “phylogenetic”,
“monophyly|”, etc. have been stuck out or replaced in the PDF. The emphasis of the
manuscript is on assessing the integrity of groups recognized on the basis of shared
morphological traits, i.e. does shared DNA sequence data support or cast doubt on the
morphology-based groups? This reviewer recommends revision of the results and discussion
sections to indicate this, with removal of some redundancy regarding the Vomerifer and Crybda
groups.
Authors: We respectfully disagree with R#1. Phenetic methods using sequence data are those
based purely on percentage of similarity or distances. It is clear in the manuscript we used ML
and Bayesian approaches in phylogeny. There is a single paper that we are aware of (Borkent
Zootaxa 2018, cited by reviewer in a manuscript comment) that makes this claim along with the
reviewer, but the author of that paper does not support this claim in any way. In general usage,
phenetic methods include algorithms such as neighbor joining, that specifically use distance
measures alone (measures of similarity) to assess relatedness. Bayesian inference and
Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses infer relationships based not only on sequence
similarity, but also models of evolutionary change. Indeed, the ‘standard’ of phylogenetic
inference is currently based upon sequence data.
The redundancy concerning the Vomerifer and Crybda group has been corrected.
3. The choice of outgroup based on reference 18, published 22 years ago, is not justifiable.
Phylogenetic principle stresses that outgroup taxa should be as closely related as possible to
the ingroup taxa. The study of Harbach et al. (2012) supports a closer relation of Melanoconion
with other Neotropical subgenera. It appears that the actual justification for the choice of
outgroup is the availability of data for the chosen taxa. Some clarification is needed.
Authors: we have clarified in the manuscript as follows: (Lines 90 – 94 in clean manuscript) The
outgroup was composed of one specimen of Culex (Culex) quinquefasciatus and two specimens
of Culex (Culex) mollis. The selection of Culex (Culex) species as outgroup taxa was based on the
availability of specimens and because the lineage that contains species of the Melanoconion is
sister of the lineage that includes Cx. pipiens among other species of the Pipiens Group [23].
4. The inferences about the integrity of the Vomerifer and Crybda groups is based on irrational
reasoning, i.e. they are judged to be unnatural groups because females that by admission
cannot be reliably identified to species, and were identified as species “near” to recognized
species but not classified in the groups with those apparently related species, were not united
with those species in the map of relationships. By virtue of not being considered members of
the groups, the assumption that the groups are not natural assemblages is not justifiable. See
comment 7.
Authors: The manuscript is based on the available sample and analyses conducted with the
specimens at hand. The text is informing that after two different analyses (Bayesian and
Maximum likelihood), some groups were recovered and not others. We believe that the
limitations of the study in terms of number of species and groups included in the sample, has
been clearly stated.
5. One wonders if relationships recovered in the study of Navarro and Weaver (2004) are
relevant to the results and discussion sections. The paper is mentioned without revealing
whether the results of the reported study support or refute the integrity of the Vomerifer and
Crybda groups. And what is the relevance of the “molecular data of other Melanoconion
species” to the results and discussion?
Authors: The text has been corrected to inform the reader on the results obtained by Navarro
and Weaver (2004), based on a ribosomal gene. In lines 267 – 272 of the clean manuscript, the
readers will find: “Phylogenetic relationships within the Vomerifer and Pedroi Groups of the
Spissipes Section have been demonstrated to be monophyletic sister groups using the internal
transcribed spacer (ITS2) of ribosomal RNA gene. Cx. adamesi, Cx. ribeirensis and Cx. pedroi
clustered together, indicating the monophyly of the Crybda Group. In addition, the monophyly
of the Vomerifer Group has been corroborated, and the presence of two divergent branches
suggests that the name Cx. pedroi can include two species”.
6. The paper essentially ignores the potential of morphology for resolving relationships, with an
underlying assumption that this can only be achieved with molecular studies. Why cite only
molecular studies, most of which were severely taxon limited. What about the larger study of
Harbach et al. (2012, Zoologica Scripta) based on morphology, which, among other subgenera,
included three species of Melanoconion? Those species indicated a paraphyletic relationship
between the Spissipes and Melanoconion sections. Are there other morphological studies that
should be mentioned or discussed?
Authors: This research has been motivated by the challenges encountered when studying
morphological characters. We are presenting a study based on molecular data, as a useful
complement to the morphology-based information known to date. Given that our sample
included a collection of three genes, the text has a clear focus on these findings. However,
following the reviewers’ suggestions, in a previous revision, our manuscript has included the
main taxonomical characters when studying the morphological features of subgenus
Melanoconion. Please refer to Discussion, lines 280 – 292, in the clean manuscript, with the
morphological characters described.
7. Logically, specimens of doubtful or questionable identification should not have been included
in the study, i.e. those species identified as “near” other species, especially adult females
whose identification is problematic. Readers are likely to wonder what results would be
obtained if only positively identified "good" species of known group placement were included.
For this reason, this reviewer strongly recommends that the analyses be run again without the
specimens identified as "near" species. Doing so is likely to produce results that could be
discussed more rationally.
Authors: We think that it is especially important to include these individuals in the analysis and
as well in the discussion portion of the manuscript. One of the main conclusions in this paper is
that the phylogenetic groupings that have been historically considered and are in the available
morphology-based keys are not consistent with the current molecular-data-based phylogenetic
groupings. One primary reason this may be the case is the inadequacy of the morphology-based
keys. Therefore, it is imperative that they be included.
Females are the most commonly collected individuals during field work and in fact their
problematic taxonomical status was one of the factor motivating for molecular analyses, in
order to find additional information that could improve the existing tools to identify female
specimens.
Detailed responses to comments added in the text:
The reviewer offers many comments and suggestions to improve the written work. Most of
these comments have been addressed and they have helped to clarify the manuscript.
R#1 - As noted below, the methods used in the study are phenetic methods, not phylogenetic
methods.
Authors: We respectfully disagree with R#1. Phenetic methods using sequence data are those
based purely on percentage of similarity or distances. It is clear in the manuscript we used ML
and Bayesian approaches in phylogeny. There is a single paper that we are aware of (Borkent
Zootaxa 2018, cited by reviewer in a manuscript comment) that makes this claim along with the
reviewer, but the author of that paper does not support this claim in any way. In general usage,
phenetic methods include algorithms such as neighbor joining, that specifically use distance
measures alone (measures of similarity) to assess relatedness. Bayesian inference and
Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses infer relationships based not only on sequence
similarity, but also models of evolutionary change. Indeed, the ‘standard’ of phylogenetic
inference is currently based upon sequence data.
R#1 - Why cite only molecular studies, most of which were severely taxon limited. What about
the larger study of Harbach et al. (2012, Zoologica Scripta) based on morphology, which, among
other subgenera, included three species of Melanoconion?
Authors: We apologize for not including the citation in previous version. We included Harbach
et al. (2012) in the current version R3. It is reference no. 23.
R#1 - See later comments. No natural groups are "proposed" in the paper, only speculation.
Authors: We respectfully disagree with R#1 because results of both ML and BA analyses
corroborate the monophyly of some groups, including both Melanoconion and Spissipes
sections. We decided to keep as hypothesis based on our results, not speculation. We believe
that this comment also reflects the lack of respect on the part of the reviewer for sequence-
based analyses, suggesting that the organismal groupings we find are not truly phylogenetic
groups.
R#1 - As mentioned in different places, Bayesian analysis is a phenetic method of comparison,
not a phylogenetic method that uncovered synapomorphies, i.e. shared derived characters.
Authors:
We strongly disagree with R#1 on this statement that Bayesian methods is a phenetic method
of comparison in phylogeny. In the early days of sequence analysis researchers used primarily
phenetic methods (neighbor-joining algorithms for instance), due to the extreme
computational demands required for phylogenetic methods that include maximum likelihood
and Bayesian analysis. Now that the computational demands are no longer limiting, these
computationally intensive methods have become standard, replacing the phenetic methods.
In summary, Bayesian and likelihood approaches in phylogenetics are the current standard used
to establish phylogenetic relationships in biological systems. The methods are well defined,
powerful, utilize evolutionary models in the analysis, and allow one to construct phylogenetic
trees that are hypotheses of relationships among the group focused in the study. MrBayes, the
standard software for Bayesian phylogenetic analyses, has been cited more than 21,000 times
(Google Scholar) and PhyML, the standard software for maximum likelihood phylogenetic
analysis has been cited more than 6400 times (Google Scholar) to date.
In the analyses conducted in the Melanoconion study, we employed Bayesian and Maximum
Likelihood methods to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among species and groups of
species. The analytical procedure is summarized in the materials and methods section and
clearly shows how the analyses were done employing appropriate evolutionary models.
The reviewer has some disagreements on how we have named several of our samples as a
‘near’ species. This is done in cases where we can get close to an identification based on
current taxonomic identification (morphology-based) but cannot be absolutely sure for one
reason or another (for example most keys are based on male genitalia and the individual
specimen is a female for which keys are less available).
We think that it is especially important to include these individuals in the analysis and as well in
the discussion portion of the manuscript. One of the main conclusions in this paper is that the
phylogenetic groupings that have been historically considered and are in the available
morphology-based keys are not consistent with the current molecular-data-based phylogenetic
groupings. One primary reason this may be the case is the inadequacy of the morphology-based
keys. Therefore, it is imperative that they be included.
A second concern in this category is with our choice of outgroup. We have updated the
manuscript to better support our choice of outgroup.
R#1 because they would cause misunderstanding and confusion in the article. The use of
“natural groups” as he suggested means that it is not phenetic group, but a group with a
common ancestor.
R#1 - But this species is not listed as a species of the Vomerifer Group in Table 1. Why is it
assumed to be a member of that group? This casts doubt on the identification of specimens and
interpretation of the results.
Authors: All specimens used in the study have been identified initially based on morphology.
Then the specimiens were identified by both ML and Bayesian methods in phylogenetic
analysis. The morphological identification showed that the specimen was similar to a species of
a specific group. i.e., Vomerifer. After the analyses, the sequence generated for the specific
mosquito clustered in a different group. Because of this, in table 1 the specimens identified as
“near” have been separated. In accordance to R#1 suggestion, authors changed table 1 keeping
all specimens identified as “near” in the group in which the formal species has been included.
R#1 – (1) This should be written as "Cx. species near portesi" or as "Cx. sp. nr. portesis". This
should also be done in Table 1.
(2) This should more specifically be the "Pedroi Subgroup of the Crybda Group". The species
identified as "Cx. near pedroi" should be included with Cx. crybda in Table 1.
(3) This species is not listed as a member of the Crybda Group in Table 1. Why is its placement
in the classification assumed to be "Uncertain"? It would logically be listed with Cx. crybda.
(4) This statement is irrational. Neither of the two specimens is assigned to the groups in Table
2, and the results merely suggest that they should have been placed in those groups. The claim
that they do "not support the monophyly" of the groups cannot be construed from their
"uncertain" classification.
(5) But this would also be true if the two species mention in line 222 had be (logically) placed in
the respective groups rather than listed as "uncertain" placement. It is the custom of
taxonomists to regard species as being identified as "near" to a recognized species to be
included in the group with that species based on morphological similarity. What other
connotation can the word "near" have?
(6) Why would they be expected to form a monophyletic group when they are not listed as
members of a specific group. Because the latter is listed as having "uncertain" placement, it is
illogical to assume that they should form a monophyletic group when there is no evidence from
Table 1 that this should be so.
Authors: As kindly suggested by R#1, authors corrected the species classification in informal
groups throughout the text and tables. We kept the morphological classification of the species
as proposed by Sirivanakarn (1983) [16], with modification by Sallum and Forattini (1996) in
table 1.
R#1 - The choice of outgroup based on reference 18, published 22 years ago, is not justifiable.
Phylogenetic principle stresses that outgroup taxa should be as closely related as possible to
the ingroup taxa. The study of Harbach et al. (2012) supports a closer relation with other
Neotropical subgenera. It appears that the actual justification for the choice of outgroup is the
availability of data for the chosen taxa. Some clarification is needed here.
Authors: we have clarified in the manuscript as follows (Lines 90 - 94 in clean manuscript):
The outgroup was composed of one specimen of Culex (Culex) quinquefasciatus and two
specimens of Culex (Culex) mollis. The selection of Culex (Culex) species as outgroup taxa was
based on the availability of specimens and because the lineage that contains species of the
Melanoconion is sister of the lineage that includes Cx. pipiens among other species of the
Pipiens Group [23].
R#1 - There is a problem with attributing the classification in the table to Harbach (2011) as the
species considered as having "uncertain" placement are not included in that classification.
Authors: The uncertain status has been changed with the group to which the nearest species.
For instance, Cx. species near portesi has been included in the Vomerifer Group.
R#1 - This article should be a numbered reference in the bibliography, not included as a
footnote here.
Authors: We changed with “Table 1. List of formal species and possibly newly discovered taxa
of the subgenus Melanoconion included in the study, taxonomic classification, number of
specimen used in the analysis, and specimen identification code. Classification adopted herein
is based on Sirivanakarn (1983) [16], with modification by Sallum and Forattini (1996) [2].”
R#1 - The summary is excessively long. It includes information that is irrelevant to the purpose
and results of the study. It is not necessary to repeat the name of the subgenus after first
mention as it is understood to be the subject of the study.
Authors: The summary has been rewritten according to R#1. The new version can be seen in
the revised manuscript.
R#1 - How is it possible for the two to "cluster together" if they are in separate clades? This
needs to be clarified. Word choice, i.e. "cluster" is faulty.
Authors: (Lines 240- 243) We correct this as follows: Specimens identified as Cx. sp. nr.
aureonotatus were recovered within the clade composed of Cx. eknomios and Cx. vaxus,
whereas Cx. aureonotatus GO1_108 and Cx. aureonotatus SP35_1 where in a separate clade,
depending on the analytical approach adopted.
R#1 – (1) The two studies mention here are not relevant to the purpose and aims of the study
reported in this paper, i.e. they do not contribute information relative to the results of the
study. The sentences and references probably should be deleted.
(2) How do the results of their study correspond to the results reported here? This should be
included in the Discussion.
(3) Why are these studies relevant to the present study? This seems to be embellishment of the
bibliography without relevance to the discussion of the results reported herein.
(4) And how does this impact on the results of the present study?
Authors: Because of similarities of statements mentioned in the paragraph (Lines 260-275) we
are responding all together (see Lines 258-279):
We excluded one reference (Mendenhal et al. [54]) because it was not directly related to this
article focus, and modified the text as follows to expand on the relevance of these studies:
“DNA sequence data available for the subgenus Melanoconion is limited; however, a few recent
studies using ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA can be highlighted. For instance, genetic
variation among Cx. erraticus from Colombia, Guatemala and nine locations in the United States
have been addressed using ND4 mitochondrial gene and ITS2 region of the rDNA [55]. Results
of analyses revealed two major lineages within the species. One lineage includes central and
eastern United States populations, whereas the other corresponded to Central America, South
America, and the western United States, with little gene flow among populations from distinct
geographical regions. Focusing on species identification, Williams and Savage [56] were able to
identify eight species of the subgenus Melanoconion that occur in the southern United States
using multiplex PCR of the small subunit of the ribosomal RNA gene (18S gene). Phylogenetic
relationships within the Vomerifer and Pedroi Groups of the Spissipes Section have been
demonstrated to be monophyletic sister groups using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) of
ribosomal RNA gene. Cx. adamesi, Cx. ribeirensis and Cx. pedroi clustered together, indicating
the monophyly of the Crybda Group. In addition, the monophyly of the Vomerifer Group has
been corroborated, and the presence of two divergent branches suggests that the name Cx.
pedroi can include two species. The study by Vesgueiro et al. [21] using ITS-2 sequence data of
several species of the subgenera Culex, Melanoconion, and Phenacomyia showed the
difficulties one may face to obtain and align the ITS-2 sequences for studies aimed at assessing
relationships among Culex species because of high intraspecific variation. In addition, results of
analyses suggested that the name Cx. aliciae includes at least two morphologically similar
species, and that the Conspirator Group that includes Cx. dyius and Cx. aliciae among other
species is not monophyletic, with Cx. ybarmis of the Intrincatus Subgroup of the Intrincatus
Group within the branch composed of Cx. aliciae.”
R#1 - What "characters and characters states"? Do you mean the illustrations in reference 1
and the morphological traits used in the keys?
We have clarified this as follows (Lines 280 - 284): The Spissipes and Melanoconion sections can
be recognized by morphological features of the male genitalia using the available illustrations in
[1], female, fourth-instar larva and pupa based on the identification keys of Sirivanakarn [16].
Morphological traits used in the Sirivanakarn´s identification keys may represent
synapomorphies for each section; however, they need to be tested in further analyses of the
whole group, including other Culex subgenera.
In the paragraph lines 295-306, R#1 made the following comments:
R#1 – (1) This paragraph is meaningless and irrational, and should be deleted unless it is revised
in light of the above and the following comments.
(2) statement based on presumed relationships that were not evident at the start of the study
(as indicated by the listing of species in Table 1).
(3) This is a ludicrous statement. It is obvious that the two species are "undescribed species",
and it is equally obvious that they should have been placed in the same group as the species
they are "near" to morphologically.
Authors: We deeply apologize for not being clear in our statements. We have rewritten the
paragraph as follows, Lines 298 - 308:
Currently the Spissipes Section includes 23 species separated into eight groups and three
subgroups [2]. Results of the analyses of the concatenated three-gene did not support the
monophyly of the Vomerifer and Crybda Groups. However, it is plausible to hypothesize that
the specimens identified as Cx. sp. nr.nr. gnomatos and Cx. sp. nr.nr. portesi using
morphological similarity of the females might belong to as-yet undescribed species that belong
to those two groups. There are undescribed Melanoconion species that have been mentioned
by Linton et al. [57] and Hutchings et al. [58] in areas of the Amazon river basin. Some of them
are morphologically similar to species of the Spissipes Section. Considering that the
classification into groups and subgroups depends primarily on features of the male genitalia,
the identification of specimen Cx. sp. nr. portesi and Cx. sp. nr. gnomatos was preliminary as it
was based on external morphology of field-collected females.
R#1 - Ten of how many groups. The reader would like to know how many groups were not
represented in the study.
Authors: We clarified the number of groups included in the study as follows: For the
Melanoconion Section we included representatives of ten groups out of thirteen groups:
Atratus Group, Bastagarius Group, Distinguendus Group, Conspirator Group, Educator Group,
Erraticus Group, Evansae Group, Inhibitator Group, Intrincatus Group and Pilosus Group (Table
1).
R#1. Comment regarding paragraph lines 307-320. Couldn't this be due to the limitation or
inability of the selected genes to resolve natural relationships. It is disturbing that it appears to
be assumed that molecular data are reliable for resolving "evolutionary" relationships and
morphology is not. Also, it is particularly annoying that molecular workers fail to realize that the
methods employed to generate relationships are phenetic methods that reveal similarities of
DNA sequences, which cannot or should not be construed to reflect "evolutionary", i.e.
"natural", relationships. The authors are encouraged to ponder this and reflect on the critical
assessment of phylogenetic research recently published by Borkent (2017, Zootaxa 4374).
Authors: We have rewritten the paragraph (Lines 309-322) as follows: The informal internal
classification of the Melanoconion Section is challenging. This section includes 137 species, and
the last revision based on morphology is that by Sirivanakarn in 1983 [16]. Even though the
relationships within the Melanoconion Section need further investigation, our results clearly
support the monophyly of the section. For the Melanoconion Section we included
representatives of ten groups out of thirteen groups: Atratus Group, Bastagarius Group,
Distinguendus Group, Conspirator Group, Educator Group, Erraticus Group, Evansae Group,
Inhibitator Group, Intrincatus Group and Pilosus Group (Table 1). None species of the Peccator,
Saramaccensis and Trifidus Groups were included in the study. Results of the analyses found
support for monophyly of the Atratus and Pilosus groups. All other groups included in the study
were found to be disjoined polyphyletic or paraphyletic. The ML and Bayesian statistical
support for the monophyly of the Pilosus and Atratus groups is strong and consistent
independent of the method of analysis that was used and the data set employed for the
analyses. The results of this study open a discussion regarding the internal classification of the
Melanoconion Section, because they do not give conclusive answers as the taxon
representation of section was limited.
R#1 - Regarding the item “Conclusions”, R#1 made the following comments:
(1) Yet there it was possible to identify these as species "near" to currently recognized
species. Logically, doubtfully or questionably identified specimens should not have been
included in the study. This reviewer wonders what results would be obtained if only positively
identified "good" species were included. I suggest that the analyses be run again without the
specimens identified as "near" species. Doing so is likely to produce results that could be
discussed more rationally.
(2) And who is going to do this? It is easy enough to state the need but unlikely to be done
unless you, the authors, do it, which could provide a sound basis for future molecular work.
(3) Ironic that in the previous sentence you advocate the need for morphological studies
and ignore this in this sentence. The discussion, in additional to including some redundancy,
includes some wishy-washy (window-dressing) statements like these.
(4) The study does not provide evidence for this. This clause should be removed or the
word "likely" replaced with "possibly".
Authors: We have rewritten the conclusion as follows: Our study found support for the two
major sections of the subgenus Melanoconion, the Spissipes and the Melanoconion sections.
The Vomerifer and the Crybda groups of the Spissipes Section may not be monophyleticgroups.
Consequently, further investigation is required because the specimens of Cx. sp. nr.nr.
gnomatos and Cx. sp. nr. portesi were field-collected females that may be misidentified due to
constraints in identifying adult females in this group. It will be of fundamental importance to
have male and female specimens linked to larva and pupa for an accurate identification and to
expand the currently available keys for this group. Based on the current classification of the
subgenus a few groups and subgroups were recovered as natural groups. This finding highlights
the need for further investigations using other genes, in addition to morphological data and a
more representative taxon sampling of all groups and subgroups current included in the
subgenus. Our data showed that the CAD gene may be used as an additional marker for
assessing relationships within Culex (Melanoconion), and possibly other Culex subgenera.

Dear Dr. Power:
We greatly appreciate your positive response to the various modifications of this manuscript, we are
excited about publishing the results of our research in the Royal Society Open Science journal. The
reviewer's corrections included inside the manuscript comprised only minor modifications, such as
spaces between phrases, and addition or deletion of words; thus, all suggested modifications were
accepted and applied to the revised version of the manuscript. Given that the reviewer's
modifications were only minor, we are not including an additional file with responses to referees; all
corrections were accepted and applied. In addition to the specific comments from the reviewer, we
made several other minor grammatical changes to increase clarity of the text.
This is the most inclusive molecular phylogeny of subgenus Melanoconion, with evidence of the
monophyly of the two major sections that were originally classified based on morphological
characters. This paper should be of interest to readers in the areas of medical entomology and
mosquito systematics.
Thank you for supporting the publication of our manuscript; it has been a constructive experience
that motivates us to continue our scientific endeavors.
Sincerely,
