Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
In this paper you provide some potentially useful and novel information by reporting the
favorable HHV value for corn straw pellet biochar and how this material could potentially
replace lignite and sub-bituminous coal. However, this benefit is severely limited by the lack of
pellet robustness shown in the mechanical resistance results for the biochar pellets. This is
unfortunate and I believe too big a problem to allow publication. Have you considered perhaps
spray-coating your biochar pellets with glycerin or some other cheap binder? That should not
affect the HHV negatively and may help greatly with mechanical resistance of the pellets. Until
you can somehow solve the problem of your biochar pellets having such low compression
strength, I cannot recommend this manuscript for publication. Additionally, here are some other
suggestions to help improve your paper:
1. You need to begin your abstract with the reason you're doing this research. You shouldn't just
start off your abstract stating that you're investigating the characteristics of biochar pellets. Start
off with *why* you're investigating biochar pellets, say how they yield a very good HHV and
could potentially replace lignite and sub-bituminous coal as a renewable source of energy.
2. (line 51) It's wrong to say "...range of 400-700 deg C, and in the absence of oxygen or nitrogen
environment during pyrolysis process." Nitrogen is present; you are using nitrogen to displace
oxygen at high temperature to facilitate your pyrolysis process.
3. (line 63) Your opening paragraph statement is confusing; what exactly is being reduced by a
factor of 30? Volume? The statement is not clear.
4. (lines 82-90) Starting with the Basu reference and going until right before the Chen reference,
why are you talking about torrefaction and pellet dimension changes? What does this have to do
with your main point of HHV values for the corn straw pellet biochar? I don't see how this
information is relevant.
5. (lines 126-128) The statement "In addition, in order to ensure consistency of the experiment,
pellets were arranged in the same distribution, and the same location samples were chosen each
analysis." is confusing. What does this mean exactly? You took pellets from the same area of the
quartz tube they were in during pyrolysis? This statement needs more detail so that it is clearer to
the reader.
6. (line 175) Change the heading to section 3.1 to "Mass and energy yields of biochar pellets"
7. (lines 189-190) I'm guessing the reason that your biochar pellets became more carbonaceous
with increasing temperature is because more and more volatiles were released as pyrolysis temp
increased, thus increasing the overall carbon percentage; I doubt your samples were gaining any
carbon. This sentence should be commented on or clarified with your thoughts on this trend.
8. (lines 258-259) Typo, change this sentence to "...because of stable chemical bonds."
9. (lines 268-271) Your claim that these biochar pellets could be used as sources of soil
amendment is too simplistic because there are other factors that are vitally important for soil
amendment that you have not addressed in this paper. For example, pH is critical, if your biochar
is > about 8.5 pH, it will be very bad for most plant growth and have a negative overall effect
regardless of the biochar porosity.
10. (Figure 1) You may want to consider adding the 3-digit temperatures next to each FTIR trace
directly on the figure; for many readers (such as myself) who print out your paper in grayscale,
your figure legend (and therefore the figure itself) is meaningless and the different traces cannot
be deciphered.

Dear authors, I think a mistake has been made as this revision does not have any tables or figures,
only the captions. Adding temperatures to each trace for Figure 1 will help clarify it, especially to
those who are not printing your manuscript in color. We also cannot see the changes you made in
the notes to further explain deviation in the data (which is not shown, as pointed out by reviewer
2). Has a Van Krevelen diagram been added?
Also, the English in this revision is still very poor. Is it possible to find a native English speaker
that can help you with the grammar, because it is still too poor for publication.

changes in the pellets after pyrolysis to emphasize the novelty.
-It is better to add deviations in manuscript instead of repeating for all table/figs.
-Since only temperature was investigated, there is no meaning to mention it in the first sentence
of the result. Or authors can give general statement such as; starting with “it is well known/

Thank you for making many changes to improve the manuscript. There are still a few minor
revisions I would suggest making to improve the manuscript further:
Abstract (line 28): It is misleading to say that the biochar pellets had "good... mechanical
resistance" when your durability tests showed that no sample reached 50% durability and the
compression strength, at best, was still a factor of 3 times weaker than the CSP control.
Lines 54-57: Do you have references or other examples/proof to back up your claim of "Gaseous
products can be used as fuels because they contain a large number of H2 and CO molecules."
And also for the statement right after that that says, "Likewise, bio-oil can be used as fuels and
ingredients for chemical products, such as phenols, organic acids, and oxygenates."
Line 226: For the statement, "The pyrolysis process eliminates hemicelluloses, celluloses, and
lignins from biomass samples which influenced the capacity for water sorption", how do you
know this?

-I again recommend to revise the statement of novelty of the study. Providing more reference for
the application of biochar pellets ( as author mentioned in the last paragraph of introduction)
should not be novelty/ importance of the study.
-In van krevelen diagram, coal, lignite, peat, anthracite REGION -NOT DOT- should be added.

Thank you for making many changes to improve the manuscript. There are still a few minor
revisions I would suggest making to improve the manuscript further:
Abstract (line 28): It is misleading to say that the biochar pellets had "good... mechanical
resistance" when your durability tests showed that no sample reached 50% durability and the
compression strength, at best, was still a factor of 3 times weaker than the CSP control.
Lines 54-57: Do you have references or other examples/proof to back up your claim of "Gaseous
products can be used as fuels because they contain a large number of H2 and CO molecules."
15
And also for the statement right after that that says, "Likewise, bio-oil can be used as fuels and
ingredients for chemical products, such as phenols, organic acids, and oxygenates."
Line 226: For the statement, "The pyrolysis process eliminates hemicelluloses, celluloses, and
lignins from biomass samples which influenced the capacity for water sorption", how do you
know this?

-I again recommend to revise the statement of novelty of the study. Providing more reference for
the application of biochar pellets ( as author mentioned in the last paragraph of introduction)
should not be novelty/ importance of the study.
-In van krevelen diagram, coal, lignite, peat, anthracite REGION -NOT DOT- should be added.
Author can learn how to make it from any related literature.

Appendix A
In this manuscript, biochars obtained from corn straw pellets were
produced at different temperatures. Some main properties of biochars were also
analyzed and discussed. Even though the paper presents informative results, it
needs to be carefully revised.
Firstly, I highly recommend to check the grammar of all manuscript.
The usage of English should be notably improved; there are some grammar
errors such as bad use of verbs/words, tense error etc.
Line 47. Since author mentioned that biomass pellets are too expensive,
they should also emphasize how pyrolysis of biomass pellets reduce the cost.
Line 95-98. This sentence is not clear. Please explain and justify the
result.
Line 109. The gap and the novelty of the study should be emphasized
in penultimate paragraph.
Line 115. Considering efficiency of energy densification, why lower
temperatures (e.g. 300 and 350) were not tested?
Line 128-129. Deviation of all data should be added in Tables/Figures.
Subsection 3.1 and 3.2 Discussion and justification of the results are
poor. Strengthen the importance of the results, with the help of citing related
papers or suggesting plausible reasons.
Line 176. What is the other tested parameters?
Line 178. (Table 1.) Please explain why biochar pellets still had
moisture (around 5%) even though they stored in desicator after pyrolysis.
Line 190. H/C and O/C ratios of biochar pellets should be discussed by
the help of Van Krevelen diagram.
Line 209. On contrary to these results, a number of researcher observed
that increase in pyrolysis temperature lowers hydrophility of biochar obtained.
Please discuss this difference.
Line 217. Micropore surface area should be given for this statement.

Dear Editor and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning our
manuscript entitled “Characteristics of biochar pellets from corn straw under different
pyrolysis temperatures” (ID: RSOS-172346.R1). Those comments are all valuable and
very helpful for revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding
significance to our researches. We have studied comments carefully and have made
correction which we hope meet with approval. The main corrections in the paper and
the responds to the reviewers’ comments are as flowing.
Reviewer: 1
Response to comments:
However, this benefit is severely limited by the lack of pellet robustness shown in
the mechanical resistance results for the biochar pellets. This is unfortunate and I
believe too big a problem to allow publication. Have you considered perhaps
spray-coating your biochar pellets with glycerin or some other cheap binder? That
should not affect the HHV negatively and may help greatly with mechanical
resistance of the pellets. Until you can somehow solve the problem of your biochar
pellets having such low compression strength, I cannot recommend this manuscript
for publication.
In this manuscript, although mechanical properties are lower than the biomass
pellets, they can still meet the needs of production. In the process of storage and
transportation, there is no obvious breakage for biochar pellets. Many studies have
also found that the mechanical properties of biochart pellets are reduced, but they
can still be preserved intact (1,2,3). Kambo et al. (4) researched that char was
compressed into pellets with binders. The results found there is no obvious change in
the compression strength with this study, which deduce that spray-coating does not
have an obvious effect on the improvement of mechanical strength. In fact, Ghiasi et
al. (3) analyzed merits and defects of torrefaction before and after densification. The
results demonstrated that it was more energy efficient to before densify the wood
chip and subsequently torrefy them. The author believe that binders can improve
some mechanical properties, but the effect is not obvious, and the cost of production
is greatly improved. So, the author believe that the biochar pellets produced by this
method can meet the requirements of production.

1. You need to begin your abstract with the reason you're doing this research. You
shouldn't just start off your abstract stating that you're investigating the
characteristics of biochar pellets. Start off with *why* you're investigating biochar
pellets, say how they yield a very good HHV and could potentially replace lignite
and sub-bituminous coal as a renewable source of energy.
According to the comments, the author added the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
2. (line 51) It's wrong to say "...range of 400-700 deg C, and in the absence of
oxygen or nitrogen environment during pyrolysis process." Nitrogen is present; you
are using nitrogen to displace oxygen at high temperature to facilitate your pyrolysis
process.
According to the comments, the author revised the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
3. (line 63) Your opening paragraph statement is confusing; what exactly is being
reduced by a factor of 30? Volume? The statement is not clear.
According to the comments, the author revised the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
4. (lines 82-90) Starting with the Basu reference and going until right before the
Chen reference, why are you talking about torrefaction and pellet dimension changes?
What does this have to do with your main point of HHV values for the corn straw
pellet biochar? I don't see how this information is relevant.
The pyrolysis study of biomass pellets is not only a change in the calorific value, but
also includes the change of pellets size, the conditions of pyrolysis and so on. These
references are the relevant contents of the research on the biomass pellets at present.
5. (lines 126-128) The statement "In addition, in order to ensure consistency of the
experiment, pellets were arranged in the same distribution, and the same location
samples were chosen each analysis." is confusing. What does this mean exactly?
You took pellets from the same area of the quartz tube they were in during pyrolysis?
This statement needs more detail so that it is clearer to the reader.
In order to prevent the experimental error caused by the condition difference, the
sample of the same position is selected in the quartz tube. In addition, the quantity
and arrangement of the pellets will also make errors in the experiment, so the
experiment adopts a uniform arrangement and selects the same sample. In order to
make the reader more clear about the experimental method, the manuscript has been
modified accordingly.
6. (line 175) Change the heading to section 3.1 to "Mass and energy yields of
biochar pellets"
According to the comments, the author revised the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
7. (lines 189-190) I'm guessing the reason that your biochar pellets became more
carbonaceous with increasing temperature is because more and more volatiles were
released as pyrolysis temp increased, thus increasing the overall carbon percentage; I
doubt your samples were gaining any carbon. This sentence should be commented
on or clarified with your thoughts on this trend.
According to the comments, the author revised the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
8. (lines 258-259) Typo, change this sentence to "...because of stable chemical
bonds."
According to the comments, the author revised the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
9. (lines 268-271) Your claim that these biochar pellets could be used as sources of
soil amendment is too simplistic because there are other factors that are vitally
important for soil amendment that you have not addressed in this paper. For example,
pH is critical, if your biochar is > about 8.5 pH, it will be very bad for most plant
growth and have a negative overall effect regardless of the biochar porosity.
According to the comments, the author revised the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
10. (Figure 1) You may want to consider adding the 3-digit temperatures next to
each FTIR trace directly on the figure; for many readers (such as myself) who print
out your paper in grayscale, your figure legend (and therefore the figure itself) is
meaningless and the different traces cannot be deciphered.
According to the comments, the author revised the Fig. 2.
Reviewer: 2
Firstly, I highly recommend to check the grammar of all manuscript. The usage of
English should be notably improved; there are some grammar errors such as bad use
of verbs/words, tense error etc.
The author checks the whole article and modifies the corresponding some grammar
errors.
1. Line 47. Since author mentioned that biomass pellets are too expensive, they
should also emphasize how pyrolysis of biomass pellets reduce the cost.
In the paper, biomass pellets were pyrolyzed for improving the the utilization value
of pellets. In line 48-52, the utilizations of the biochar, bio-oil, and gaseous products
are explained in detail.
2. Line 95-98. This sentence is not clear. Please explain and justify the result.
According to the comments, the author revised the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
3. Line 109. The gap and the novelty of the study should be emphasized in
penultimate paragraph.
According to the comments, the author revised the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
4. Line 115. Considering efficiency of energy densification, why lower temperatures
(e.g. 300 and 350) were not tested?
The pyrolysis of lower temperatures (e.g. 300 and 350 °C) is generally called
torrefaction. Many studies have shown that the pyrolysis yield under this condition
is high, but the calorific value is low.
5. Line 128-129. Deviation of all data should be added in Tables/Figures.
The experimental deviations are within 5%. So, the authors did not add a deviation.
In the revised manuscript, the authors explains in the way of notes.
6. Subsection 3.1 and 3.2 Discussion and justification of the results are poor.Strengthen
the importance of the results, with the help of citing related papers or suggesting
plausible reasons.
In subsection 3.1, the author added the relevant content in the new manuscript. In
subsection 3.2, there is no similar study in the literature. The author is based on the
analysis of the characteristics of biomass composition.and biochar properties
7. Line 176. What is the other tested parameters?
Such as heating rate, residence time. There are many factors affecting the biomass
pyrolysis, but a large number of studies show that the temperature is the most important.
8. Line 178. (Table 1.) Please explain why biochar pellets still had moisture (around 5%)
even though they stored in desicator after pyrolysis.
In order to simulate the actual utilization process, before the element analysis and
proximate analysis tested, the sample was placed in the air for 24 h. In the revised
manuscript, the relevant content was added.
9. Line 190. H/C and O/C ratios of biochar pellets should be discussed by the help of
Van Krevelen diagram.
According to the comments, the author added the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
10. Line 209. On contrary to these results, a number of researcher observed that increase
in pyrolysis temperature lowers hydrophility of biochar obtained. Please discuss this
difference.
According to the comments, the author added the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
11. Line 217. Micropore surface area should be given for this statement.
According to the comments, the author added the relevant content in the new
manuscript.

Reviewer: 1
Response to comments:
Dear authors, I think a mistake has been made as this revision does not have any
tables or figures, only the captions. Adding temperatures to each trace for Figure 1
will help clarify it, especially to those who are not printing your manuscript in color.
We also cannot see the changes you made in the notes to further explain deviation in
the data (which is not shown, as pointed out by reviewer 2). Has a Van Krevelen
diagram been added?
According to the comments, the author added the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
Also, the English in this revision is still very poor. Is it possible to find a native
English speaker that can help you with the grammar, because it is still too poor for
publication.
The full manuscriptt has been modified in grammar and structure by a native English
speaker.
Reviewer: 2
-In my opinion, author should mention that this study is related to the chemical and
physical changes in the pellets after pyrolysis to emphasize the novelty.
In the manuscript, the author study the chemical and physical changes in the pellets
after pyrolysis to emphasize the novelty by hydrophobicity, mechanical resistance,
FT-IR, SEM. The author emphasize the novelty according to changes of pellets after
pyrolysis.
-It is better to add deviations in manuscript instead of repeating for all table/figs.
The author calculated the deviation. Because the values are small, the author did not
list them in tables and charts. The author explains in the form of footnote.
-Since only temperature was investigated, there is no meaning to mention it in the
first sentence of the result. Or authors can give general statement such as; starting
with “it is well known/ common knowledge that...” etc.
According to the comments, the author revised the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
- In Van krevelen diagram, coal, lignite, peat, anthracite region can be provided for
visually a better graph.
According to the comments, the author revised the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
- Remove " please discuss this difference "in line 221. and give ref. for "other
researchers".
According to the comments, the author revised the relevant content in the new
manuscript.
Line 200 – Revise the sentence “….better fuel characteristics than…”
According to the comments, the author revised the relevant content in the new
