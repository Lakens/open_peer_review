Comments to the Authors:
The authors explore the role of diet in shaping the sexual development in male fallow deer.
Supplemental feed and pasture composition were determined using several nutritional analyses.
Moreover, metrics for growth, testis mass, spermatogenic activity, sperm traits, and testosterone
levels were determined. The authors found that males grew more, had higher testicular mass,
and also had higher sperm quality when provided supplemental grains.
This study investigates an interesting and relatively understudied question. Many novel aspects
of reproductive responses to diet have been explored in this study. My major concerns pertain to
the use of energy as the primary indicator of nutrient quality without actually providing
estimates for dietary energetic differences and the potentially strong alternative explanations
driving the differences in response variables. The nutritive composition of the diet is really only
cited in a single sentence (Lines 92-93), while later in the Discussion section only the protein and
energetic content seems to be robustly considered. The protein content was slightly higher in the
grass and the fat content was slightly higher in the barley grain. However, the dry matter content
was over twice as great in the barley, while the fiber and lignin content were approximately three
times as high in the grass. These factors might contribute to digestibility and assimilation
differences/costs between the diets, which could be interacting with the response variables (in
addition to energy intake). The study also seems to have been conducted on single population
(divided into a control and treatment) during a single season, with most sample collection
occurring at the terminus, which perhaps limits extrapolation of the findings.
Specific Comments:
1. Line 71-73: This statement seems to offer one of the strongest nutritive explanations for why
supplementation with barley might increase fertility in male fallow deer. However, essential
amino acids did not seem to be quantified in this study. Other nutritive explanations for the
advantages of supplementation (digestibility, higher fat content, etc.) might give broader
perspective to the study from the dietary data provided.
2. Lines 98-104: Was nutrient composition of barley grain determined using the same analyses as
pasture or were other methods used to infer?
3. Lines 106-108: This seems like sufficient justification for using an alternative to randomized
sample collection.
4. Lines 175-177: It looks like the deer were initially size-matched for the treatments, which I think
was well recognized to be a necessary part of the experimental design.
5. Lines 189-193 and 215-217: These seemed to be the most significant experimental findings.
Many of the other response variables did not seem to differ (e.g. testosterone, acrosomal status,
and several aspects of sperm morphology).
6. Lines 230- 253: The authors seem well versed in the function and production of male gametes,
however, the link to diet is not yet well-elucidated. The only direct nutritional explanation is from
the early reference to essential amino acids present (but not actually measured in this study) in
the grains.
7. Lines 291-293: These lines provide a citation to the broader diversity of animals in the
literature, which is relatively sparse up to this point in the paper. However, the animals in the
3
current study seemed to be neither food restricted nor in poor body condition given the gain in
mass and at least some equivalent aspects of fertility in both treatment and control.
8. Lines 300- 302: It is difficult to assess this claim because Table 1 appears to show higher protein
available for consumer intake in the grass compared to grain.
9. Line 498: At present, Table 1 only seems to be provided as background rather than as a
supporting piece of evidence. This table is only cited once (within the Methods) and only protein
and perhaps fat are alluded to. It is not yet clear why other nutrient analyses in the table were
conducted and if these biochemicals might also contribute to the observed differences in the
response variables. The arguments for higher-energy diet contributing to increased
spermatogenic function and sperm midpiece length would also be strengthened if calorimetry
findings or standard energy conversion estimates were to be included for the diets (e.g.
protein=17 kJ/g, and fat=37 kJ/g; Raubenheimer and Rothman. 2013. Nutritional ecology of
entomophagy in humans and other primates. Annu Rev Entomol).

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In this work, the authors elicit the influence of an energy-rich diet on the onset of sexual
maturation of fallow deer (Dama dama). To achieve this, the authors randomly allocated 32 pre-
pubertal fallow deer to two groups: one fed with pasture and one supplemented with barley. Six
month later, the animals were sacrificed and biometric parameters, serum testosterone, sperm
parameters, spermatogenic function and acrosomal status were accessed. Overall, the authors
report improvements in sperm parameters and reproductive function, compatible to an earlier
onset of sexual maturation in the group fed with pasture supplemented with barley.
This paper presents some results that explore the potential commercial viability of fallow deer,
based on an adequate methodology. The evaluated parameters are significant according to the
aims of the work, and variables are properly defined. Besides, considering the amount of
collected data and its further treatment, the reported results seem reliable.
Nevertheless, there are some major concerns regarding the way the authors present their data,
4
and some gaps that must be filled in order to draw more consistent conclusions.
1. The authors have not identified the most critical aim of their work. The most evident
conclusion of this work is that a high-energy diet anticipates the puberty onset on fallow deer.
The authors do not present any conclusive proof that it was diet, and not sexual development
during puberty, the responsible for the improvement in sperm parameters. In fact, even the
bibliography cited by the authors raise the idea that it was the maturation state, likely due to
nutritional state, the main differentiating factor between the two groups of deer. Therefore, the
authors must rewrite the paper around this aim, which will forcibly mean changes in all sections,
including title.
2. The nomenclature of scientific terms is incoherent throughout the paper, rendering it unclear.
As example, the nomenclature used for germ cell development phases is not coherent between
Figure 1, Table 2 and the manuscript (the authors use round spermatocytes in text, then in table 2
they present counts for primary and secondary spermatocytes). Additionally, the authors should
clearly define what are “sperm parameters”, “spermatogenic function” and “acrosomal status”.
3. Figure 1 is an essential figure in the context of the work but needs further refinement. It should
show a wider field, or the authors could supplement it with an image of lower magnification, in
order to show the seminiferous tubule structure and integrity.
4. During discussion, the authors overestimate their observations based upon inadequate
bibliography. It is not comparable sperm mid-piece size of lizards with deer, particularly if no
measurement of mitochondria number and fitness was performed. Besides, it is not acceptable to
relate that eventual gain to a diet effect, based upon data draw from a study in rat liver. If the
authors want to make this connection, they must present data on mitochondrial number and
function in spermatozoa’s midpiece.
5. Since the authors collected serum of the animals, they should quantify other hormones of the
reproductive axis, in order to further characterize the maturation phase of the deer at sacrifice.
6. Although the study focuses on fallow deer, the authors must not disregard works published in
other mammal species, notably rodents and humans, where it is stated that high-energy diets
lead to impaired sperm parameters and poorer fertility outcomes.
7. I would not draw conclusions out of non-significant results as if there is a difference (e.g.
testosterone levels).
Additionally, there are minor issues that should be addressed when rewriting the article.
1. Please, review the superscripts in the boxplots and state what “a” and “b” stand for.
2. I advise the authors to look at the following bibliography to improve their work, especially
regarding germ cell – Sertoli cell cooperation: PMID 23495257, 29453570; ISBN 978-3-319-19791-3.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Punidan Jeyasingh):
This manuscript reporting effects of an experimental high-energy diet on sperm morphology and
functionality in a livestock ruminant was evaluated by two experts. I apologize for the long delay
because I had a hard time finding suitable reviewers. The experts liked the work, and clearly see
its importance. Nevertheless, they have raised some serious issues. Of particular note is the lack
of data on the nutritional parameters of the diet. This information must be more clearly
furnished, and the results discussed in this light. Clearly, dietary changes are bound to have
myriad physiological implications, making the links between diet and sperm traits, as claimed in
this study, rather obscure. I believe the manuscript can be improved along these lines. Moreover,
the authors appear to have ignored similar work in other taxa which can be leveraged to
strengthen inferences. I felt the reviews were fair and constructive. With much gratitude to the
expert reviewers, I wish the authors the best in addressing these comments and improving their
manuscript.

Overall, I find that the authors have comprehensively addressed my concerns from the previous
draft. The authors have provided additional clarification and seemed to effectively revise
paragraph structure within the Methods. Inclusion of Table 2 (Lines 589-592) sufficiently reports
the energetics of pasture versus the supplemental diet. This is exemplified through partitioning of
the gross and digestible/metabolisable components, which seems to support a more robust series
of explanations in the revised Discussion section. Further, the authors have integrated
consideration of scope to their findings (Lines 242-243, 305-307) while also providing a more
thorough consideration of the literature base (throughout Discussion) necessary to compel future
study in this understudied research area.

After reading their revised paper, and considering all the changes in result of the reviewer’s
criticism, the outcome is a clearly an improved manuscript. I would like to particularly address
the improvements in discussion, which now reflect a sounder rational and easier reading.
I consider that my central criticism regarding this paper was addressed. As I pointed out before,
one of the limitations of this work is the impossibility to separate developmental and dietary
factors as the driving force of the male fertility parameters. This concern is addressed by the
authors (lines 317-318), but a plethora of other methodologies could suit this problem in further
works. Therefore, my advice is to restrict your conclusions to “young adult fallow deer”, or a
more suitable veterinarian term to describe the developmental phase of animals included in this
study. This change should also be reflected in title.
Lastly, I call the author’s attention to a minor aspect. In pages 71 and 72, the significance marks
are not clear. The authors should state what the lower-case letters “a” and “b” stand for in the
image subtitle. I understand they denote significance, but does “a” and “b” stand for different
levels of significance? Or does it stand for group-group comparisons?

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Punidan Jeyasingh):
I thank the authors for a thoroughly revised version of the manuscript. This revision was assessed
by the original reviewers, and both are clearly happy with it. With much gratitude to the
reviewers, I am happy to recommend this manuscript for publication. One of the reviewers
picked up a couple of important issues that should be addressed before the manuscript can be
accepted for publication.

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
In this work, the authors elicit the influence of an energy-rich diet on the onset of sexual
maturation of fallow deer (Dama dama). To achieve this, the authors randomly allocated 32 pre-
pubertal fallow deer to two groups: one fed with pasture and one supplemented with barley. Six
month later, the animals were sacrificed and biometric parameters, serum testosterone, sperm
parameters, spermatogenic function and acrosomal status were accessed. Overall, the authors
report improvements in sperm parameters and reproductive function, compatible to an earlier
onset of sexual maturation in the group fed with pasture supplemented with barley.
After reading their revised paper, and considering all the changes in result of the reviewer’s
criticism, the outcome is a clearly an improved manuscript. I would like to particularly address
the improvements in discussion, which now reflect a sounder rational and easier reading.
I consider that my central criticism regarding this paper was addressed. As I pointed out before,
one of the limitations of this work is the impossibility to separate developmental and dietary
factors as the driving force of the male fertility parameters. This concern is addressed by the
authors (lines 317-318), but a plethora of other methodologies could suit this problem in further
works. Therefore, my advice is to restrict your conclusions to “young adult fallow deer”, or a
more suitable veterinarian term to describe the developmental phase of animals included in this
study. This change should also be reflected in title.
Lastly, I call the author’s attention to a minor aspect. In pages 71 and 72, the significance marks
are not clear. The authors should state what the lower-case letters “a” and “b” stand for in the
image subtitle. I understand they denote significance, but does “a” and “b” stand for different
levels of significance? Or does it stand for group-group comparisons?

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
Overall, I find that the authors have comprehensively addressed my concerns from the previous
draft. The authors have provided additional clarification and seemed to effectively revise
paragraph structure within the Methods. Inclusion of Table 2 (Lines 589-592) sufficiently reports
the energetics of pasture versus the supplemental diet. This is exemplified through partitioning of
the gross and digestible/metabolisable components, which seems to support a more robust series
of explanations in the revised Discussion section. Further, the authors have integrated
consideration of scope to their findings (Lines 242-243, 305-307) while also providing a more
thorough consideration of the literature base (throughout Discussion) necessary to compel future
study in this understudied research area.

ociate Editor's comments (Dr Punidan Jeyasingh):
s manuscript reporting effects of an experimental high-energy diet on sperm morphology and
ctionality in a livestock ruminant was evaluated by two experts. I apologize for the long delay because I
a hard time finding suitable reviewers. The experts liked the work, and clearly see its importance.
ertheless, they have raised some serious issues. Of particular note is the lack of data on the nutritional
ameters of the diet. This information must be more clearly furnished, and the results discussed in this
t. Clearly, dietary changes are bound to have myriad physiological implications, making the links
ween diet and sperm traits, as claimed in this study, rather obscure. I believe the manuscript can be
roved along these lines. Moreover, the authors appear to have ignored similar work in other taxa which
be leveraged to strengthen inferences. I felt the reviews were fair and constructive. With much gratitude
he expert reviewers, I wish the authors the best in addressing these comments and improving their
uscript.
suggested by Reviewer 1, we have included in the manuscript a new table (Table 2) providing
eral nutritional parameters of the diets (i.e. organic matter digestibility, energy digestibility, gross
rgy, digestible energy, and metabolisable energy). On the basis of these findings, we discussed our
ults from a deeper and broader perspective (lines 255-265). Moreover, we have included several
references, including those recommended by Reviewer 2. As suggested by both Reviewers, as
itations of our study, we have stated in the manuscript that i) the study was performed on a single
ulation of fallow deer (as indicated by Reviewer 1) (lines 242-243) and ii) that additional hormonal
lysis should be considered in future studies (as indicated by Reviewer 2) (lines 313-315).
hope that the revised version of the manuscript is now clearly presented and technically sound.

mments to the Authors:
authors explore the role of diet in shaping the sexual development in male fallow deer. Supplemental
and pasture composition were determined using several nutritional analyses. Moreover, metrics for
wth, testis mass, spermatogenic activity, sperm traits, and testosterone levels were determined. The
ors found that males grew more, had higher testicular mass, and also had higher sperm quality when
vided supplemental grains.
s study investigates an interesting and relatively understudied question. Many novel aspects of
oductive responses to diet have been explored in this study. My major concerns pertain to the use of
rgy as the primary indicator of nutrient quality without actually providing estimates for dietary energetic
erences and the potentially strong alternative explanations driving the differences in response variables.
nutritive composition of the diet is really only cited in a single sentence (Lines 92-93), while later in the
cussion section only the protein and energetic content seems to be robustly considered. The protein
tent was slightly higher in the grass and the fat content was slightly higher in the barley grain. However,
dry matter content was over twice as great in the barley, while the fiber and lignin content were
roximately three times as high in the grass. These factors might contribute to digestibility and
milation differences/costs between the diets, which could be interacting with the response variables (in
ition to energy intake). The study also seems to have been conducted on single population (divided into a
trol and treatment) during a single season, with most sample collection occurring at the terminus, which
haps limits extrapolation of the findings.
suggested by Reviewer 1, we have included in the manuscript a new table (Table 2) providing
eral nutritional parameters of the diets (i.e. organic matter digestibility, energy digestibility, gross
rgy, digestible energy, and metabolisable energy). On the basis of these findings, we include a new
agraph in the discussion section (lines 255-265). We would like also to point out that in our study
samples (testes) were collected during the breeding season (autumn-October) because during the
of the year fallow deer show little or no sperm production. Nevertheless, because our study was
ducted on a single population, we stated that this factor may limit the extrapolation of our findings
es 242-243).
cific Comments:
Line 71-73: This statement seems to offer one of the strongest nutritive explanations for why
plementation with barley might increase fertility in male fallow deer. However, essential amino acids did
seem to be quantified in this study. Other nutritive explanations for the advantages of supplementation
estibility, higher fat content, etc.) might give broader perspective to the study from the dietary data
vided.
Reviewer 1 suggested, the estimation of energetic value of the diets (Table 2) helped us to discuss
findings in a broader perspective that consider the composition and energetic value of the feeds
es 255-265).
ines 98-104: Was nutrient composition of barley grain determined using the same analyses as pasture or
e other methods used to infer?
nk you for your comment. Yes, the nutrient composition of barley grain was determined using the
e analyses as the pasture. We have included this information in the manuscript (lines 102).
ines 106-108: This seems like sufficient justification for using an alternative to randomized sample
ection.
ples were processed using the same order of slaughtering in order to minimize the interval
ween death and sperm analyses. In this way, all samples were processed approximately after the
e time interval after animal’s death. Moreover, the order of slaughtering (pasture vs barley grain)
randomly established and the researchers who perform the testicular and sperm analyses were
d about the group assignment of the animals. This information has been included in the
nuscript (lines 121-123).
ines 175-177: It looks like the deer were initially size-matched for the treatments, which I think was well
gnized to be a necessary part of the experimental design.
the beginning of the experiment, the deer were allocated in two groups and we checked that there
e no differences in the body mass between treatments.
ines 189-193 and 215-217: These seemed to be the most significant experimental findings. Many of the
er response variables did not seem to differ (e.g. testosterone, acrosomal status, and several aspects of
rm morphology).
agree with you. The effects of high energy diet on the quantitative assessment of spermatogenesis
testicular cytology together with the increase of the sperm midpiece length are the most relevant
ings of this study.
ines 230- 253: The authors seem well versed in the function and production of male gametes, however,
link to diet is not yet well-elucidated. The only direct nutritional explanation is from the early reference
ssential amino acids present (but not actually measured in this study) in the grains.
suggested by Reviewer 1, the estimation of the energetic values of pasture and barley grain helped
o discuss our finding in a broader perspective (lines 255-265). Despite the gross energy of barley
pasture were similar, the higher digestibility of the barley grain (i.e. low fiber amount and high
matter content) contributes to its higher digestible and metabolisable energy compared to those of
ture.
ines 291-293: These lines provide a citation to the broader diversity of animals in the literature, which is
tively sparse up to this point in the paper. However, the animals in the current study seemed to be neither
d restricted nor in poor body condition given the gain in mass and at least some equivalent aspects of
ility in both treatment and control.
nk you for your comments and observations. We are aware that some of the citations within these
s are more related with food restriction and poor body condition. The current literature about the
cts of nutrition in the size of sperm structures is extremely scarce. For this reason, we think that
cited references here are useful to provide a plausible explanation to our findings. However, we
e included in the manuscript that, in our study, none of the fallow deer seemed to be
ernourished, given that mean body mass was similar to the values previously reported by
apman and Chapman (1970) (lines 291-292). In addition, we included new references about the
ct of nutrition on male reproduction in other species (lines 265 and 294).
ines 300- 302: It is difficult to assess this claim because Table 1 appears to show higher protein available
consumer intake in the grass compared to grain.
, pasture shows slightly higher protein content compared to the barley grain. Nevertheless, we have
ake into account that all animals in this study were fed on pasture. The barley grain represents a
plementation to their diet. Barley provides a higher dry matter content and low amount of crude
e, which confers to this feed high digestible and metabolisable energy. Nevertheless, we have
hrased this sentence, now it reads: “Therefore, a higher protein intake (provided by the barley
in supplementation) in fallow deer may be associated with increased levels or activity of some
ochondrial enzymes related to the sperm metabolism that could promote an enlargement of the
rm midpiece” (lines 339-341).
ine 498: At present, Table 1 only seems to be provided as background rather than as a supporting piece
vidence. This table is only cited once (within the Methods) and only protein and perhaps fat are alluded
t is not yet clear why other nutrient analyses in the table were conducted and if these biochemicals might
contribute to the observed differences in the response variables. The arguments for higher-energy diet
tributing to increased spermatogenic function and sperm midpiece length would also be strengthened if
rimetry findings or standard energy conversion estimates were to be included for the diets (e.g.
ein=17 kJ/g, and fat=37 kJ/g; Raubenheimer and Rothman. 2013. Nutritional ecology of entomophagy in
ans and other primates. Annu Rev Entomol).
the basis of the estimated energetic values shown in Table 2, the findings have been rediscussed
es 255-265).

mments to the Author(s)
his work, the authors elicit the influence of an energy-rich diet on the onset of sexual maturation of fallow
r (Dama dama). To achieve this, the authors randomly allocated 32 pre-pubertal fallow deer to two
ups: one fed with pasture and one supplemented with barley. Six month later, the animals were sacrificed
biometric parameters, serum testosterone, sperm parameters, spermatogenic function and acrosomal
us were accessed. Overall, the authors report improvements in sperm parameters and reproductive
ction, compatible to an earlier onset of sexual maturation in the group fed with pasture supplemented with
ey.
s paper presents some results that explore the potential commercial viability of fallow deer, based on an
quate methodology. The evaluated parameters are significant according to the aims of the work, and
ables are properly defined. Besides, considering the amount of collected data and its further treatment,
reported results seem reliable.
ertheless, there are some major concerns regarding the way the authors present their data, and some gaps
must be filled in order to draw more consistent conclusions.
The authors have not identified the most critical aim of their work. The most evident conclusion of this
k is that a high-energy diet anticipates the puberty onset on fallow deer. The authors do not present any
clusive proof that it was diet, and not sexual development during puberty, the responsible for the
rovement in sperm parameters. In fact, even the bibliography cited by the authors raise the idea that it
the maturation state, likely due to nutritional state, the main differentiating factor between the two
ups of deer. Therefore, the authors must rewrite the paper around this aim, which will forcibly mean
nges in all sections, including title.
would like to highlight that in our study fallow deer have the same age, so that the diet was the
y difference between groups. Therefore, our results provide clear proofs that barley
plementation increases the testis mass, spermatogenic activity, sperm concentration, the percentage
he normal spermatozoa, and sperm midpiece length. As a plausible explanation, we suggest that
h-energy diet may have fastened the onset of puberty. Nevertheless, as we state in the discussion
es 304-307), in order to state that the dietary supplementation fasten the onset of puberty, repeated
ple collections are required from the same individual throughout the breeding season.
The nomenclature of scientific terms is incoherent throughout the paper, rendering it unclear. As
mple, the nomenclature used for germ cell development phases is not coherent between Figure 1, Table 2
the manuscript (the authors use round spermatocytes in text, then in table 2 they present counts for
mary and secondary spermatocytes). Additionally, the authors should clearly define what are “sperm
ameters”, “spermatogenic function” and “acrosomal status”.
checked the manuscript and the term used were round spermatids and primary spermatocytes.
could not find “round spermatocytes”. As suggested by Reviewer 2, we clearly defined in the text
term “sperm parameters” (line 25 and lines 29-30) and we replaced the term “acrosomal status”
h “acrosome integrity” (Lines 165, 214, 219) and the “spermatogenic function” with
ermatogenic activity” (line 24). However, we prefer to retain the term “spermatogenic function” in
title for clarity and conciseness as it is not easy to sum up all the results concerning the assessment
permatogenesis in a brief statement.
Figure 1 is an essential figure in the context of the work but needs further refinement. It should show a
er field, or the authors could supplement it with an image of lower magnification, in order to show the
iniferous tubule structure and integrity.
nk you for your suggestion. It is not possible to show the structure and integrity of seminiferous
ules because in our study the testicular samples were collected by fine needle aspiration cytology.
During discussion, the authors overestimate their observations based upon inadequate bibliography. It

ber and fitness was performed. Besides, it is not acceptable to relate that eventual gain to a diet effect,
ed upon data draw from a study in rat liver. If the authors want to make this connection, they must present
on mitochondrial number and function in spermatozoa’s midpiece.
nk you for giving us the opportunity to better clarify this point. In the discussion section, we aim to
vide a plausible explanation of the phenomenon observed in our study and not to compare species.
date, the relationship between nutrition and changes in the size of sperm structures is almost an
xplored topic. As a consequence, the references are extremely scarce. We believe therefore that the
rences cited in the manuscript are essential for the discussion of our findings. Moreover, all of
m deal with vertebrate animals.
Since the authors collected serum of the animals, they should quantify other hormones of the
oductive axis, in order to further characterize the maturation phase of the deer at sacrifice.
nk you for your suggestion. In this study, we evaluated the plasma testosterone levels, given the
jor role of this sexual hormone in male reproduction. Nevertheless, we have included in the
ussion that: “Despite our study was focused on the effects of high-energy diet on blood testosterone
ls, the role of other hormones like the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid hormone,
ulin, and ghrelin should be considered in future studies, given their relevance in spermatogenesis
Sertoli cell functions (Oliveira and Alves 2015)” (lines 313-315).
Although the study focuses on fallow deer, the authors must not disregard works published in other
mmal species, notably rodents and humans, where it is stated that high-energy diets lead to impaired
rm parameters and poorer fertility outcomes.
nk you for your suggestions. We include in the manuscript references about the negative effect of
sity and undernourishment in male fertility in other species (rats: Jia et al. 2018; rams: Guan et al.
4) (Lines 292-294).
I would not draw conclusions out of non-significant results as if there is a difference (e.g. testosterone
ls).
have not included in our conclusions the results about testosterone levels. We only state
oughout the discussion that there was a tendency for higher blood testosterone levels in animals fed
h barley grain than those fed with pasture only.
itionally, there are minor issues that should be addressed when rewriting the article.
Please, review the superscripts in the boxplots and state what “a” and “b” stand for.
