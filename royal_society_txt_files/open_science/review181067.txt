In their paper, Ogawa et al. investigate the pathological changes occurring in the pancreas of a
murine model of chronic graft-versus host disease by histopathology, immunohistochemistry,
electron microscopy and western blotting. To my knowledge this is the first study to do so in
such detail. Furthermore, the authors show that they are able to reverse some of the pathological
changes found in their model by administrating 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA). Although the
described positive effect of PBA on the cGVHD changes in the pancreas in particular are novel,
the authors have another paper currently being accepted (but not available for me to read),
looking at the overall beneficial aspects of PBA in cGVHD. Of note, PBA is FDA approved for
human use with a relatively good safety profile, thus the finding of this study are potentially
clinically translatable.
Despite these novel aspects, there are some major concerns with this study.
1. The authors do not discuss the current human literature of cGVHD of the pancreas, e.g. they do
not distinguish between exocrine and endocrine failure of the pancreas.
2. The authors do not discuss the short-falls of the murine model, compared to human cGVHD,
nor do they describe any clinical signs in their mice that are consistent with chronic pancreatitis,
e.g. did these mice develop diarrhoea, steatorrhoea or alteration of their blood glucose?
Therefore, the diagnosis of cGVHD is based on the histopathological, immunohistopathological
and EM analysis of the authors alone.
3. The presentation of the data is at times not convincing. The inflammatory infiltrates on the HE
staining are not clearly visible due to the size of the figure 1. Have the authors quantified the
infiltrate to allow for a more objective analysis?
4. The densitometric comparison of Figure 2 and 4 is not convincing, the authors should plot the
raw data.
What do the authors mean with data from two similar experiments are shown?
5. All p-values are given as <0.05, the exact p-values should be stated. What is the meaning of *
versus ** versus ***?
6. Figure 5, the photographs of the histopathological findings are too small to evaluate.
7. Figure 3a and Figure 6a, show blue and green staining (not red), please correct.
8. Most of the results are given in the figure legends but not in the result section, this should be
changed.
9. Better anatomical descriptions of the histopathological and EM findings should be provided.
10. The English of the manuscript should be reviewed as it is verbose at times, e.g. “Once we

Appendix A
Point-by-point responses
With sincere thanks for the time and energy you invested in reviewing our
manuscript, we would like to respond to your comments in a point-by-point
manner. Unfortunately, the main lead author Shin Mukai suffered from a
debilitating kidney disorder. Hence, the revision of our manuscript has taken
longer than expected. However, we have revised our text to the greatest extent
possible.
1. The authors do not discuss the current human literature of cGVHD of the
pancreas, e.g. they do not distinguish between exocrine and endocrine failure
of the pancreas.
To the best of our knowledge, there are few to no articles about the pancreas
affected by cGVHD. Our new-found knowledge in this study is as follows:
1) When allogeneic BMT (allo-BMT) recipient mice are untreated or treated
with a solvent vehicle, severe inflammation and fibrosis around pancreatic
ducts (exocrine glands) were observed. In addition, the size of their pancreatic
islets (endocrine glands) was reduced. These phenomena did not occur in
syngeneic BMT (syn-BMT) recipients or allo-BMT recipients treated with
PBA.
Accordingly, we placed the following statements in the main article.
Page 11, Line 249
As indicated by HE and Mallory’s staining, tissues around ducts in the
pancreas collected from allogeneic BMT recipients was excessively inflamed
in association with mononuclear cell infiltration and fibrotic in concert with
extracellular matrix accumulation. (Figure 1a, b, Supplementary Figures 1,
2) Conversely, when mice underwent syngeneic BMT, their pancreas seemed
to be virtually normal. (Figure 1a, b; Supplementary Figures 1, 2) This
finding indicated that pancreatic exocrine failure could be induced by
1
cGVHD.
Page 11, Line 259
In addition, the size of pancreatic islets was greatly reduced in the
GVHD-affected mice in contrast to that in their syngeneic control counterparts.
(Figure 1e, Supplementary Figure 4). Presumably owing to the dysfunctional
exocrine and endocrine glands,[26-28] the blood glucose levels in the
cGVHD-affected mice was substantially greater than those in the syngeneic
control subjects. (P = 0.000029) (Figure 1f)
Page 14, Line 325
The HE and Mallory pictures suggested that areas around pancreatic ducts in
PBA-medicated pancreas was less inflamed and fibrotic compared with its
vehicle-medicated partner. (Figure 5a, b, Supplementary Figures 11, 12).
Page 14, Line 332
Furthermore, pancreatic islets in the PBA-treated allo-BMT recipient mice
were larger than those in their vehicle-treated counterparts. (Figure 5e,
Supplementary Figure 15) Presumably, as a result of the protection of
exocrine and endocrine glands, the blood glucose levels in the PBA-medicated
allo-BMT recipients were normal in contrast to those in their
vehicle-medicated equivalents. (P = 2.2 x 10-7) (Figure 5f)
Page 16, Line 372
In particular, severe inflammation and fibrosis around pancreatic ducts were
induced, and pancreatic islets were shrunk. Previous reports indicated that
exocrine failure as well as endocrine failure in the pancreas could result in
diabetes.[26-28] Hence, it is conceivable that the exocrine and endocrine
failure in cGVHD-affected pancreas resulted in diabetes-like symptoms and
thereby the blood glucose levels in mice with cGVHD were augmented.
2. The authors do not discuss the short-falls of the murine model, compared to
human cGVHD, nor do they describe any clinical signs in their mice that are
2
consistent with chronic pancreatitis, e.g. did these mice develop diarrhoea,
steatorrhoea or alteration of their blood glucose? Therefore, the diagnosis of
cGVHD is based on the histopathological, immunohistopathological and EM
analysis of the authors alone.
With regard to the dependability of the mouse model used in this study, we
placed the following sentences in the Discussion section.
Page 16, Line 364
As demonstrated by our previous investigation, the pathogenic processes of
lacrimal gland cGVHD in this murine model were similar to those in patients
with cGVHD [3, 33-35]. As with the human lacrimal glands affected by
cGVHD, abnormal inflammation and fibrosis were observed in their murine
counterparts. In addition, previous reports demonstrated that inflammation and
fibrosis were induced systemically in this mouse model [3, 34, 36]. Therefore,
we examined the development of pancreatic cGVHD utilizing this murine
model.
In response to your comment on clinical signs, we solicited the Japanese
company, Sanritsu Zelkova (Kanagawa, Japan), to measure blood glucose
levels. The results indicated that the blood glucose levels in untreated
all-BMT recipients and BMT-recipients treated with the solvent vehicle were
significantly higher than those in syn-BMT recipients and allo-BMT recipients
treated with PBA. Accordingly, we placed the following statement in the main
text and showed the results in Figures 1f, 5f.
Page 10, Line 238
(f) Measurement of blood glucose levels
Blood glucose levels were measured by the Japanese company, Sanritsu
Zelkova (Kanagawa, Japan). The measurement was conducted with the use of
a kit (27E1X80166000006, LSI Medience, Japan).

3. The presentation of the data is at times not convincing. The inflammatory
infiltrates on the HE staining are not clearly visible due to the size of the
figure 1. Have the authors quantified the infiltrate to allow for a more
objective analysis?
The enlarged version of Figure 1 has been shown in Supplementary Figures
1, 2, 3, 4, 7.
Furthermore, we carried out immunostaining for CD45+ cells and determined
the number of immune cell infiltrates. Accordingly, the following sentences
have been placed in the Method section.
Page 7 Line 156
As for the counting of CD45+ cells, five areas of each tissue section were
randomly photographed under 200× magnification, and the number of CD45+
cells in the individual images was subsequently determined.
4. The densitometric comparison of Figure 2 and 4 is not convincing, the
authors should plot the raw data.
The raw data and instructions on how to see the data have been provided.
What do the authors mean with data from two similar experiments are shown?
We replaced the sentence with ‘Results are representative of 2 independently
performed experiments with similar results.’
5. All p-values are given as <0.05, the exact p-values should be stated. What
is the meaning of * versus ** versus ***?
The exact P-values have been stated in the figures.
6. Figure 5, the photographs of the histopathological findings are too small to
evaluate.
Their enlarged versions have been shown in Supplementary Figures 11, 12,
13, 15, 18.
4
7. Figure 3a and Figure 6a, show blue and green staining (not red), please
correct.
According to your suggestion, the mistakes have been corrected.
8. Most of the results are given in the figure legends but not in the result
section, this should be changed.
As with some other research articles, P-values have been placed where
applicable in the Results section.
Page 11, Line 256
Immunostaining for the generic leukocyte marker CD45 also revealed that
abnormal immune cell migration was observed in the cGVHD-disordered
pancreas by contrast with its syngeneic control equivalent. (P = 0.00038)
(Figure 1c, d, Supplementary Figure 3)
Page 11, Line 261
Presumably owing to the dysfunctional exocrine and endocrine glands,[26-28]
the blood glucose levels in the cGVHD-affected mice was substantially
greater than those in the syngeneic control subjects. (P = 0.000029) (Figure
1f)
Page 11, Line 266
Our data indicated that these two markers were expressed at higher level in
the cGVHD-affected pancreas compared with its syngeneic control partner.
(IL-6: P = 6.9 x 10-5, CTGF: P = 1.2 x 10-4) (Supplementary Figures 5, 6)
Page 12, Line 280
As judged by immunoblot analysis, the ER stress markers in the
cGVHD-affected pancreas were expressed at higher level than its syngeneic
control partner. (GRP78: P = 1.3 x 10-5, CHOP: P = 2.0 x 10-4, p-PERK: P =
6.0 x 10-6, p-eIF2<U+F061>:<U+F020>P = 2.4 x 10-4<U+F02C> p-IRE1<U+F061>: P = 0.0012) (Figure 2a, b,
Supplementary Figure 8a-e)
5
Page 12, Line 284
As a consequence of the activation of ER stress signalling pathways, the
following two inflammation-related molecules were elevated and/or activated
in the cGVHD-disordered pancreas in contrast to its syngeneic control
counterpart: NF-<U+F06B>B and TXNIP. (NF-<U+F06B>B: P = 3.9 x 10-7, TXNIP: P = 4.9 x
10-6) (Figure 2a, b, Supplementary Figure 8f, g)
Page 13, Line 299
As shown by immunohistochemical and immunoblot assays, the expression of
the EMT indicator E-cadherin in the cGVHD-affected pancreas was decreased
in contrast to that in its syngeneic control equivalent. (P = 0.0016) (Figure
3a-c, Supplementary Figure 9a)
Page 13, Line 302
Moreover, immunoblot analysis indicated that the EMT markers <U+F061>-smooth
muscle actin (<U+F061>-SMA) and Snail in the cGVHD-affected pancreas were
expressed at higher level than those in their syngeneic control partners.
(<U+F061>-SMA: P = 0.0084, Snail: P = 0.022) (Figure 3b, c, Supplementary Figure
9b, c)
Page 13, Line 312
As judged by immunoblot analysis, the pancreas collected from the
PBA-treated mice displayed the lower protein levels of GRP78, CHOP,
p-PERK, p-eIF2<U+F061><U+F02C><U+F020>and p-IRE1<U+F061><U+F020>compared with that collected from their
vehicle-treated counterparts. (GRP78: P = 3.0 x 10-8, CHOP: P = 5.7 x 10-7,
p-PERK: P = 4.4 x 10-7, p-eIF2<U+F061>:<U+F020>P = 1.3 x 10-5<U+F02C> p-IRE1<U+F061>: P = 5.4 x 10-4)
(Figure 4a, b, Supplementary Figure 10a-e)
Page 14, Line 317
As a consequence, the proinflammatory molecules NF-<U+F06B>B and TXNIP, which
are in the downstream of ER stress signalling pathways, were repressed in the
pancreas treated with PBA in comparison to its vehicle-treated equivalent.
6
(NF-<U+F06B>B: P = 1.2 x 10-5, TXNIP: P = 1.9 x 10-4) (Figure 4a, b,
Supplementary Figure 10f, g)
Page 14, Line 327
In addition, immunohistochemical analysis showed (1) that the number of
immune cells in the PBA-injected pancreas was vastly lower than that in its
vehicle-injected equivalent (P = 0.005) (Figure 5c, d, Supplementary Figure
13)
Page 14, Line 334
Presumably, as a result of the protection of exocrine and endocrine glands, the
blood glucose levels in the PBA-medicated allo-BMT recipients were normal
in contrast to those in their vehicle-medicated equivalents. (P = 2.2 x 10-7)
(Figure 5f)
Page 14, Line 337
Immunoblot analysis of IL-6 and CTGF also indicated that systemic injection
of PBA suppressed cGVHD-elicited inflammation and fibrosis in contrast to
the solvent-vehicle. (IL-6: P = 6.9 x 10-7, CTGF: P = 1.6 x10-8)
(Supplementary Figures 16, 17)
Page 15, Line 349
We subsequently investigated whether PBA could suppress EMT, which were
conceivably associated with excessive fibrosis in the pancreas affected by
cGVHD. Immunohistochemistry and immunoblot analysis revealed that
E-cadherin was retained in the PBA-treated pancreas in contrast to its
vehicle-treated counterpart. (P = 7.4 x 10-4) (Figure 6a-c, Supplementary
Figure 19a)
Page 15, Line 353
In addition, the protein level of <U+F061>-SMA and snail in the PBA-medicated
7
pancreas seemed to be normal, whereas <U+F061>-SMA and Snail was overexpressed
in its vehicle-medicated partner. (<U+F061>-SMA: P = 0.0019 and Snail: P = 0.0082)
(Figure 6b, c, Supplementary Figure 19b, c)
9. Better anatomical descriptions of the histopathological and EM findings
should be provided.
The following statements regarding the histopathological and EM findings
have been added to the main article.
Page 11, Line 249
As indicated by HE and Mallory’s staining, tissues around ducts in the
pancreas collected from allogeneic BMT recipients was excessively inflamed
in association with mononuclear cell infiltration and fibrotic in concert with
extracellular matrix accumulation. (Figure 1a, b, Supplementary Figures 1,
2) Conversely, when mice underwent syngeneic BMT, their pancreas seemed
to be virtually normal. (Figure 1a, b; Supplementary Figures 1, 2) This
finding indicated that pancreatic exocrine failure could be induced by
cGVHD.
Page 11, Line 259
In addition, the size of pancreatic islets was greatly reduced in the
GVHD-affected mice in contrast to that in their syngeneic control counterparts.
(Figure 1e, Supplementary Figure 4). Presumably owing to the dysfunctional
exocrine and endocrine glands,[26-28] the blood glucose levels in the
cGVHD-affected mice was substantially greater than those in the syngeneic
control subjects. (P = 0.000029) (Figure 1f)
Page 12, Line 270
The electron micrographs of cGVHD-affected pancreatic epithelia suggested
(1) that the ER was abnormally expanded and distorted owing to aberrant
accumulation of proteins and (2) that the walls of blood vessels in the stroma
were extremely thin in association with multiple fenestrations and (3) that the
cristae of mitochondria in acinar cells were distorted and damaged and (4) that
8
the mitochondria were expanded. (Figure 1g, Supplementary Figure 7)
Page 14, Line 325
The HE and Mallory pictures suggested that areas around pancreatic ducts in
PBA-medicated pancreas was less inflamed and fibrotic compared with its
vehicle-medicated partner. (Figure 5a, b, Supplementary Figures 11, 12).
Page 14, Line 332
Furthermore, pancreatic islets in the PBA-treated allo-BMT recipient mice
were larger than those in their vehicle-treated counterparts. (Figure 5e,
Supplementary Figure 15) Presumably, as a result of the protection of
exocrine and endocrine glands, the blood glucose levels in the PBA-medicated
allo-BMT recipients were normal in contrast to those in their
vehicle-medicated equivalents. (P = 2.2 x 10-7) (Figure 5f)
Page 14, Line 340
Moreover, judging from electron micrographic analysis, pancreatic epithelia
treated with PBA had almost normal structure of ER, blood vessels and
mitochondria. (Figure 5g, Supplementary Figure 18) In contrast, in
vehicle-treated pancreatic epithelia, the ER appeared to be expanded due to
abnormal accumulation of proteins, the wall of a capillary was extremely thin,
and mitochondria seemed to be damaged and lose their cristae. (Figure 5g,
Supplementary Figure 18)
Page 16, Line 372
In particular, severe inflammation and fibrosis around pancreatic ducts were
induced, and pancreatic islets were shrunk. Previous reports indicated that
exocrine failure as well as endocrine failure in the pancreas could result in
diabetes.[26-28] Hence, it is conceivable that the exocrine and endocrine
failure in cGVHD-affected pancreas resulted in diabetes-like symptoms and
thereby the blood glucose levels in mice with cGVHD were augmented.
Page 16, Line 384
9
Furthermore, our electron microscopic examination into pancreas disordered
by cGVHD suggested (1) that the ER in the cGVHD-affected epithelia was
expanded owing to accumulation of proteins, (2) the blood vessels were
seriously demolished and (3) mitochondria in the epithelia were severely
damaged.
Page 18, Line 417
Especially, PBA treatment subdued inflammation and fibrosis around
pancreatic ducts, prevented pancreatic islets from shrinking and retained
normal blood glucose levels in all-BMT recipient mice.
Page 17, Line 419
Electron microscopic assays also underpinned our claim by showing that PBA
kept the ER, blood vessels and mitochondria in pancreatic epithelia virtually
intact.
10. The English of the manuscript should be reviewed as it is verbose at times,
e.g. “Once we gleaned these outcomes of medical importance” ; “we
endeavored’’; “this fact urged us to carry out groundbreaking research”;
As suggested, we have modified the following sentences in order to make
them more succinct and less self-congratulatory.
Page 17, Line 409
Once we gleaned these outcomes of medical importance, we subsequently
endeavored to treat pancreatic cGVHD.
Revised Sentence) With these outcomes, we subsequently attempted to
treat pancreatic cGVHD.
Page 3, Line 80
This fact urged us to carry out ground-breaking research on cGVHD in the
10
pancreas.
Revised Sentence) This fact urged us to gain more insights into cGVHD in
the pancreas.
11. Figure 7 should be omitted and instead can be discussed in the text, as it is
speculative and the study has not been designed to confirm the suggestions
made in the figure.
We have removed Figure 7.
