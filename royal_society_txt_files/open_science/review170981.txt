This manuscript reports the preparation of Fe5C2/Fe7C3-filled CNOs material using CVD
method. In addition, the small quantity of sulfur during the pyrolysis of ferrocene allows for the
controllable CNOs synthesis. This manuscript should consider the following points before its
acceptance.
1. Does Sulfur get involved in the formation of Fe2S in the process of the pyrolysis of ferrocene?
XPS and Elemental analysis are recommended to corroborate whether Fe2S exists or not. Given
the unclear existence of Fe2S, I think it’s inappropriate to draw a conclusion that based on the fact
that Fe2S active area changes the thermodynamics of CNTs nucleation.
2. The author claimed that there are no magnetic phase transitions in the temperature region from
65K to 70K, the conclusion would be much more convincing if other supportive details are
available.
3. The author compared the differences of electric properties between few shell Fe7C3/Fe5C2-
CNOs and multishell Fe3C-CNOs, while the same contrasts weren’t shown in the magnetic
properties. I think the same contrasts are required to maintain consistency.
4. The Fe5C2/Fe7C3-filled CNOs material is not related to fullerene at all. Therefore, the term of
fullerene in title and main text should be deleted.

This is an interesting paper describing the formation of carbon onions encapsulating
ferromagnetic Fe5C2 and Fe7C3 that would otherwise not exist. The results described in this
manuscript could be attractive enough for the readers of this journal after the revisions by
considering the comments and request below.

1) This paper describes that you succeeded in the diameter and thickness control of the onions.
However, carbon onions of various sizes are shown in the TEM images. Please consider showing
the size and thickness distribution of the onions.
2) Can you show the EDS or EELS mapping of the images? Are there possibilities that sulfur may
form some sulfides, which could influence on the results of the measurements? The elemental
mapping would be helpful to consider the origin of remaining questions.
3) You observed that the magnetic behaviors of the onions depend on the number of the shells.
You insist that the dependence originates from the curvature and hybridization in the shells with
small diameters. However, this part is highly speculative. I think there is still a lot of work
needed, in particular with the computations. Please consider DFT computation of the onions with
small diameters.

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript reports the preparation of Fe5C2/Fe7C3-filled CNOs material using CVD method.
In addition, the small quantity of sulfur during the pyrolysis of ferrocene allows for the controllabl
e CNOs synthesis. This manuscript should consider the following points before its acceptance.
We thank the reviewer for his/her comments
1.
Does Sulfur get involved in the formation of Fe2S in the process of the pyrolysis of ferrocene? XPS
and Elemental analysis are recommended to corroborate whether Fe2S exists or not. Given the u
nclear existence of Fe2S, I think it’s inappropriate to draw a conclusion that based on the fact that
Fe2S active area changes the thermodynamics of CNTs nucleation.
We thank the reviewer for his/her comments. Unfortunately XPS facilities are currently
unavailable to us but we successfully performed EDX analyses in STEM mode, as shown in
supplementary information. These analyses clearly show the presence of small quantities of
sulfur within the CNOs. These results are in agreement with previous reports on CNTs (ref. 20 and
21) where small quantities of sulfur were reported by EDX in STEM mode. The presence of small
quantities of sulfur can indeed strongly change the thermodynamics of CNTs nucleation and lead
to formation of localized Fe-S-Fe eutectic areas. In our case, due to the very small % sulfur and
the very high content of Fe is difficult to observe the sulfur distribution with STEM since the
image will appear very bright (due to the high content of Fe).

The following comments have been added in the manuscript:
‘‘ Note that a previous report on superparamagnetic Fe7C3 did not show magnetic phase transitions in
the T-range above17. Also a recent report has demonstrated that Fe5C2 particles with similar
dimensions exhibited a ferromagnetic behaviour, therefore also for this type of phase no magnetic
transition is expected in the T-range above25. Note that the (room temperature) magnetic properties
reported in this work are also comparable with those of Fe3C filled CNOs where a saturation
magnetization in the order of 42 emu/g was reported14. However Fe3C filled CNOs present a much
higher coercivity and saturation magnetization at low temperatures14 (see also references 23-24 for
ZFC and FC studies23-24) due to the absence of exchange coupling phenomena. This latter
observation is in agreement with our observations where an unusual decrease in the saturation
magnetization is found with the decrease of the temperature.’’
3.
The author compared the differences of electric properties between few shell Fe7C3/Fe5C2-CNO
s and multishell Fe3C-CNOs, while the same contrasts weren’t shown in the magnetic properties.
I think the same contrasts are required to maintain consistency.
We thank the reviewer for his/her comments. Unfortunately our VSM and SQUID facilities are
currently unavailable due to multiple instrumental issues. However in order to cover this issue
the addition of new references and comparisons has been considered. See references 14, 23 and
24.
The following sentences have been added in the manuscript:
‘‘Note that the (room temperature) magnetic properties reported in this work are also comparable
with those of Fe3C filled CNOs where a saturation magnetization in the order of 42 emu/g was

an unusual decrease in the saturation magnetization is found with the decrease of the temperature.’’
4.
The Fe5C2/Fe7C3-filled CNOs material is not related to fullerene at all. Therefore, the term of full
erene in title and main text should be deleted.
We thank the reviewer for his/her comments. This has been done.

3) You observed that the magnetic behaviors of the onions depend on the number of the shells. Y
ou insist that the dependence originates from the curvature and hybridization in the shells with s
mall diameters. However, this part is highly speculative. I think there is still a lot of work needed, i
n particular with the computations. Please consider DFT computation of the onions with small dia
meters.
We thank the reviewer for his/her comments. Our comments related to the effect of the number
of shells were mainly on the electric properties. We suggested that the curvature may play an
important role on the control of the electric properties of the CNOs. While the magnetic
contribution mainly comes from the encapsulated ferromagnets Fe7C3/Fe5C2. The reviewer is
right, and more work needs to be performed from a computational perspective in order to better
understand the effect of curvature on the electric and magnetic properties of these structures.
We will surely consider DFT computations in our future works.
