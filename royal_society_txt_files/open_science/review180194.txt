I find this a very interesting manuscript which I think makes a major theoretical contribution to
the understanding of attention allocation in driving as well as other naturalistic tasks. In my
view, the core idea that the allocation of attention is governed to action uncertainty is spot on and
the computational model offers an explicit mechanistic account of how this may work. The model
also opens up for many novel practical applications, such as simulating the underlying causes of
rear-end crashes.
Given the important theoretical contribution of the manuscript, I would have liked to see more
discussion of how the proposed model is related to existing theories, including conceptual driver
models such as the classical zero-risk theory developed by the 6th author as well as modern
cognitive science and neuroscience models which are based on very similar principles as the
proposed model. Some of these models are mentioned in the Discussion but not further
discussion “for brievity”. Some examples of the latter include the “Bayesian brain hypothesis”
(e.g., Knill and Pouget, 2004), predictive processing/coding (Clark, 2017) or the free energy
principle (e.g., Feldman and Friston, 2010). Engstrom et al. (2018) offer an application of
predictive processing to driving which seem based on very similar ideas as the proposed model.
My main concern with the manuscript is that I find the description if the model somewhat
incomplete and hard to understand in places. I appreciate that the idea was to first introduce the
model on a conceptual level in section 2 and then provide mathematical detail in section 3.
However, I found it hard to understand some of the key ideas from the conceptual description
only which was somewhat frustrating. Thus, either the conceptual description needs to be
substantially more detailed or the mathematical description in section 3 moved into section 2. I’m
leaning towards the latter option as some of the concepts are hard to explain without providing
the equations.
More specifically, here are some of the items I think need to be better explained:
116-117: “…driver’s internal model of the environment dynamics consists of predicted leader
acceleration aL and an ”efference copy” of the driver’s own desired acceleration…”. It is unclear
how the model “consists” of the acceleration and efference copy variables. I guess it is the model
that produces values of these variables.
135: The concept of “visual flow”, later referred to as “environment flow” is never explained.
First, I think “optical flow” is the correct term. Second, please provide a brief explanation of this
concept, possibly referring to references on speed perception such as Larish and Flach, 1990).
138: What is the function relating distance to precision in perception?
130-131: How does the update of the state estimate based on evaluation of predicted percepts
against actual percepts work. I could not find any explanation of this neither in section 2, not
section 3.
352-377: Please provide some more detail on the model parameterization. In particular, how was
the data combined with simulation to obtain the parameters?
I also have some comments on the Results and Discussion section:
401-404: What could be a possible reason for the discrepancy to the results from the previous
study?
408-410: “The overall level of speed, time headway and occlusion duration is replicated quite well
by the model, but this is to be expected as aggregate (median) values of these are used for
3
calibration.” I find this sentence unclear. In particular, what is meant by “calibration”?
Figure 7: I don’t understand how the occlusion duration can be represented as a continuous
signal. Please clarify.
529-531: The statement “In the very least the intermittency and imperfection in the state
estimation and control are complementary and – especially regarding the attentional mechanisms
– probably cause synergistic effects.” is interesting but it is not clear in what way the models are
complementary and what the potential synergistic effects are. Please expand.
There are also a relatively large number of typos and other editorial errors. Below are the ones I
spotted, but I would strongly suggest a thorough proof-reading.
41: “…performance OF the actual driving task”
108: Reference to “section i” does not make sense. Should be something like “3.c.i” (I assume the
proper reference format is given in the journal style guides)
136 write out “w.r.t”
142: “estimate” -> “estimated”
240: “cars speed” -> “vehicle speed”
240: Suggest rephrasing “At the cars front was a laser scanner (IBEO Lux)…” to “A laser scanner
(IBEO Lux) was mounted at the vehicle’s front…”
266: “…gray rectangle was displayed…” remove “was”
271: “…front like the you” remove “the”
286: “After this,the” add space
294: “…comfortable AND waited”
307: “Approximate “steady state” -> An approximate “steady state’””
311-312: These were further processed to speeds, accelerations and relative distances without
further prosessing.” This sentence does not make sense. Also, correct spelling of “processing”.
322: “internal scene representation” I suppose this should be “state representation” to be
consistent with the terminology used above
330: “driver acceleration, or leader volatility” I assume it should be “leader acceleration”. Also, I
think the term “leader volatility” needs to be further explained.
332: ”…copy of THE driver’s…”
362: The “IDM” acronym needs to be introduced above
364: “be systematically to…” is incomplete. Do you mean “be systematically related to…”
272: Replace “than” with “to those that”
435: “with” -> “and”
446: “it’s” -> “it is”
453: ”than THEY would”
470: “state estimate uncertainty” -> “state estimates of uncertainty”
489: Remove the first “correlation”

In this paper, the authors propose a novel car-following model explicitely taking into account the
driver's imperfect perception and his or her internal cognitive state. Basically, this is a worthy
contribution. However, there are several technical and conceptual inconsistencies and obviously
wrong or poorly explained equations. Finally the state of the art review is incomplete. Some
specific points follow.
(1) When dealing with car-following models implementing genuinely human aspects, one should
also mention modeling approaches based on the perceived risk using prospect theory or
maximization of classic expected utility. In these models, the driver choses a local action
(acceleration, deceleration, steering) so as to maximize the expected utility (or the expectation of
the prospect-theoretic perceived utility) by weighting the time savings against the risk of crashes,
see, e.g., [Samer H. Hamdar, Hani S. Mahmassani, and Martin Treiber, Transportation Research
Part B: Methodological 78, 32-53].
(2) The model's internal state/scene variables should be described in a better way. Specifically, I
did not find a precise mathematical specification for the time instants where the model "requests
a visual sample" as mentioned in the caption of Fig. 2. Finally, the acceleration spikes (e.g., the
acceleration drop from near zero to -3 m/s^2 for a few milliseconds and then back) are utterly
unrealistic, regardless of whether the physical or perceived values are meant.
(3) The authors do not bring convincing arguments for assuming the visual flow to be logarithmic
with the speed meaning that a speed difference between 5 km/h and 10 km/h is perceived
similarly as that between 50 km/h and 100 km/h which is somewhat inplausible.
(4) The mathematical specification seems to be erroneous. For example, assuming a width u of the
leading vehicle and a longitudinal distance d+d0 between the driver's eyes and the back bumper,
the visual angle of that leader is given by
phi=2*tan^{-1}(0.5*u/(d0+d)) (1)
5
not by
phi=2*tan^{-1}(2*l/(d0+d))
(the vehicle length is totally irrelevant for that angle)
Interestingly, when defining v_{phi}=d(phi)/dt, the last equation of (3.1) is the correct time
derivative of Eq (1) above. However, to my knowledge, people perceive the *relative* rate of
change R=v_{phi}/phi which, interestingly, is directly given by the inverse of the time-to-
collision. The equations need to be corrected and the perception physio-psychology (v_{phi} or R?
) needs to be discussed.
(5) several errors in the unnumbered update equations between the lines 337 and 338. For
example, the first one should read
\hat{d}[i]=\hat{d}[i-1]+\hat{r}[i-1]*delta t
in the second one, one equates a number (lhs) with a distribution (rhs), i.e., apples with bananas.
This one should read
\hat{v}[i] \sim N(E(\hat{v}[i-1])+\bar{a}*delta t, (\lambda*\bar{a}*delta t)^2)
or similar. The next ones seem to be erroneous as well.
(6) Fig. 5: There are many data points with time headways above 4 s which is unrealistic for not
freely driving drivers (the driver follows a leader). I wonder if these data points belong to free
traffic or to the car-following regime.
Minor
The presentation should be improved. For example, at the end of the top-level paragraph of
Section 2, a reference to Section i is mentioned. In reality, it is Section 3(c)i. In Fig. 2, there are
several scene variables, not only one, etc

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
I think the authors has done a great job in addressing my previous comments and the manuscript
has been greatly improved with the new revision.
My only remaining technical comment concerns the presentation of the predictive processing
(PP) framework versus the model developed by Markkula et al ref [70], where the former was
added response to one of my previous comments. In the revision, these are both addressed in
Section 5.2 named “The predictive processing perspective”. However, I think it is incorrect to put
the model described in ref. [70] under the heading of predictive processing, as it has been
developed quite independently of the PP framework (although, as discussed in ref. [70], it
incorporates ideas from, and can be viewed as compatible with, PP). In particular, the key
concepts of intermittent control and evidence accumulation in [70] are not directly related to PP.
Moreover, the “criticism” (that I think is well-taken) that the Markkula et al. model [70] does not
account for “higher-level” predictions (and does not entail a cognitive state representation) does
not apply to PP. Rather, in PP (and the Bayesian brain hypothesis) such a state (or prior)
representation maintained by the generative model is a central feature.
Thus, I would suggest moving the first part of section 5.2 (lines 642-658) to the end of section 5.1
and make the point that many of the key features of the present model (as well as ZRT) are
strongly related to PP and thus well-grounded in modern cognitive neuroscience (which I think is
12
a great strength of the model). Section 5.2 can then be entirely devoted to discussing the specific
relation to the Markkula et al. model (changing the title accordingly).

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
I think the authors has done a great job in addressing my previous comments and the manuscript
has been greatly improved with the new revision.
My only remaining technical comment concerns the presentation of the predictive processing
(PP) framework versus the model developed by Markkula et al ref [70], where the former was
added response to one of my previous comments. In the revision, these are both addressed in
Section 5.2 named “The predictive processing perspective”. However, I think it is incorrect to put
the model described in ref. [70] under the heading of predictive processing, as it has been
developed quite independently of the PP framework (although, as discussed in ref. [70], it
incorporates ideas from, and can be viewed as compatible with, PP). In particular, the key
concepts of intermittent control and evidence accumulation in [70] are not directly related to PP.
Moreover, the “criticism” (that I think is well-taken) that the Markkula et al. model [70] does not
account for “higher-level” predictions (and does not entail a cognitive state representation) does
not apply to PP. Rather, in PP (and the Bayesian brain hypothesis) such a state (or prior)
representation maintained by the generative model is a central feature.
Thus, I would suggest moving the first part of section 5.2 (lines 642-658) to the end of section 5.1
and make the point that many of the key features of the present model (as well as ZRT) are
strongly related to PP and thus well-grounded in modern cognitive neuroscience (which I think is
a great strength of the model). Section 5.2 can then be entirely devoted to discussing the specific
relation to the Markkula et al. model (changing the title accordingly).

Appendix A
We thank the reviewers for their comments on the manuscript. As an overview of
changes we made in response, we added discussion on several pointed out topics,
merged the formal and conceptual descriptions of the model and made the
mathematical discussion more rigorous.
We have addressed the individual issues raised as follows:
> *Reviewer #1*:
> Given the important theoretical contribution of the manuscript, I would have liked
to see more discussion of how the proposed model is related to existing theories,
including conceptual driver models such as the classical zero-risk theory developed
by the 6th author as well as modern cognitive science and neuroscience models
which are based on very similar principles as the proposed model. Some of these
models are mentioned in the Discussion but not further discussion “for brievity”.
Some examples of the latter include the “Bayesian brain hypothesis” (e.g., Knill and
Pouget, 2004), predictive processing/coding (Clark, 2017) or the free energy
principle (e.g., Feldman and Friston, 2010). Engstrom et al. (2018) offer an
application of predictive processing to driving which seem based on very similar
ideas as the proposed model.
The traffic psychological models are now introduced in section 1.2 and discussed in
relation to the current model in section 5.1. The modern cognitive science and
computational neuroscience perspective is now discussed in section 5.2.
> *Reviewer #1*
> My main concern with the manuscript is that I find the description if the model
somewhat incomplete and hard to understand in places. I appreciate that the idea
was to first introduce the model on a conceptual level in section 2 and then provide
mathematical detail in section 3. However, I found it hard to understand some of
the key ideas from the conceptual description only which was somewhat frustrating.
Thus, either the conceptual description needs to be substantially more detailed or
the mathematical description in section 3 moved into section 2. I’m leaning towards
the latter option as some of the concepts are hard to explain without providing the
equations.
We have now incorporated the mathematical description with the conceptual
description of section 2. We've tried to keep the conceptual description to be
understandable also without the formalism by concentrating the mathematical
detail in the end of each subsection.
> *Reviewer #1*
> More specifically, here are some of the items I think need to be better explained:
> 116-117: “…driver’s internal model of the environment dynamics consists of
predicted leader acceleration aL and an ”efference copy” of the driver’s own desired
acceleration…”. It is unclear how the model “consists” of the acceleration and
efference copy variables. I guess it is the model that produces values of these
variables.
It is indeed so that the model produces these values based on the model and its
previous acceleration. We have now rephrased this in section 2.1 as (mathematical
symbols omitted due to typographical constraints):
"The driver has also a stochastic model of some of the environments dynamics,
namely
predicted leader acceleration ... and an ”efference copy” ... of the own desired
acceleration
at the previous time instant (see section 2.3), which the driver considers a noisy
version of the
actuated acceleration"
> *Reviewer #1*
> 135: The concept of “visual flow”, later referred to as “environment flow” is never
explained. First, I think “optical flow” is the correct term. Second, please provide a
brief explanation of this concept, possibly referring to references on speed
perception such as Larish and Flach, 1990).
We changed the term to "optical flow" throughout, added reference to Larish and
Flach, 1990, and now briefly explain it in section 2.2:
"Own movement in a textured environment produces a visual movement pattern,
or optic flow, whose magnitude F is related to the landspeed v"
> *Reviewer #1*
> 138: What is the function relating distance to precision in perception?
We added Figure 3 to illustrate the relationship between the state variables
and typical estimation error of a single sample. The resulting error distributions
are rather complex and apart from the own speed estimate likely don't admit to
simple
closed form solutions, but we hope that the figure clarifies the relationships
sufficiently.
> *Reviewer #1*
> 130-131: How does the update of the state estimate based on evaluation of
predicted percepts against actual percepts work. I could not find any explanation of
this neither in section 2, not section 3.
This was indeed not well explained. We now elaborate on it in section 2.2
conceptually:
"The evaluation can be seen as giving more weight to the states that ”predicted” the
observed percept better, while taking account the inaccuracies of the perceptual
system and what is known about how the environment should behave."
and define it formally in equations 2.8 and 2.9.
> *Reviewer #1*
> 352-377: Please provide some more detail on the model parameterization. In
particular, how was the data combined with simulation to obtain the parameters?
We have now explained this in more depth in the end of section 3.3.1.
> *Reviewer #1*
> I also have some comments on the Results and Discussion section:
> 401-404: What could be a possible reason for the discrepancy to the results from
the previous study?
We now briefly discuss the possible reason in section 4.2:
"This is likely at least partly due to the more subdued speeds and accelerations of
the leading vehicle (mandated by
safety and practicalities of the real car experiment) leading to less variation in the
within-subject
time headways."
> *Reviewer #1*
> 408-410: “The overall level of speed, time headway and occlusion duration is
replicated quite well by the model, but this is to be expected as aggregate (median)
values of these are used for calibration.” I find this sentence unclear. In particular,
what is meant by “calibration”?
We've now clarified the phrasing in section 4.2:
"The overall level of speed, time headway and occlusion duration is replicated quite
well by the model, but this is to be expected as the parameter estimation procedure
optimizes the model to match per-subject aggregates (medians) of time headway
and occlusion duration and 99th percentile of acceleration."
> *Reviewer #1*
> Figure 7: I don’t understand how the occlusion duration can be represented as a
continuous signal. Please clarify.
The occlusion duration indeed is not a continuous signal. We plot it as line so that
the trends can be seen more clearly. This is now explained in the caption of what's
now Figure 8:
"The plotted occlusion duration is the duration of the occlusion following the glance
at the x-
axis indicated time, and the line is formed by linearly interpolating this value
between adjacent glance instants."
> *Reviewer #1*
> There are also a relatively large number of typos and other editorial errors. Below
are the ones I spotted, but I would strongly suggest a thorough proof-reading.
We've corrected the errors pointed out and have done additional passes of
proofreading.
> *Reviewer #2*
> (1) When dealing with car-following models implementing genuinely human
aspects, one should also mention modeling approaches based on the perceived risk
using prospect theory or maximization of classic expected utility. In these models,
the driver choses a local action (acceleration, deceleration, steering) so as to
maximize the expected utility (or the expectation of the prospect-theoretic
perceived utility) by weighting the time savings against the risk of crashes, see, e.g.,
[Samer H. Hamdar, Hani S. Mahmassani, and Martin Treiber, Transportation
Research Part B: Methodological 78, 32-53].
The section 1.1 now includes a brief review of modeling human factors in car
following models and introduces the expected utility models. Expected utility
models are also discussed further in relation to the traffic psychological models in
section 1.2 and in relation to potential future developments in section 5.1.
> *Reviewer #2*
> (2) The model's internal state/scene variables should be described in a better way.
We now introduce the state and scene variables in more detail and along with
mathematical definition in section 2.1.
> *Reviewer #2*
Specifically, I did not find a precise mathematical specification for the time instants
where the model "requests a visual sample" as mentioned in the caption of Fig. 2.
This is now described in the end of section 2.3 and mathematically specified in
equations 2.11 and 2.12.
> *Reviewer #2*
> Finally, the acceleration spikes (e.g., the acceleration drop from near zero to -3
m/s^2 for a few milliseconds and then back) are utterly unrealistic, regardless of
whether the physical or perceived values are meant.
We now elaborate on this in the caption of figure 2:
"The acceleration variable (bottom panel, green) represents the desired
acceleration of the driver based on the environment state estimate. Note that for
simplicity the model can directly control their acceleration (desired acceleration is
equal to the true acceleration), and thus can produce physically unrealistic values
and variation (see section 5.3 for further discussion)."
Section 5.3 also discusses the idealized acceleration model further.
> *Reviewer #2*
> (3) The authors do not bring convincing arguments for assuming the visual flow to
be logarithmic with the speed meaning that a speed difference between 5 km/h and
10 km/h is perceived similarly as that between 50 km/h and 100 km/h which is
somewhat inplausible.
The logarithmic relationship is indeed an idealization extrapolated from laboratory
studies reporting approximately logarithmic relationships, which are now
referenced (Larish & Flach 1990, Zanker 1995, Wei et al 2010), and the idealization
is discussed section 5.3.
> *Reviewer #2*
> (4) The mathematical specification seems to be erroneous. For example, assuming
a width u of the leading vehicle and a longitudinal distance d+d0 between the
driver's eyes and the back bumper, the visual angle of that leader is given by
>
> phi=2*tan^{-1}(0.5*u/(d0+d)) (1)
>
> not by
>
> phi=2*tan^{-1}(2*l/(d0+d))
>
> (the vehicle length is totally irrelevant for that angle)
This was indeed an error in the manuscript. The equation for the visual angle is now
corrected in equation 2.6. In the code used for the simulations the function was
correct, as can be verified in:
https://gitlab.com/mulsimco/cfmodels/blob/rsos/particlePredictor.hpp#L197
> *Reviewer #2*
> Interestingly, when defining v_{phi}=d(phi)/dt, the last equation of (3.1) is the
correct time derivative of Eq (1) above.
> However, to my knowledge, people perceive the *relative* rate of change
R=v_{phi}/phi which, interestingly, is directly given by the inverse of the time-to-
collision. The equations need to be corrected and the perception physio-psychology
(v_{phi} or R? ) needs to be discussed.
We now discuss the issue of tau versus "distance normalized angular rate" in section
5.3 and explicate the motivation of using the latter in our model due to it being
more readily compatible with the state representation.
> *Reviewer #2*
> (5) several errors in the unnumbered update equations between the lines 337 and
338. For example, the first one should read

>
> or similar. The next ones seem to be erroneous as well.
The update equations indeed used a non-standard and likely confusing notation,
where the \sim was overloaded to mean sampling from a distribution. We have now
incorporated the equations in a more rigorous form to section 2 (equations 2.1-2.5
and 2.8-2.9). The implementation as a particle filter is now discussed separately in
section 3.3.2.
> *Reviewer #2*

> The presentation should be improved. For example, at the end of the top-level
paragraph of Section 2, a reference to Section i is mentioned. In reality, it is Section
3(c)i.
The previous section labeling and references were based on the provided Latex
template. We have now adjusted the template to use
labeling similar to published RSOS articles.

We've updated the Figure 2 caption and clarified the presentation throughout the
article.
Appendix B
We thank the reviewers for their time and pointers for improving the manuscript.
We have addressed the latest comments as follows.
Reviewer 2: "However, one residual inconsistency related to Question 5 of my
previous report remain: The mathematical notation of (2.3) and (2.4) is still
somewhat unorthodox, at least when assuming that the past state, e.g., \hat{v}(t-
Delta t) is a number and not a distribution."
We agree that the proposed notation clarifies the separation between a variable
and its distribution and we have updated the equations 2.3 and 2.4 as suggested,
although we keep the original variable names \hat{a}[t] and \hat{a}_L[t].
Reviewer 2: "Finally, I wonder why the variance of the own acceleration increases
with the expectation while that of the leader does not."
The rationale is now explained in a footnote: "The magnitude-related noise is
formalization of an assumption that the efference copy prediction follows similar
magnitude-related precision as most other perceptual processes. Intuitively, it is
assumed that outcomes of smaller control adjustments are predicted more
accurately than of larger adjustments. See 5.4 for further discussion of magnitude-
related precision."
Reviewer 1: "Thus, I would suggest moving the first part of section 5.2 (lines 642-
658) to the end of section 5.1 and make the point that many of the key features of
the present model (as well as ZRT) are strongly related to PP and thus well-
grounded in modern cognitive neuroscience (which I think is a great strength of the
model). Section 5.2 can then be entirely devoted to discussing the specific relation
to the Markkula et al. model (changing the title accordingly)."
The Markkula et al. and related models are now discussed separately from the
Predictive Processing framework in the new section 5.3. The PP framework
discussion is now in its own section 5.2.
