Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
For decades, two linear transmission functions have dominated the literature, even though
intermediate nonlinear transmission functions might be more biologically realistic and tend to
provide better descriptions of empirical datasets. But does it matter if we use linear vs. nonlinear
transmission functions? Here, Borremans et al. use stochastic model simulations to show that the
choice of linear vs. nonlinear transmission function has important implications for pathogen
invasion and persistence probabilities. Though previous studies have considered how
transmission functions differentially affect model dynamics and stability, Borremans et al.
provide what is probably the most comprehensive demonstration to date, and their use of
empirically-derived contact functions makes their model output particular meaningful. This work
is important and well-written, and the topic should be of broad interest to researchers working
with epidemiological models.
For the most part, I can confirm that this work is technically sound. However, there are a few
important details that I would like to challenge (i.e., use of the fitting constant and use of constant
population densities – see below). It might be that these details *are* technically sound, but that
they need to be better justified/described in the manuscript to improve communication to the
reader. If so, they’ll be quick fixes. If these details are not technically sound, then the simulations
need to be re-done without a fitting constant and/or with variable population densities. Those
revisions are straightforward and do-able, but they would be time-consuming. Therefore, I’m
recommending that this manuscript be accepted pending major revisions.
Great work! I’m looking forward to seeing this published so that I can cite it in my future papers.

The fitting constant, qi
I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around the fitting constant used in your models. The
fitting constant is used to “ensure[s] that a certain model result or parameter is equal for each
function.” But the point of your study is that contact rates and thus transmission rates vary with
density, and different models incorporate density differently, and thus I do not understand why
you want the transmission rates (Betas) to be the same across models. It seems to me that since
you already known the biologically appropriate contact function, you should be able to multiply
c(N) by p to get the relevant transmission rate. My concern is that your approach might be
inappropriate, and could be spuriously creating one of your main results: that the prevalence of
infection does not differ appreciably among three of the transmission functions. There might be a
good reason to use the fitting constant that I’m missing, but if so, you’ll need to justify in more
detail why the fitting constant is necessary, so that it is easier for readers to understand.
Density vs. population size
Line 136: Do you mean that population size/density is constant (b = mu)? Or that the initial
population size resets each year and varies through the year? If population size/density is
actually temporally constant, then it doesn’t make sense to consider contact functions that vary
with density, unless you’re comparing across population that vary in density across space. But
given my next comment, it doesn’t seem like you’re varying densities across simulations/space,
either…
Lines 217-226: I think that exploring the effects of variable population size and density is
interesting and potentially informative. However, this paragraph seems to say that you kept
density constant while manipulating population size? Again, if true, then it doesn’t make sense to
consider contact functions that vary with density. If you actually varied density, then you just
3
need to clarify further how you did so independently from varying population size. If you didn’t
vary density, then you need to vary it temporally or “spatially” across simulations.
Other important comments:
Line 66: I agree that this is one argument for using the FD function with human infectious
diseases. But I’ve also seen the argument that human contact behavior doesn’t appreciably
change with density. To keep the epidemiologists happy, you might want to include and cite both
reasons.
Lines 76-83: I completely agree with the topic of this paragraph. However, I’d caution against
singling out particular studies, and especially these two studies. I believe that the Ryder et al.
lady bird study notes that they didn’t have the power to consider a nonlinear function. This is
notable because the cost of the extra parameter(s) is the biggest downside to using nonlinear
functions. And I talked to Angela Luis about transmission functions, and she’s tried nonlinear
options with Sin Nombre - I think within the paper you cited, though it might be buried in an
appendix. She told me that DD outperformed NL.
Line 175: Why did you choose a power of 0.5 for an intermediate saturating shape? Was that the
best fit from your previous study?
Line 279-280: I think you can use a stronger opening line/paragraph without overselling your
results. I’d at least point out that while most models assume constant population densities,
*densities usually vary in space or time,* and you’ve shown that how we incorporate variable
densities has important consequences for invasion and persistence.
Minor comments:
Line 27: should be “…intermediate nonlinear functions are…”
Line 30: should be “…field data on Morogoro”
Line 50-51: This opening sentence should probably be cited, since there isn’t another place where
you cite or describe all of the existing work on this topic. For instance, the Fenton et al. 2002
“reconciling theory and reality” paper did a bunch of work here.
Line 59: should be “When the transmission…”
Lines 109-110: should be “are an important agricultural pest species and a natural reservoir host”
Line 156: would be more clear if it were “…number of events of each type (infection or
recovery)…”
Line 167: I don’t think you ever mention that the FD function is also recommended/used for
vector transmitted infections. Is there a reason for leaving them out?
Line 168-180: This section would read easier if you wrote it in complete sentences. It shouldn’t
add too many additional words.
Figures 3-4: Can you change the X axis to scientific notation or something, instead of offsetting
every other label? It’s a bit cluttered this way.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
Borremans et al apply field data on contact-density interactions in a rodent host with infection
parameters informed by empirical data to investigate the effect of different transmission
functions on the probability of viral invasion and persistence within populations of different
sizes. They find that the choice of function is important within their system, and also highlight a
broad range of wildlife host systems for which the results are relevant. They highlight the
diversity of responses that might be expected given understanding about each host species’
ecology and behaviour. The paper is well written, presents solid methodologies and important
results. I have no hesitation in supporting its publication.
Specific comments:
line 52-53: minor comment, but the use of ‘introduction’ and ’entering’ here seems a bit
tautological. Suggest changing ‘entering’ to ‘into’
line 123 - it would be nice to see additional comments in the discussion on the caveats of the
methods applied here - e.g. any potential implications/expected differences if the
latent/incubation period was taken into account?
line 147: should this be Beta = c(N/A)p ? or in line 148, a different constant symbol used, or
should line 148 say contact density function c = f(N/A)? There is a bit of inconsistency in how
this is represented in the paper, which is confusing to those for whom mathematical notation is
not a strong point.
line 160-164 - These are results. If the authors wish to highlight that this was checked prior to
moving forward with the rest of the analyses, I suggest rephrasing this section to indicate this.
line 213-214 - This is an interesting definition of invasion success. Can the authors justify a 1 year
period to demonstrate invasion success? (this seems long to me). Has this ‘successful start’
measure been used in other studies? How does this relate to a scenario where there might be a
short stuttering chain of, say 1-3 infections before stochastic fadeout? Is the introduced infected
individual assumed to be at the beginning of their infectious period?
line 274-276: For clarity, suggest rewording line 275 to “where persistence was only possible for
an infectious period of 30 days in combination with a high transmission rate and large population
size.”
line 279: For clarity, suggest rewording to “avoid having to assume the way in which
transmission scales with density”
5
line 282: Suggest “important consequences for estimating invasion and persistence success”
lines 284 - 295 are largely just restating the results. Either incorporate this summary into the
results section or incorporate further interpretation of each of the findings here (some of which is
in the paragraphs below), rather than just restating them.
Figure S3-1: for clarity, suggest changing the ‘b1’, ‘b2’, ‘b3’ notation within the plots and ‘b’ in the
y-axis to ‘beta1’, ‘beta2’, ‘beta3’, ‘beta’ (using the beta symbol), for consistency with the figure

Author response:
We understand the confusion about the fitting constant. In fact, this section was one of the
hardest to write, because we are aware that this is difficult to explain, yet did not want to
make the section too long. It is clear that we need to do a better job at explaining the
necessity of having a fitting constant, which we hope we now did. Please see the changes at
Lines 219-226.

then you just need to clarify further how you did so independently from varying population
size. If you didn’t vary density, then you need to vary it temporally or “spatially” across
simulations.
Author response:
We may not have explained these two points properly, and have tried to improve our
explanation in the text (please see Lines 147-149 & 262-265).
Annual birth rate was indeed the same as annual mortality rate, but while all births occurred
during a brief breeding period within each year, mortality was constant throughout the
year. Because of this, densities changed within each year, but not between years. The
reason for this approach is that we are only interested in the effects of seasonal density
fluctuations. We wanted to avoid also having to take into account changes in population
density between years, as this would require many more simulations. We did however want
to investigate the effect of population size while maintaining the same seasonal changes in
population density, which is the reason for implementing a range of initial population sizes
N0.
We hope that this explanation, and the edits in the manuscript, remove the confusion about
this part of our approach.

Reviewer 1:
Other important comments:
Line 66: I agree that this is one argument for using the FD function with human infectious
diseases. But I’ve also seen the argument that human contact behavior doesn’t appreciably
change with density. To keep the epidemiologists happy, you might want to include and cite
both reasons.
Author response:
Good suggestion, we added this to that paragraph. (Lines 67-68)
========================
Reviewer 1:
Lines 76-83: I completely agree with the topic of this paragraph. However, I’d caution
against singling out particular studies, and especially these two studies. I believe that the
Ryder et al. lady bird study notes that they didn’t have the power to consider a nonlinear
function. This is notable because the cost of the extra parameter(s) is the biggest downside
to using nonlinear functions. And I talked to Angela Luis about transmission functions, and
she’s tried nonlinear options with Sin Nombre - I think within the paper you cited, though it
might be buried in an appendix. She told me that DD outperformed NL.
Author response:
Thanks for this remark. We agree with your point that singling out studies like this may not
come across well, although we do stand behind the topic of the statements. The 2015 paper
by Angela Luis in particular stood out, because the key goal of the study was to investigate
persistence and density-dependence. We did follow your advice because we agree, and
changed the paragraph accordingly by removing these sentences while leaving the citations,
and merging the first sentence with the following paragraph. (Line 77)
========================
Reviewer 1:
Line 175: Why did you choose a power of 0.5 for an intermediate saturating shape? Was
that the best fit from your previous study?
Author response:
That’s a valid comment. Indeed, the previous version of this manuscript used a power that
was obtained by fitting to the contact data. This however resulted in a function that was
extremely similar to the linear function (see the figure below), and was therefore not
informative. For this reason, we chose a power of 0.5 because this results in a function
exactly intermediate between a linear and constant function, as you can see in figure 1 of
the manuscript. (Line 194)
========================
Reviewer 1:
Line 279-280: I think you can use a stronger opening line/paragraph without overselling your
results. I’d at least point out that while most models assume constant population densities,
*densities usually vary in space or time,* and you’ve shown that how we incorporate
variable densities has important consequences for invasion and persistence.
Author response:
Thanks for the suggestion. Based on this, we rewrote the opening paragraph in an attempt
to make it stronger. (Line 320)
========================
Reviewer 1:
Minor comments:
Line 27: should be “…intermediate nonlinear functions are…”
Author response:
Changed. We appreciate you taking the time to list these minor comments and providing
suggestions.
========================
Reviewer 1:
Line 30: should be “…field data on Morogoro”
Author response:
Changed.
========================
Reviewer 1:
Line 50-51: This opening sentence should probably be cited, since there isn’t another place
where you cite or describe all of the existing work on this topic. For instance, the Fenton et
al. 2002 “reconciling theory and reality” paper did a bunch of work here.
Author response:
Perfect suggestion, we added this reference.
========================
Reviewer 1:
Line 59: should be “When the transmission…”
Author response:
This is followed by the symbol beta, so is probably good without adding ‘the’?
========================
Reviewer 1:
Lines 109-110: should be “are an important agricultural pest species and a natural reservoir
host”
Author response:
Changed.
========================
Reviewer 1:
Line 156: would be more clear if it were “…number of events of each type (infection or
recovery)…”
Author response:
Changed.
========================
Reviewer 1:
Line 167: I don’t think you ever mention that the FD function is also recommended/used for
vector transmitted infections. Is there a reason for leaving them out?
Author response:
Good point. We added this to the paragraph. (Line 188)
========================
Reviewer 1:
Line 168-180: This section would read easier if you wrote it in complete sentences. It
shouldn’t add too many additional words.
Author response:
Changed. This indeed improved it a lot. (Line 187)
========================
Reviewer 1:
Figures 3-4: Can you change the X axis to scientific notation or something, instead of
offsetting every other label? It’s a bit cluttered this way.
Author response:
We had previously tried a number of options for these axis labels, and the current version
was in our opinion the clearest. It would indeed be nicer to have all axis labels on the same
line, but this means that the font size would have to decrease quite a lot, which in turn
makes it less clear to read. Even using scientific format would require decreasing the font
size. So we would prefer to go with the current version of the figures.
Reviewer 2:
Borremans et al apply field data on contact-density interactions in a rodent host with
infection parameters informed by empirical data to investigate the effect of different
transmission functions on the probability of viral invasion and persistence within populations
of different sizes. They find that the choice of function is important within their system, and
also highlight a broad range of wildlife host systems for which the results are relevant. They
highlight the diversity of responses that might be expected given understanding about each
host species’ ecology and behaviour. The paper is well written, presents solid methodologies
and important results. I have no hesitation in supporting its publication.
Author response:
Thank you for the feedback and the positive words.
========================
Reviewer 2:
Specific comments:
line 52-53: minor comment, but the use of ‘introduction’ and ’entering’ here seems a bit
tautological. Suggest changing ‘entering’ to ‘into’
Author response:
Thanks for the suggestion, we changed it accordingly. (Line 54)
========================
Reviewer 2:
line 123 - it would be nice to see additional comments in the discussion on the caveats of the
methods applied here - e.g. any potential implications/expected differences if the
latent/incubation period was taken into account?
Author response:
We had not included this in the previous version because we doubt that the overall patterns
would change. But we agree that it is good to specifically acknowledge this, so we added a
paragraph to the discussion about the caveats of the approach. (Line 395).
========================
Reviewer 2:
line 147: should this be Beta = c(N/A)p ? or in line 148, a different constant symbol used, or
should line 148 say contact density function c = f(N/A)? There is a bit of inconsistency in how
this is represented in the paper, which is confusing to those for whom mathematical
notation is not a strong point.
Author response:
This should indeed be c=f(N/A), thanks for noting this. (Line 163)
========================
Reviewer 2:
line 160-164 - These are results. If the authors wish to highlight that this was checked prior
to moving forward with the rest of the analyses, I suggest rephrasing this section to indicate
this.
Author response:
True. We now added an additional sentence to indicate that these are results. (Line 178)
========================
Reviewer 2:
line 213-214 - This is an interesting definition of invasion success. Can the authors justify a 1
year period to demonstrate invasion success? (this seems long to me). Has this ‘successful
start’ measure been used in other studies? How does this relate to a scenario where there
might be a short stuttering chain of, say 1-3 infections before stochastic fadeout? Is the
introduced infected individual assumed to be at the beginning of their infectious period?
Author response:
It is true that there can be several definitions of invasion success. We chose this one
because of a number of reasons:
- A pathogen persisting in a population for one generation has biological relevance.
- This definition was used previously in a modelling paper on the invasion and persistence of
Morogoro virus in multimammate mice (Goyens et al. 2013, Journal of Theoretical Biology
317:55-61).
- It is a simple definition, easy to remember.
- It is long enough to avoid a bias from short stuttering chains, as mentioned in the
comment.
Although we did not explicitly test different the effect of different definitions of invasion
success, it is unlikely that they would change the results qualitatively, aside from increasing
or decreasing the proportion of simulations in which the arbitrary threshold is reached.
We added an extra sentence in the methods to support this definition. (Line 250)
As for the last question: an animal is considered to be at the start of the infectious period
upon introduction in the population. We now added this explicitly in the text. (Line 176)
========================
Reviewer 2:
line 274-276: For clarity, suggest rewording line 275 to “where persistence was only possible
for an infectious period of 30 days in combination with a high transmission rate and large
population size.”
Author response:
We partly followed this suggestion by removing ‘for an infectious period of 30 days’, as this
made the sentence both clearer and more concise.
========================
Reviewer 2:
line 279: For clarity, suggest rewording to “avoid having to assume the way in which
transmission scales with density”
Author response:
This sentence could indeed be improved, thanks for your suggestion. Based on this
comment, and that of Reviewer 1, we rewrote the first paragraph in an attempt to make it
clearer/stronger. (Line 320)
========================
Reviewer 2:
line 282: Suggest “important consequences for estimating invasion and persistence success”
Author response:
Changed.
========================
Reviewer 2:
lines 284 - 295 are largely just restating the results. Either incorporate this summary into the
results section or incorporate further interpretation of each of the findings here (some of
which is in the paragraphs below), rather than just restating them.
Author response:
It is true that this paragraph repeats some results, but this was done intentionally to provide
the reader with a summary of the most important patterns that were observed. We prefer
to do this because the following paragraphs go into these patterns in more depth. So
although this comment is true, we’d prefer to keep this version.
========================
Reviewer 2:
Figure S3-1: for clarity, suggest changing the ‘b1’, ‘b2’, ‘b3’ notation within the plots and ‘b’
in the y-axis to ‘beta1’, ‘beta2’, ‘beta3’, ‘beta’ (using the beta symbol), for consistency with
the figure legend
Author response:
Thanks for noting this. Our original figure indeed has the beta symbols, but something must
have gone wrong when saving the file to pdf format. The new version should be correct.
