I enjoyed reading this manuscript and found the authors’ use of a novel methodology in this
context well-motivated and appropriate, making it likely to be of interest to a range of readers.
The authors clearly describe their study system and methods, and provide a thorough
interpretation of their results. I therefore have no major comments on the work or its
presentation, but a few minor points/suggestions as follows.
Line 44: ‘on which’ might be better as ‘that’
Line 45: the comma after ‘reflect’ should be a semicolon
Line 52: The comma after ‘autonomous’ should go outside the quotes, and the ‘or’ can be deleted.
Lines 54-57: It may be worth highlighting the considerable difficulty of disentangling endogenous
and exogenous contributions to pattern here, especially since the manuscript describes a fairly
novel and promising way of doing so.
Line 56: replace ‘are’ with ‘is’ and add ‘being’ before ‘associated’
Line 64: ‘been’ is unnecessary
Line 67: missing ‘that’ after ‘noted’
Line 68: ‘ant nests’ rather than ‘ants’
Lines 82-85: Perhaps unavoidable but ‘critical’ is repeated quite often in this section
Lines 88-91: A good point, and possibly worth mentioning that exactly this separation of scales is
often assumed just to make it possible to analyse endogenous and exogenous factors separately.
Line 136: Repeated ‘began’
Line 138: At what height?
Line 139: Probably worth clarifying that the entire plot was covered by these transects – i.e. that
complete spatial patterns were recorded.
Line 179: Could light levels have some effect?
Lines 180-186: This is one methodological point that could perhaps be better dealt with. There’s
an obvious need for some kernel assumption to be made, but the choice of clustering range as a
proxy for sensitivity to tree and nest density feels a little too neat – can you either justify it
slightly more strongly, or provide some idea of how variations in the kernels might affect the
results?
3
Line 191: The terms in the formula are unclear in my PDF – worth checking.
Line 193: Why?
Line 241: Population of trees?
Lines 249-259: Can you mention the possible contribution of the spatial structure of trees here?
Lines 269-275: It would be good to have p-values somewhere (Table 1?) – or at least an idea of
where they’re substantially smaller than 0.05 (since some of these results are presumably due to
Type I errors).
Lines 276-282: Could tree availability be a limiting factor at this point?
Line 391: Glad to see this highlighted, but still wonder whether you can say anything more about
it.

This is an interesting study that is going to contribute nicely to the debate about the factors and
scales underlying ecological pattern formation. I don't have any major concerns but I have a few
minor ones, mostly aimed to improve clarity and consistency.
page 3, lines 51-54: there is a bit of confusion here. The Turing mechanism is something more
specific than the point that the authors actually try to make here. In particular, the pattern
formation mechanism studied by Petrovskii & Malchow (2001) was clearly shown to be non-
4
Turing. This confusion can be cleared by changing "basic Turing mechanism" to a more generic
"diffusive instability". Moreover, I think that the findings of this work actually suggest a non-
Turing mechanism as the Turing scenario normally results in a clear periodic spatial pattern (e.g.
like in semiarid vegetation) which does not seem to be the case with ants.
page 16, lines 353-358: it is not clear to me how the observed negative density-dependence
"potentially reflects" the effect of natural enemies. What could be a mechanism that translates the
effect of enemies to the negative density dependence? Please explain.
page 17, lines 366-368: although I think that the hypothetical mechanism explaining the counter-
intuitive increase in the ant nest population along with the reduction of trees is plausible, I could
not find it in the paper that the authors "demonstrated that dispersal limitation of natural
enemies of A. sericeasur could be the cause". Please explain very clearly how and where in the
paper it is demonstrated or admit that this is a hypothesis.
page 17, lines 377-379: I don't think that Fig.2a shows "progressively higher values" of the
intersection point density. For instance, the intersection points for 2007, 2009 and 2011 are
approximately 32, 44 and 36, respectively. Clearly, there is no tendency to increase. Hence, the
authors conclusion seems to be unjustified; please correct or explain what was meant.
Figure 2a: when looking at the curves, it occurred to me that the shape of the curves indicates the
existence of the strong Allee effect. I think it is worth mentioning it explicitly, and it would be
interesting to discuss it some details too.

179: Could light levels have some effect?
reviewer raises an important consideration. In our case, the majority of the plot had a generally
orm hill aspect, and thus a similar duration of sun exposure. We agree that this could be explicitly
ressed, however, and we’ve noted the reason for the omission in the revision. (162-164)
s 180-186: This is one methodological point that could perhaps be better dealt with. There’s an
ious need for some kernel assumption to be made, but the choice of clustering range as a proxy for
sitivity to tree and nest density feels a little too neat – can you either justify it slightly more strongly,
rovide some idea of how variations in the kernels might affect the results?
ough we do discuss the limitations of our assumptions on scale later, there is some precedent for
bandwidth distance we chose, which we’ve added to the text, along with another caveat about
study’s limitations. Ultimately, we feel that the question of scale, while interesting, is a bit
side the scope of this study, but we do note that it is a potential direction for future research.

usted the notation to be more easily read. (178)
193: Why?
malizing the variables allowed easier interpretation of fitted model coefficients because it centred
dictions on the plot averages of those variables and presented coefficient estimates on a uniform
e in terms of variable variances across the plot. The text has been adjusted to explain this. (180-
)
241: Population of trees?

s 249-259: Can you mention the possible contribution of the spatial structure of trees here?
reviewer is correct to point out the influence of the changing spatial structure of the trees, and we
e noted its potential effect in the text. We also note that nests remained clustered within this
cture, as the existing patterns were still significantly different from random reallocations within
h year’s tree distribution. (239-243)
s 269-275: It would be good to have p-values somewhere (Table 1?) – or at least an idea of where
y’re substantially smaller than 0.05 (since some of these results are presumably due to Type I errors).
le 1 has been adjusted to report the p values for IPP and ITCP models. If this table is too
plicated, we could also provide a table that symbolically differentiates p values substantially
ller than 0.05 and/or additional information in the electronic supplemental material.
s 276-282: Could tree availability be a limiting factor at this point?
have edited the text to emphasise this as a possible explanation, while also noting that projected
t density remained much lower than tree density, so the relationship may be indirect. (260-262)
391: Glad to see this highlighted, but still wonder whether you can say anything more about it.
reviewer has raised a valid concern. As we did in the methods section, we’ve re-framed our choice
andwidth in terms of our knowledge of the system, supported by our PCF results. We do believe
is an important and relevant area for future research, which is why we present specific related
es that future work should address. (365-372)

ments to the Author(s)
is an interesting study that is going to contribute nicely to the debate about the factors and scales
erlying ecological pattern formation. I don't have any major concerns but I have a few minor ones,
stly aimed to improve clarity and consistency.
nk you for your valuable comments. We appreciate the depth of your feedback and the
ortunity to strengthen our manuscript.
e 3, lines 51-54: there is a bit of confusion here. The Turing mechanism is something more specific
n the point that the authors actually try to make here. In particular, the pattern formation
hanism studied by Petrovskii & Malchow (2001) was clearly shown to be non-Turing. This confusion
be cleared by changing "basic Turing mechanism" to a more generic "diffusive instability". Moreover,
nk that the findings of this work actually suggest a non-Turing mechanism as the Turing scenario
mally results in a clear periodic spatial pattern (e.g. like in semiarid vegetation) which does not seem
e the case with ants.
appreciate this point of clarification. We agree that the Turing mechanism may not be an
ropriate appellation for the patterns in our case. It was our intention, however, to recognise
ing’s contribution to the more general concept of diffusive instability through the proposal of his
inal mechanism. We have adjusted the text to make this distinction more clear (lines 45-47) and
laced references to his mechanism when describing our system with the more generic term
fusive instability” (67, 70, and 324).
e 16, lines 353-358: it is not clear to me how the observed negative density-dependence "potentially
ects" the effect of natural enemies. What could be a mechanism that translates the effect of enemies
he negative density dependence? Please explain.
agree that the connection to negative density dependence could be made clearer, as it was only
ntioned in passing in the introduction. We have edited the text to explain the connection more
rly. (332-337)
e 17, lines 366-368: although I think that the hypothetical mechanism explaining the counter-
itive increase in the ant nest population along with the reduction of trees is plausible, I could not find
the paper that the authors "demonstrated that dispersal limitation of natural enemies of A.
ceasur could be the cause". Please explain very clearly how and where in the paper it is demonstrated
dmit that this is a hypothesis.
agree that this mechanism should be understood as a hypothesis, so we’ve edited the text to
licitly state it as such and emphasised that the cited study demonstrated the mechanism through a
ular automata model. (343-345)
e 17, lines 377-379: I don't think that Fig.2a shows "progressively higher values" of the intersection
nt density. For instance, the intersection points for 2007, 2009 and 2011 are approximately 32, 44 and
respectively. Clearly, there is no tendency to increase. Hence, the authors conclusion seems to be
ustified; please correct or explain what was meant.
reviewer is correct to point this out. Our initial assessment was an over-simplification. We have
uded a more nuanced description of the trend in the results section (273-276), which we interpret
fly in the discussion (352-356).
re 2a: when looking at the curves, it occurred to me that the shape of the curves indicates the
tence of the strong Allee effect. I think it is worth mentioning it explicitly, and it would be interesting
iscuss it some details too.
thank the reviewer for this interesting insight. We have noted it as a new area of potential
earch in the text. (276-278, 337-340)
