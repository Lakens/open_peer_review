Dear Authors,
It was very nice for me to review your manuscript. I find it a nice contribution and it adds
important pieces to the knowledge of parthenogenesis within insects. However I find some parts
within the manuscript that I thought might be worth to modify.
- I think you could modify the last section of the introduction. Please elaborate/introduce a bit
more the methods you will use for your research. What additional knowledge about
parthenogenesis will we gain from this particular study?
- I am not sure where the 1.77% divergence/lineages/million years exactly comes from?
Moreover the Papadopoulou et al. paper is based on beetles and thus it maybe would be worth to
perform a second calibration based on geological data (island age) or maybe dates inferred by
other studies (e.g. Rehm et al.)?
- Please provide the ESS values from all your calculated trees?
- Please cite some other papers about parthenogenesis within aquatic insects (e.g. Baetidae).
Overall, the manuscript is presented very nicely and important for the study of parthenogenesis
within aquatic insects. I think it might be worth for the authors to spend a bit more time to some
more details in order to improve the quality of the manuscript.

This paper is an important contribution to our knowledge of parthenogenesis in these Japanese
polymitarcids, as well as contributing to what we know of the topic in various Ephemeropteran
groups. The manuscript is clear and well-written.
I have made a few comments in the attached document, mostly correcting sentence structure and
comments asking to explain ambiguous phrases. Under the table of corrections in the attached
document, there are more detailed comments on various concepts proposed in the manuscript
that raised a few ideas and questions while reading through it, perhaps the authors should
elaborate on some of these concepts, to make the discussion more thorough in its conclusions.
In short, these comments were firstly a missing reference (a conference proceedings by the
authors) that I think should be included and cited. Secondly, a comment about the possible
geographical origin of the parthenogenetic strain; and thirdly, a comment on the possibility that
the bisexual populations are in fact re-establishing geographically and mingling with the
unisexual populations (ultimately resulting in hybridization and out-competing) as opposed to
the other way around? Based on Cuellar's 1977 paper (see attached document for details).

manuscript that raised a few ideas and questions while reading through it, perhaps the authors

In short, these comments were firstly a missing reference (a conference proceedings by the

geographical origin of the parthenogenetic strain; and thirdly, a comment on the possibility
that the bisexual populations are in fact re-establishing geographically and mingling with the
unisexual populations (ultimately resulting in hybridization and out-competing) as opposed to
the other way around? Based on Cuellar's 1977 paper (see attached document for details).
Line 38: “parthenogenetic populations” should read “parthenogenetic organisms” (reads better,
less ambiguous)
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 1, we changed “parthenogenetic populations” to “parthenogenetic
organisms”.
Line 45: Replace “although” with “while”
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 1, we changed “although” to “while”.
Line 48-49: “…would be no gene flow between the specimens of the bisexual lineage….”
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 1, we added “the” to this sentence.
Line 71-73: “…bisexual reproduction, that is a sexually reproductive system relying on a
male and a female, is the general mode of reproduction for metazoans, especially when
considering….”
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 1, we revised to “…bisexual reproduction, that is a sexually
reproductive system relying on a male and a female, is the general mode of reproduction for
metazoans, especially when considering….”.
Line 105-106: “…analyses in order to elucidate as to whether each parthenogenetic strain is
of singlular or multiple origin…”
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 1, we revised to “…analyses in order to elucidate as to whether
each parthenogenetic strain is of singlular or multiple origin…”.
Line 120: “…Four hundred and twenty-two specimens..”
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 1, we added “and” to this sentence.
Line 153: Comment: AIC technically should not be used for Bayesian Inferences because the
prior is not considered, the prior is an important component of a Bayesian model. Use the
marginal likelihood estimation using Bayes Factors to find the correct model.
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 1, we chose substitution models using the marginal likelihood
estimation.
Line 206: Comment: Table S2 shows the data for combined 16S+CO1. Please check the
labels in the manuscript text and the supporting document labels, the tables especially have
been mixed up.
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 1, we revised “table S2” to the data of 16S rRNA and the labels of
the tables and documents.
Line 226: (Fig. S1) should be S2 – please correct all other labels in this section as well.
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 1, we revised “Fig. S1” to “Fig. S2”.
234 “…subclade V was contained the C1 haplotype, as was observed…”
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 1, we revised “was contained” to “contained”.
Line 236: “..(table S4,..” is this supposed to be (Fig. 2, ?
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 1, we added “figure 2” to this sentence.
Line 248: “…A The network tree resulted in a star-like shape…”
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 1, we revised “A” to “The”.
Line 250-253: Rephrase this sentence, it is too long and awkward : “…Females with the C1
haplotype according to the COI region, in not only unisexual and strongly femalebiased
populations, but also in weakly female-biased and bisexual populations were found to be
heterozygous of the E1/E3 sequence genotypes and homozygous of the E1/E1 or E3/E3…”.
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 1, we revised the sentence to “Females with the C1 haplotype
according to the COI region were observed in the all population types. In addition, the all
females were heterozygous of the E1/E3 sequence genotypes and homozygous of the E1/E1
or E3/E3.”
Line 274: Comment: Check that the figure numbers are correct here
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 1, we revised and divided “figure 4 “to “figure 4a” and “figure
4b”.
Line 298-299: “…In many other unisexually reproductive groups organisms, it is
generally…”
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 1, we revised the sentence to ““…In many other unisexually
reproductive groups organisms, it is generally…”.
Line 311: “…analyses for E. shigae indicated a relatively…”
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 1, we revised “was contained” to “contained”.
Line 320-321: “…have come to be distributed a more widely distributed than those of a
bisexual…”
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 1, we revised the sentence to “have come to be more widely
distributed than those of a bisexual lineage…”.
Line 335: Comment: “The disagreement between the nuclear….” This paragraph needs to be
reworded. At first glance it seems to be implying that there is a disagreement in the nuclear
and mtDNA in this particular study for E. shigae, not ostracods. For example, start the
paragraph like this: “ In the geographically parthenogenetic ostracod, Eucypris virens, the
disagreement between the nuclear….”
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 1, we revised the sentence to “In the geographically
parthenogenetic ostracods, Eucypris virens, the disagreement between the nuclear and
mitochondrial DNA data verified the fact that genetic exchange has taken place between the
bisexual and unisexual lineages [53].”
Table S2, S3, S4 & S5.
Spelling error at bottom of the tables:
*Population numbers are reffered referred from table S1 and figure S1.
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 1, we revised “reffered” to “referred” in Table S2, S3, S4 and S5.
Figure 2 &S3
Comment: I would suggest extending the white “box” around the parthenogenetic haplotypes
to the edge of the blue “West Japan box”, or somehow show that this haplotype is also found
in the Eastern parts of Japan, because it is currently unclear to the reader at first glance.
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 1, we revised white “box” around Figure 2 and S3 to “referred”.
More detailed comments on the manuscript:
Missing reference: Sekine & Tojo, Proc. Arthropod. Embryol. Soc. Jpn. 47, 33–35 (2012)
2012 Arthropodan Embryological Society of Japan ISSN 1341–1527. This conference
proceeding has similar, but more simplified compared to this paper, however it has important
information which has not been addressed in this manuscript, it also sheds some light on some
unclear aspects within this manuscript, it should definitely be cited. For example, you should
specify somewhere in the manuscript that the unisexual and bisexual populations cohabit the
same river system and sometimes even the same population.
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 1, we added Sekine and Tojo (2012) to the reference as [64].
In Line 298: you mention that the unisexual strains differentiated somewhere in Western
Japan, about 0.15MYA. Looking at the haplotype table there is one Western Japan bisexual
population where the only haplotype found was the unisexual one, C1_S1 – which is
population number 38 in the Yumesaki-Gawa river – is it possible that this area may be the
origin of the parthenogenetic strain? What are your thoughts on this?
Answer comments:
We are glad for good comments. Sex ratio (bisexual) of the Yumesaki-gawa population is
based on the previous study (Ishiwata, 1996; Watanabe and Ishiwata. 1997). They collected
only two individuals (female : male = 1 : 1) in 1989. In our study, we collected 17 adults, all
females in the population in 2006 and examined the four individuals for genetic analysis. We
doubt that the Yumesaki-gawa population becomes female-biased, although we cannot decide
in this study. We would like to examine correct sex ratio by nymphs in the future.
According to Cuellar (1977), parthenogenetic strains can only evolve in areas devoid of the
generating bisexual species, because such bisexual species would prevent newly formed
unisexual populations from establishing clones due to either hybridisation or competition. As
you have mentioned, it would make sense that the parthenogenetic strain would have
differentiated during the last glacial age, presumably when the bisexual populations were at
their lowest. It appears that the unisexual populations spread quickly and through corridors in
the Japanese Alps and into the Eastern parts of Japan. So while the bisexual populations were
low, the unisexual mayflies were recolonizing and establishing populations all over the
country. After this (according to the Beast Skyline plots) there was an increase in bisexual
populations, is it possible that the bisexual strains are hybridising and outcompeting with the
unisexual strain (based on Cuellar), what are your thoughts on this? Also, if the
parthenogenetic strain is reproductively more advantageous as is implied, even in optimal
conditions, would there not be the issue of reduced genetic variation (even in automictic
obligate parthenogenetic strains), which would be disadvantageous for the species? What are
your thoughts on this?
Answer comments:
We are glad for good comments. Males are sporadically produced in the obligatorily
parthenogenetic shrimp (Artemia spp.), water flea (Daphnia pulex), and an aphid
(Rhopalosiphum padi) (Innes and Hebert, 1988; Delmotte et al., 2001; Maccari et al., 2013).
This accounts for the occasional appearance of males in otherwise fully unisexual populations,
and such instances do not contradict the general principle that gene flow between sexual and
parthenogenetic lineages allows the spread of unisexuality in a contagious fashion and can
rapidly convert bisexual into parthenogenetic lineages (Simon et al., 2003). In addition,
occasional gene exchange between bisexual lineages may be critical to the preservation of
otherwise parthenogenetic lineages. However, it is unclear as to whether or not males
produced from parthenogenetic strains of E. shigae are functional in terms of sexual
reproduction. We would like to examine this topic and the competition between bisexual and
parthenogenetic individuals in the future.
Your manuscript was a very interesting read and further studies looking at the whether or not
parthenogenetic females are able to mate and lay viable fertilized eggs will be well
worthwhile.
Answer comments:
We are glad for nice and encourage comments. We would like to continue study about this
topic in the future.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
Dear Authors,
It was very nice for me to review your manuscript. I find it a nice contribution and it adds
important pieces to the knowledge of parthenogenesis within insects. However I find some
parts within the manuscript that I thought might be worth to modify.
- I think you could modify the last section of the introduction. Please elaborate/introduce a bit
more the methods you will use for your research. What additional knowledge about
parthenogenesis will we gain from this particular study?
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 2, we modified the last section of the introduction.
- I am not sure where the 1.77% divergence/lineages/million years exactly comes from?
Moreover the Papadopoulou et al. paper is based on beetles and thus it maybe would be worth
to perform a second calibration based on geological data (island age) or maybe dates inferred
by other studies (e.g. Rehm et al.)?
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 2, we also added 0.075% divergence/lineages/million years to
Skyline plot analysis and modified results and discussion.
- Please provide the ESS values from all your calculated trees?
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 2, we added the ESS values to figure legends.
- Please cite some other papers about parthenogenesis within aquatic insects (e.g. Baetidae).
Answer comments:
As suggested by Reviewer 2, we added papers about mayfly parthenogenesis and the families:
“Although thelytoky is generally observed in parthenogenetic mayflies (Ameletidae, Baetidae,
Baetiscidae, Caenidae, Ephemerellidae, Ephemeridae, Heptageniidae, Leptophlebiidae,
Palingeniidae, Polymitarcyidae, and Siphlonuridae) [55-62], in some parthenogenetic
mayflies, deuterotoky (i.e., generating both males and females from unfertilized eggs) has
also been proposed [61].”
Overall, the manuscript is presented very nicely and important for the study of
parthenogenesis within aquatic insects. I think it might be worth for the authors to spend a bit
more time to some more details in order to improve the quality of the manuscript.
Answer comments:
We are glad that this reviewer recognized the biological/scientific value of our study. We are
grateful for this referee’s very important comments and constructive suggestions.
