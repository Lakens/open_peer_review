As the authors claimed, the Ti-based materials are common materials for the implant of an
artificial limb and joint. How to improve the biocompatibility is a critical and practical issue. The
authors proposed modified the surface with anode TiO2 nanotube array to change the surface
roughness, wettability and composition to enhance the adhesive of the cell and biocompatibility.
It is worth to be investigated.
Please address the following questions
1. pay more attention to the format and the consistency, Some part is Figure some are Fig. In
section 3.3 it should be Figure 6, not Figure 8. The table need capitalize the first letter, and so on.
2. The authors need to reorganize the whole paper. What is the critical issue to affect the
biocompatibility for the TiO2 nanotube array modified Ti materials, for example, morphology,
roughness, or wettability, and then the paper should focus on these conditions. If the factor is not
a critical one, put the corresponding data into supporting information. Otherwise, it will
influence the story.
3. Prof. Grimes had been work on the TiO2 nanotube array a lot. I do not think this is the first
time report, (I do not check the literature, I believe it is not)

In this manuscript, the authors claimed that the highly ordered nanotube oxide films have been
prepared on commercial pure titanium (CP-Ti) in fluoride-based electrolyte by two-step
oxidation method for the first time, and it is non-toxic and favorable for the growth of fibroblasts.
However, due to the following problems I think it in the present form is not suitable to be
published in the journal.
1) It is not true to mention “up to date, there are few reports in the current literatures about the
surface roughness, wettability and surface energy of the nanotubular oxide film” or “the
exploration of the electrochemical corrosion behavior of the TiO2 nanotube array film is also
limited.” in introduction. Actually, many relevant works have been extensively done in the
literature.
2) The preparations of the highly ordered nanotube oxide films on titanium in fluoride-based
electrolyte by two-step oxidation method have been previously published.
3) The experiment seems not sufficient to evaluate the bioproperties of the prepared nanotube
oxide films on Ti. More experimental data on biocompatibility are needed.
4) Why the highly ordered nanotube oxide films on titanium exhibit excellent adhesion,
extensibility, and proliferation compared to those cultured on bare titanium?
5) The corrosion current and AC impedance are associated with real surface area, it is hard to
compare the electrochemical behavior because the real surface area is different for the different
surface treatments.
6) The relevant previously published works have not well cited.

Dear Dr. Laura Smith:
Responding to your request, we have revised our manuscript entitled “Surface
properties and bioactivity of TiO2 nanotube array prepared by two-step
anodic oxidation for biomedical applications” (Manuscript ID: RSOS-181948).
The referees’ useful remarks and suggestions are much appreciated. We have
responded positively to essentially all of the comments and revised the
manuscript accordingly as described below.
All changes made in the manuscript have been marked in red font.
Reviewer: 1
1. “pay more attention to the format and the consistency, Some part is
Figure some are Fig. In section 3.3 it should be Figure 6, not Figure 8.
The table need capitalize the first letter, and so on.”
--- We thank the Reviewer for the suggestion. We have changed
Figure 1 (1st line, 1st paragraph, section 3.1) to Fig. 1; changed Figure
3A (1st line, 3rd paragraph, section 3.1) to Fig. 3A; changed Figure 9
(3rd line, 2nd paragraph, section 3.3) to Fig. 9. We have changed Fig. 8
(4th line, 1st paragraph, section 3.3) to Fig. 6. We have changed “table
3 (1st line, 8th paragraph, section 3.2) to “Table 3”, “table 4 (3rd line,
8th paragraph, section 3.2)” to “Table 4”.
2. “The authors need to reorganize the whole paper. What is the critical issue
to affect the biocompatibility for the TiO2 nanotube array modified Ti
materials, for example, morphology, roughness, or wettability, and then
the paper should focus on these conditions. If the factor is not a critical
one, put the corresponding data into supporting information. Otherwise,
it will influence the story.”
--- The reviewer gave us useful suggestions. In this work, we discussed
mainly the surface physicochemical properties, including morphology,
composition, surface roughness, wettability and surface electrochemical
behaviors, which together determine the effect of TiO2 nanotube surface
on cell behaviors.
3. “Prof. Grimes had been work on the TiO2 nanotube array a lot. I do not
think this is the first time report, (I do not check the literature, I believe it
is not).”
--- We thank the Reviewer for the suggestion. We have deleted “for the
first time” (3rd line, 4th paragraph, section 1).
4. “Making the connection between the critical factor and the
biocompatibility. Such as the wettability, if the hydrophilic surface is a
benefit to the cell growth, show the data, the cell growth depends on
the hydrophilic properties.”
--- We thank the Reviewer for the suggestion. We believe that the
effect of biomaterial surface on cell behaviors is acted together by
various physical and chemical factors in this work. After implantation,
water molecules adsorb on the surface of biomaterials in a very short
time, and affect the subsequent protein adsorption process. Some
studies have been carried out on the effects of hydrophilicity on cell
behaviors, including adhesion, migration and differentiation. Most
studies support the view that cell adhesion is guided by ECM
(extracelluar matrix), and hydrophobic surfaces are more beneficial to
protein adsorption. Therefore, the maximum number of cell adhesion
will appear at a certain degree of wettability, and the equilibrium value
prefers to hydrophilicity. And the main purpose of this work is to
introduce the physicochemical properties of the surface of TiO2
nanotube arrays, and the biological experiments just preliminarily
proved the biocompatibility of TiO2 nanotubes.
Reviewer: 2
1. “It is not true to mention “up to date, there are few reports in the
current literatures about the surface roughness, wettability and
surface energy of the nanotubular oxide film” or “the exploration of
the electrochemical corrosion behavior of the TiO2 nanotube array film
is also limited.” in introduction. Actually, many relevant works have
been extensively done in the literature.”
--- We thank the Reviewer for the suggestion. We have deleted these
sentences “Up to date, there are few reports in the current literatures
about the surface roughness, wettability and surface energy of the
nanotubular oxide film. The exploration of the electrochemical
corrosion behavior of the TiO2 nanotube array film is also limited.” (12-
15th line, 3rd paragraph, section 1). And we changed the sentence “But,
they are very important for the biomedical applications” (15th line, 3rd
paragraph, section 1) to “But, surface physicochemical properties of
implants are very important for the biomedical applications.” (13th line,
3rd paragraph, section 1)
2. “The preparations of the highly ordered nanotube oxide films on
titanium in fluoride-based electrolyte by two-step oxidation method
have been previously published.”
--- We thank the Reviewer for the suggestion. We have deleted “for the
first time” (3rd line, 4th paragraph, section 1).
3. “The experiment seems not sufficient to evaluate the bioproperties of
the prepared nanotube oxide films on Ti. More experimental data on
biocompatibility are needed.”
--- We thank the Reviewer for the suggestion. In this manuscript, we
mainly discussed the preparation and surface physicochemical
properties of anodized TiO2 nanotubes, and the biological experiments
were adopted to preliminarily evaluate the biocompatibility of
anodized TiO2 nanotube arrays. We will discuss the biological
properties of TiO2 nanotube arrays in detail in our subsequent articles.
4. “Why the highly ordered nanotube oxide films on titanium exhibit
excellent adhesion, extensibility, and proliferation compared to those
cultured on bare titanium?”
--- We thank the Reviewer for the suggestion. The surface roughness
of TiO2 nanotubes is higher than that of pure titanium due to the
special tube structure. When the cells adhere to the surface of
nanotubes, their filopodia can anchor in the wall of nanotubes and
even reach into the tubes, which is more beneficial to early adhesion
of cells. Meanwhile, the surface of nanotube exhibits excellent
hydrophilicity, and the media is easy to penetrate into the interior of
tubes and the interval between tubes, which provides adequate
nutrition for cell growth.
5. “The corrosion current and AC impedance are associated with real
surface area, it is hard to compare the electrochemical behavior
because the real surface area is different for the different surface
treatments.”
--- We thank the Reviewer for the suggestion. In my opinion, AC
impedance is not related to the real surface area, but is related to the
interface structure and the reaction happened at the interface.
Because the principle of AC impedance is to apply a sinusoidal signal
with small amplitude potential but different frequency near the open
circuit potential, and then record the feedback signal. Thus, the
difference between the input and output signals is obtained. This is not
current information, so it is independent of the real surface area.
Different nanotube thicknesses and different tube diameters have
effects on the values of different devices of the AC impedance fitting
circuit. The pure titanium surface has only a thin and dense oxide film.
The current density is related to the true area of the sample. The
corrosion current is the total current on the working electrode
(sample) measured by electrochemical workstation. To compare the
current density of different samples, the real surface area of the
working electrode (sample) should be measured. Therefore, the
nanotube arrays may have an effect on the current density. The current
characteristics of nanotubes may vary under different applied voltages.
We define the current density obtained by macro area (the same area
of all samples) as the nominal current density. It can be seen that if
tube diameter is large, the real area is close to the macro area, the
current density is close to the current density of the pure titanium
sample. The smaller the diameter of the tube, the larger the real area
and the smaller the current density. Therefore, we can judge the
structure of the films on pure titanium surface by polarization curves.
6. “The relevant previously published works have not well cited.”
--- We thank the Reviewer for the suggestion. In section “Introduction”,
we have cited 6 relevant previously published works (Ref.[17]-
Ref.[22]), and the subsequent reference number has also been
adjusted.
Reviewer: 3
1. “Pore structure are not uniform in the microscope images. The pores
are slightly distorted. More explanation is required.”
--- We thank the Reviewer for the suggestion. In this manuscript, we
prepared TiO2 nanotube arrays on pure titanium surface in HF
electrolyte by anodization. The growth of TiO2 nanotube array is a self-
assembly process, and is a dynamic process of continuous growth at
the bottom of nanotube array and continuous dissolution of the tube
array surface and tube walls. The ordered nanotube arrays can be
obtained at a certain voltage (20V in this manuscript), but at a higher
or lower voltage, no nanotube arrays can be obtained. The nanotube
arrays showed in this manuscript are highly ordered anodized
nanotubes obtained in HF electrolyte, which causes the serious
corrosion on the nanotube array surface and nanotube walls. So far,
anodization can only prepare TiO2 nanotubes with rough uniform size,
but can not achieve the nanotubes with identical size.
2. “Fluorine is good for life activity. The source of Fluorine is HF. HF is very
toxic. How did authors make sure of complete removal of HF from TiO2
nanotubes?”
--- We thank the Reviewer for the suggestion. After preparation
process, the sample surface was rinsed repeatedly by distilled water,
which is described by the sentence “The anodized samples are washed
with distilled water” (line 13-14, 1st paragraph, section 2.1). Also, we
have added the word “repeatedly” into this sentence “The anodized
samples are washed with distilled water repeatedly” (line 14, 1st
paragraph, section 2.1). Before biological experiments, all nanotube
samples were ultrasonically cleaned for half an hour, and then
immersed into distilled water for 24 hours to minimize HF residues in
the interior of nanotubes and crevices among nanotubes, so as to
eliminate the adverse effects of HF on cells. Also, we have added the
sentence “In this work, all TiO2 nanotube samples for biological
experiments were ultrasonically cleaned for half an hour in distilled
water and then were immersed into the distilled water for 24 hours to
minimize HF electrolyte residues in the interior of nanotubes and
crevices among nanotubes.” in the biological experiments (Line 4-7, 3rd
paragraph, section 2.3.1).
3. “The adhesion property of TiO2 is not clearly explained in the
manuscript.”
--- We thank the Reviewer for the suggestion. We did not measure the
adhesion strength of TiO2 nanotubes on titanium substrate according
to the standard method in this work. But after half an hour of ultrasonic
cleaning, the TiO2 nanotube arrays were not peeled off from the
substrate, which indicated that anodized TiO2 nanotube arrays possess
excellent adhesion strength on the titanium substrate.
4. “It would be more interesting if authors compare the wettability and
adhesion property of amorphous TiO2 with crystalline TiO2 nanotube.”
--- We thank the Reviewer for the suggestion. We will compare the
surface physicochemical properties, including the wettability and
adhesion property, of amorphous TiO2 nanotube arrays with crystalline
TiO2 nanotube arrays in our subsequent articles.
Thanks very much for your attention, and we hope to hear a positive
response.
