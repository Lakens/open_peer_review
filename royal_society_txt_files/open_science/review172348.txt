Comments to the Author(s)

The authors show that correlation matrix completion problems with the considered block
structure occur within the insurance industry, and give convincing arguments for using the
maximum determinant approach. The main novel results of this paper (in Section 4, especially
Theorem 4.1) are explicit formulas for completing correlation matrices with certain block
structures, so that the resulting correlation matrix has maximum determinant.
The authors then use a numerical experiment to compare their approach with alternatives, e.g.,
the nearest correlation matrix. Finally, they show how to use the results in Section 4 to solve more
general correlation matrix completion problems.
The paper is well-written and accessible, and contains novel results.
Minor comments:
p. 2, l. 23: "underyling" should be "underlying"
p. 2, l. 31: "show its use with shrinking". At this stage the reader may be unfamiliar with the
shrinking method used. Perhaps replace by something like "show its use with the shrinking
method in [23]".
p. 7, Theorem 4.5: Please replace the green font in the matrix. Although the red and green blocks
are described in the text, the colour choice is not ideal for people who are red-green colourblind.
p. 8, l. -9: It would be helpful to remind readers what SCR stands for.
p. 8, Numerical experiment: Although it's possible for the reader to reproduce the results, this
requires some work. The following suggestion is optional, but it would be nice if the experiment
results could be generated from a single file (provided the reader downloaded the Anderson
acceleration and shrinking method codes).

The paper deals with the important problem of completing correlation matrices with application
to the finance industry. The motivation here is the risk exposure of insurance companies that are
subject to regulation. The context is explained well and is easy to follow and motivating for the
reader. Several real-life examples are given, and the matrix structures of these are illustrated with
clear figures.
The paper is particularly successful at being accessible to those from the statistical background of
the application and those who are interested in the problem from a numerical linear algebra point
of view. After a discussion of existence, the dual problem of covariance selection is introduced
and its equivalence to maximum determinant completion, that the paper uses, is explained and
supported by four useful properties.
Completions are given for several applications and the proofs are succinct and generally easy to
understand. They are often given in multiple forms to satisfy the dual audience. The explicit
computable solutions are very welcome to someone like myself who is interested in
implementing them in software. Although the nature of the problem and the varying structures
do not suggest an all-encompassing algorithm. The reader is, however, guided in what
numerical methods to use for solving the problem practically. In particular, they are prompted
how to maintain accuracy and efficiency.
The comparison to the nearest correlation matrix problem is useful here. While these are very
different problems is it natural to ask how the completion solutions presented relate to nearness
problems.
The authors identify further work to include semidefinite diagonal blocks, which is a limiting
factor here and also more general structures. Methods that include influencing a subset of entries
in the unknown matrix blocks would surely be welcome too.
Overall the paper offers a very satisfying read. I some minor specific comments as follows:
Page 2 lines 44-51 It is not clear here as to the origin of the Sigma matrix. The authors seem to
imply the regulator supplies sigma but then go on to say there may be unknowns in this matrix
due to the insurers particular risks. I believe some clarification is needed.
Page 5 line at 26 The first step of the expansion of det A(epsilon) makes quite a jump and the
reader could benefit from an extra step being explicitly shown here.
Page 8 lines 19-21 The last sentence of section 4 implies that a correlation matrix is positive
definite. I think the intension here is to say that if a semidefinite diagonal block (and correlation
matrix) is found it is replaced with the nearest positive definite correlation matrix.
The Abstract refers to the papers explicit formulas being useful to test “algorithms for the general
correlation matrix completion problem”, and the presumably they don’t mean nearness here. No
such algorithms are given or used in the numerical examples section.

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your

5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article
so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
