The manuscript by Shintaro Sakurai et. al. describes on “Filtration-induced production of
conductive/ robust Cu films on cellulose paper by low temperature sintering in air.” Overall, I
find in the manuscript author did routine work in the Cu films. However, to improve the quality
of the manuscript author should address the following question.
(1) There are many papers are reported in Cu based inks, ofcourse same author presented the
same work in materials chemistry and physics, 2017. So author address how sintering will
improve the quality Cu films. So explain the novelty of your work?
(2) The viscosities of the ink were measured 600 Pa.s and 240 Pa.s, so justify your results is it good
for preparing the ink.
(3) Find the conductivity of Cu films in different temperature and include the dielectric
calculation for your work.
Please address all the comments and improve the quality of the manuscript.
Based on the above I am assigning this manuscript under major revision.

• The manuscript submitted to RSOS describes the production of Cu films on paper at low
temperature. In general, the manuscript brings a good strategy to generate conductive films on
paper with wide possibility of applications in different areas.
• When compared to other references cited in the manuscript (especially ref #35 from the same
group), the novelty to justify another publication is not clear enough.
• In page 8, for example, the main idea of the manuscript described in the first paragraph refers
3
to the development of a new synthesis aiming lower electrical resistance in comparison with
ref#35. This also happens in the conclusions. If the main idea is already published, it is not
new/novel. Maybe the authors wished to say something related to the optimization of the
synthesis/route. Some application is encouraged.
• The abstract needs to be revised and written in the past tense. Most of the articles already
reported in literature are missed in page 3.
• There are many recent papers describing the examples cited in the last paragraph detailed in pg
3.
• In the end of the introduction, the authors cited the bending stability as one of the proposals
reported in the manuscript.
• While they have explored the stability over 1000 cycles, it would better to broadly explore the
long-time stability as well as the reproducibility.
• Cu films we fabricated on grade 4 whatman paper. However, thicker and thinner substrates
could provide different results. A comparison would be welcome.
• Most of the details about the solution preparation can be avoided. When cited, it should be
done correctly.
• APTS is current provided under liquid form and NOT solid. If this was the case of the Japanese
supplier, it should be clarified.
• Information about the hydrolysis step are missed.
• The English needs to be revised.
• Ref #43 contains a title similar to the manuscript and it is cited in the supplementary
information. I think the ref is not necessary.

manuscript by Shintaro Sakurai et. al. describes on “Filtration-induced production of conductive/ robust Cu films on
lose paper by low temperature sintering in air.” Overall, I find in the manuscript author did routine work in the Cu
. However, to improve the quality of the manuscript author should address the following question.
There are many papers are reported in Cu based inks, of course same author presented the same work in materials
hemistry and physics, 2017. So author address how sintering will improve the quality Cu films. So explain the novelty
of your work?
onse 1:
arch Originality: The main novelty of this work is that present Cu based ink can produce conductive Cu films
trode) on porous paper in air even at low temperature sintering of 100 <U+F0B0>C. Due to the oxidation of copper and the
us character of paper, it is very difficult task to fabricate a Cu-based composite ink to deposit conductive Cu films onto
lose paper via low-temperature sintering in air. Our previous study reported air-sinterable Cu inks for “polymer
rates” (ref. 35), but this ink cannot apply for paper substrate due to the porous structures of paper. More recently, we
reported a composite Cu-based ink composed to produce conductive Cu films on cellulose paper under a nitrogen
sphere (ref. 42). This Cu-based composite ink resulted in sintered Cu films with improved conductivity. Nevertheless,
nk still resulted in Cu films with high resistance (~10-3 O·cm) on paper when sintered at 100 <U+F0B0>C in air. Thus, these
ously reported inks could not produce sintered Cu films with low resistance (~10-5 O·cm) on paper via an
tmosphere sintering process. For the Cu-based ink composite of the MOD ink and micron-sized Cu flakes developed in
study, the Cu flakes were pre-treated with formic acid to remove surface oxidation and inhibit the oxidation of the Cu
during the air-sintering process. In contrast, the air- sinterable Cu based ink developed in this study for the first time
a conductive Cu film (7 × 10-5 O·cm) on the cellulose paper at 100 °C in air for only 15 s. In addition, a strategy was
loped to enhance the bending stability of the sintered Cu films on paper substrates using polyvinylpyrrolidone-modified
akes and amine-modified paper.
ortance of the work: The development of air-sintered Cu-based inks compatible with quick and effective roll-to-roll
esses in printable electronics would represent a substantial advancement. However, the air-thermal sintering process has
utilized for Ag-based inks because the air-thermal sintering process of Cu-based inks tends to oxidize the copper. To
end, intense pulsed light (IPL) processes have been developed to sinter Cu nanoparticles under air ambient conditions.
IPL processes are very attractive for air sintering of Cu-based inks; however, these approaches require expensive and
alized equipment, and a drying process is usually needed before the sintering procedure. The present work is the first
rt of conductive Cu film formation on paper using a Cu-based ink and low-temperature sintering in air, which would
bute to printable and flexible electronics, which have garnered considerable attention over the past 10 years because of
broad application in devices with substantial societal impact.
ct on the field: The key findings of this study on Cu inks for paper are listed below.
he Cu-based inks is heated in air at 100 °C for only 15 s to give a conductive Cu film (7 × 10 -5 O cm) on cellulose
aper. The reducing action of the formic-acid treated Cu flakes was effective to produce the conductive Cu film at low
ntering temperature in air.
strategy to strengthen the bending stability of sintered Cu film on the paper was found by using
oly-vinylpyrrolidone-modified Cu flakes and amine modified paper.
have previously received little or no attempt.
ion: To emphasize the novelty of this study, we added the comparative results on sintered Cu film on paper from
nt Cu based ink and previous one (page 4). The main idea of the manuscript to achieve the air sintering of Cu-based
n paper is described in the first paragraph (page 6) of the revised manuscript. We also added the related result on FT-IR
um of formic acid-protected Cu flakes to produce the conductive Cu film at low sintering temperature in air (fig. S3).
he viscosities of the ink were measured 600 Pa.s and 240 Pa.s, so justify your results is it good for preparing the ink.
onse 2: I am sorry to mistake the unit of “Pas”. The unit, “mPa s” is correct. The viscosities of the present ink are
le for screen printing paints in operating conditions that should have apparent viscosity in the range 600 - 1000 mPas.
ion: we added the reference on the viscosities for screen printing paints as ref 43. (page 3)
Find the conductivity of Cu films in different temperature and include the dielectric calculation for your work.
onse 3: Thank you for your suggestion on the temperature-dependence of the conductivity of Cu films on papers.
ver, we hope to be able to conduct studies on the temperature-dependence of the conductivity in future research, since
e of paper as the substrates is limited to the changeable temperature-range.
rs: English grammar and syntax in the manuscripts should be checked and corrected by two native English-speaking
ns.
