Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The study reported on the fungal diversity and volatile compounds present at different parts of
the Aquilaria sinensis tree upon wounding treatment. The chemical compounds obtained were
correlated with the fungal diversity based on different tree parts. The latter work could be
considered as novel to agarwood-related studies. However, the manuscript was poorly presented
and the authors should give more attention to their writings.
there are several important information the author left out when reporting their work; the
authors need to enhance their presentation by referring to published papers for the description in
MnM; the authors tend to put Discussion materials in their Results; the authors need to determine
which Table and Figure are important to display in the manuscript and which are not. I suggest
that this manuscript can be accepted if the below comments are attained.
Title
The authors only compared the fungal diversity and volatile compound between different tree
parts, but the effects were not mentioned in the study.
Abstract
The abstract needs to be edited based on the comments below.
Introduction
The authors did not emphasize the importance of fungal species identification in Aquilaria tree.
There is no information regarding endophytic and introduced fungi in man-made agarwood
induction process. While the Fungi-Aquilaria relationship is a crucial key to agarwood formation,
the authors should provide more information on the importance of fungi towards agarwood
formation in A. sinensis. And I believe the finding for this study is to contribute assistance
towards sustainable agarwood production in cultivated A. sinensis, hence such information
should also be included.
MnM
Missing information on sampling techniques. Poor scientific write-up. The authors need to
enhance their presentation by referring to published work for this section. I do not agree that the
wounding treatment was carried out at different (spatial-formed) tissue types. The wounding
points mentioned in the study were all from a single, or to breakdown, the most two tissue type:
wood tissue from the stem and wood tissue from the branch. Scientifically, the five types of
agarwood mentioned in this study are just names for the agarwood formed at different location
on the tree stem. Instead, the authors should not mention the names of the agarwood in the MnM
but to bring it up only at the Discussion section as an additional information on the naming
practice among agarwood collectors in China. The samples, in my opinion, should be just treated
as merely different wounding points.
Results
The authors tend to put Discussion materials in the Results section, which is incorrect.

Discussion
Poor discussed. With the amount of information obtained from the Results, the authors did not
explain the possible causes of the strong correlation in certain fungi species and chemical
compounds. There is possibility that the fungus is endophytic as well as introduced. furthermore,
the samples were only collected at the end of the fifth year post-wounding treatment, this does
not explain the correlation between the fungi and the agarwood formation because agarwood
forms during the process. The process may have stopped at the 3rd or 4th year. My point is that
to look at the true correlation between fungal diversity that would contribute towards agarwood
formation, the authors should have carried out a time-lined sampling technique. Therefore, this
study only explains the fungal diversity that is present when the agarwood has formed, and this
does not directly provide information on the fungi whether they contribute towards the
formation of agarwood in A. sinensis. This as well refers to the correlation between volatile
compounds available and fungi diversity. In order to prove that the fungi are responsible to the
great number of a certain volatile compound, there is a need to forward the study to specifically
test on the efficacy of the fungus in contributing the production of a certain agarwood-related
compound. Also, the authors should tone down their confidence between the volatile and fungi
diversity recorded from their study as the study was only carried out in a single location. The
fungal diversity could be affected by the environment, thus affect the result on the volatile
compounds. Overall, the discussion needs to be refocused and rearranged to meet the standard of
the study.
Conclusion
Figures & Tables
Removal and insertion of Figure and Tables are suggested in the comments below. The authors
have to use good choice of language to present the Figure captions. If the data in the Figures or
Tables were results from some software or database, there is a need to provide information of the
said software or database. The Figures and Tables themselves should be able to be self-
explanatory.

Furthermore the fungal diversity reported in this study could also involved those being
introduced from the surrounding due to the wounding treatment. Thus, the references provided
here do not reflect as a support to this study.

then reintroduced back to the tree to confirm its strength to produce those volatile, yet there is no
such experiment carried out in this study. hence, i think the authors need to rephrase this
objective.
>Line 96-98 what is the sampling technique? wounded using what? when was this carried out?

many trees were there? how many treatments were there? is it 1 treatment 3 trees, then you got 5

then you have 3 biological replicates? Also, is there any negative control (a none wounded tree).
How do you select your trees? are they side to side? or far apart? how trees interval? the
information on the sampling technique is unclear. Please clarify.
>Line 99 the information in the Introduction should merge in here. However I have to raise my
disagreement on the use of the name for the agarwood type as the specimen name, but to replace
them by the organ/location of the tree where the wounding treatment is carried out as the
specimen name. In such manner, the names for the type of agarwood form can be mentioned in
the Discussion section. Unless the authors took the initiative to prepare an additional subsection
in the MnM to specifically describe how the wounding treatment was carried out.

be marked with underline or bold fonts instead of yellow highlights; the fungi names should be
arranged in alphabetical order; The Y-axis should be the fungi names; The X-axis should be the

label_comment_2
The present manuscript by Liu et al reports effects of fungal diversity on volatile compounds in
different spatial formations of agarwood originated from Aquilaria sinensis. Authors have also
showed relationship between fungal community and volatile compounds. The experiments are
well conceived and well presented.
Major concerns:
1) where is reference of extraction method of agrawood oil? or Normally, the volatile oil is
generally obtained from hrdrodistillation only. No discussion on extraction method relevant with
extracting solvent provided in manuscript.
2. Use the common name for identified compounds. Kovat index is needed to present for
identification confirmation. For example, mass spectrum of compounds 7 in Fig. 2 is not similar
to those from library.
3. Fig S5B and Fig 5, other genus is the major group of fungi in all samples. The fungi in other
genus may be correlated mainly to volatile compound production. The metagenome sequencing
is important in this experiment. Genus of all isolated fungal strains are completely identified by
PCR.
4. GCxGC chromatogram is not clear. Select one to present between 3D or 2D.

Dear Dr. Huang,
The submission has been reviewed by two domain experts. Based on their recommendations and
also my evaluation fo the manuscript, I judge that this paper requires a major revision before it
can be accepted for publication in RSOS. I feel that the novelty of the paper requires clarification.
In addition, given that the observed correlation between the wood composition and also fungal
diversity, authors suggest that this information can be used to guide future production of wood
with altered wood quality. please describe in the text how this can be achieved in practice. In
addition, the authors correlated a few wood types with the fungal speceis and then make the
statemnt that the fungal diversity influence the wood type. It is equally possible that the fungal
species diversity was generated by the difference wood composition. Which is the cause, which is
the result? Please discuss this point. Please address all the other concerns of the reviewers as
well.
Looking forward to receiving a revised manuscript.

many trees were there? how many treatments were there? is it 1 treatment 3 trees, then you got 5

information on the sampling technique is unclear. Please clarify.

disagreement on the use of the name for the agarwood type as the specimen name, but to replace
them by the organ/location of the tree where the wounding treatment is carried out as the
specimen name. In such manner, the names for the type of agarwood form can be mentioned in
the Discussion section. Unless the authors took the initiative to prepare an additional subsection
in the MnM to specifically describe how the wounding treatment was carried out.

be marked with underline or bold fonts instead of yellow highlights; the fungi names should be
arranged in alphabetical order; The Y-axis should be the fungi names; The X-axis should be the

Comments to the Author(s)
The present manuscript by Liu et al reports effects of fungal diversity on volatile compounds in
different spatial formations of agarwood originated from Aquilaria sinensis. Authors have also
showed relationship between fungal community and volatile compounds. The experiments are
well conceived and well presented.
Major concerns:
1) where is reference of extraction method of agrawood oil? or Normally, the volatile oil is
generally obtained from hrdrodistillation only. No discussion on extraction method relevant with
extracting solvent provided in manuscript.
2. Use the common name for identified compounds. Kovat index is needed to present for
identification confirmation. For example, mass spectrum of compounds 7 in Fig. 2 is not similar
to those from library.
3. Fig S5B and Fig 5, other genus is the major group of fungi in all samples. The fungi in other
genus may be correlated mainly to volatile compound production. The metagenome sequencing
is important in this experiment. Genus of all isolated fungal strains are completely identified by
PCR.
4. GCxGC chromatogram is not clear. Select one to present between 3D or 2D.

Appendix A
Dear Professor Xinguang Zhu and Professor Kevin Padian:
On behalf of my co-authors, we thank you very much for giving us an
opportunity to revise our manuscript, we appreciate editors and reviewers very much
for their positive and constructive comments and suggestions on our manuscript
entitled “Effects of fungal diversity on volatile compounds in different spatial
formations of agarwood originated from Aquilaria sinensis”.
We have studied the editors’ reviewers’ comments carefully and have made
revision which included a point by point response to the reviewers’ comments as
following, and revised manuscript using 'Track Changes'/comments in Word. We
have tried our best to revise our manuscript according to the comments. Attached
please find the revised version, which we would like to submit for your kind
consideration.
1. Associate Editor's comments (Professor Xinguang Zhu):
Dear Dr. Huang,
The submission has been reviewed by two domain experts. Based on their
recommendations and also my evaluation for the manuscript, I judge that this
paper requires a major revision before it can be accepted for publication in RSOS.
(1) I feel that the novelty of the paper requires clarification.
Yes, the editor is right. In the revised manuscript, we emphasized the novelty
of this study according to the editor’s kind advice.
Our work was firstly reported that the different wounded points of fungal
microbiome and agarwood chemical variety, which would provide insights on
their intrinsic relevance in A. sinensis. Also, both high-throughput sequencing
method to analyze the fungal community and GC×GC-HR-TOF-MS method to
analyze the volatile compounds were successfully used in different agarwood
samples formed from different wounded sections at the first time. We would
highlight the innovations from both scientific story and technical method.
(2) In addition, given that the observed correlation between the wood
composition and also fungal diversity, authors suggest that this information can be
used to guide future production of wood with altered wood quality, please
describe in the text how this can be achieved in practice.
Yes, the editor is right. In the results and discussion sections of revised
manuscript, we have added the above information and made a table (Table 4)
including our results and relevant previous studies to give a guide of future
production of agarwood.
(3) In addition, the authors correlated a few wood types with the fungal species
and then make the statement that the fungal diversity influence the wood type. It is
equally possible that the fungal species diversity was generated by the difference
wood composition. Which is the cause, which is the result? Please discuss this
point.
Yes, thank you for the review’s kind suggestion.
In previous studies, researchers have recognized that the fungal community is
highly specific to tree species as well as plant organ and tissue types (Cregger et al.
2018; Purahong et al. 2018). Thus, we choose the stems of Aquilaria sinensis as our
experimental materials.
Naturally, agarwood is produced as a consequence of attack to microbes,
insects and etc. Although both tissue types and wound methods could influence
the agarwood types, we pay more attention to the effect of microbes on resin
formation. Wood composition originated from various tissue types might
influence the agarwood formation, but we pay more attention to the relation
between microbes and agarwood compounds. Thus, in this article, we just
emphasized the relation between the microbes and agarwood compositions
through comparing the fungal communities and volatiles in various agarwood
types. We hope the microbial fermentation could be a useful way to accumulate
the agarwood formation or directly to obtain the agarwood resin ingredients in the
future, which could effectively protect wild agarwood resources.

Comments to the Author:
I have read this paper and found the results very interesting. I have some
comments on this study.
(1) Please describe clearly the novelty of this paper.
Thanks for the editor’s good advice. We have emphasized the novelty of this
study in the revised manuscript from both scientific story and technical method as
following. Our work was firstly reported that the spatial distribution of fungal
microbiome and agarwood chemical variety, which would provide insights on
their intrinsic relevance in A. sinensis. Also, both high-throughput sequencing
method to analyze the fungal community and GC×GC-HR-TOF-MS method to
analyze the volatile compounds were successfully used in different agarwood
samples at the first time.
(2) Given that the observed correlation between the wood composition and also
fungal diversity, authors suggest that this information can be used to guide future
production of wood with altered wood quality. please describe in the text how this
can be achieved in practice.
Yes, thanks for the reviewer’s good advice. In the results and discussion
sections of revised manuscript, we have added the correlation between the wood
composition and also fungal diversity and made a table (Table 4) including our
results and relevant previous studies to give a guide of future production of
agarwood.
(3) The authors correlated a few wood types with the fungal speceis and then
make the statemnt that the fungal diversity influence the wood type. It is equally
possible that the fungal species diversity was generated by the difference wood
composition. Which is the cause, which is the result? Please discuss this point.
Yes, the reviewer is right. We have discuss the above issue in discussion part.
Usually, the formation of natural agarwood is the result of tree defense reaction to
microbial or insect attack. Although both tissue types and wound methods could
influence the agarwood types, we pay more attention to the effect of microbes on
resin formation. Wood composition originated from various tissue types might
influence the agarwood formation, but we pay more attention to the relation
between microbes and agarwood compounds. Thus, in this article, we just
emphasized the relation between the microbes and agarwood compositions
through comparing the fungal communities and volatiles in various agarwood
types. We hope the microbial fermentation could be a useful way to accumulate
the agarwood formation or to directly to obtain the agarwood resin ingredients in
the future, which could effectively protect wild agarwood resources.
3. Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
(1) The study reported on the fungal diversity and volatile compounds present at
different parts of the Aquilaria sinensis tree upon wounding treatment. The
chemical compounds obtained were correlated with the fungal diversity based on
different tree parts. The latter work could be considered as novel to
agarwood-related studies. However, the manuscript was poorly presented and the
authors should give more attention to their writings.
Thank for the reviewer’s advice. We have totally revised our manuscript
using 'Track Changes'/comments in Word. We discussed the correlation between
volatiles and fungi in more detail in the revised manuscript. We hope our revision
could meet the requirement of publication.
(2) there are several important information the author left out when reporting their
work; the authors need to enhance their presentation by referring to published
papers for the description in MnM; the authors tend to put Discussion materials in
their Results; the authors need to determine which Table and Figure are important
to display in the manuscript and which are not. I suggest that this manuscript can
be accepted if the below comments are attained.
Yes, the reviewer is right. We have added more important published papers
for the description in MnM in the reviewed paper. And we also rewrite the
Discussion and Results to make the manuscript more readable and logical. We
have also deleted Figure 2A, B, D and Supplemental Figure S1, S2, which do not
provide any useful information. Also, we put Figure 2C into Supplemental
materials, and Figure 3A, B were replaced with Table 1. Figure 4A were
break-downed into Figure 4A-F. Figure 4B, C and Supplementary Figure S4 were
both go under a different Figure together, new Figure 5. Supplemental Table S2
was displayed in manuscript as Table 3.
(3) Title. The authors only compared the fungal diversity and volatile compound
between different tree parts, but the effects were not mentioned in the study.
Yes, the reviewer is right. According to the content of our manuscript, we
would like to adjust the article title as “Different wounded locations of agarwood
originated from Aquilaria sinensis provide insights on the intrinsic relevance
between fungal diversity and volatile compounds”, which meets the content of this
work.
(4) Abstract. The abstract needs to be edited based on the comments below.
Thank you for the reviewer’s advice. We have edited the abstract after
reviewing the manuscript, according to the comments below.
(5) Introduction. The authors did not emphasize the importance of fungal species
identification in Aquilaria tree. There is no information regarding endophytic and
introduced fungi in man-made agarwood induction process. While the
Fungi-Aquilaria relationship is a crucial key to agarwood formation, the authors
should provide more information on the importance of fungi towards agarwood
formation in A. sinensis. And I believe the finding for this study is to contribute
assistance towards sustainable agarwood production in cultivated A. sinensis,
hence such information should also be included.
Thank you for the reviewer’s kind suggestion. In the Introduction part, we
have added more information associated with endophytic and introduced fungi in
man-made agarwood induction process, which would help to analyze our data and
give an assistance towards sustainable agarwood production in cultivated A.
sinensis.
(6) MnM. Missing information on sampling techniques. Poor scientific write-up.
The authors need to enhance their presentation by referring to published work for
this section. I do not agree that the wounding treatment was carried out at different
(spatial-formed) tissue types. The wounding points mentioned in the study were
all from a single, or to breakdown, the most two tissue type: wood tissue from the
stem and wood tissue from the branch. Scientifically, the five types of agarwood
mentioned in this study are just names for the agarwood formed at different
location on the tree stem. Instead, the authors should not mention the names of the
agarwood in the MnM but to bring it up only at the Discussion section as an
additional information on the naming practice among agarwood collectors in
China. The samples, in my opinion, should be just treated as merely different
wounding points.
Thank you for the reviewer’s good advice. We have reviewed this part as
reviewer suggested using 'Track Changes'/comments in Word. We have changed
our title and related contents, for the five types of agarwood samples were formed
from different locations of the stems not the tissue types. Additionally, the naming
practice of agarwood collectors were put into Discussion section not MnM. We
also referred more published work to enhance our presentation, especially the
sampling method.
(7) Results. The authors tend to put Discussion materials in the Results section,
which is incorrect.
Yes, the reviewer is right. According to the reviewer’s kind reminding, we
have corrected the Results section, and put some discussing statement in
Discussion section.
(8) Discussion. Poor discussed. With the amount of information obtained from the
Results, the authors did not explain the possible causes of the strong correlation in
certain fungi species and chemical compounds. There is possibility that the fungus
is endophytic as well as introduced. furthermore, the samples were only collected
at the end of the fifth year post-wounding treatment, this does not explain the
correlation between the fungi and the agarwood formation because agarwood
forms during the process. The process may have stopped at the 3rd or 4th year.
My point is that to look at the true correlation between fungal diversity that would
contribute towards agarwood formation, the authors should have carried out a
time-lined sampling technique. Therefore, this study only explains the fungal
diversity that is present when the agarwood has formed, and this does not directly
provide information on the fungi whether they contribute towards the formation of
agarwood in A. sinensis. This as well refers to the correlation between volatile
compounds available and fungi diversity. In order to prove that the fungi are
responsible to the great number of a certain volatile compound, there is a need to
forward the study to specifically test on the efficacy of the fungus in contributing
the production of a certain agarwood-related compound. Also, the authors should
tone down their confidence between the volatile and fungi diversity recorded from
their study as the study was only carried out in a single location. The fungal
diversity could be affected by the environment, thus affect the result on the
volatile compounds. Overall, the discussion needs to be refocused and rearranged
to meet the standard of the study.
Thanks for the reviewer’s kind advice. We have totally reviewed our
discussion section. We hope that our reviewed discussion would meet the standard
of the study.
(9) Figures & Tables
Removal and insertion of Figure and Tables are suggested in the comments below.
The authors have to use good choice of language to present the Figure captions. If
the data in the Figures or Tables were results from some software or database,
there is a need to provide information of the said software or database. The
Figures and Tables themselves should be able to be self-explanatory.
Thank you for the reviewer’s good suggestion. We have removal and
insertion of Figures and Tables according to the reviewer’s suggestion. And we
hope our revision could be more readable.
(10) Writing Problems.
Thanks very much for the reviewer’s kind advices and revision. We have

Yes, the reviewer is right. According to the reviewer’s advice, we changed
the sentence as “Due to its rarity and crucial value, A. sinensis has been used to
investigate processes for improving agarwood oil yield in China.”

>Line 62 consequence of attack to what?
In reference 13, the writer has reported the natural agarwood formation as
following, “Naturally, the production of agarwood occurred due to microbial or insect
attack and in the result, white heart wood converted into black/brown fragrant resin
which accumulates in main or side branch of stem.” Thus, in our article, we would
like to analyze the relationship between the resin fragrance constituents and fungi
using the agarwood samples which were only treated by simple wound method and
then formed under natural conditions for many years imitating the natural agarwood
formation.
Thanks for the reviewer’s advice. We have changed the sentence as
“consequence of attack to microbes, insect and etc.”

following sentence to give the readers a hint on their hypothesis of the relationship
between fungal diversity and wounded part. "Although different types of agarwood

to produce those volatile, yet there is no such experiment carried out in this study.
hence, i think the authors need to rephrase this objective.
Yes, the reviewer is right. We have changed this sentence as following:
Furthermore, due to the regular pattern in fungal communities and the volatile
constituents in different types of agarwood, we were able to characterize the fungal
community structures found in different parts of agarwood formation and to
preliminarily investigate the intrinsic relevance between fungal diversity and volatile
compounds, which could help to furtherly understand the variety of agarwood
fragrances.
>Line 96-98 what is the sampling technique? wounded using what? when was this
carried out? how do you collect the formed agarwood? using what technique?
Thanks for the reviewer’s advice. We have reviewed this part as following.
“30-year-old A. sinensis trees from Dalingshan town in Guangdong Province
(latitude 22°45´43<U+2033> N, longitude 113°48´45<U+2033> E) were treated by physical wounding
using machete [26,27]. Five years later, the agarwood section was formed about 0.5~1
cm thickness beneath the wounded surface, and were collected by cutting about 5 cm
below the wounding section in November 2017, and then non-agarwood parts were
removed.”

>Line 98-99 the number of individuals are unclear. each treatment has three
individuals, so how many trees were there? how many treatments were there? is it 1
treatment 3 trees, then you got 5 different wounding points, so total is 15 tree? or u
put all 5 wounding points on the same tree, then you have 3 biological replicates?
Also, is there any negative control (a none wounded tree). How do you select your
trees? are they side to side? or far apart? how trees interval? the information on the
sampling technique is unclear. Please clarify.
Yes, it is 1 treatment 3 trees, 5 different wounding points, so total is 15 trees.
This work only analyzed the agarwood samples formed from different locations of
trees, and we didn’t analyze the samples from the none wounded tree. We selected the
30-year-old trees with similar diameter, about 20-30 cm, and the trees interval was
about 5~20 meters.
>Line 99 the information in the Introduction should merge in here. However I have
to raise my disagreement on the use of the name for the agarwood type as the
specimen name, but to replace them by the organ/location of the tree where the
wounding treatment is carried out as the specimen name. In such manner, the names
for the type of agarwood form can be mentioned in the Discussion section. Unless the
authors took the initiative to prepare an additional subsection in the MnM to
specifically describe how the wounding treatment was carried out.
Yes, the editor is right. We have merged the information in the Introduction of
sample collection here, and named the samples by number (I, II, III, IV, V) as
following. The transverse section of the main trunk of A. sinensis trees were labeled
as I (about 2.0-2.5 meter height); the transverse section of lateral branch of A. sinensis
trees were labeled as II (about 1.5-1.8 meter height); the transverse section of the
main trunk below the branches of A. sinensis trees were labeled as III (about 1.0-1.2
meter height); the longitudinal section of the main trunk of A. sinensis trees were
labeled as IV (about 0.8-1.2 meter height); and the longitudinal section of the main
trunk of A. sinensis trees near the root were labeled as V (about 0.2-0.4 meter height).

“All agarwood samples were washed with distilled sterile water. Surfaces were sterilized by
soaking the tissues sequentially in 75% ethanol for 2 min, followed by a rinse with sterile water,
and dried with sterile filter paper. Then, DNA was extracted from 100 mg each agarwood sample
using the MoBio PowerPlant Pro DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA,
USA). Agarwood samples had two replicate extractions per sample to achieve sufficient DNA
yields. DNA purity was monitored on 1% agarose gels. All extractions were quantified on a
NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Products, Wimingto, DE, USA). According to the
concentration, DNA was diluted to 1 ng/µL using sterile water. Internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1)
sequences in all samples were amplified using the universal primers ITS5-1737F
(5'-GGAAGTAAAAGTCGTAACAAGG-3') and ITS2-2043R
(5'-GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC-3') using a barcode to distinguish samples. The PCR was
performed with a Phusion® High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA,
UK). PCR was conducted according to Cregger et al [28]. PCR products were mixed in equal
ratios. Then, the mixed PCR products were purified with a Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen,
Germany). Sequencing libraries were generated using the Ion Plus Fragment Library Kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) following the manufacturer’s recommendations, and index
codes were added. Library quality was assessed on a Qubit@ 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies Inc.,
CA, USA). The library was sequenced on a Thermofisher Life Ion S5TM platform (Thermo Fisher

“The identification of volatiles of the agarwood samples was based on an

with Kovats retention index (RI) [41]. The mass spectral match factor (probability>60)
was used to judge whether a peak was correctly identified or not. For the
determination of RI, calculated on the first dimension, a series of n-alkanes (C9 to
C23) were used under the same experimental conditions. The computational formula
of each compound RI was as follows:
lgt ' (i) - lgt ' (n)
RI = 100 × {n + }
lgt ' (n + 1) - lgt ' (n)
n and n+1 were the number of carbon atoms in alkanes eluting before and after
the compound, respectively; t'(n) and t'(n+1) were the corresponding retention time
and t'(i) was the retention time of the identified compound.”

Comments to the Author(s)
The present manuscript by Liu et al reports effects of fungal diversity on volatile
compounds in different spatial formations of agarwood originated from Aquilaria
sinensis. Authors have also showed relationship between fungal community and
volatile compounds. The experiments are well conceived and well presented.
Major concerns:
(1) where is reference of extraction method of agrawood oil? or Normally, the
volatile oil is generally obtained from hydrodistillation only. No discussion on
extraction method relevant with extracting solvent provided in manuscript.
Thanks for the reviewer’s kind advice. We have added the reference of
extraction method of agarwood oil. Truly, the volatile oil is generally obtained
from hydrodistillation. However, traditional extraction of volatile oil need a plenty
of agarwood sample. For the agarwood samples are very precious, thus we used
extracting solvent extraction method according to the related references.
(2) Use the common name for identified compounds. Kovat index is needed to
present for identification confirmation. For example, mass spectrum of
compounds 7 in Fig. 2 is not similar to those from library.
Thanks for the reviewer’s kind advice. We have added the Kovat index to the
compounds in Table 1 and the method was put in the section of Materials and
Methods. All the mass spectrum of compounds were rechecked, and the mass
spectrum of compounds 7 and 13 were put in Supplemental Figure S1.
(3) Fig S5B and Fig 5, other genus is the major group of fungi in all samples. The
fungi in other genus may be correlated mainly to volatile compound production.
The metagenome sequencing is important in this experiment. Genus of all isolated
fungal strains are completely identified by PCR.
Yes, what the reviewer said is very reasonable. Although the fungi of other
genus might be correlated to volatile compound, most of these fungi were quite
different among one type of agarwood samples. If we analyzed these data, the
credibility of the results is not high. Thus, in this work, we only analyzed the
major identified group of fungi, and we deleted Fig 5 and Fig S5B according to
the reviewer 1.
(4) GCxGC chromatogram is not clear. Select one to present between 3D or 2D.
Thank you for the reviewer’s advice. For there are many chemical
compounds were shown in GC×GC chromatogram, which is not clearly enough.
Thus, according to the suggestion from reviewer 1, we put Supplemental Table S2
in the reviewed manuscript as Table 1, and deleted all the chromatograms to make
the data more useful and understandable.
We would like to express our great appreciation to you and reviewers for
comments on our paper. Looking forward to hearing from you.
Thank you and best regards.
