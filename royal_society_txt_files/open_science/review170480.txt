Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The paper by Santillan-Urquiza et al. describes the effect of inulin coating on Zn oxide and core-
shell alpha-Fe2O3@ZnO NPs. Their model system (mussel hemocytes) is appropriate and the
approach adopted, based on measurement of fluorescent molecular probes, is innovative
allowing simultaneous evaluation of several cytotoxicity parameters and intracellular Zn
accumulation. However, the NPs were not fully characterized in the exposure media and this
limits the discussion and interpretation of the results. Indeed, one of the main conclusions of the
authors (i.e. enhanced Zn uptake is due to the NPs agglomerate size) in unsubstantiated because
the NPs hydrodynamic characterization was performed in water and not in the complex exposure
media. The salt and protein composition of the exposure media might have a profound effect on
the NPs agglomerate size that in turn can affect the NPs uptake. I think that this type of analysis
is necessary to interpret the results.
Other specific comments are listed below:
Page 5, Line 6: Please place PS before Ca/Mg-free
Page 5, Lines 12-13: how where the cells counted? This is an important aspect that should be
explained
Page 5, Line 33: The media in which the NPs were characterized should be specified here and in
the SI.
Page 5, Line 42: Were the hemocytes always exposed to NPs dispersed in PS + 1% FBS? If so state
it clearly.
Page 5, Line 47: For how long are the mussel hemocytes viable? This information is important
and should be mentioned. I am surprised to see exposure of only 2 hours, but if this is due to the
limited viability of the hemocytes in vitro, this should be clarified.
Page 6, Lines 44-55: were cells exposed to only one molecular probe? Or were they exposed to
different probes simultaneously - please clarify further.
Page 7, Lines 45- 56: was the recovery of Zn (or Fe) from NPs measured? This should be done
ideally in water, exposure media and from cell extracts. If this data is available it should be
reported. It is important to prove the validity of new methods to compare metal recovery with
more traditional methods such as ICP-MS, ICP-OES or AAS.
Page 8, Lines 45-49: how was the fluorescence normalization performed? Was the fluorescence of
each molecular probe divided by the fluoresce of the nuclear staining? Please clarify.
Page 10, Lines 19-50: this section would greatly benefit from the characterization of the NP in the
exposure media, the role of inulin on NPs stabilization is possible but should be confirmed by
DLS analysis in exposure media i.e. physiological saline supplemented with 1% FBS
Page 14, Figure 3: please include information on the method used to quantify Zn (e.g. total Zn
concentration measured by… ) Moreover, how was the normalization per cell number done?
Were the cells counted previous to extraction? Please clarify in the methods section.
3
Page 14, line 56: this data suggest that the effect is mainly due to Zn dissolution and all other
hypothesis are largely speculative. This aspect of the study should be discussed more carefully
and any other hypothesis should be substantiated by stronger evidence.
Page 15, line 46-49: this part of the discussion is not supported by NPs characterization in
exposure media. Characterization in deionized water is not necessarily reflecting the behavior of
the NPs in exposure media.
Supplementary Material
1.4. Characterization: “Results are summarized in Table 1 – not S1”.
The digestion protocol should be more detailed. How the NPs suspension
was acidified? How was the zinc concentration determined? Were standards applied?

exposure media. Moreover, how were exposure solutions prepared?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The study was well done and provides some interesting results to the community but don't
stretch your results or your model system. Your write up has a few hiccups and needs some
attention. Do not contradict yourself, it's confusing for the reader and makes it look like you
aren't sure of your work. A few specific comments below.
Your justification for testing mussel hemocytes to understand potential impacts on humans is
weak. You need to either rework your argument regarding the use of these types of materials
(supplement for micronutrients) or add more evidence that using hemocytes will adequately
model the potential impact in humans.
Table 1. You need to define your acronyms.

2.2 Animals and hemocytes collection
What size were the mussels? Provide average length
How long did the mussels remain in the tanks after purchase?
Define PS (also not defined in Table 1)
2.3 In vitro chemical exposure of mussel hemocytes
Are FBS and BSA the same thing? If so, why did you choose to use this terminology instead of
BSA? If not, why did you choose to use FBS instead of BSA?
2.8 Data analysis
You don't set your p value, you set alpha=0.05
3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Mussel hemocytes as a model for ENMs toxicity evaluation
(2nd paragraph) Here you state that hemocytes are a model to study effects of ENMs in marine
organisms. In the intro you state that they could be used to understand mammalian systems. I
believe this argument more than your intro argument. I suggest changing the intro to reflect this
rather than mammalian systems.
(bottom of page 9 top of 10) Do you mean you validated it here or in another publication? If you
validated here then this needs to be in methods. Clarify.
3.2 Cellular responses to nZnO and na-Fe2O3@ZnO exposure
(bottom of page 10) "This indicates that inulin coating has an effect on zinc uptake without
affecting other important cellular functions." - For one, this section doesn't discuss Zn uptake, the
next section does so you should move this there. Secondly, this argument is odd, why would you
say that inulin had an effect on uptake? Is it that it affected dissolution? Or aggregation? And that
impacted uptake? Is that what you mean? Reword.
3.3 Inulin coating of nZnO and na-Fe2O3@ZnO increases zinc uptake
(bottom of page 13) Here is the argument you should be making regarding inulin's impact on Zn
uptake. Either remove the statement in 3.2 or reword it to this.
3.4 Exploring mechanisms for increased zinc uptake
When discussing figure 4 you say that the "presence of chemicals decreased phagocytosis" and in
the figure 4 caption you also say "chemicals". What chemicals are your referring to? Reword this
to make your argument clear.
(Page 15 Line ~ 30/31) Your argument that inulin coating may increase phagocytotic selectivity
toward nanoparticles doesn't seem to make sense considering the info provided in the previous
paragraph (or your statement in the next paragraph). Don't contradict yourself. Rework this or
remove.

1.1 Preparation of ZnO nanoparticles
synthesized is spelled incorrectly (same in the next section as well)

Comments to the Author:
I'd like to thank the authors for submitting this ms, and the reviewers for providing fair and
constructive reviews. Both expert reviewers were enthusiastic about this manuscript. I believe
there is a key piece of data missing from the current version of the manuscript. The authors
characterized nanoparticle suspension in a different medium than the exposure medium. This is a
pivotal issue, as one reviewer points out. Further, there appears to be some internal
inconsistencies in interpretation. I think the authors should furnish at least some data on how the
parameters change in the exposure medium. All other comments can be fixed in a revision. I hope
the authors would seriously consider revising this potentially impactful manuscript based on the
constructive comments provided by the expert reviewers.
