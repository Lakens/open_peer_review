This paper addresses beta-diversity of coastal communities and how such diversity patterns
could inform about recovery rates using two taxonomical groups. I read this paper with a great
interest as experimental studies about beta-diversity and metacommunity applications are very
rare. Often the problem is the low number of experimental sites, hindering the use of spatial
multivariate statistics (distance decay or raw data approach). I found that paper is very clearly
written and nicely embedded both in general theory and in a context of coastal biology. I have
however major concerns about the paper.
I found that hypotheses are not well backed up by references or explained in the text. I would
suggest to explain better especially the first hypothesis at it is not clear enough for the readers. I
understand that references need not to be repeated if given in the Intro but I did not find clear
justification for especially the first hypothesis.
I have major concern with the beta diversity analyses. It seems you use 6x5=30 values of beta
diversity for the samples. If you use classical Whittaker beta diversity, you need to divide gamma
diversity by MEAN alpha diversity, not by sample alpha diversity, which seems to be the case
here (page 8, lines 184-189). Please see in Wikipedia (beta diversity):
“The simplest of Whittaker's original definitions of beta diversity is
ß = <U+03B3>/a
Here gamma diversity is the total species diversity of a landscape and alpha diversity is the mean
species diversity per habitat.”
Therefore, one cannot get true beta diversity value for each sample as beta diversity is a regional
variable, quantifying how much spatial variation there is among sites or samples. I think only
proper way to get local beta diversity values is to use local contribution to beta diversity method
(LCBD) (Legendre & Caceres 2013 Ecol Lett). Thus, it may be that your beta diversity values are
mostly driven by variation in alpha diversity and samples within sites have one common gamma
diversity and are therefore not independent. It seems it is possible to get one true beta diversity
value for each site based on six samples, not six local values. If this is the case, I would suggest to
use LCBD method here if you would like to do regressions with beta diversity values. Otherwise,
it may be that the number of beta diversity values is too low.
In sum, I would suggest to double-check the analyses and consider the independence. But, if you
have done the analyses correctly, please write methods very clearly in the revision as this is very
critical point here. If I missed the point, it is likely that some other readers will do the same.

Understanding which processes are responsible for structuring ecological communities is
essential to fully comprehend patterns of community recovery following disturbances. The
finding that the increase in the disturbance regime ultimately leads to the homogenisation of
habitats and communities is alarming under the climate change scenario. Therefore, I find this
study interesting and it certainly merits publication after minor revision.
Specific comments
p. 3 lines 61-62: it is not clear how high beta diversity is related to dispersal and environmental
filtering, perhaps add another sentence explaining how these processes can generate high beta
diversity (I found some details on a paper you cite - Vanshoenwinkel et al., 2013) i. e. stochastic
colonization and priority effects.
p. 4 line 101: Isn't plot beta the within-site diversity? If so, maybe you could add that information
in brackets to clarify.
p. 5 lines 103-106 (hypothesis 1): It was not clear to me, by reading your Introduction, why you
would expect this to happen (ambient - nestedness and disturbed - replacement). Please justify
this prediction in the Introduction.

p. 9 line 201: add "-" after the letter "E" in the title.
p. 10 lines 241-243: Did authors used the p-values to compare the rates of recovery between sites?
If so, shouldn't effect sizes be used instead?

From Matt Whalen, University of British Columbia
**General:
This manuscript (MS) presents an experimental investigation of community assembly processes
and the causes of spatial patterns in community structure. Experimental clearings of rocky shore
communities are compared with undisturbed areas one year following disturbance. The pairwise
similarity in community presence-absence patterns between cleared and uncleared plots were
interpreted as the rate of recovery (high similarity equal fast recovery). These community
8
similarities were compared using a variety of explanatory variables at local and regional scales,
and the results are discussed in light of potential future disturbances that might occur at different
scales (i.e. so-called “cumulative impacts” and ”large-scale disturbances”).
The framework of the MS hangs on the idea that sites with a similar complement of species is
more connected than sites with less similar species composition, which depends on how
connectivity is defined. The questions are fundamental and the results are intriguing and deserve
to be published, but it is difficult to relate the results to the interpretation and framework
supported by the MS. The MS lacks some basic information about the communities (e.g. what
were the infauna?, how was abundance considered?) that might help build a context for the
reader that would allow her to interpret the results in light of ecological theory.
I recommend major revisions. A revised MS should more critically consider what the various
decompositions of beta diversity mean, and whether they can be are appropriately used as a
surrogate for connectivity or for the influence of environmental gradients. The MS should
generally put more stock into more clearly and specifically discussing/interpreting the results
that were presented. Perhaps the short format of this journal prevents a more lengthy discussion,
but there seems to be a lot to unpack and describe from the results.
**Major Comments:
I had a difficult time keeping track of how the different components of beta diversity related to
the hypotheses being tested, the analyses, and the interpretation of the results. I think
terminology had something to do with this. The “replacement” and “nestedness” indices were
both confusing terms to me (this is especially true from reading the abstract) and I worry their
interpretation as proxies for connectivity is misleading. Perhaps “turnover” as a term is no less
problematic when it comes to expressing spatial diversity patterns, but it is used to define
replacement several times in the MS and is likely more familiar to most readers. If replacement is
strictly different than turnover, then perhaps more descriptive language could be used to help
readers associate the terminology with meaning.
The biggest concern I have for this MS is the use of beta diversity to define sites in terms of
connectivity. Given the many ways places and communities can be connected and the many
factors that influence connectivity (e.g. life history, scale), it is unclear what meaning of
connectivity the manuscript uses. Sites with low beta diversity are similar in terms of species
presence-absence, but does this mean they are connected? Surely, over some scale of time and
space they are connected for all species in this area, but two sites that are similar based on
community composition may have similar environmental conditions that allow a complement of
species to exist and/or dominate even if all sites are well connected. The MS points out that
species replacement was low, suggesting weak influence of environmental filtering, yet this does
not alone mean that similar sites are well connected.
Again about connectivity, the manuscript mentions several times (abstract, introduction,
discussion) that sites with low among site beta diversity are more connected to the regional
species pool. This kind of “connectivity” seems subtly different than using it refer to dispersal of
propagules. Does connection to the regional species arise as a consequence of long-term
environmental conditions that help define the size and number of niches or through rapid
replenishment from propagules (sourced from the same site or from other sites)? Within-site
connectivity was also implicated several times, but again connectivity really means similarity. Is
it possible that sites that recovered fastest had smaller numbers of species present at the site?
Predictions: some of the predictions seem unsupported, or at least the rationale behind them is
unclear to the reader. For instance, prediction 1 makes fairly concrete predictions about how the
components of beta diversity should look for ambient and disturbed communities. However, it is
not clear why this prediction is made. Does it have to do with environmental gradients having an
9
influence on species occurrence patterns over long periods of time (high nestedness predicted for
ambient plots) and dispersal limiting what species can occupy patches early in succession
following an acute disturbance (high replacement for disturbed plots)? This kind of information
would help the reader make sense of the predictions and help the reader interpret results in light
of the prediction. Prediction 3 seems the least satisfying of the three because it only predicts some
difference. How might these relationships differ and why?
The measurement of each of replacement and nestedness is the mirror image of the other (plainly
evident in Fig. 1), and it seems almost impossible to talk about one without talking about the
other. Do both measurement need to be used? I think it may be possible for them to be considered
inverted gradients of the same information. The data at hand suggest generally low turnover
among sites for all organisms, which may be due to the fact that the extent of the study was small
and environments similar, lessening the influence of broadscale environmental filtering or other
(perhaps more localized) processes that would cause more marked differences in species
composition. Turnover among sites was slightly higher for epibenthos in disturbed plots than in
ambient plots, which should signify some spatial constraint perhaps due to dispersal limitation.
Some of the discussion points seem contradictory at first glance. The abstract states, “sites closely
connected to the regional species pool (low among-site beta diversity) did not recover faster,”
while the last sentence of the paper states, “our finding that more connected and, thus, more
homogeneous communities recover faster”. Was the recovery rate determined by similarity in
species composition or not? Based on Table 2, within-site (plot) similarity hastened species
composition recovery of epibenthos, while plot similarity slowed recovery of infauna. The key is
the spatial scale because among-site beta diversity only appears as an interaction for infauna, but
this is sometimes difficult to keep track of when reading the paper. These are key messages that
the MS needs to ensure are clear and consistent.
Why was presence-absence data used instead of raw community matrices filled with abundance
data? Especially for questions about rates of recovery, should not abundance or percent cover be
an important requirement for community similarity? Understandably, the data were collected
only one year after clearing, so it is quite possible that abundance was still low in disturbed plots.
Given the lack of descriptive data on the communities (for example, we don’t even know what
possible taxa make up infauna without consulting other publications from the area), it is difficult
for the reader to get a sense of what is going on with these communities.
I disagree with some of the interpretation of statistical results (see minor comments below for
more detail). The MS should be careful when describing predictions from polynomial and
interaction terms. These “non-linearities” are not discussed much in the body of the discussion,
which makes it difficult to asses how important they might be. I think the MS would benefit
greatly by more explicitly considering, and perhaps graphing, model predictions. It would help
the reader visually assess, for instance, how the interaction between site replacement and site beta
diversity influence infaunal recovery patterns, or how the polynomial terms influence responses
over the range of the predictor. An extra figure showing some of the patterns might be worth
considering.
L81-88: This is the part of the manuscript that attempts to link components of beta diversity to
ecological processes that generate connectivity. However, it comes off more like a presentation of
caveats surrounding (and hope for) good surrogates of dispersal and connectivity rather than a
justification for how and why the beta diversity components are themselves good surrogates for
dispersal and connectivity. Can the MS provide for justification for using beta diversity to infer
connectivity via dispersal?
L300-307: It seems to me from the results presented in the MS that documenting the changes in
10
large plants (all macroalgae, including turfs?) and animals (mussels, barnacles, gastropods?) does
provide a fairly good surrogate for rocky shore assembly processes. As the name suggests, all of
the infauna seem to associate with algal turfs. Therefore, anything affecting the recovery of those
turfs should also affects the recovery of the infauna. It seems like most important predictors of
infaunal recovery had something to do with epibenthic recovery, so it seems like a stretch for the
MS to argue that changes in large plants and animals is a poor surrogate. Also consider Best et al
2014 Ecology (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/13-1480.1/epdf) for more on large
and small animals and their relationships with plants.
Figure 1: I was surprised to only find one figure in this paper. Figure 1 is interesting and I think
helps to tell the story. However, I feel it is simultaneously redundant and difficult to interpret. It
might be helpful to connect the points belonging to a group with lines or convex hulls to help
guide the reader to patterns. I think panel B should be removed. Mention that replacement is (1-
nestedness) in the legend and/or add a descriptive scale to the x axis in panel A that shows how
moving to the left means replacement while moving to the right means nestedness. Would it be
possible to replace panel B with a ternary plot like those used in Podani & Schmera 2011 and
Legendre 2014? I think this would more allow easily allow comparison to other datasets that have
used these beta diversity decompositions.
Illustration of major concerns from the abstact:
Because the abstract is dense and contains jargon that is unclear upon first reading, I would like
to consider a few of the sentences in order to help illustrate some of the major comments. I think
the abstract could be crafted to stand alone more from the main body:
L33: Epibenthos is described as being composed mostly of macroalgae. Why not consider
macroalgae separately?
L33: Turf infauna are not described here in the sense of which taxa were present, nor are they
described elsewhere in the manuscript even though they were “enumerated at the lowest
taxonomic resolution possible.” Despite infauna being an important component of the story, the
reader does not know what these organisms are.
L35: infaunal recovery was strongly influenced by local factors. True, but it is also worth pointing
out that these relationships were complicated (most model terms were polynomials or
interactions, and one included connection to regional species pool).
L37: Nestedness and replacement immediately stood out to me as jargon that may not be widely
known. Consider adjusting the language here to something more descriptive.
L39: Are sites with low among-site beta diversity actually more “connected” to the regional
species pool? This stood out upon first reading as dubious.
L40-42: The finding that infauna may be more influenced by dispersal (than epibenthos?) is
intriguing. However, the MS did not explicitly discuss this finding. Were infaunal communities
actually more influenced by dispersal? Among-site replacement was only an “important”
(supported) predictor as it interacted with site beta diversity, so it seems difficult to argue for
this.
L45: Cumulative effects: What does this mean? Later in the MS we find out this means the effect
of many small-scale disturbances, but this is not clear at the start.
**Minor Comments:
L28: “multiple rocky shore sites” is more concise here.
L33: please define turf here, and elsewhere in the MS, as algal turf. This small adjustment may
help readers connect more quickly to the material.
L34: replace conversely with “whereas” or “while” or separate these phrases with a period
rather than a comma.
L83: dispersing marine larvae are generally considered propagules. Consider deleting “larval or”
L93: Rather than “significantly enhance”, perhaps “contribute to” implies that they are part of the
diversity rather than directly promoting it.
11
L94: What makes this experiment novel? Is it the fact that large plots were used, that multiple
sites were used, the study of infauna, or the combination of these? I suggest the MS refrain from
this type of self-assessment.
Methods (Study sites): It might be helpful to provide some insight into the geology of the area, at
least as a link to sinuosity and fractal measures.
L149-155: GIS was used but never defined. It is not entirely clear what separates Sinuosity from
Sinuosity (GIS). The language used in Table S1 is more intuitive and should probable be used in
the main body (e.g. “fractal dimension” is much more informative that “fractal (GIS)”.
Furthermore, the description of line segments for the ARCGIS calculated metrics is difficult to
follow (where do the line segments come from?). Finally, what is the relationship between fractal
dimension and sinuosity at the large scale? It appears that they are linearly related nearly one-to-
one, so why calculate both?
L119: Why is it important to know that “barometric tide may dominate water level”? Most
readers may not know what barometric tides are. I think the meaning is that tidal amplitude is
low and therefore sites are similar and that 1 meter square quadrats would be sufficient to cover
the entire intertidal zone. This should be made explicit if it is important.
L134-138: Percent cover only pertains to epibenthos. Make this clear.
L138: can the MS comment on the efficacy of the coring method? From the information provided
at the beginning of the methods, which gives us our only concrete clue about site differences in
community composition, it sounds like turfs may not be present or abundant at all sites.
L156-163: AHCI seems like an interesting measurement, but potentially one that misleads. The
largest canopy forming species have the highest AHCI values yet they likely do not have the
highest surface area to volume ratios. It seems like some of the smaller algae (e.g. filamentous
turf) would have very high complexity despite generally small size, which infauna might
respond to more than thallus size.
L160: Is “paint” a common term for corallines? I am used to hearing about coralline crusts.
L227: “For both ambient and disturbed plots, the relativized richness difference was a larger
proportion of beta-diversity for the infauna than the epibenthos”. This is not so obvious from Fig
1. Unlike other assertions in this paragraph, this particular result lacks a statistical test. Is it not
the case that richness differences were higher ambient than disturbed plots for epibenthos and
infauna? What is the interpretation of richness differences being higher in ambient than disturbed
plots? It would be interesting for the MS to comment on this.
L252-254: The squared terms here are confusing. I interpreted these as second degree polynomial
terms, rather than the explanatory variable squared. In the former case, it is somewhat misleading
to say that infaunal recovery is positively related to epibenthic recovery. I expect the
interpretation to be that infaunal recovery was highest at intermediate cover of Corallina and
lowest at intermediate levels of epibenthic recover.
L270: “sites with higher…replacement…had higher infaunal recovery.” This result is difficult to
support just as an interaction, even with the parenthetical “multiplied by site beta-diversity”
added. It is possible that recovery was decreased with increasing replacement, but this effect was
lessened as site beta-diversity increases (overall negative trend with positive interaction term).
L271-272: Does this sentence run counter to the inclusion of an interaction term (Site replacement
* Infaunal site beta-A) for infaunal recovery? Prediction 2 states that sites with low site beta
diversity would recover faster. Can the MS please address this? Is it because replacement did not
dominate?
L286: Are turfs more likely to have vegetative propagating thalli? Currently the MS does not
clarify this, and it influences the reader’s ability to understand the point of this paragraph.
Furthermore, the finding that turf dominated communites recovered faster than macroalgal one
is very interesting, yet is only brought up as a minor point in the discussion. I think this result
warrants further attention in the MS as it likely influences patterns seen for infauna.
Supplement: I expected to find more data and methods here than what was presented.

Comments to the Author(s)
Understanding which processes are responsible for structuring ecological communities is
essential to fully comprehend patterns of community recovery following disturbances. The
finding that the increase in the disturbance regime ultimately leads to the homogenisation of
habitats and communities is alarming under the climate change scenario. Therefore, I find this
study interesting and it certainly merits publication after minor revision.
Specific comments
p. 3 lines 61-62: it is not clear how high beta diversity is related to dispersal and environmental
filtering, perhaps add another sentence explaining how these processes can generate high beta
diversity (I found some details on a paper you cite - Vanshoenwinkel et al., 2013) i. e. stochastic
colonization and priority effects.
p. 4 line 101: Isn't plot beta the within-site diversity? If so, maybe you could add that information
in brackets to clarify.
p. 5 lines 103-106 (hypothesis 1): It was not clear to me, by reading your Introduction, why you
would expect this to happen (ambient - nestedness and disturbed - replacement). Please justify
this prediction in the Introduction.
p. 5 line 116: I could not find Supplemental Figure 1, only Table 1.
p. 6 line 129: please add a space between the end of paragraph and the title.
p. 8 line 180: move the comma after the word "diversity" to after the word "replication"; makes the
sentence more readable.
p. 9 line 201: add "-" after the letter "E" in the title.
p. 10 lines 241-243: Did authors used the p-values to compare the rates of recovery between sites?
If so, shouldn't effect sizes be used instead?

p. 13 line 300: "emphasizes" instead of "emphases"
p. 13 line 313: "different" instead of "difference"

Comments to the Author(s)
From Matt Whalen, University of British Columbia
**General:
This manuscript (MS) presents an experimental investigation of community assembly processes
and the causes of spatial patterns in community structure. Experimental clearings of rocky shore
communities are compared with undisturbed areas one year following disturbance. The pairwise
similarity in community presence-absence patterns between cleared and uncleared plots were
interpreted as the rate of recovery (high similarity equal fast recovery). These community
similarities were compared using a variety of explanatory variables at local and regional scales,
and the results are discussed in light of potential future disturbances that might occur at different
scales (i.e. so-called “cumulative impacts” and ”large-scale disturbances”).
The framework of the MS hangs on the idea that sites with a similar complement of species is
more connected than sites with less similar species composition, which depends on how
connectivity is defined. The questions are fundamental and the results are intriguing and deserve
to be published, but it is difficult to relate the results to the interpretation and framework
supported by the MS. The MS lacks some basic information about the communities (e.g. what
were the infauna?, how was abundance considered?) that might help build a context for the
reader that would allow her to interpret the results in light of ecological theory.
I recommend major revisions. A revised MS should more critically consider what the various
decompositions of beta diversity mean, and whether they can be are appropriately used as a
surrogate for connectivity or for the influence of environmental gradients. The MS should
generally put more stock into more clearly and specifically discussing/interpreting the results
that were presented. Perhaps the short format of this journal prevents a more lengthy discussion,
but there seems to be a lot to unpack and describe from the results.
**Major Comments:
I had a difficult time keeping track of how the different components of beta diversity related to
the hypotheses being tested, the analyses, and the interpretation of the results. I think
terminology had something to do with this. The “replacement” and “nestedness” indices were
both confusing terms to me (this is especially true from reading the abstract) and I worry their
interpretation as proxies for connectivity is misleading. Perhaps “turnover” as a term is no less
problematic when it comes to expressing spatial diversity patterns, but it is used to define
replacement several times in the MS and is likely more familiar to most readers. If replacement is
strictly different than turnover, then perhaps more descriptive language could be used to help
readers associate the terminology with meaning.
The biggest concern I have for this MS is the use of beta diversity to define sites in terms of
connectivity. Given the many ways places and communities can be connected and the many
factors that influence connectivity (e.g. life history, scale), it is unclear what meaning of
connectivity the manuscript uses. Sites with low beta diversity are similar in terms of species
16
presence-absence, but does this mean they are connected? Surely, over some scale of time and
space they are connected for all species in this area, but two sites that are similar based on
community composition may have similar environmental conditions that allow a complement of
species to exist and/or dominate even if all sites are well connected. The MS points out that
species replacement was low, suggesting weak influence of environmental filtering, yet this does
not alone mean that similar sites are well connected.
Again about connectivity, the manuscript mentions several times (abstract, introduction,
discussion) that sites with low among site beta diversity are more connected to the regional
species pool. This kind of “connectivity” seems subtly different than using it refer to dispersal of
propagules. Does connection to the regional species arise as a consequence of long-term
environmental conditions that help define the size and number of niches or through rapid
replenishment from propagules (sourced from the same site or from other sites)? Within-site
connectivity was also implicated several times, but again connectivity really means similarity. Is
it possible that sites that recovered fastest had smaller numbers of species present at the site?
Predictions: some of the predictions seem unsupported, or at least the rationale behind them is
unclear to the reader. For instance, prediction 1 makes fairly concrete predictions about how the
components of beta diversity should look for ambient and disturbed communities. However, it is
not clear why this prediction is made. Does it have to do with environmental gradients having an
influence on species occurrence patterns over long periods of time (high nestedness predicted for
ambient plots) and dispersal limiting what species can occupy patches early in succession
following an acute disturbance (high replacement for disturbed plots)? This kind of information
would help the reader make sense of the predictions and help the reader interpret results in light
of the prediction. Prediction 3 seems the least satisfying of the three because it only predicts some
difference. How might these relationships differ and why?
The measurement of each of replacement and nestedness is the mirror image of the other (plainly
evident in Fig. 1), and it seems almost impossible to talk about one without talking about the
other. Do both measurement need to be used? I think it may be possible for them to be considered
inverted gradients of the same information. The data at hand suggest generally low turnover
among sites for all organisms, which may be due to the fact that the extent of the study was small
and environments similar, lessening the influence of broadscale environmental filtering or other
(perhaps more localized) processes that would cause more marked differences in species
composition. Turnover among sites was slightly higher for epibenthos in disturbed plots than in
ambient plots, which should signify some spatial constraint perhaps due to dispersal limitation.
Some of the discussion points seem contradictory at first glance. The abstract states, “sites closely
connected to the regional species pool (low among-site beta diversity) did not recover faster,”
while the last sentence of the paper states, “our finding that more connected and, thus, more
homogeneous communities recover faster”. Was the recovery rate determined by similarity in
species composition or not? Based on Table 2, within-site (plot) similarity hastened species
composition recovery of epibenthos, while plot similarity slowed recovery of infauna. The key is
the spatial scale because among-site beta diversity only appears as an interaction for infauna, but
this is sometimes difficult to keep track of when reading the paper. These are key messages that
the MS needs to ensure are clear and consistent.
Why was presence-absence data used instead of raw community matrices filled with abundance
data? Especially for questions about rates of recovery, should not abundance or percent cover be
an important requirement for community similarity? Understandably, the data were collected
only one year after clearing, so it is quite possible that abundance was still low in disturbed plots.
Given the lack of descriptive data on the communities (for example, we don’t even know what
17
possible taxa make up infauna without consulting other publications from the area), it is difficult
for the reader to get a sense of what is going on with these communities.
I disagree with some of the interpretation of statistical results (see minor comments below for
more detail). The MS should be careful when describing predictions from polynomial and
interaction terms. These “non-linearities” are not discussed much in the body of the discussion,
which makes it difficult to asses how important they might be. I think the MS would benefit
greatly by more explicitly considering, and perhaps graphing, model predictions. It would help
the reader visually assess, for instance, how the interaction between site replacement and site beta
diversity influence infaunal recovery patterns, or how the polynomial terms influence responses
over the range of the predictor. An extra figure showing some of the patterns might be worth
considering.
L81-88: This is the part of the manuscript that attempts to link components of beta diversity to
ecological processes that generate connectivity. However, it comes off more like a presentation of
caveats surrounding (and hope for) good surrogates of dispersal and connectivity rather than a
justification for how and why the beta diversity components are themselves good surrogates for
dispersal and connectivity. Can the MS provide for justification for using beta diversity to infer
connectivity via dispersal?
L300-307: It seems to me from the results presented in the MS that documenting the changes in
large plants (all macroalgae, including turfs?) and animals (mussels, barnacles, gastropods?) does
provide a fairly good surrogate for rocky shore assembly processes. As the name suggests, all of
the infauna seem to associate with algal turfs. Therefore, anything affecting the recovery of those
turfs should also affects the recovery of the infauna. It seems like most important predictors of
infaunal recovery had something to do with epibenthic recovery, so it seems like a stretch for the
MS to argue that changes in large plants and animals is a poor surrogate. Also consider Best et al
2014 Ecology (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/13-1480.1/epdf) for more on large
and small animals and their relationships with plants.
Figure 1: I was surprised to only find one figure in this paper. Figure 1 is interesting and I think
helps to tell the story. However, I feel it is simultaneously redundant and difficult to interpret. It
might be helpful to connect the points belonging to a group with lines or convex hulls to help
guide the reader to patterns. I think panel B should be removed. Mention that replacement is (1-
nestedness) in the legend and/or add a descriptive scale to the x axis in panel A that shows how
moving to the left means replacement while moving to the right means nestedness. Would it be
possible to replace panel B with a ternary plot like those used in Podani & Schmera 2011 and
Legendre 2014? I think this would more allow easily allow comparison to other datasets that have
used these beta diversity decompositions.
Illustration of major concerns from the abstact:
Because the abstract is dense and contains jargon that is unclear upon first reading, I would like
to consider a few of the sentences in order to help illustrate some of the major comments. I think
the abstract could be crafted to stand alone more from the main body:
L33: Epibenthos is described as being composed mostly of macroalgae. Why not consider
macroalgae separately?
L33: Turf infauna are not described here in the sense of which taxa were present, nor are they
described elsewhere in the manuscript even though they were “enumerated at the lowest
taxonomic resolution possible.” Despite infauna being an important component of the story, the
reader does not know what these organisms are.
L35: infaunal recovery was strongly influenced by local factors. True, but it is also worth pointing
out that these relationships were complicated (most model terms were polynomials or
interactions, and one included connection to regional species pool).
18
L37: Nestedness and replacement immediately stood out to me as jargon that may not be widely
known. Consider adjusting the language here to something more descriptive.
L39: Are sites with low among-site beta diversity actually more “connected” to the regional
species pool? This stood out upon first reading as dubious.
L40-42: The finding that infauna may be more influenced by dispersal (than epibenthos?) is
intriguing. However, the MS did not explicitly discuss this finding. Were infaunal communities
actually more influenced by dispersal? Among-site replacement was only an “important”
(supported) predictor as it interacted with site beta diversity, so it seems difficult to argue for
this.
L45: Cumulative effects: What does this mean? Later in the MS we find out this means the effect
of many small-scale disturbances, but this is not clear at the start.
**Minor Comments:
L28: “multiple rocky shore sites” is more concise here.
L33: please define turf here, and elsewhere in the MS, as algal turf. This small adjustment may
help readers connect more quickly to the material.
L34: replace conversely with “whereas” or “while” or separate these phrases with a period rather
than a comma.
L83: dispersing marine larvae are generally considered propagules. Consider deleting “larval or”
L93: Rather than “significantly enhance”, perhaps “contribute to” implies that they are part of the
diversity rather than directly promoting it.
L94: What makes this experiment novel? Is it the fact that large plots were used, that multiple
sites were used, the study of infauna, or the combination of these? I suggest the MS refrain from
this type of self-assessment.
Methods (Study sites): It might be helpful to provide some insight into the geology of the area, at
least as a link to sinuosity and fractal measures.
L149-155: GIS was used but never defined. It is not entirely clear what separates Sinuosity from
Sinuosity (GIS). The language used in Table S1 is more intuitive and should probable be used in
the main body (e.g. “fractal dimension” is much more informative that “fractal (GIS)”.
Furthermore, the description of line segments for the ARCGIS calculated metrics is difficult to
follow (where do the line segments come from?). Finally, what is the relationship between fractal
dimension and sinuosity at the large scale? It appears that they are linearly related nearly one-to-
one, so why calculate both?
L119: Why is it important to know that “barometric tide may dominate water level”? Most
readers may not know what barometric tides are. I think the meaning is that tidal amplitude is
low and therefore sites are similar and that 1 meter square quadrats would be sufficient to cover
the entire intertidal zone. This should be made explicit if it is important.
L134-138: Percent cover only pertains to epibenthos. Make this clear.
L138: can the MS comment on the efficacy of the coring method? From the information provided
at the beginning of the methods, which gives us our only concrete clue about site differences in
community composition, it sounds like turfs may not be present or abundant at all sites.
L156-163: AHCI seems like an interesting measurement, but potentially one that misleads. The
largest canopy forming species have the highest AHCI values yet they likely do not have the
highest surface area to volume ratios. It seems like some of the smaller algae (e.g. filamentous
turf) would have very high complexity despite generally small size, which infauna might
respond to more than thallus size.
L160: Is “paint” a common term for corallines? I am used to hearing about coralline crusts.
L227: “For both ambient and disturbed plots, the relativized richness difference was a larger
proportion of beta-diversity for the infauna than the epibenthos”. This is not so obvious from Fig
1. Unlike other assertions in this paragraph, this particular result lacks a statistical test. Is it not
the case that richness differences were higher ambient than disturbed plots for epibenthos and
19
infauna? What is the interpretation of richness differences being higher in ambient than disturbed
plots? It would be interesting for the MS to comment on this.
L252-254: The squared terms here are confusing. I interpreted these as second degree polynomial
terms, rather than the explanatory variable squared. In the former case, it is somewhat misleading
to say that infaunal recovery is positively related to epibenthic recovery. I expect the
interpretation to be that infaunal recovery was highest at intermediate cover of Corallina and
lowest at intermediate levels of epibenthic recover.
L270: “sites with higher…replacement…had higher infaunal recovery.” This result is difficult to
support just as an interaction, even with the parenthetical “multiplied by site beta-diversity”
added. It is possible that recovery was decreased with increasing replacement, but this effect was
lessened as site beta-diversity increases (overall negative trend with positive interaction term).
L271-272: Does this sentence run counter to the inclusion of an interaction term (Site replacement
* Infaunal site beta-A) for infaunal recovery? Prediction 2 states that sites with low site beta
diversity would recover faster. Can the MS please address this? Is it because replacement did not
dominate?
L286: Are turfs more likely to have vegetative propagating thalli? Currently the MS does not
clarify this, and it influences the reader’s ability to understand the point of this paragraph.
Furthermore, the finding that turf dominated communites recovered faster than macroalgal one
is very interesting, yet is only brought up as a minor point in the discussion. I think this result
warrants further attention in the MS as it likely influences patterns seen for infauna.
Supplement: I expected to find more data and methods here than what was presented.

This manuscript is greatly improved in several ways, and I think we can all thank Dr. Legendre
for his generous input. For my part, the manuscript (MS) is much more approachable to the
general reader, whether or not they already have knowledge about marine intertidal
communities or the decomposition of beta diversity. Upon seeing the MS again after revision, I
really think the novelty of this study is threefold: 1) Multi-scale inference across sites and within
sites; 2) experimental manipulation of disturbance that spans the range of the intertidal zone
(rather than plot size per se); and 3) focus on multiple groups of organisms – the habitat formers
and the organisms that rely on biogenic habitat. All of these attributes help to uncover
mechanisms for how communities assemble (as revealed by beta diversity decomposition). They
are also some of the hallmarks of marine ecology, specifically intertidal ecology, which makes it
deserving of attention from ecologists in general. After seeing Dr. Legendre’s presentation at
WCMB in Montreal, I am convinced that empirical test of beta diversity are essential, and this MS
gets us one step closer while revealing how the complexity of natural systems makes studying
beta diversity less straight-forward than theory might suggest. I find the work and the
complexity of the results interesting and inspiring. I still think the MS suffers from vague
language, and I try to point out some of these instances below. The added figures in the
21
supplement are very helpful (more on that below). I recommend publication after some minor
revision.
Vague language: I think the MS will be more accessible (and perhaps more likely to be cited) if it
can make the language clear, and the connection to theory concrete. I do not advocate for a much
longer paper about the nuanced responses about every species. The MS already tries to
incorporate some of this nuance in the form of natural history and basic biological information,
and for some groups like infauna it seems that this information is just as important as
decomposing beta diversity. So, I like the marriage of abstract diversity theory and more colorful
and relatable information about species and their potential interactions. This is a strength for the
MS. Below I list a few instances where I think the language is vague or the message unclear. I
leave it to the authors to find solutions, knowing that readers will appreciate the paper much
more if they can digest it easily.
L 300 – indications – what does this mean and why are the results not worthy of interpretation?
L 334 – local features – this is vague
L 336 – I know it was just stated that environmental factors were not important, but I think it
would be helpful to make it clear the homogeneity here means low within-site beta diversity.
Prediction paragraph (L 123-138) – This paragraph is important and I think it could be
strengthened to emphasize the important points about scales of space and time and how these
inform predictions. It is difficult to understand some of the key concepts in this MS when they are
presented as parenthetical statements, like spatial constraints. I see how spatial constraints play
an important role in beta diversity, but a pithy statement that connects the prediction to the
theory and the system to create a logical flow in the introduction would be very helpful. The next
sentence (L125-126) somewhat redundantly (see L 119) reiterates how the balance of nestedness
and replacement is influenced by spatial scale, but I think this discussion of space and time are
important and could be revisited in the discussion. L 138 – staged: I do not understand this
wording, but I think I understand the idea about successional trajectories. I think replacing “is
staged to” with “is tied to” or “is intimately associated with” or “is facilitated by” or “follows”
would be more meaningful. Making this part of the sentence active would also help, e.g.
“Biogenic habitat creation by macroalgae will lead to stronger habitat filtering of infauna than
epibenthos, as macroalgae facilitate infaunal recovery” --- as an aside, do mussels not also
facilitate infauna in this system? I’m thinking of systems on the Pacific Coast of North America
(e.g. Lafferty & Suchanek 2016 American Naturalist, Jurgens & Gaylord 2016 Scientific Reports).
Figures: I found it extremely helpful to see the figures that were added to the supplement. In my
initial reading of the MS, I was frustrated that the quadratic terms for cover were interpreted as
linear effects. The figure makes it clear that the effects can be interpreted this way because they
are monotonic over the range of the predictor variable. These figures also give the reader an
immediate sense of sample size, effect size, and variation. I think the MS would be strengthened
by including these figures (or at least some of them) in the main MS. Can the figures also
illustrate the interaction between site replacement and infaunal among-site beta?
Multiple regression: The MS is about beta diversity and finding how its various decompositions
inform patterns of diversity at multiple scales and in the face of disturbance. I find it curious then,
that the MS puts so much emphasis in the results on comparing (nested) models that emphasize
the role of habitat structure. Firstly, even the more complex model (selected by AIC) already
emphasizes this while illustrating some effect of replacement and richness differences. Instead of
presenting nested models motivated by philosophically different measures of model fit (e.g. AIC,
BIC) I think the MS would benefit from sticking to the more complex model (even though the top
22
three are indistinguishable based on AIC) and actually giving some interpretation to the
interaction term rather than showing it as “indication” (L300).
Minor comments:
L 32: sites
L 39: recovery being well predicted by local what? If it should be “local factors” this makes the
rest of the sentence less satisfying because habitat is one of those local factors.
L 42: replace this with and or but?
L 45: wasn’t within-site beta also important and negatively correlated with epibenthic recover. It
general, it seems the abstract needs to be tightened up a bit more.
L 103-104 - Novelty: see first paragraph of this review, but I think the MS will be strongly by
showing us how the work is novel. Yes, this should include some explicit statements about how
this work addresses gaps and advances theory, and if a direct statement about novelty is
important then I think it can be done without the reasons being parenthetical. It is not just the
plot size but how it relates to the size of the habitat (it spans most of the intertidal zone, right?).
L 185 – still unclear what these line segments are or where they come from.
L 237 – make it clear that these are the squared terms from the Podani equations.
L 348-350 – The previous part of this paragraph is about canopy-formers and how vegetative
propagation is important, but then this sentence states that the turf formers recovered faster.
Does this mean that vegetative propagation is not important or that recovery through sexual
propagules is faster than we thought (if, in fact, this is the mode of recovery for turfs)? Please
provide some interpretation to what seems like a one-off statement that counters the rest of the
paragraph.
I appreciate the taxon table added to the supplement. It gives the reader a sense of the flora and
fauna without having to dig up other papers, and it makes it clear (to me, anyway) that infauna
comprise a diverse fauna with a range of body sizes (e.g. caprellids vs harpacticoids) and life
history strategies (e.g. peracarids vs. polychates) and trophic strategies.
Table S2: Should Podolerus be Podocerus (one of my favorite genera of amphipod)?

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript is greatly improved in several ways, and I think we can all thank Dr. Legendre
for his generous input. For my part, the manuscript (MS) is much more approachable to the
general reader, whether or not they already have knowledge about marine intertidal
communities or the decomposition of beta diversity. Upon seeing the MS again after revision, I
really think the novelty of this study is threefold: 1) Multi-scale inference across sites and within
sites; 2) experimental manipulation of disturbance that spans the range of the intertidal zone
(rather than plot size per se); and 3) focus on multiple groups of organisms – the habitat formers
and the organisms that rely on biogenic habitat. All of these attributes help to uncover
mechanisms for how communities assemble (as revealed by beta diversity decomposition). They
are also some of the hallmarks of marine ecology, specifically intertidal ecology, which makes it
deserving of attention from ecologists in general. After seeing Dr. Legendre’s presentation at
WCMB in Montreal, I am convinced that empirical test of beta diversity are essential, and this MS
gets us one step closer while revealing how the complexity of natural systems makes studying
beta diversity less straight-forward than theory might suggest. I find the work and the
complexity of the results interesting and inspiring. I still think the MS suffers from vague
language, and I try to point out some of these instances below. The added figures in the
26
supplement are very helpful (more on that below). I recommend publication after some minor
revision.
Vague language: I think the MS will be more accessible (and perhaps more likely to be cited) if it
can make the language clear, and the connection to theory concrete. I do not advocate for a much
longer paper about the nuanced responses about every species. The MS already tries to
incorporate some of this nuance in the form of natural history and basic biological information,
and for some groups like infauna it seems that this information is just as important as
decomposing beta diversity. So, I like the marriage of abstract diversity theory and more colorful
and relatable information about species and their potential interactions. This is a strength for the
MS. Below I list a few instances where I think the language is vague or the message unclear. I
leave it to the authors to find solutions, knowing that readers will appreciate the paper much
more if they can digest it easily.
L 300 – indications – what does this mean and why are the results not worthy of interpretation?
L 334 – local features – this is vague
L 336 – I know it was just stated that environmental factors were not important, but I think it
would be helpful to make it clear the homogeneity here means low within-site beta diversity.
Prediction paragraph (L 123-138) – This paragraph is important and I think it could be
strengthened to emphasize the important points about scales of space and time and how these
inform predictions. It is difficult to understand some of the key concepts in this MS when they are
presented as parenthetical statements, like spatial constraints. I see how spatial constraints play
an important role in beta diversity, but a pithy statement that connects the prediction to the
theory and the system to create a logical flow in the introduction would be very helpful. The next
sentence (L125-126) somewhat redundantly (see L 119) reiterates how the balance of nestedness
and replacement is influenced by spatial scale, but I think this discussion of space and time are
important and could be revisited in the discussion. L 138 – staged: I do not understand this
wording, but I think I understand the idea about successional trajectories. I think replacing “is
staged to” with “is tied to” or “is intimately associated with” or “is facilitated by” or “follows”
would be more meaningful. Making this part of the sentence active would also help, e.g.
“Biogenic habitat creation by macroalgae will lead to stronger habitat filtering of infauna than
epibenthos, as macroalgae facilitate infaunal recovery” --- as an aside, do mussels not also
facilitate infauna in this system? I’m thinking of systems on the Pacific Coast of North America
(e.g. Lafferty & Suchanek 2016 American Naturalist, Jurgens & Gaylord 2016 Scientific Reports).
Figures: I found it extremely helpful to see the figures that were added to the supplement. In my
initial reading of the MS, I was frustrated that the quadratic terms for cover were interpreted as
linear effects. The figure makes it clear that the effects can be interpreted this way because they
are monotonic over the range of the predictor variable. These figures also give the reader an
immediate sense of sample size, effect size, and variation. I think the MS would be strengthened
by including these figures (or at least some of them) in the main MS. Can the figures also
illustrate the interaction between site replacement and infaunal among-site beta?
Multiple regression: The MS is about beta diversity and finding how its various decompositions
inform patterns of diversity at multiple scales and in the face of disturbance. I find it curious then,
that the MS puts so much emphasis in the results on comparing (nested) models that emphasize
the role of habitat structure. Firstly, even the more complex model (selected by AIC) already
emphasizes this while illustrating some effect of replacement and richness differences. Instead of
presenting nested models motivated by philosophically different measures of model fit (e.g. AIC,
BIC) I think the MS would benefit from sticking to the more complex model (even though the top
27
three are indistinguishable based on AIC) and actually giving some interpretation to the
interaction term rather than showing it as “indication” (L300).
Minor comments:
L 32: sites
L 39: recovery being well predicted by local what? If it should be “local factors” this makes the
rest of the sentence less satisfying because habitat is one of those local factors.
L 42: replace this with and or but?
L 45: wasn’t within-site beta also important and negatively correlated with epibenthic recover. It
general, it seems the abstract needs to be tightened up a bit more.
L 103-104 - Novelty: see first paragraph of this review, but I think the MS will be strongly by
showing us how the work is novel. Yes, this should include some explicit statements about how
this work addresses gaps and advances theory, and if a direct statement about novelty is
important then I think it can be done without the reasons being parenthetical. It is not just the
plot size but how it relates to the size of the habitat (it spans most of the intertidal zone, right?).
L 185 – still unclear what these line segments are or where they come from.
L 237 – make it clear that these are the squared terms from the Podani equations.
L 348-350 – The previous part of this paragraph is about canopy-formers and how vegetative
propagation is important, but then this sentence states that the turf formers recovered faster.
Does this mean that vegetative propagation is not important or that recovery through sexual
propagules is faster than we thought (if, in fact, this is the mode of recovery for turfs)? Please
provide some interpretation to what seems like a one-off statement that counters the rest of the
paragraph.
I appreciate the taxon table added to the supplement. It gives the reader a sense of the flora and
fauna without having to dig up other papers, and it makes it clear (to me, anyway) that infauna
comprise a diverse fauna with a range of body sizes (e.g. caprellids vs harpacticoids) and life
history strategies (e.g. peracarids vs. polychates) and trophic strategies.
Table S2: Should Podolerus be Podocerus (one of my favorite genera of amphipod)?

multiple roles of ß–diversity help untangle community assembly processes affecting
very of temperate rocky shores
paper describes the analysis of an ecological field experiment where portions of the rocky
e, at 6 different sites over a 80 km stretch of the northern Italian coastline, were cleared and
o recolonize during one year. Then, the macroalgal and infaunal communties were sampled at
cleared and matching uncleared quadrats. The authors tested predictions about different
ponents of beta diversity and their relationships to the main factor of the experiment (cleared
uncleared sites) and a set of carefully selected environmental explanatory variables.
strengths of the paper are (1) the experimental design and (2) the formulation of the
otheses tested. There are also some weaknesses: (1) some of the analyses reported in the
er could be strengthened, and (2) there are missing explanations here and there. The paper is
resting and worth publishing after these problems have been solved.
or comments
ines 105-108 – I was surprised to read these predictions, which seem opposed to those of
ierrez-Canovas et al. (2013), who wrote: “We hypothesized that mechanisms underlying beta
rsity in rivers would differ between gradients where (1) natural stressors [as in your ambient
munities] result in progressive species turnover with high specificity and (2) anthropogenic
ssors [as in your disturbed communities] result in the loss of specialist taxa thus giving rise to
edness.” I am not saying that your predictions are incorrect, only that you should justify
m, using for example elements of ecological theory.
n the statistical analyses, I was surprised that you used quantitative community data and the
entage difference (aka Bray-Curtis) coefficient, which is the quantitative form of the
ensen index used in analyses of presence-absence data, whereas a few lines down (line 190),
beta diversity decomposition, you used presence-absence data and the Jaccard index. Please
ify this double shift in approach: quantitative to qualitative and Sørensen family to Jaccard
ily. Both analyses could have been done with either the quantitative or incidence data, and
either the Sørensen family or the Jaccard family of coefficients. Please justify the change,
aps with reference to the mathematical properties of the replacement, richness or abundance
erence, and nestedness coefficients described in Table S1.4 of the Legendre (2014) paper.
tatistical analyses, lines 180-181: Explain how you measured the difference between the
urbed and ambient plots as indications of recovery after clearing. By computing a
imilarity coefficient between a disturbed quadrat and its related ambient plot? Or by
ulating the difference in taxonomic richness?
tatistical analyses, lines 200-201: You did strange contortions to obtain, for each
erimental site, an average value of dissimilarity for Rrep and other indices. I am not sure that

onstrate its validity before using it to draw conclusions about your experiment.
easier solution would be to use the Local Contributions to Beta Diversity (LCBD) indices,
ch are computed for each site by the function beta.div(). The basic form of LCBD indices,
ch partitions beta diversity among the study sites, is well documented in the Legendre & De
eres paper (2013); it also comes with a p-value attached to it, which can be useful.
er forms of LCBD indices can be computed for the beta diversity components (replacement,
ness/abundance differences) as shown in Legendre (2014), who provided R code to compute
m. Function LCBD.comp() is also available in the adespatial package to compute these
ces. – Note that LCBD indices are additive, meaning that all LCBD indices computed, for
mple, for the individual quadrats of a site can be added up, providing a LCBD value for the
This is what you need in your study.
mmary, my suggestion is that you compute first a total beta diversity index over the 6 study
s, using the data at the quadrat level, then partition it into LCBD contributions for sites and for
vidual quadrats. Do not average or add up the faunal abundances of the 5 quadrats of each
before these analyses. Then, use the LCBD values for individual quadrats as replicates in an
ysis of variance or regression framework to test the relationships (a) to the main experimental
or (cleared vs. uncleared quadrats) and (b) to the set of selected environmental explanatory
ables using ordinary or GLM multiple regression.
hen, you could partition total beta diversity into replacement, richness/abundance difference
nestedness components, which you have already done, then compute LCBD indices for these
ponents. LCBDs of beta diversity components would be appropriate indices to test the
ictions on lines 105-111 of the present manuscript. For that purpose, you could proceed by
ession. Or by RDA if you care to assemble the different LCBD indices of the components
a multivariate data table, with columns LCBD.Repl, LCBD.AbDiff and LCBD.Nes, at the
e of individual quadrats, you could analyse this trivariate data table by RDA against the
lable environmental variables.
tatistical analyses, lines 204-207: you could use the LCBD indices for the 6 sites as a measure
olation (a site with higher LCBD value should be more isolated) and test that hypothesis
nst Exposure and perhaps other variables of Appendix Table 1 associated with isolation.
nother interesting thing that you could do is to compute PCoA ordinations based on the
imilarity matrix (Sørensen for incidence data, or percentage difference for quantitative data)
its components that form matrices of replacement and richness/abundance differences. These
nation plots would clearly illustrate the relationships among the 6 study sites and the
erences between ambient and cleared quadrats.
postpone comments on the Discussion until the analyses have been redone. I expect that the
cussion will be enhanced by the new results, if the authors follow my recommendations.

Royal Society Open Science
Dear Alice and Kevin,
Thank you for your letter of 24 July 2017, concerning the reviews of our Manuscript
ID RSOS-170771 entitled "The multiple roles of ß–diversity help untangle community
assembly processes affecting recovery of temperate rocky shores" suggesting we
could resubmit.
We found the comments of both reviewers constructive and helpful, and have
largely addressed reviewer 1’s comments but have not been able to do the same
with Prof. Legendre’s comments. This is because ß–diversity has multiple definitions
that we do not consider are resolved in the literature, essentially these range from
ß–diversity as a measure of community heterogeneity, ß–diversity as a distance-
decay measure and ß–diversity as a measure of ecological connectivity. It is
ecological connectivity that is the focus of our manuscript. We think using ß–
diversity as an indicator of connectivity of sites to the regional species pool is
worthy of investigation, especially in species rich systems where it is not possible to
assess the connectivity of individual populations on ecological time scales. LCBD,
which both reviewers urge us to use, is an elegant technique to assess ß–diversity
by defining the pure heterogeneity in the study system and is additive across scales
so we did investigate its use initially. But LCBD represents the difference between
the community at a location and the average composition. As Legendre and
Gauthier 2014 state “a site with average species composition would have an LCBD
value of 0”. LCBD only calculates a difference from mean and does not indicate if the
difference for a specific location is more or less, yet this knowledge is essential to us
if we are to describe communities with similar richness to that of the regional
species pool as well connected and sites very different from the regional pool as
poorly connected. Essentially what is suggested here is that we write a paper about
heterogeneity and show that disturbed plots (that have not fully recovered) are
different from the ambient community. This might be interesting but it is not the
paper we want to write.
We acknowledge that our focus on ß–diversity as ecological connectivity was not
clear. We have gone through the manuscript clarifying this in both the introduction,
methods and discussion, mainly by removed references to heterogeneity and
emphasising connectivity. We have also extensively revised the manuscript to
address the other concerns raised in review
I realise that this gives you as editors a problem. We cannot follow the key
recommendations of the reviewers, particularly Professor Legendre, as this draws us
away from addressing ecological connectivity. This means some delicate
negotiations with the previous reviewers and we would be happy to communicate
with Professor Legendre directly, or aid with a search on your part for new
reviewers – and we acknowledge there is probably a very small pool of potential
reviewers with experience in the application of ß–diversity in field research and
experience in dealing with marine ecosystems. I realise that you may consider we
have not addressed your concerns adequately and just reject the manuscript.
However, we hope that considering the reviewers’ statements that the topic is
interesting and nicely embedded in general theory (reviewer 1) and that the
experimental design and hypotheses are strong (reviewer 2), I hope that you will
consider the manuscript again.
In case you do feel that our reasoning is appropriate, our responses to the other
comments of the reviewers are detailed below.
Associate Editor Comments to Author:
We have received two evaluations from reviewers, and overall, they found this
manuscript to be a worthy addition to the literature with a sound experimental
design and clearly formulated hypotheses. However, especially reviewer 1 raises
significant concerns with the analysis of beta diversity. While the manuscript cannot
be accepted as currently written, we encourage you to consider reworking your
paper according to the suggestions of the reviewers and resubmitting it after
significant revision.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This paper addresses beta-diversity of coastal communities and how such diversity
patterns could inform about recovery rates using two taxonomical groups. I read
this paper with a great interest as experimental studies about beta-diversity and
metacommunity applications are very rare. Often the problem is the low number of
experimental sites, hindering the use of spatial multivariate statistics (distance
decay or raw data approach). I found that paper is very clearly written and nicely
embedded both in general theory and in a context of coastal biology. I have
however major concerns about the paper.
I found that hypotheses are not well backed up by references or explained in the
text. I would suggest to explain better especially the first hypothesis at it is not clear
enough for the readers. I understand that references need not to be repeated if
given in the Intro but I did not find clear justification for especially the first
hypothesis.
Response The justification is now led into by including a definition of nestedness
and replacement in L 64 – 66 “species replacement (turnover of species as a
consequence of environmental sorting or spatial or historic constraints), richness
difference (one community has more species than another) and nestedness (where
one community is a subset of another due to non-random species loss) [12-14]” and
then referring to those in the hypothesis itself L104-106 “with ambient communities
more likely to exhibit nestedness (non-random species loss) and disturbed
communities more likely to exhibit replacement (spatial constraints)”
I have major concern with the beta diversity analyses. It seems you use 6x5=30
values of beta diversity for the samples. If you use classical Whittaker beta diversity,
you need to divide gamma diversity by MEAN alpha diversity, not by sample alpha
diversity, which seems to be the case here (page 8, lines 184-189). Please see in
Wikipedia (beta diversity):
“The simplest of Whittaker's original definitions of beta diversity is ß = <U+03B3>/a Here
gamma diversity is the total species diversity of a landscape and alpha diversity is
the mean species diversity per habitat.”
Therefore, one cannot get true beta diversity value for each sample as beta diversity
is a regional variable, quantifying how much spatial variation there is among sites or
samples.
Response: We agree that this is correct. We now acknowledge this in the methods
and suggest that the difference in plot species richness and total site richness is a
surrogate for plot connectivity and call it an estimate of plot <U+F062>-diversity. L177-182
“Technically, the hierarchical additive calculation of beta diversity finishes at the
scale that contains replication. Having no within plot replication we consider plot ß-
diversity, the difference between number of species observed in the sample taken
from the plot (sample richness) and the total number of species found at a site (a-
diversity) as an estimate only, and a surrogate for plot connectivity.”
I think only proper way to get local beta diversity values is to use local contribution
to beta diversity method (LCBD) (Legendre & Caceres 2013 Ecol Lett). Thus, it may
be that your beta diversity values are mostly driven by variation in alpha diversity
and samples within sites have one common gamma diversity and are therefore not
independent. It seems it is possible to get one true beta diversity value for each site
based on six samples, not six local values. If this is the case, I would suggest to use
LCBD method here if you would like to do regressions with beta diversity values.
Otherwise, it may be that the number of beta diversity values is too low. In sum, I
would suggest to double-check the analyses and consider the independence. But, if
you have done the analyses correctly, please write methods very clearly in the
revision as this is very critical point here. If I missed the point, it is likely that some
other readers will do the same.
Response: The use of LCBD is addressed above. With respect to the independence of
alfa and beta diversity indices, Veech and Crist (Ecology, 2010) show that both the
multiplicative decomposition of gamma diversity and the additive decomposition
produce estimates of alpha and beta diversity that are somewhat (although not
highly) dependent on one another. We are aware that the case could be made that
the plot beta diversity is related to plot alpha diversity, but the actual pearson’s
correlation across the full set of data is <0.6 for both the epibenthic and infauna
data. This results in a better fit and explanatory power for regressions using plot
beta diversity than plot alpha diversity. The point could also be made that the
within-site replicates are not true replicates. We did actually redo the analyses with
n=6 and found similar broad-scale variables being important. However we found it
frustrating not to be able to include the local scale variability (especially of the
epibenthic recovery) into the analyses. As we focus our analysis on explained
variability rather than p-values, lack of independence is likely to have a minimal
effect at most.
Figure of three dimensions of beta diversity is not clear – could you use a triangle
plot with three dimensions?
Response: I really tried to construct this but failed. I have replaced the 3D plot with
two plots showing the relationship between richness difference with nestedness
and then with replacement (which is 1- nestedness).

with high specificity and (2) anthropogenic stressors [as in your disturbed
communities] result in the loss of specialist taxa thus giving rise to nestedness.” I am
not saying that your predictions are incorrect, only that you should justifythem,
using for example elements of ecological theory.
Response: We do this now- see reply to reviewer 1
2. In the statistical analyses, I was surprised that you used quantitative community
data and the percentage difference (aka Bray-Curtis) coefficient, which is the
quantitative form of the
Sørensen index used in analyses of presence-absence data, whereas a few lines
down (line 190),for beta diversity decomposition, you used presence-absence data
and the Jaccard index. Please justify this double shift in approach: quantitative to
qualitative and Sørensen family to Jaccard family. Both analyses could have been
done with either the quantitative or incidence data, and with either the Sørensen
family or the Jaccard family of coefficients. Please justify the change, perhaps with
reference to the mathematical properties of the replacement, richness or
abundance difference, and nestedness coefficients described in Table S1.4 of the
Legendre (2014) paper.
Response: We now explain that we use the Sorenson quantitative to measure how
much recovery has happened (dissimilarity between each experimental plot and the
nearest ambient plot), i.e., a response variable, while the presence/absence Jaccard
family is only used as an explanatory factor representing beta diversity
3. Statistical analyses, lines 180-181: Explain how you measured the difference
between the
disturbed and ambient plots as indications of recovery after clearing. By computing
a
dissimilarity coefficient between a disturbed quadrat and its related ambient plot?
Or by
calculating the difference in taxonomic richness?
Response: We have now defined this clearly as dissimilarity between each
experimental plot and the nearest ambient plot). L171-173 ”Relative recovery of
epibenthos and infauna for each plot was estimated as the difference between
paired disturbed and ambient samples 1 year after disturbance based on Bray Curtis
similarity of untransformed data.”
4. Statistical analyses, lines 200-201: You did strange contortions to obtain, for each
experimental site, an average value of dissimilarity for Rrep and other indices. I am
not sure that the result of your averaging calculations produced a meaningful index.
It would be up to you to demonstrate its validity before using it to draw conclusions
about your experiment.
Response: We have clarified how this was done as we feel that this must have led to
Prof Legendre’s consideration of it being a “strange contortion”. Basically each site
can be compared with 5 others and thus there are 5 estimates of nestedness (for
example) for each site. We present the average of these. Averages of pairwise
comparisons are frequently used in analyses (e.g., average percent dissimilarity is
considered to be an estimate of <U+F062>-diversity.
An easier solution would be to use the Local Contributions to Beta Diversity (LCBD)
indices,
which are computed for each site by the function beta.div(). The basic form of LCBD
indices,
which partitions beta diversity among the study sites, is well documented in the
Legendre & De Cáceres paper (2013); it also comes with a p-value attached to it,
which can be useful.
Other forms of LCBD indices can be computed for the beta diversity components
(replacement, richness/abundance differences) as shown in Legendre (2014), who
provided R code to compute them. Function LCBD.comp() is also available in the
adespatial package to compute these indices. – Note that LCBD indices are additive,
meaning that all LCBD indices computed, forexample, for the individual quadrats of
a site can be added up, providing a LCBD value for the site. This is what you need in
your study.
Response: See the discussion of LCBD in the general reply for why we have not used
the LCBD indices.
I summary, my suggestion is that you compute first a total beta diversity index over
the 6 study sites, using the data at the quadrat level, then partition it into LCBD
contributions for sites and for individual quadrats. Do not average or add up the
faunal abundances of the 5 quadrats of each site before these analyses. Then, use
the LCBD values for individual quadrats as replicates in an analysis of variance or
regression framework to test the relationships (a) to the main experimental factor
(cleared vs. uncleared quadrats) and (b) to the set of selected environmental
explanatory variables using ordinary or GLM multiple regression.
Response: We have not completed the analysis that Prof Legendre suggests here as,
although it would be interesting, it is not related to the main focus of the
manuscript. We do feel that we had led the reviewers along an incorrect path as to
our intentions by introducing terminology relating beta diversity to heterogeneity
when that was not our focus.
5. Then, you could partition total beta diversity into replacement,
richness/abundance difference and nestedness components, which you have
already done, then compute LCBD indices for these components. LCBDs of beta
diversity components would be appropriate indices to test the predictions on lines
105-111 of the present manuscript. For that purpose, you could proceed by
regression. Or by RDA if you care to assemble the different LCBD indices of the
components into a multivariate data table, with columns LCBD.Repl, LCBD.AbDiff
and LCBD.Nes, at the scale of individual quadrats, you could analyse this trivariate
data table by RDA against the available environmental variables.
Response: See the discussion of LCBD in the general reply for why we have not used
the LCBD indices.
6. Statistical analyses, lines 204-207: you could use the LCBD indices for the 6 sites
as a measure of isolation (a site with higher LCBD value should be more isolated)
and test that hypothesis against Exposure and perhaps other variables of Appendix
Table 1 associated with isolation.
Response: Statistical isolation is maybe not quite the same thing as connectivity- a
site with a large LCBD that contains most of the species that make up the regional
species pool would be highly connected, whereas one with very few of the species
that make up the regional species pool is either dispersal restricted or has habitat
characteristics that limit the species living there. For our experiment as all the sites
have similar habitats we can say that they are dispersal restricted.
7. Another interesting thing that you could do is to compute PCoA ordinations based
on the
dissimilarity matrix (Sørensen for incidence data, or percentage difference for
quantitative data) and its components that form matrices of replacement and
richness/abundance differences. These ordination plots would clearly illustrate the
relationships among the 6 study sites and the differences between ambient and
cleared quadrats.
Response: this was not done but we have replaced Fig 1 to make this easier to see
8. I postpone comments on the Discussion until the analyses have been redone. I
expect that the Discussion will be enhanced by the new results, if the authors follow
my recommendations.
Minor comments
• The community called “macroalgae” contains more than macroalgae. It also
contains molluscs and barnacles (line 165). It should be referred to as the
“macroalgal community” throughout the paper.
Response: we replaced this with “epibenthos”
• What software did you use for calculation of beta diversity decomposition into
Rrep, Rrd and Rnes? You did not mention it. If you used functions beta.div() and
beta.div.comp() in R, you could refer to the adespatial R package (now in version
0.0-8) where these functions are found. This package has been available on CRAN
since June 2016.
Response: We did give the equations used. Basically as there were very few
calculations to be made (and as we were separated from the web at the time and
thus unable to download beta.div) we simply made the calculations in excel.
• I found Figure 1 useless. You simply used it to show the negative relationship
between
Replacement and Nestedness, a relationship that is obvious by examining the
equations. One has to know, of course, that 2*min(b,c) = (b + c) – |b – c|. From this,
one derives that 2*min(b,c) is negatively related to |b – c| for fixed values of (a + b
+ c).
Response: Actually we used it to show the relationship between the three
components across different community types and disturbance- but we have
replaced our reference to it to make this clearer and also replaced the figure.
• Lines 232-237, t-tests: how you computed these tests is not clear. Pease re-write
these
sentences, they can be understood in at least two different ways. Perhaps you
should show the
results of these calculations in a Table.
Response: we have rewritten this to always have the variables being compared
directly prior to the paired t-test result
• Line 243: since the Site*Treatment interaction is significant, you should compute
separate
Premanovas for each site before you can state that Treatment was always
significant. Is that what you did? Show the detailed results, perhaps in an Appendix.
Response: These results were buried in the caption for table 1. We have removed
them and placed them in the text “Epibenthos showed a significant Site*Treatment
interaction, with the Treatment effect, while always significant, varying in strength
across sites. Bonassola and Portofino exhibited the largest difference between
ambient and treatment (indicating slowest recovery, p = 0.007 and p = 0.008), while
Framura exhibited the fastest recovery (p = 0.029). The other three sites also
displayed a significant treatment effect (Pontetto: p = 0.011; Punta Mesco: p =
0.012; and Montenero: p = 0.016).”
• Lines 244-246: where can we see these results? Show them in a Table or a PCoA
ordination
illustrating results at the quadrat level.
Response: See above
• Lines 247-256: It is not clear how you related the macroalgae component of the
community to the local heterogeneity (within site ß-diversity). Did you compute a
regression on a dissimilaritymatrix? That would be incorrect. I suggest you use LCBD
indices for these analyses. – In addition, the detailed discussion of the results from
Table 2 is hard to follow. I suggest you basethese analyses on LCBD indices.
Response: This was not done for the community composition but for the degree of
recovery (ie a single variable)
• Lines 250-250: you are saying that the regional connectivity (among-sites beta
diversity)
increased site average recovery for microalgae, and you refer to Fig. 2a. However,
Fig 2a is about within-site beta diversity, if I read correctly the label of the abscissa,
which is printed in
minuscule font.
Response: this figure and analysis has been removed
• Line 277: epifauna (fauna that lives on the surface of the seafloor) is not described
in the
Methods section. Only the macroalgal community and the turf-infauna community
are
mentioned.
Response: this has been fixed
• Table 2, results for Turf infauna: you found significant quadratic effects for
macroalgal
recovery and coralline recovery. These nonlinear effects are interesting and should
be discussed in the Discussion section of the paper.
Response: this is done

antore et al.
s revised version of the paper is in progress compared to the original version.
restingly, my remarks were closely related to those of Reviewer 1.
articular, the new version explains more clearly why and how they are using beta
ersity as a proxy measure of connectivity. The hypotheses tested in the paper are more
rly justified in the last paragraph of the Introduction, although references are still
sing. See point 6 in the Minor remarks below.
or points
wever, the authors were a bit too hasty in discarding some good suggestions that had
n made by reviewer 1 and by me. Let me stress some points again.
eviewer 1 pointed out that the calculation of Whittaker’s beta in the paper had been
e incorrectly. In their response, the authors recognized that fact, but instead of
recting their calculation formula, then offered an unclear explanation (lines 178-183) of
y they kept using the calculation method of the first version of the paper, which was also
clearly explained.
is first formula, Whittaker’s (1972) first beta formula (ß = <U+03B3>/(mean of a values))
sures how many more species are present in a region of interest (gamma) than at an
rage site within the region (computed as the mean of the alpha values). I am not
osed to the use of the additive form of the formula, where beta is the difference between
ma and alpha. An alternative additive formula that the authors apparently did not
sider is the log-transformed form of the original Whittaker’s formula: log(ß) = log(<U+03B3>) –
mean of a values).
new sentence that you wrote (lines 180-183), which seems to describe your calculation
hod to estimate beta diversity among plots within a site, is hard to understand: “Having
within plot replication we consider plot ß-diversity, the difference between number of
cies observed in the sample taken from the plot (sample richness) and the total number
pecies found at a site (a-diversity) as an estimate only, and a surrogate for plot
nectivity.” Please rewrite the sentence more clearly. Explanations:
ambient plot is the smallest sampling unit in your study. You cannot measure or even
about “plot ß-diversity”. An ambient quadrat (or ambient plot) has alpha diversity, not
a diversity.
u wrote: “number of species observed in the sample taken from the plot (sample
ness)”. The sentence says that you considered only one plot, one sample. Is this what
really did? In Whittaker’s beta formula, one has to calculate the mean of the richness of
lots within the site.
r the calculation of ß diversity among plots within a site, “the total number of species
nd at a site” may be alpha diversity when you are studying the site the site, but it is used
e as gamma diversity when you want to measure beta among plots within a site.
2
now asking two questions:
The equation that you used was not clear in the first version of the paper and it is still
clear in the revised version. What is exactly the index that you are using? Describe it
cisely at least for one of the two scales of your analysis.
Why did you not use Whittaker's original beta index, in multiplicative or additive form?
at is the rationale for the alternative equation that you are using and how does it satisfy
requirements for a proxy measure of connectivity?
Strange contortions”, now on lines 195-198. – Consider the calculations you did among
6 sites: you computed the mean of the differences between replacement, nestedness
richness difference between a site and the 5 other sites. Among the 5 plots within a site,
did the same calculation, comparing each plot to the 4 other plots of that site.
e the following problems: (a) You did not explain why you are computing this index,
t you want to use it for. I believe I understand what you want to do although you did not
te it down in the original version of the manuscript or in the revised version: you want
stimate the contribution of each site to the {replacement, nestedness, richness
erence} among the sites within the study area, and of each plot among the plots of each
. These are the “relative contributions” that you used to plot Fig. 1. In addition, (b) you
e not demonstrated that your calculation method produced a valid and useful index
responding to that objective.
our response, you argued that this is just as good as computing the average D within a D
rix, which is considered to be a good and valid measure of beta diversity. You
parison does not hold: for the percentage difference dissimilarity for example (aka
y-Curtis), the mean of the dissimilarities is an unbiased estimate of the total variance in
D matrix. (For other D indices that have the Euclidean property, it is the mean of the
ared dissimilarities that produces an unbiased estimate of the total variance.) This point
hown in detail in the Legendre & De Cáceres (2013) paper, section Related approaches to
a diversity assessment. Your calculation is different and produces different results. You
uld have to demonstrate that it is a valid measure corresponding to your unstated
ective.
ead of the calculation you did, may I suggest that, in the plots-within-a-site study for
mple, you calculate the distance between each plot and the centroid of the plots of that
. These distances are readily calculated in the PERMDISP2 method of Anderson et al.
06), which can be found in e-Primer and also in the function betadisper() in R. That
ction implements a method for measuring beta diversity described by Prof. Marti
erson. When we compute it with the argument type="centroid", betadisper() produces
se distances between each plot and the centroid of the plots of a site. These values are
d measures of the absolute contributions of individual plots to beta diversity.
ce relationship is that the squares of these values are the LCBD indices of Legendre & De
eres (2013). They can be computed using the function beta.div() of adespatial for a
ety of dissimilarity coefficients, including the percentage difference index, which is the
ntitative form of the Sørensen coefficient. This is the index that you used in your paper
er the name Bray-Curtis. LCBD indices can also be computed by the function
3
D.comp() of the same package for precomputed matrices of Replacement, Richness
erence or Nestedness. LCBD indices are additive.
obtain the exact same values (absolute contributions) as those obtained from
adisper(), you would have to multiply the LCBD indices obtained from beta.div() by the
l sum-of-squares, found in element $beta[1] of the function’s output list. Conversely,
can turn the values provided by betadisper() into relative contributions to beta
ersity (or LCBD values) by dividing them by the total sum-of-squares of the input D
rix. The values provided by function LCBD.comp() are relative contributions to
lacement, nestedness, richness difference}, like those used in your Fig. 1. They can, of
rse, be computed in Excel if you care to program them.
rder to compute the individual contributions of the 6 sites to regional beta diversity and
omponents, you can compute the percentage difference (aka Bray-Curtis index) among
0 plot data rows, obtain the LCBD indices, and add up the LCBD values of the plots that
ong to each site. This is a valid calculation because LCBD indices are additive. You will
s obtain the contributions of the 6 sites to beta diversity computed through the
ifference index. You can then obtain LCBD indices for the beta diversity components by
puting beta diversity partitioning into replacement, nestedness and richness difference,
sfer the resulting matrices to the function LCBD.comp() and obtain the LCBD indices
responding to these three components.
or remarks
n the Abstract, define what a site is, by opposition to a plot. The Abstract offers a first
tact of a reader with the paper. It is important that he/she understands right away that
r study design was nested, with 6 sites spreads along 80 km of coastline, and that in
h site, you established 5 plots with matching disturbed and undisturbed quadrats.
bstract, line 42, “their recovery did not simply track habitat formation”: I don’t
erstand what you meant to say here. Rephrase please.
bstract: the paper is organized around an experiment where you compared disturbed
undisturbed quadrats. It would be important to report in the Abstract the results of the
parison you made between these two types of treatments in terms of the ecological
cesses at work in them.
ines 100-101: It was a good idea to indicate that beta diversity is used in the paper as a
rogate for connectivity. You might insist a bit more and say that it is not a measure of
sical (hydrological) connectivity and that no such measure, based perhaps on a physical
rent model, was available.
ine 101: the expressions “plot ß” and “among-site (site ßA)” have not been defined (or
I miss the definitions?) and are not understandable at this point when reading the paper
arly. Please explain.
redictions, lines 104-106: you were quite parsimonious in the explanations you added
his sentence. Please explain your ecological reasoning in more detail and provide
rences. Why should we have non-random species losses among the undisturbed sites?
what are the “spatial constraints” that you mentioned as a justification to predict
4
lacement as the major mechanism among the disturbed communities? Did you have in
d: (a) species sorting by environmental conditions or (b) neutral spatial variation? Or
h (a) and (b)?
ines 142 and 171 (vocabulary): you did not define the site characteristics, since you did
experimentally control them; you observed them. In these two sections, you could say
you are describing these characteristics using appropriate indices.
ines 180-183: the sentence is not clear, please reformulate. In particular, in the
ulation of ß-diversity among the plots of a site, the total number of species found at a
is <U+03B3>-diversity (or <U+03B3>-richness) for that site, not a-diversity.
ine 185 should read: “of species found across all sites.”
On p. 8, you wrote down the equations you used; in your response letter, you wrote that
programmed these equations in an Excel sheet. Yet readers might be interested in
wing that these calculations are readily available in R software, the beta.div.comp()
ction of the adespatial package, as I indicated in my first review. Because you used
ani and Schmera’s (2011) equation for relative nestedness in your paper, this made me
ize that users of the R function might want to compute it also. I will add a note to the
umentation file explaining that relative nestedness is simply (1 – relative replacement)
he Podani family of indices. And although it was originally defined for the Jaccard group,
tive nestedness can also be readily computed from the Sørensen group in the Podani
ily.
Lines 234-235, you wrote: “Results were not so clear for the infaunal ß-diversity
ponents (paired t-tests, n=6, p > 0.30 for all.)”. “For all” presumably refers to the three
es of relative contributions displayed in the figure. – In Fig. 1 (left and right graphs),
ever, for infauna, ambient richness difference (closed circles) was clearly higher than in
disturbed plots. Your sentence should be more nuanced and report that observation.
ote these notes and suggestions in the hope that they will help you write a stronger
er.

Appendix D
Dear Editor,
We are pleased to provide the revised version of “The multiple roles of ß–
diversity help untangle community assembly processes affecting recovery of
temperate rocky shores”.
We greatly appreciate the constructive comments of the three reviewers as this
has helped us clarify a number of issues in the manuscript.
We have addressed all the substantive comments of the 3 reviewers and we
outline the changes in detail in our “response to reviewers”, but to summarise:
<U+F0B7> We have done all that Professor Legendre asked: Removed plot ß-
diversity; implemented the PERMDISP procedure; and analysed within site
ß-diversity in an appropriate way using Lande (1996).
<U+F0B7> We have reviewed our text on the concept of ecological connectivity to
address all 3 reviewers’ comments. We acknowledge that Professor
Legendre thought this use of ß-diversity a good idea and have expanded as
suggested by him and the anon reviewer. We hope this will offset Dr
Whelan’s review. We suspect this idea of addressing connectivity at the
community level is novel as typically in marine studies connectivity in the
context of benthic organisms is reduced to hydrodynamics and larval
dispersal. While this approach has its limitations as it is only possible to
assess this on a species basis and we do not have the detailed behaviour
and life history data for most benthic species. The approach would
become intractable for multiple species. Hence the need to investigate
the use of ß-diversity in this context. We had referred the reader of our
manuscript to 2 other papers that justify and use this approach
(successfully).
<U+F0B7> We have added context and references to the hypothesis we seek to test
in the paper. We have also strengthened the text on the value and
novelty of a real-world experimental approach to testing hypothesis and
exploring ß-diversity.
<U+F0B7> We have every sympathy with Dr Whelan’s comments on the use of the
extensive ß-diversity jargon. We have added further clarification and note
that the terms are well used in the literature now. Some of Dr Whelan’s
comments implied to us that he wanted us to write a different paper a
much much longer one that was less about the utility of ß-diversity in
community dynamics and more about the individual species and recovery.
We have written some of those papers from this study previously and they
have been cited in this paper.
We would like to thank you and the reviewers for the time put into helping us
publish this unique study. We hope we have now addressed all reasonable
criticism and that you are happy to publish our work.
If the paper is acceptable we will upload supporting data to Dryad
Best wishes

DETAILED RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS COMMENTS
Original text of reviewer – our comments
Review of RSOS-170771.R1 - Chiantore et al.
This revised version of the paper is in progress compared to the original version.
Interestingly, my remarks were closely related to those of Reviewer 1.
In particular, the new version explains more clearly why and how they are using
beta diversity as a proxy measure of connectivity. The hypotheses tested in the
paper are more clearly justified in the last paragraph of the Introduction, although
references are still missing. See point 6 in the Minor remarks below.
Thanks for the positive comments, reference have not been added (see below)
Major points
However, the authors were a bit too hasty in discarding some good suggestions
that had been made by reviewer 1 and by me. Let me stress some points again.
1. Reviewer 1 pointed out that the calculation of Whittaker’s beta in the paper had
been done incorrectly. In their response, the authors recognized that fact, but
instead of correcting their calculation formula, then offered an unclear explanation
(lines 178-183) of why they kept using the calculation method of the first version of
the paper, which was also not clearly explained.
In his first formula, Whittaker’s (1972) first beta formula (ß = <U+03B3>/(mean of a values))
measures how many more species are present in a region of interest (gamma) than
at an average site within the region (computed as the mean of the alpha values). I
am not opposed to the use of the additive form of the formula, where beta is the
difference between gamma and alpha. An alternative additive formula that the
authors apparently did not consider is the log-transformed form of the original
Whittaker’s formula: log(ß) = log(<U+03B3>) – log(mean of a values).
The new sentence that you wrote (lines 180-183), which seems to describe your
calculation method to estimate beta diversity among plots within a site, is hard to
understand: “Having no within plot replication we consider plot ß-diversity, the
difference between number of species observed in the sample taken from the plot
(sample richness) and the total number of species found at a site (a-diversity) as an
estimate only, and a surrogate for plot connectivity.” Please rewrite the sentence
more clearly.
We apologise for lack of clarity here.- However, we have now removed all this and
do not use this in our analysis.
Explanations:
• An ambient plot is the smallest sampling unit in your study. You cannot measure
or even talk about “plot ß-diversity”. An ambient quadrat (or ambient plot) has
alpha diversity, not beta diversity.
• You wrote: “number of species observed in the sample taken from the plot
(sample richness)”. The sentence says that you considered only one plot, one
sample. Is this what you really did? In Whittaker’s beta formula, one has to
calculate the mean of the richness of all plots within the site.
• For the calculation of ß diversity among plots within a site, “the total number of
species found at a site” may be alpha diversity when you are studying the site the
site, but it is used here as gamma diversity when you want to measure beta among
plots within a site.
I am now asking two questions:
(a) The equation that you used was not clear in the first version of the paper
and it is still not clear in the revised version. What is exactly the index that
you are using? Describe it precisely at least for one of the two scales of your
analysis.
In the text we now state:
“Within-site ß-diversity was measured as the difference between the average
number of species found at each site (average a-diversity) and the total number of
species found at the site (site <U+03B3>-diversity).” resulting in 1 data point per site.
And
“Among-site ß-diversity was measured as the difference between the average
number of species found at each site (average a-diversity) and the total number of
species found across all sites (region <U+03B3>-diversity).” also resulting in 1 data point per
site.
(b) Why did you not use Whittaker's original beta index, in multiplicative or
additive form? What is the rationale for the alternative equation that you
are using and how does it satisfy the requirements for a proxy measure of
connectivity?
Thanks we have clarified the text and now use the additive form of ß-diversity as in
Lande 1996.
2. “Strange contortions”, now on lines 195-198. – Consider the calculations you did
among the 6 sites: you computed the mean of the differences between
replacement, nestedness and richness difference between a site and the 5 other
sites. Among the 5 plots within a site, you did the same calculation, comparing each
plot to the 4 other plots of that site.
I see the following problems: (a) You did not explain why you are computing this
index, what you want to use it for. I believe I understand what you want to do
although you did not write it down in the original version of the manuscript or in
the revised version: you want to estimate the contribution of each site to the
{replacement, nestedness, richness difference} among the sites within the study
area, and of each plot among the plots of each site. These are the “relative
contributions” that you used to plot Fig. 1.
You are correct and we have taken your excellent explanation and used it in the
methods. We now state
“To estimate the contribution of replacement, nestedness or richness difference
among the sites within the study area, and of each plot among the plots of each site
calculations were done on two scales.”
(b) you have not demonstrated that your calculation method produced a valid and
useful index corresponding to that objective.
In your response, you argued that this is just as good as computing the average D
within a D matrix, which is considered to be a good and valid measure of beta
diversity. You comparison does not hold: for the percentage difference dissimilarity
for example (aka Bray-Curtis), the mean of the dissimilarities is an unbiased
estimate of the total variance in the D matrix. (For other D indices that have the
Euclidean property, it is the mean of the squared dissimilarities that produces an
unbiased estimate of the total variance.) This point is shown in detail in the
Legendre & De Ca´ceres (2013) paper, section Related approaches to beta diversity
assessment. Your calculation is different and produces different results. You would
have to demonstrate that it is a valid measure corresponding to your unstated
objective.
Yes we had missed that- we have now used the average of the squared
dissimilarities
Instead of the calculation you did, may I suggest that, in the plots-within-a-site
study for example, you calculate the distance between each plot and the centroid
of the plots of that site. These distances are readily calculated in the PERMDISP2
method of Anderson et al. (2006), which can be found in e-Primer and also in the
function betadisper() in R. That function implements a method for measuring beta
diversity described by Prof. Marti Anderson. When we compute it with the
argument type="centroid", betadisper() produces these distances between each
plot and the centroid of the plots of a site. These values are valid measures of the
absolute contributions of individual plots to beta diversity. A nice relationship is
that the squares of these values are the LCBD indices of Legendre & De Ca´ceres
(2013). They can be computed using the function beta.div() of adespatial for a
variety of dissimilarity coefficients, including the percentage difference index,
which is the quantitative form of the Sørensen coefficient. This is the index that you
used in your paper under the name Bray-Curtis. LCBD indices can also be computed
by the function LCBD.comp() of the same package for precomputed matrices of
Replacement, Richness difference or Nestedness. LCBD indices are additive. To
obtain the exact same values (absolute contributions) as those obtained from
betadisper(), you would have to multiply the LCBD indices obtained from beta.div()
by the total sum-of-squares, found in element $beta[1] of the function’s output list.
Conversely, you can turn the values provided by betadisper() into relative
contributions to beta diversity (or LCBD values) by dividing them by the total sum-
of-squares of the input D matrix. The values provided by function LCBD.comp() are
relative contributions to {replacement, nestedness, richness difference}, like those
used in your Fig. 1. They can, of course, be computed in Excel if you care to
program them.
In order to compute the individual contributions of the 6 sites to regional beta
diversity and its components, you can compute the percentage difference (aka
Bray-Curtis index) among all 30 plot data rows, obtain the LCBD indices, and add up
the LCBD values of the plots that belong to each site. This is a valid calculation
because LCBD indices are additive. You will thus obtain the contributions of the 6
sites to beta diversity computed through the %difference index. You can then
obtain LCBD indices for the beta diversity components by computing beta diversity
partitioning into replacement, nestedness and richness difference, transfer the
resulting matrices to the function LCBD.comp() and obtain the LCBD indices
corresponding to these three components.
As you suggested we calculated both the Permdisp and the LCBD values (and for the
LCBD we calculated the replacement, richness and nested components). We
included these in the regression analysis but, regretfully and surprisingly, they did
not prove to be useful predictors in this instance. We suspect that this is because it
is not just whether there is more or less of a variation from the mean, but that there
is indeed an element of connectivity here and the number of taxa and the difference
in these between scales plays a role. As suggested by another reviewer we
incorporated nearby ambient alpha diversity (30 unique data values) and ambient
site total richness (6 unique data values) into the regression analysis and found the
nearby ambient alpha diversity to be a useful predictor for epibenthos.
Minor remarks
1.In the Abstract, define what a site is, by opposition to a plot. The Abstract offers a
first contact of a reader with the paper. It is important that he/she understands
right away that your study design was nested, with 6 sites spreads along 80 km of
coastline, and that in each site, you established 5 plots with matching disturbed
and undisturbed quadrats.
OK, DONE
2.Abstract, line 42, “their recovery did not simply track habitat formation”: I don’t
understand what you meant to say here. Rephrase please.
We were trying to say that infaunal recovery was not strongly related to epibenthic
recovery. We now state
“infaunal communities recovery did not simply track formation of habitat by
recovering epibenthos”
3. Abstract: the paper is organized around an experiment where you compared
disturbed and undisturbed quadrats. It would be important to report in the
Abstract the results of the comparison you made between these two types of
treatments in terms of the ecological processes at work in them.
We now state
“Recovery was not complete at any of the sites after 1 year for either epibenthos
(mostly composed of macroalgae and, locally, mussels) or infauna. Significant
differences in recovery among sites were observed for epibenthos but not for infauna
suggesting different community assembly processes were operating.”
4. Lines 100-101: It was a good idea to indicate that beta diversity is used in the
paper as a surrogate for connectivity. You might insist a bit more and say that it is
not a measure of physical (hydrological) connectivity and that no such measure,
based perhaps on a physical current model, was available.
We now state “One such proposed surrogate is the degree to which site species
richness reflects the regional species pool, for that environment/habitat”
And then later “ecological connectivity, among-site ß-diversity (i.e., low ß means
well connected). This surrogate of ecological connectivity incorporates both
hydrodynamic constraints and life history traits.”
5. Line 101: the expressions “plot ß” and “among-site (site ßA)” have not been
defined (or did I miss the definitions?) and are not understandable at this point
when reading the paper linearly. Please explain.
DONE, considering the changes described above. We state
“We calculated ß-diversity, based on presence-absence data, at two scales, within
and among sites, based on ambient data only. Within-site ß-diversity was measured
as the difference between the average number of species found at each site
(average a-diversity) and the total number of species found at the site (site <U+03B3>-
diversity). Among-site ß-diversity was measured as the difference between the
average number of species found at each site (average a-diversity) and the total
number of species found across all sites (region <U+03B3>-diversity).
6. Predictions, lines 104-106: you were quite parsimonious in the explanations you
added to this sentence. Please explain your ecological reasoning in more detail and
provide references. Why should we have non-random species losses among the
undisturbed sites? And what are the “spatial constraints” that you mentioned as a
justification to predict replacement as the major mechanism among the disturbed
communities? Did you have in mind: (a) species sorting by environmental
conditions or (b) neutral spatial variation? Or both (a) and (b)?
DONE. We now state
“The complexity of dispersal mechanisms highlights the difficulty of measuring
and modelling dispersal at the community scale and the value of finding surrogate
measures of connectivity based on natural history, landscape connectivity and
community ecology. ß–diversity can be generated by multiple processes associated
with metacommunities, (e.g., stochastic processes or environmental filtering) but
dispersal play a role in affecting the relative importance of any process. ß–diversity
has been proposed as a surrogate for whole community dispersal as it encompasses
the relationship between site species richness and the regional species pool [1, 11].”
And then..
“We also estimated the nestedness, replacement and richness difference
components of ß-diversity to provide insight into the relative importance of habitat
filtering and niche related processes (replacement) and stochastic processes
(nestedness) in ambient and disturbed plots [19]. We note that essentially,
replacement and nestedness are inverse components of ß-diversity and are
influenced by the heterogeneity of the landscape, spatial scale and dispersal. While
the relative contributions of different ß-diversity components may be clear cut in
theory, in empirical research any aspect of diversity is likely the outcome of multiple
community assembly processes [12, [20], [19, 21].
We predicted that (1) the relative contribution of different components of ß-
diversity would differ between ambient and experimentally disturbed communities,
with disturbed communities more likely to exhibit replacement (spatial constraints).
The relative importance of nestedness and replacement may vary with spatial scale.
However, in our experimental study we expected nestedness to dominate the
ambient community because our samples of the community integrate over extended
time allowing for stochastic processes to dominate ß-diversity [22].”
7. Lines 142 and 171 (vocabulary): you did not define the site characteristics, since
you did not experimentally control them; you observed them. In these two
sections, you could say that you are describing these characteristics using
appropriate indices.
We have removed the term define.
8. Lines 180-183: the sentence is not clear, please reformulate. In particular, in the
calculation of ß-diversity among the plots of a site, the total number of species
found at a site is <U+03B3>-diversity (or <U+03B3>-richness) for that site, not a-diversity.
See above comments
9. Line 185 should read: “of species found across all sites.”
DONE: now reads… the total number of species found across all sites
10. On p. 8, you wrote down the equations you used; in your response letter, you
wrote that you programmed these equations in an Excel sheet. Yet readers might
be interested in knowing that these calculations are readily available in R software,
the beta.div.comp() function of the adespatial package, as I indicated in my first
review. Because you used Podani and Schmera’s (2011) equation for relative
nestedness in your paper, this made me realize that users of the R function might
want to compute it also. I will add a note to the documentation file explaining that
relative nestedness is simply (1 – relative replacement) in the Podani family of
indices. And although it was originally defined for the Jaccard group, relative
nestedness can also be readily computed from the Sørensen group in the Podani
family.
DONE. Reference to Function in R now provided
11. Lines 234-235, you wrote: “Results were not so clear for the infaunal ß-diversity
components (paired t-tests, n=6, p > 0.30 for all.)”. “For all” presumably refers to
the three types of relative contributions displayed in the figure. – In Fig. 1 (left and
right graphs), however, for infauna, ambient richness difference (closed circles) was
clearly higher than in the disturbed plots. Your sentence should be more nuanced
and report that observation.
We now state “Results were not so clear for the infaunal ß-diversity components,
with significant effects only observed for relativized richness difference (paired t-
tests, n=6, p = 0.0174, ambient > disturbed).”

Comments to the Author(s)
Understanding which processes are responsible for structuring ecological
communities is essential to fully comprehend patterns of community recovery
following disturbances. The finding that the increase in the disturbance regime
ultimately leads to the homogenisation of habitats and communities is alarming
under the climate change scenario. Therefore, I find this study interesting and it
certainly merits publication after minor revision.
We thank the reviewer for their insight.
Specific comments
p. 3 lines 61-62: it is not clear how high beta diversity is related to dispersal and
environmental filtering, perhaps add another sentence explaining how these
processes can generate high beta diversity (I found some details on a paper you cite
- Vanshoenwinkel et al., 2013) i. e. stochastic colonization and priority effects.
This statement has been removed from here and is discussed related to the
hypothesis and ß–diversity components - see reply to reviewer 1.
p. 4 line 101: Isn't plot beta the within-site diversity? If so, maybe you could add
that information in brackets to clarify.
No, plot beta as we calculated it was not the within-site diversity, but we have
removed that measure and replaced it with “Within-site ß-diversity (measured as
the difference between the average number of species found at each site and the
total number of species found at the site (site<U+F020><U+F067>-diversity).
p. 5 lines 103-106 (hypothesis 1): It was not clear to me, by reading your
Introduction, why you would expect this to happen (ambient - nestedness and
disturbed - replacement). Please justify this prediction in the Introduction.
We have addressed this in response to reviewer 1.
p. 5 line 116: I could not find Supplemental Figure 1, only Table 1.
Suppl. Fig 1 is now present visible
p. 6 line 129: please add a space between the end of paragraph and the title.

Recovery was calculated as the Bray-Curtis similarity between community

we can understand why you thought this. As well as defining our recovery measure
in the methods we now state “One year after clearing the 1m2 plots, recovery was
not complete for either infauna or epibenthos, with average recovery per site
ranging from 30-60 Bray Curtis similarities for infauna and 15-59 for epibenthos).”

Comments to the Author(s)
From Matt Whalen, University of British Columbia
**General:
This manuscript (MS) presents an experimental investigation of community
assembly processes and the causes of spatial patterns in community structure.
Experimental clearings of rocky shore communities are compared with undisturbed
areas one year following disturbance. The pairwise similarity in community
presence-absence patterns between cleared and uncleared plots were interpreted
as the rate of recovery (high similarity equal fast recovery). These community
similarities were compared using a variety of explanatory variables at local and
regional scales, and the results are discussed in light of potential future
disturbances that might occur at different scales (i.e. so-called “cumulative
impacts” and ”large-scale disturbances”).
The framework of the MS hangs on the idea that sites with a similar complement of
species is more connected than sites with less similar species composition, which
depends on how connectivity is defined. The questions are fundamental and the
results are intriguing and deserve to be published, but it is difficult to relate the
results to the interpretation and framework supported by the MS. The MS lacks
some basic information about the communities (e.g. what were the infauna?, how
was abundance considered?) that might help build a context for the reader that
would allow her to interpret the results in light of ecological theory.
Better explained now in lines 157-166.
I recommend major revisions. A revised MS should more critically consider what
the various decompositions of beta diversity mean, and whether they can be are
appropriately used as a surrogate for connectivity or for the influence of
environmental gradients. The MS should generally put more stock into more clearly
and specifically discussing/interpreting the results that were presented. Perhaps
the short format of this journal prevents a more lengthy discussion, but there
seems to be a lot to unpack and describe from the results.
We do define, as our title suggests, multiple forms of ß–diversity. We have now
expanded on explanations of what these terms mean and why they might be
expected to influence our understanding of the processes that drive community
recovery. (See response to Reviewer 1) The fact that these terms stay in our models
is informative.
Some comments below suggest to us that the reviewer seems to be expecting a
description of the recovery process on a species by species basis. Because we
sampled the small animals that live in the turf (infauna) 31 species and large plants
and animals (epibenthos) 17 species this would make for a long paper. Our study is
focused at the community level looking at diversity and its influence on recovery
dynamics. Previous papers have described the recovery dynamics amongst the
macroalgae, these are cited in the paper.
**Major Comments:
I had a difficult time keeping track of how the different components of beta
diversity related to the hypotheses being tested, the analyses, and the
interpretation of the results. I think terminology had something to do with this. The
“replacement” and “nestedness” indices were both confusing terms to me (this is
especially true from reading the abstract) and I worry their interpretation as
proxies for connectivity is misleading. Perhaps “turnover” as a term is no less
problematic when it comes to expressing spatial diversity patterns, but it is used to
define replacement several times in the MS and is likely more familiar to most
readers. If replacement is strictly different than turnover, then perhaps more
descriptive language could be used to help readers associate the terminology with
meaning.
We have tried to use general terms in the abstract, define the terms in the
introduction and then use them consistently. These terms are essential to relating
the recovery to assembly processes.
Nevertheless, we agree that there is too much terminology – but it is well
established in the literature and it is expanded upon in the reference cited. Our
contribution is trying to work to make the terminology meaningful by testing its
application.
The biggest concern I have for this MS is the use of beta diversity to define sites in
terms of connectivity. Given the many ways places and communities can be
connected and the many factors that influence connectivity (e.g. life history, scale),
it is unclear what meaning of connectivity the manuscript uses. Sites with low beta
diversity are similar in terms of species presence-absence, but does this mean they
are connected? Surely, over some scale of time and space they are connected for
all species in this area, but two sites that are similar based on community
composition may have similar environmental conditions that allow a complement
of species to exist and/or dominate even if all sites are well connected. The MS
points out that species replacement was low, suggesting weak influence of
environmental filtering, yet this does not alone mean that similar sites are well
connected.
We understand the reviewers concern, but note the two other reviewers positively
commented on the idea that –diversity might be a proxy for ecological connectivity.
We used that terminology to differentiate it from species connectivity, where for
rocky reef and seafloor organisms this usually means hydrodynamic dispersal
modelling (with assumptions about larval life history, behaviour, boundary flow
characteristics and the role of waves). We do not mean to imply that species
connectivity is not useful, simply it is not without its uncertainties and space and
time scale limitations. But what we are investigating is a community level analysis
–a biodiversity analysis. We acknowledged the reviewers concerns about
connectivity and the use of ß–diversity as a proxy, it is only through empirical
research underpinned by theory that we are going to figure this out. Thus we take
the reviewers comment as a positive that we should be investigating these ideas
rather than this is a fatal flaw.
We are aware of the issues raised by the reviewer- which is why we tested for the
effect of the environmental variability (at both within and between site scales). So,
having removed environmental differences we are left with what we call ecological
connectivity (e.g., a combination of hydrodynamics and life-history characteristics
that control whether a site has more or less of the regional species pool
represented). This is now explained by in a few places in the text- see replies to
reviewer 1
We have also revised the entire introduction to make the context of connectivity
clearer.
Again about connectivity, the manuscript mentions several times (abstract,
introduction, discussion) that sites with low among site beta diversity are more
connected to the regional species pool. This kind of “connectivity” seems subtly
different than using it refer to dispersal of propagules. Does connection to the
regional species arise as a consequence of long-term environmental conditions that
help define the size and number of niches or through rapid replenishment from
propagules (sourced from the same site or from other sites)? Within-site
connectivity was also implicated several times, but again connectivity really means
similarity. Is it possible that sites that recovered fastest had smaller numbers of
species present at the site?
We believe that this “connectivity” is not just a consequence of dispersal ability of
species although it is related to it (Thrush et al 2013), however, we included number
of taxa in the ambient controls as a predictor. This did end up removing the
previously important environmental predictors for epibenthic recovery but did not
change any relationships with ß-diversity.
Predictions: some of the predictions seem unsupported, or at least the rationale
behind them is unclear to the reader. For instance, prediction 1 makes fairly
concrete predictions about how the components of beta diversity should look for
ambient and disturbed communities. However, it is not clear why this prediction is
made. Does it have to do with environmental gradients having an influence on
species occurrence patterns over long periods of time (high nestedness predicted
for ambient plots) and dispersal limiting what species can occupy patches early in
succession following an acute disturbance (high replacement for disturbed plots)?
This kind of information would help the reader make sense of the predictions and
help the reader interpret results in light of the prediction. Prediction 3 seems the
least satisfying of the three because it only predicts some difference. How might
these relationships differ and why?
Please see comments in response to reviewer 1. We have tried to expand on
Prediction 3 to clarify: “Prediction (3): Given the foundational role of habitat-
forming macroalgae for the recolonisation of the infaunal community, relationships
between ß-diversity and recovery would differ for epibenthos and infauna. Biogenic
habitat creation by macroalgae for infauna will lead to a stronger role of habitat
filtering, as infaunal recovery is staged to macroalgal community development.”
The measurement of each of replacement and nestedness is the mirror image of
the other (plainly evident in Fig. 1), and it seems almost impossible to talk about
one without talking about the other. Do both measurement need to be used? I
think it may be possible for them to be considered inverted gradients of the same
information.
Yes we agree and now only use once except for the prediction 1 which is directly
comparing whether nestedness or replacement is dominant
Some of the discussion points seem contradictory at first glance. The abstract
states, “sites closely connected to the regional species pool (low among-site beta
diversity) did not recover faster,” while the last sentence of the paper states, “our
finding that more connected and, thus, more homogeneous communities recover
faster”.
This was misleading and we have corrected it within site ß now only refers to
homogeneity not connectivity.
Was the recovery rate determined by similarity in species composition or not?
Based on Table 2, within-site (plot) similarity hastened species composition
recovery of epibenthos, while plot similarity slowed recovery of infauna.
This was not similarity (as in B-C) rather beta diversity (within site)
The key is the spatial scale because among-site beta diversity only appears as an
interaction for infauna, but this is sometimes difficult to keep track of when reading
the paper. These are key messages that the MS needs to ensure are clear and
consistent.
We have gone through and ensured that the text is now consistent- some changes
have ensued as a result of changing from plot to within-site <U+F062>-diversity (as a
measure of heterogeneity), including ambient alpha diversity and averaging the
squared terms of the Podani equations.
Why was presence-absence data used instead of raw community matrices filled
with abundance data? Especially for questions about rates of recovery, should not
abundance or percent cover be an important requirement for community
similarity? Understandably, the data were collected only one year after clearing, so
it is quite possible that abundance was still low in disturbed plots. Given the lack of
descriptive data on the communities (for example, we don’t even know what
possible taxa make up infauna without consulting other publications from the
area), it is difficult for the reader to get a sense of what is going on with these
communities.
The methods stated “Relative recovery of epibenthos and infauna for each plot was
estimated as the difference between paired disturbed and ambient samples 1 year
after disturbance based on Bray Curtis similarity of untransformed data.” While
untransformed means raw counts we have replaced the term. We have included
that infaunal taxa included polychaetes, amphipods and bivalves. We have also
placed a list of infaunal taxa found in the supplement
I disagree with some of the interpretation of statistical results (see minor
comments below for more detail). The MS should be careful when describing
predictions from polynomial and interaction terms. These “non-linearities” are not
discussed much in the body of the discussion, which makes it difficult to assess how
important they might be. I think the MS would benefit greatly by more explicitly
considering, and perhaps graphing, model predictions. It would help the reader
visually assess, for instance, how the interaction between site replacement and site
beta diversity influence infaunal recovery patterns, or how the polynomial terms
influence responses over the range of the predictor. An extra figure showing some
of the patterns might be worth considering.
No polynomials ended up in the model in either the previous version of the
manuscript or the new models (see Table 2)- only squared terms by themselves and
these are relatively easy to interpret- we have clarified that in the results. Only one
multiplicative term is still in the most complex of the infaunal models and that is
also relatively easy to interpret- a negative relationship with among-site
replacement offset by a positive relationship of among-site beta * among-site
replacement. However, we have included a plot of partial predictions in the
supplementary information.
L81-88: This is the part of the manuscript that attempts to link components of beta
diversity to ecological processes that generate connectivity. However, it comes off
more like a presentation of caveats surrounding (and hope for) good surrogates of
dispersal and connectivity rather than a justification for how and why the beta
diversity components are themselves good surrogates for dispersal and
connectivity. Can the MS provide for justification for using beta diversity to infer
connectivity via dispersal?
We do not think this part comes off like a presentation of caveats, but actually
simply explains the complexity of the investigated system. This justification is now
given in the introduction and methods. We state “One such proposed surrogate is
the degree to which site species richness reflects the regional species pool, for that
environment/habitat”
And then later “ecological connectivity, among-site ß-diversity (i.e., low ß means
well connected). This surrogate of ecological connectivity incorporates both
hydrodynamic constraints and life history traits.”
L300-307: It seems to me from the results presented in the MS that documenting
the changes in large plants (all macroalgae, including turfs?) and animals (mussels,
barnacles, gastropods?) does provide a fairly good surrogate for rocky shore
assembly processes. As the name suggests, all of the infauna seem to associate
with algal turfs. Therefore, anything affecting the recovery of those turfs should
also affects the recovery of the infauna. It seems like most important predictors of
infaunal recovery had something to do with epibenthic recovery, so it seems like a
stretch for the MS to argue that changes in large plants and animals is a poor
surrogate. Also consider Best et al 2014 Ecology
(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/13-1480.1/epdf) for more on large
and small animals and their relationships with plants.
We now clarify this by stating “Interestingly, despite the importance of macroalgae
in habitat creation for the infauna, the recovery of these communities did not simply
track habitat formation (percent explained <45%), with other processes also
indicated as important (e.g., within-site richness difference, within-site nestedness
and among-site replacement of infaunal communities).
Figure 1: I was surprised to only find one figure in this paper. Figure 1 is interesting
and I think helps to tell the story. However, I feel it is simultaneously redundant
and difficult to interpret. It might be helpful to connect the points belonging to a
group with lines or convex hulls to help guide the reader to patterns.
The point of the fig was to show no clear patterns, we have now joined the dots to
show overlapping hulls.
I think panel B should be removed.
This is redesigned to emphasise differences between ambient and disturbed plots
and is directly relevant to our hypothesis.
Mention that replacement is (1-nestedness) in the legend and/or add a descriptive
scale to the x axis in panel A that shows how moving to the left means replacement
while moving to the right means nestedness. Would it be possible to replace panel
B with a ternary plot like those used in Podani & Schmera 2011 and Legendre
2014? I think this would more allow easily allow comparison to other datasets that
have used these beta diversity decompositions.
We did try these before the previous submission but did not find they were at all
easy to interpret
Illustration of major concerns from the abstact:
Because the abstract is dense and contains jargon that is unclear upon first reading,
I would like to consider a few of the sentences in order to help illustrate some of
the major comments. I think the abstract could be crafted to stand alone more
from the main body:
Thanks for pointing this out – we have now done this
L33: Epibenthos is described as being composed mostly of macroalgae. Why not
consider macroalgae separately?
We wanted to consider the structure formers together - and now explain that it is
mostly composed of macroalgae but also mussels, we now provide a supplementary
species list of all the taxa.
L33: Turf infauna are not described here in the sense of which taxa were present,
nor are they described elsewhere in the manuscript even though they were
“enumerated at the lowest taxonomic resolution possible.” Despite infauna being
an important component of the story, the reader does not know what these
organisms are.
Described now as “(mostly polychaetes, bivalves and amphipods)” and list is given
now in the suppliment
L35: infaunal recovery was strongly influenced by local factors. True, but it is also
worth pointing out that these relationships were complicated (most model terms
were polynomials or interactions, and one included connection to regional species
pool).
Now redescribed as “Local diversity measures predicted epibenthic recovery while
infaunal recovery was most strongly influenced by local epibenthic habitat.
However, infaunal communities recovery did not simply track formation of habitat
by recovering epibenthos, this appeared to be overlain by within-site and among-site
aspects of infaunal <U+F062>-diversity.”
L37: Nestedness and replacement immediately stood out to me as jargon that may
not be widely known. Consider adjusting the language here to something more
descriptive.
We understand this- especially for the abstract- we have removed the reference to
nestedness and simply state “epibenthos in the recovering plots having higher
species turnover than in ambient sediment,” However, later in the introduction we
define and then use these terms as they are common jargon used in biodiversity
impact studies and meta-community theory.
L39: Are sites with low among-site beta diversity actually more “connected” to the
regional species pool? This stood out upon first reading as dubious.
We expand on this issue of ecological connectivity above. Beta diversity has been
used as a surrogate of ecological connectivity see refs 1, 9, 11- when
environmental/habitat are similar. The difference between the local and regional
species pool incorporates scale, hydrodynamic connectivity and life history traits.
L40-42: The finding that infauna may be more influenced by dispersal (than
epibenthos?) is intriguing. However, the MS did not explicitly discuss this finding.
Were infaunal communities actually more influenced by dispersal? Among-site
replacement was only an “important” (supported) predictor as it interacted with
site beta diversity, so it seems difficult to argue for this.
In the abstract we simply say “However, infaunal communities recovery did not
simply track formation of habitat by recovering epibenthos, this appeared to be
overlain by within-site and among-site aspects of infaunal <U+F062>-diversity.”
L45: Cumulative effects: What does this mean? Later in the MS we find out this
means the effect of many small-scale disturbances, but this is not clear at the start.
Cumulative effects is well established term in the ecological and environmental
management literature. However, we have replaced this with “ effects from
multiple disturbances “
**Minor Comments:
L28: “multiple rocky shore sites” is more concise here.
Changed into across multiple sites and among plots within site on the rocky shore
L33: please define turf here, and elsewhere in the MS, as algal turf. This small
adjustment may help readers connect more quickly to the material.
Actually we have removed the term “turf” and simply refer to “infauna” as they are
actually “the fauna living in the macroalgal assemblage, turf or canopy”
L34: replace conversely with “whereas” or “while” or separate these phrases with a
period rather than a comma.
OK, DONE
L83: dispersing marine larvae are generally considered propagules. Consider
deleting “larval or”
We prefer to maintain both in the context of this sentence on the multiple forms of
dispersal.
L93: Rather than “significantly enhance”, perhaps “contribute to” implies that they
are part of the diversity rather than directly promoting it.
DONE
L94: What makes this experiment novel? Is it the fact that large plots were used,
that multiple sites were used, the study of infauna, or the combination of these? I
suggest the MS refrain from this type of self-assessment.
The novelty is explained above, in terms of plot size and encompassed coastline
(now also added in brackets)
Methods (Study sites): It might be helpful to provide some insight into the geology
of the area, at least as a link to sinuosity and fractal measures.
L149-155: GIS was used but never defined. It is not entirely clear what separates
Sinuosity from Sinuosity (GIS). The language used in Table S1 is more intuitive and
should probable be used in the main body (e.g. “fractal dimension” is much more
informative that “fractal (GIS)”. Furthermore, the description of line segments for
the ARCGIS calculated metrics is difficult to follow (where do the line segments
come from?). Finally, what is the relationship between fractal dimension and
sinuosity at the large scale? It appears that they are linearly related nearly one-to-
one, so why calculate both?
Explained better in the text now, “Sinuosity (GIS) is calculated in the same way as
Sinuosity (chain) measurements, but at a larger scale: the Sinuosity (chain) taking
into account the small scale roughness of the substrate.”
L119: Why is it important to know that “barometric tide may dominate water
level”? Most readers may not know what barometric tides are. I think the meaning
is that tidal amplitude is low and therefore sites are similar and that 1 meter square
quadrats would be sufficient to cover the entire intertidal zone. This should be
made explicit if it is important.
The sentence was used to stress that in the Mediterranean, mostly in the summer,
these communities may be exposed to open air because of prolonged high pressure
that exerts a larger effect than tide.
L134-138: Percent cover only pertains to epibenthos. Make this clear.
DONE
L138: can the MS comment on the efficacy of the coring method? From the
information provided at the beginning of the methods, which gives us our only
concrete clue about site differences in community composition, it sounds like turfs
may not be present or abundant at all sites.
There were epibenthos at all sites, and we were able to effectively core it. Explained
now that infauna refers to all animals living within the algal assemblage (turf or
canopy).
L156-163: AHCI seems like an interesting measurement, but potentially one that
misleads. The largest canopy forming species have the highest AHCI values yet they
likely do not have the highest surface area to volume ratios. It seems like some of
the smaller algae (e.g. filamentous turf) would have very high complexity despite
generally small size, which infauna might respond to more than thallus size.
We were mostly interested in the complexity related to the three-dimensionality
and the refuge provisioning that is definitely larger in the canopy than in the
turf/filamentous system, however it was not a useful concept in this analysis.
Remember this is the Mediterranean – there are no large browns in this system.
L160: Is “paint” a common term for corallines? I am used to hearing about coralline
crusts.
Yes paint is common terminology in most of the western world but we have
changed it to accommodate the reviewer
L227: “For both ambient and disturbed plots, the relativized richness difference
was a larger proportion of beta-diversity for the infauna than the epibenthos”. This
is not so obvious from Fig 1. Unlike other assertions in this paragraph, this
particular result lacks a statistical test. Is it not the case that richness differences
were higher ambient than disturbed plots for epibenthos and infauna? What is the
interpretation of richness differences being higher in ambient than disturbed plots?
It would be interesting for the MS to comment on this.
Changed into: “A significant effect of infauna and epibenthos was not detected on
the relativized richness difference proportion of ß–diversity for either ambient or
disturbed plots (p > 0.20 for both, Fig. 1). “ and we have redrawn the figure
L252-254: The squared terms here are confusing. I interpreted these as second
degree polynomial terms, rather than the explanatory variable squared. In the
former case, it is somewhat misleading to say that infaunal recovery is positively
related to epibenthic recovery. I expect the interpretation to be that infaunal
recovery was highest at intermediate cover of Corallina and lowest at intermediate
levels of epibenthic recover.
No, although a polynomial was included, only the squared term was significant so
the regression was rerun with only the squared term (see Table 2) thus the
description is correct in both instances
L270: “sites with higher…replacement…had higher infaunal recovery.” This result is
difficult to support just as an interaction, even with the parenthetical “multiplied by
site beta-diversity” added. It is possible that recovery was decreased with
increasing replacement, but this effect was lessened as site beta-diversity increases
(overall negative trend with positive interaction term).
Yes you are correct given that we now find a negative effect for the replacement
term as well as the positive multiplicative term, although we had already replaced
this with “infaunal recovery increased with increased recovery of the epibenthos
(prediction 3), negatively mediated by local habitat structure (coralline algae).
However, for infaunal recovery there were indications that effects of local habitat
were overlain by aspects of beta diversity at both the local and among-site scale. “
Given that we do not have a clear optimal model for infauna we feel it is better be
circumspect about what we think are the drivers.
L271-272: Does this sentence run counter to the inclusion of an interaction term
(Site replacement * Infaunal site beta-A) for infaunal recovery? Prediction 2 states
that sites with low site beta diversity would recover faster. Can the MS please
address this? Is it because replacement did not dominate?
We now clearly state that we did not find that sites with high ecological
connectivity (low among-site beta diversity) recovered faster. We do find among
site beta diversity to be important for infauna- but it is operating in the wrong
direction. We state this here “Utilizing ß–diversity as an indicator of ecological
connectivity in this large-scale experiment indicated no reliance on the regional
species pool for epibenthic or infaunal recovery,” and in the abstract.
L286: Are turfs more likely to have vegetative propagating thalli? Currently the MS
does not clarify this, and it influences the reader’s ability to understand the point of
this paragraph. Furthermore, the finding that turf dominated communities
recovered faster than macroalgal one is very interesting, yet is only brought up as a
minor point in the discussion. I think this result warrants further attention in the
MS as it likely influences patterns seen for infauna.
We are now clear that infauna live in other places than turf so this is not likely to be
a strong driver of infaunal patterns- and in the initial regression analysis we did
include turf cover as a driver of recovery, however it seemed to have little effect.
Supplement: I expected to find more data and methods here than what was
presented.
We are not sure what data or methods the reviewer expected to find here.
However, we have placed the diagnostic plots here, in case that is what he was
referring to.

incorporated many of my suggestions.
crepancies between the response letter and the revised manuscript
e Response letter says on p. 4, lines 44-45: “(and for the LCBD we calculated the
acement, richness and nested components)”. Sorry, one cannot compute the replacement,
ness and nested components from LCBD values. You probably meant to write that you
puted LCBD indices from the replacement, richness and nested components?
wever, this has not been done: the acronym LCBD appears nowhere in the paper. The LCBD
ces could have been computed either with the beta.div() function of adespatial in R, or as the
ances of the sites [or plots] to their centroid, using the PERMDISP2 method of Anderson et
2006), which can be found in e-Primer and also in function betadisper() in R. I explained in
notes of 12 November 2017 that the LCBD indices are the squares of the PERMDISP2
ances to the centroid. Neither the LCBD indices nor the equivalent results from PERMDISP2
found in the paper.
the response letter, p. 3, lines 42–46, about the relative contributions of the sites [or plots] to
diversity, I read:
u are correct and we have taken your excellent explanation and used it in the methods. We
state: ‘To estimate the contribution of replacement, nestedness or richness difference among
sites within the study area, and of each plot among the plots of each site calculations were
e on two scales.’ ”
s sentence is indeed found on lines 232-234 of the MS. However, the calculations described
ines 234-237 are still the calculations that I had criticised in the old MS:
5 pairwise comparisons were available for each site at the among-site scale, and 4 pairwise
parisons for each plot at the within-site scale, we calculated the average replacement, nested
richness difference for each site and plot from the squared terms.”

not understand that sentence, which I had commented upon in previous reviews. For the 6
s, 15 pairwise comparisons among sites (not 5) are available to study the among-site scale.
ewise within each site, 5 ambient plots (or quadrats) were surveyed, hence 10 pairwise
parisons (not 4) can be computed among plots. If you had done the calculations using the
.div.comp() function in R, as mentioned on lines 238–239, you would have obtained 15
wise comparisons among the sites and 10 pairwise comparisons among the plots within each
finale on line 237 is equally unclear: “we calculated the average replacement, nested and
ness difference for each site and plot from the squared terms”. What are these “square terms”
what is the justification for adding them? This has to be explained to readers who might want
pply your calculation method to their own data.
nt of disagreement
n p. 4 of the response letter, line 7, I read: “Yes we had missed that- we have now used the
age of the squared dissimilarities”.
afraid this is not what I suggested. The correct way of computing the total variance of the
from the percentage difference (aka Bray-Curtis) D matrix is to compute the mean of the
–1)/2 dissimilarities in the upper or lower triangular portion, not the squared dissimilarities.
calculation is shown in eq. 1 of the Legendre (2014) GEB paper, with reference to the
endre & De Cáceres (2013) paper. The full explanation involves the fact that for this
ficient, the square roots of the dissimilarities produce a Euclidean matrix whereas the original
imilarities are not Euclidean. — A few lines down in the Legendre (2014) paper, eq. 2 and
owing lines, you can see that the mean of the Replacement and Richness difference indices
duce a true partitioning of total beta diversity (BDTotal) computed from that index. So again, it
e values of Replacement and Richness difference that should be added, not their squares,
re dividing by n(n–1)/2.
nestedness, the problem is more complex. Podani & Schmera (2011) defined nestedness only
he Jaccard index, where replacement and nestedness add up to 1. Indeed, replacement =
c)–|b–c|)/(a+b+c) and nestedness = (a+|b–c|)/(a+b+c); so, the sum of these two indices is
b+c)/(a+b+c) = 1 for the Jaccard denominator.
s relationship does not hold for the Sørensen index, which has a different denominator. The
of the numerators for replacement and nestedness would still be (a+b+c), but since the
ensen denominator is (2a+b+c), the sum of replacement and nestedness is not 1.
not aware that the Podani group ever defined nestedness for abundance data. This may be an
vation in your paper. However, you may have to justify the use you are making of this
stic in the paper and especially in Fig. 1A where you are showing replacement + nestedness
e adding up to 1. — A simple way out of this conundrum would be to avoid nestedness for
ndance data altogether. In Fig. 1A, it is sufficient to show the replacement indices in the form
ark lines, as in the present Fig. 1A. You don’t refer to nestedness in Fig. 1B, so you don’t
d this difficult statistic in the paper and you don’t have to show it in Fig. 1A.

presence-absence data, it would be correct to compute nestedness, where it is the one-
plement of replacement for the Jaccard group. But perhaps you are not using it in the paper.

nts that require clarification

, but it is only on line 168 that readers learn that an “ambient” quadrat is an undisturbed
drat. Please make this term clear earlier in the paper. You could evacuate the difficulty by
acing “ambient” by “undisturbed” everywhere in the paper.

The multiple roles of ß–diversity help untangle community assembly processes
affecting recovery of temperate rocky shores
I read with interest the responses of Prof. Thrush to my previous comments on the
paper. It seems, however, that the corrections to the paper itself were made by
another co-author, and there are some discrepancies between the corrections and
modifications announced in the response letter and the new version of the paper. I
will point out those that I noted. There may be more that I missed.
I found the paper much clearer than previous versions. Furthermore, the authors
have answered my main questions, either in the revised version or at least in the
response letter. I am happy that they incorporated many of my suggestions.
Discrepancies between the response letter and the revised manuscript
• The Response letter says on p. 4, lines 44-45: “(and for the LCBD we calculated the
replacement, richness and nested components)”. Sorry, one cannot compute the
replacement, richness and nested components from LCBD values. You probably
meant to write that you computed LCBD indices from the replacement, richness and
nested components?
Probably a better way of putting this in response to the reviewer’s previous
comments would be that we calculated LCBD replacement, LCBD richness and LCBD
nestedness using the beta.div() function of adespatial in R
However, this has not been done: the acronym LCBD appears nowhere in the paper.
The LCBD indices could have been computed either with the beta.div() function of
adespatial in R, or as the distances of the sites [or plots] to their centroid, using the
PERMDISP2 method of Anderson et al. (2006), which can be found in e-Primer and
also in function betadisper() in R. I explained in my notes of 12 November 2017 that
the LCBD indices are the squares of the PERMDISP2 distances to the centroid.
Neither the LCBD indices nor the equivalent results from PERMDISP2 are found in
the paper.
Correct, they do not appear in the manuscript as they were not selected as good
predictor variables. However, we have now acknowledged that we did trial the use
of LCBD.
• In the response letter, p. 3, lines 42–46, about the relative contributions of the
sites [or plots] to beta diversity, I read: “You are correct and we have taken your
excellent explanation and used it in the methods. We now state: ‘To estimate the
contribution of replacement, nestedness or richness difference among the sites
within the study area, and of each plot among the plots of each site calculations
were done on two scales.’ ”
This sentence is indeed found on lines 232-234 of the MS. However, the calculations
described on lines 234-237 are still the calculations that I had criticised in the old
MS: “As 5 pairwise comparisons were available for each site at the among-site scale,
and 4 pairwise comparisons for each plot at the within-site scale, we calculated the
average replacement, nested and richness difference for each site and plot from the
squared terms.” I do not understand that sentence, which I had commented upon in
previous reviews. For the 6 sites, 15 pairwise comparisons among sites (not 5) are
available to study the among-site scale. Likewise within each site, 5 ambient plots
(or quadrats) were surveyed, hence 10 pairwise comparisons (not 4) can be
computed among plots. If you had done the calculations using the beta.div.comp()
function in R, as mentioned on lines 238–239, you would have obtained 15 pairwise
comparisons among the sites and 10 pairwise comparisons among the plots within
each site.
Correct, there are 15 pairwise comparisons for the sites and 10 among the plots
within each site. That said each site is involved in only 5 comparisons and each plot
is only involved in 4 comparisons. For the undisturbed vs disturbed comparison we
now use all 15 of the pairwise data.
The finale on line 237 is equally unclear: “we calculated the average replacement,
nested and richness difference for each site and plot from the squared terms”. What
are these “square terms” and what is the justification for adding them? This has to
be explained to readers who might want to apply your calculation method to their
own data.
Point of disagreement
• On p. 4 of the response letter, line 7, I read: “Yes we had missed that- we have
now used the
average of the squared dissimilarities”.
I am afraid this is not what I suggested. The correct way of computing the total
variance of the data from the percentage difference (aka Bray-Curtis) D matrix is to
compute the mean of the n(n–1)/2 dissimilarities in the upper or lower triangular
portion, not the squared dissimilarities.
We do not use the Bray-Curtis (Sorenson) index in our calculations of replacement
and richness difference. Instead our calculations are based on the Jaccard index
(presence/absence data) using the Podani family of calculations. We have ensured
this is clearer in the text. Thus, we believe that the next section of Prof Legendre’s
review does not need to be addressed. With respect to whether we square the
indices before averaging or not, much of the work on this topic is related to utilising
the indices within ordinations to calculate the “true” amount of variance, thus it
becomes important whether the indices produce dissimilarities that form a
Euclidean matrix or not. Table S1.4 in Appendix 1 of Legendre 2014 indicates that
the Jaccard group of Podani family calculations based on presence/absence is
neither Euclidean, nor becomes Euclidean upon a square root transformation.
However, we are not attempting to use the indices in this way, and we have now
clarified this in the manuscript. Once we had calculated the pairwise estimates of
replacement and richness difference, we wished to determine whether the average
of the estimates of replacement (or richness difference) for a plot affected its
recovery. We now place this information in the text, and rather than refer simply to
within-site (or among site) replacement, richness difference and nestedness” we
refer to averaged plot (or site) replacement, richness difference and nestedness.
We changed the analysis of the comparison of the undisturbed /disturbed degree of
replacement, richness difference and nestedness.
The remaining comment from Prof Legendre on this issue is thus not relevant
because we perform our calculations based on the Jaccard index (presence/absence
data) using the Podani family of calculations. However we have left Prof Legendre’s
comment below for continuity.
The calculation is shown in eq. 1 of the Legendre (2014) GEB paper, with reference
to the Legendre & De Cáceres (2013) paper. The full explanation involves the fact
that for this coefficient, the square roots of the dissimilarities produce a Euclidean
matrix whereas the original dissimilarities are not Euclidean. — A few lines down in
the Legendre (2014) paper, eq. 2 and following lines, you can see that the mean of
the Replacement and Richness difference indices produce a true partitioning of total
beta diversity (BDTotal) computed from that index. So again, it is the values of
Replacement and Richness difference that should be added, not their squares,
before dividing by n(n–1)/2.
For nestedness, the problem is more complex. Podani & Schmera (2011) defined
nestedness only for the Jaccard index, where replacement and nestedness add up to
1. Indeed, replacement = ((b+c)–|b–c|)/(a+b+c) and nestedness = (a+|b–
c|)/(a+b+c); so, the sum of these two indices is (a+b+c)/(a+b+c) = 1 for the Jaccard
denominator.
This relationship does not hold for the Sørensen index, which has a different
denominator. The sum of the numerators for replacement and nestedness would
still be (a+b+c), but since the Sørensen denominator is (2a+b+c), the sum of
replacement and nestedness is not 1.
I am not aware that the Podani group ever defined nestedness for abundance data.
This may be an innovation in your paper. However, you may have to justify the use
you are making of this statistic in the paper and especially in Fig. 1A where you are
showing replacement + nestedness to be adding up to 1. — A simple way out of this
conundrum would be to avoid nestedness for abundance data altogether. In Fig. 1A,
it is sufficient to show the replacement indices in the form of dark lines, as in the
present Fig. 1A. You don’t refer to nestedness in Fig. 1B, so you don’t need this
difficult statistic in the paper and you don’t have to show it in Fig. 1A.
For presence-absence data, it would be correct to compute nestedness, where it is
the onecomplement of replacement for the Jaccard group. But perhaps you are not
using it in the paper.
Please check your manuscript.
Points that require clarification
• Definition of terms: the expression “ambient quadrat” [or plot] is used on lines 39,
117, 124 and 127, but it is only on line 168 that readers learn that an “ambient”
quadrat is an undisturbed quadrat. Please make this term clear earlier in the paper.
You could evacuate the difficulty by replacing “ambient” by “undisturbed”

We have followed this suggestion with a full replacement of “ambient” with
“undisturbed”.

presented as a dissimilarity (or a distance) and its values are in the [0,1] range. The
similarity form of the same index (S = 1 – D) is the Steinhaus similarity, which is also
in the [0,1] range.
We now say “ based on Bray Curtis dissimilarities of raw count data as percentages

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript is greatly improved in several ways, and I think we can all thank Dr.
Legendre for his generous input. For my part, the manuscript (MS) is much more
approachable to the general reader, whether or not they already have knowledge
about marine intertidal communities or the decomposition of beta diversity. Upon
seeing the MS again after revision, I really think the novelty of this study is
threefold: 1) Multi-scale inference across sites and within sites; 2) experimental
manipulation of disturbance that spans the range of the intertidal zone (rather than
plot size per se); and 3) focus on multiple groups of organisms – the habitat formers
and the organisms that rely on biogenic habitat. All of these attributes help to
uncover mechanisms for how communities assemble (as revealed by beta diversity
decomposition). They are also some of the hallmarks of marine ecology, specifically
intertidal ecology, which makes it deserving of attention from ecologists in general.
While not being quite so blatant we have made sure that the paragraph in the
introduction where this is discussed does cover all these points
After seeing Dr. Legendre’s presentation at WCMB in Montreal, I am convinced that
empirical test of beta diversity are essential, and this MS gets us one step closer
while revealing how the complexity of natural systems makes studying beta
diversity less straight-forward than theory might suggest. I find the work and the
complexity of the results interesting and inspiring. I still think the MS suffers from
vague language, and I try to point out some of these instances below. The added
figures in the supplement are very helpful (more on that below). I recommend
publication after some minor revision.
Vague language: I think the MS will be more accessible (and perhaps more likely to
be cited) if it can make the language clear, and the connection to theory concrete. I
do not advocate for a much longer paper about the nuanced responses about every
species. The MS already tries to incorporate some of this nuance in the form of
natural history and basic biological information, and for some groups like infauna it
seems that this information is just as important as decomposing beta diversity. So, I
like the marriage of abstract diversity theory and more colorful and relatable
information about species and their potential interactions. This is a strength for the
MS. Below I list a few instances where I think the language is vague or the message
unclear. I leave it to the authors to find solutions, knowing that readers will
appreciate the paper much more if they can digest it easily.
L 300 – indications – what does this mean and why are the results not worthy of
interpretation?
We have removed this given the reviewer’s comments about the multiple
regressions
L 334 – local features – this is vague
Changed into local biotic features
L 336 – I know it was just stated that environmental factors were not important, but
I think it would be helpful to make it clear the homogeneity here means low within-
site beta diversity.
Changed into: Epibenthic (mainly macroalgal) recovery was faster at homogeneous
sites (i.e. sites characterised by low within-site beta diversity)
Prediction paragraph (L 123-138) – This paragraph is important and I think it could
be strengthened to emphasize the important points about scales of space and time
and how these inform predictions. It is difficult to understand some of the key
concepts in this MS when they are presented as parenthetical statements, like
spatial constraints. I see how spatial constraints play an important role in beta
diversity, but a pithy statement that connects the prediction to the theory and the
system to create a logical flow in the introduction would be very helpful. The next
sentence (L125-126) somewhat redundantly (see L 119) reiterates how the balance
of nestedness and replacement is influenced by spatial scale, but I think this
discussion of space and time are important and could be revisited in the discussion.
L 138 – staged: I do not understand this wording, but I think I understand the idea
about successional trajectories. I think replacing “is staged to” with “is tied to” or “is
intimately associated with” or “is facilitated by” or “follows” would be more
meaningful. Making this part of the sentence active would also help, e.g. “Biogenic
habitat creation by macroalgae will lead to stronger habitat filtering of infauna than
epibenthos, as macroalgae facilitate infaunal recovery” --- as an aside, do mussels
not also facilitate infauna in this system? I’m thinking of systems on the Pacific Coast
of North America (e.g. Lafferty & Suchanek 2016 American Naturalist, Jurgens &
Gaylord 2016 Scientific Reports).
We have modified this paragraph as suggested to aid clarity and make the
paragraph more pithy. We have also added an extension to a discussion point to
emphasise the effect of spatial and temporal scale. L 358-362 “An important
implication of this is our ability to interpret survey data when the disturbance
history is unknown [4, 37]. Natural landscapes often represent a mosaic of patches
in different stages of recovery: if ignored, these may confuse the analysis of patterns
in biodiversity, as both the spatial scale of patchiness and the temporal scale of
disturbance history may be expected to alter the relative contributions of
replacement and nestedness”
Figures: I found it extremely helpful to see the figures that were added to the
supplement. In my initial reading of the MS, I was frustrated that the quadratic
terms for cover were interpreted as linear effects. The figure makes it clear that the
effects can be interpreted this way because they are monotonic over the range of
the predictor variable. These figures also give the reader an immediate sense of
sample size, effect size, and variation. I think the MS would be strengthened by
including these figures (or at least some of them) in the main MS. Can the figures
also illustrate the interaction between site replacement and infaunal among-site
beta?
This was the figure with the missing caption. It does not do a very good job of
illustrating the interaction, although that is where the high degree of variation
comes from.
Multiple regression: The MS is about beta diversity and finding how its various
decompositions inform patterns of diversity at multiple scales and in the face of
disturbance. I find it curious then, that the MS puts so much emphasis in the results
on comparing (nested) models that emphasize the role of habitat structure. Firstly,
even the more complex model (selected by AIC) already emphasizes this while
illustrating some effect of replacement and richness differences. Instead of
presenting nested models motivated by philosophically different measures of model
fit (e.g. AIC, BIC) I think the MS would benefit from sticking to the more complex
model (even though the top three are indistinguishable based on AIC) and actually
giving some interpretation to the interaction term rather than showing it as
“indication” (L300).
We have done as suggested here and only present the most complex model. We
have also included a sentence in the discussion on interpreting the interaction term.
“In particular recovery was increased when both average site replacement and
among-site beta diversity was high.”
Minor comments:
L 32: sites
done
L 39: recovery being well predicted by local what? If it should be “local factors” this
makes the rest of the sentence less satisfying because habitat is one of those local
factors.
Changed into: This was supported by epibenthos in the recovering plots having
higher species turnover than in undisturbed plots, and recovery well predicted by
local features, while infaunal recovery was most strongly influenced by the
epibenthic community complexity (lines 37-40)
L 42: replace this with and or but?
Replaced with but
L 45: wasn’t within-site beta also important and negatively correlated with
epibenthic recover. It general, it seems the abstract needs to be tightened up a bit
more.
We have tightened up Abstract to ensure that all general concepts associated with
our experiment are mentioned.
L 103-104 - Novelty: see first paragraph of this review, but I think the MS will be
strongly by showing us how the work is novel. Yes, this should include some explicit
statements about how this work addresses gaps and advances theory, and if a direct
statement about novelty is important then I think it can be done without the
reasons being parenthetical. It is not just the plot size but how it relates to the size
of the habitat (it spans most of the intertidal zone, right?).
See reply further up, we are really happy that the reviewer understands the novelty
of this manuscript.
L 185 – still unclear what these line segments are or where they come from.
Made clear (i.e. the individual segments of the continuous broken line of the
coastline)
L 237 – make it clear that these are the squared terms from the Podani equations.
This was indicated just above in the text “We decomposed the undisturbed ß-
diversity into replacement, richness difference and nestedness, based on the
Jaccard group (presence/absence data) and using the Podani family of calculations”
L 348-350 – The previous part of this paragraph is about canopy-formers and how
vegetative propagation is important, but then this sentence states that the turf
formers recovered faster. Does this mean that vegetative propagation is not
important or that recovery through sexual propagules is faster than we thought (if,
in fact, this is the mode of recovery for turfs)? Please provide some interpretation to
what seems like a one-off statement that counters the rest of the paragraph.
We now state “ In fact, algal turf dominated communities (such as Framura),
characterised by vegetative propagation, recovered much faster than canopy
dominated ones (mostly Pontetto, Portofino and Bonassola; [24, 36]), which rely on
recolonisation by sexual propagules.”
I appreciate the taxon table added to the supplement. It gives the reader a sense of
the flora and fauna without having to dig up other papers, and it makes it clear (to
me, anyway) that infauna comprise a diverse fauna with a range of body sizes (e.g.
caprellids vs harpacticoids) and life history strategies (e.g. peracarids vs. polychates)
and trophic strategies.
