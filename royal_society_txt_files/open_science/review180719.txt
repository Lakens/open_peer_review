The manuscript deals with an important aspect of animal disease spread by a relevant approach.
However, as the movement of animals via markets is a phenomenon that plays a much more
important role in the British isles than elsewhere in Europe, it would be useful for the reader to
include some additional text about this. For some diseases, animals meeting at markets/shows
(despite biosecurity measures in place) constitutes a major risk of dissemination and it would
therefore be of great interest to see all the analyses performed on the dataset with markets and
shows included as well as excluded. As this is relevant for 35% of the movements (p5, l46) it is
not unimportant. At least, Figure S1 in the supplementary material could be placed next to
Figure 2 to illustrate this, and some text added in relevant sections (Methods, Results,
Discussion). Moreover, as bovine TB is referred to (and rightly so), it would be of interest to
relate the movement patterns (e.g. the pattern of the GSCC) to the different geographical risk
areas for TB or, at least, add some comments about this in the Discussion.
I have some minor comments, listed below:
P7, L8: directed or direct?
P12, L 36-41. The comparison with Sweden needs an added statement that the Swedish cattle
trading system doesn't include livestock markets, the similarity is a large number of animals into
fattening farms, not a proportion of these via livestock markets. In addition, Swedish fattening
herds only sell directly to slaughter.
P13, L14-15: "these" farms, not this farms
P14, L20: rather "than" random selection
P14, L27-28: perhaps point out that moving infected animals remains the highest risk (other
contacts <100%)
P15 L 9: it appears that you are hinting that contacts and ICC information should be added to
farms' disease status information, this might be pointed out more clearly in the discussion, with
pro's and con's of such a system.
In addition, the following points would be useful to add to the Discussion:
"Fattening herds" in most countries (except for UK and Ireland) sell only animals directly to
slaughter, in this study it is demonstrated that some have large ICCs AND large OCCs, is it
possible to characterise these more (where are they, are they really "fattening" herds or something
else?)?
As TB is mentioned as a disease for which the study is relevant, the finding that animal
movements increased while TB testing almost stopped entirely is worth commenting on. In many
papers the stopped testing has been put forward as the main reason for subsequent increase in TB
prevalence and animal movements have not been highlighted. This study demonstrates the
importance of movements and it would be a shame not to emphasise it. The many animal
movements still resulted in a lower number of edges in 2001, this should also be commented on,
the particular aspects of restockning depopulated herds could be elaborated.
Some herds with low in-degree and out-degree still had large ICCs and OCCs, this is also worth
commenting on (false sense of security?)
High ICC's in the North of England is also worth mentioning in connection with TB, as a lot of
the low risk area for TB is in the North.

The paper titled “Contact chains of cattle farms in Great Britain” describes the cattle movement
network in the study country during a time span of 15 years (2001-2015). The authors applied
several network analysis metric in order to characterize the 15 yearly networks. Particular
attention was given to a metric called “contact chain” (in the literature known also as “infection
chain”), and to the merit of the authors this metrics was rarely used on such extensive datasets, in
particular in GB (to my knowledge).
The paper has the clear merit to conduct a complete network analysis, including many metrics
that can describe the between-farms contact patterns due to animal movements, and to conduct
this research through a long time-series. However, novelty elements hardly emerge from both the
methods and the discussion/conclusion, since they applied metrics developed by others and
already used in the context of livestock networks, and the conclusions are rather well-known in
the literature. In fact, the major concern regards the structure and the lack of a sound scientific
question to drive the paper.
Major comments
Lack of scientific question drive
Overall, the present study lack of a clear question-answer drive and, in the current form, looks
more like an application of a network analysis measures. This lack is reflected in the structure of
the Introduction and Discussion sections. While the former is confusing and does not follow a
clear logical flow, the latter seems to partly repeat the results section (except for few paragraphs,
such as page 12 the 1st and 2nd, and page 13, the 3rd), and to partly to state already known. I
think that a descriptive analysis might be still valuable, but only if better justified and well
described.
Contact chains calculation
The second major comment regard the calculation of contact chains. The paragraph reported
from Page 7 line 28 to Page 8 line 5 is confusing and it took me a lot to understand how authors
calculated the contact chains.
In my understanding, they calculate the ICC (and OCC) starting each year from January for 365
4
days. My concern is that by calculating the contact chains in this way, they overestimate the
chains value. For example, if a given farm (#2) receive an animal in February from farm #1, then
is inactive for a prolonged time period, and in November sends an animal to farm #3, are farm 1-
2-3 in the same chain? Konschake et al (2014, PlosOne) introduced an infection period for the
calculation of contacts chains to overcome this issue. In this formulation two contacts needs to
happen within the infectious period to be included in the same chain. The authors formulation
could work in the context of slow-spreading diseases (i.e. bTB) in the absence of control
measures, such as movement restrictions, but not for fast-spreading diseases (i.e. FMD).
Another issue with that is the seasonality of movements and “border effect”. The authors showed
that by starting the calculation in different months (over a range of 3 years) results did not
changed much. However, this sounds obvious, because the periods with more movements will be
caught anyway by the chain, as cattle movement are known to have a marked yearly seasonal
behaviour. So, I do not think this issue is addressed correctly. On the other hand, a “border
effect” could prevent a correct calculation of contact chains. As an example, if I start to calculate
the ICC on Jan 1st of a given year and ignore what happened in the last period of the previous
year. How do the authors addressed this issue?
Finally, in order to combine the information of the ICC and OCC the authors could use the
method showed by Rossi et al (2017, Plos Computational Biology), or at least discuss their results
in the light of this. In general, I would refresh the literature on contact chains.
Minor comments
General
- The citations numbering is not correct (example, page 4 and 5, no 36 and 38 between 35 and 39,
37 is the same as 33). Also, sometimes citations are redundant (see page 3, line 14).
- Networks measures are calculated for each year (so, 15 observations per measure, in my
understanding): most of the time the authors reports mean and SD. I think it would be better to
report the median/mean and 95th percentile or median/mean and range.

Lines 15-56 (and Page 7 lines 3-24): I would suggest the authors to report all these network

needs more explanation and discussion;

I have only one remaining question, that does not really qualify as a revision.
I would suggest to double-check the statement on line 216-217 that 5.4% of fattening herds were
closed for the five-year period (2011-2015). Is it reasonable that about 450 herds (if I understand
the figures correctly) that are classified as fattening herds would not introduce a single animal for
5 years but still qualify as active herds (so there must be outward movements as births would not
be expected to occur at any significant rate in fattening herds). A brief explanatory comment
could be added to this sentence, as it does sound extraordinary to have any number of "closed"
fattening herds for a longer period.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
The quality how this manuscript has improved and the authors were able to effectively clarify the
purpose of it. These efforts made the manuscript publishable.
However, I would suggest a couple of things. First, to make more clear (in the abstract, in
particular) that OCC and ICCs calculations are suited to bovine TB. In general, the abstract needs
a bit more explanation on the background and the significance of the paper (as an example, one
important result to me is that even after excluding markets, some farms act as “hubs” anyway).
Second, I would also suggest to fix the syntax of some sentences, to improve the readability and
the flow of the manuscript (example: lines 19-20 or 84-85, but throughout the text). Other minor
comments below.
Line 36: “pathogens”?
Line 42: influence on what?
Lines 98-107: this paragraph is already explaining some methods, maybe it needs a better
collocation
Lines 160-170: I might have intuitively understood what you did exactly to address the “border
effect”, but this part is not clear. Please, rephrase.
Line 182: “and” is bold

Comments to the Author(s)
I have only one remaining question, that does not really qualify as a revision.
I would suggest to double-check the statement on line 216-217 that 5.4% of fattening herds were
closed for the five-year period (2011-2015). Is it reasonable that about 450 herds (if I understand
the figures correctly) that are classified as fattening herds would not introduce a single animal for
5 years but still qualify as active herds (so there must be outward movements as births would not
be expected to occur at any significant rate in fattening herds). A brief explanatory comment
could be added to this sentence, as it does sound extraordinary to have any number of "closed"
fattening herds for a longer period.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
The quality how this manuscript has improved and the authors were able to effectively clarify the
purpose of it. These efforts made the manuscript publishable.
16
However, I would suggest a couple of things. First, to make more clear (in the abstract, in
particular) that OCC and ICCs calculations are suited to bovine TB. In general, the abstract needs
a bit more explanation on the background and the significance of the paper (as an example, one
important result to me is that even after excluding markets, some farms act as “hubs” anyway).
Second, I would also suggest to fix the syntax of some sentences, to improve the readability and
the flow of the manuscript (example: lines 19-20 or 84-85, but throughout the text). Other minor
comments below.
Line 36: “pathogens”?
Line 42: influence on what?
Lines 98-107: this paragraph is already explaining some methods, maybe it needs a better
collocation
Lines 160-170: I might have intuitively understood what you did exactly to address the “border
effect”, but this part is not clear. Please, rephrase.
Line 182: “and” is bold
Line 386: in my understanding the ones cited here are not “transmission models” but rather
algorithms to calculate the contact chains
Line 419: the method is at least 10 years old (first Dube’ paper was published in 2008)

Response to reviewers
____________________________________________________________________
______________
Reviewer 1
1. The manuscript deals with an important aspect of animal disease spread by a
relevant approach. However, as the movement of animals via markets is a
phenomenon that plays a much more important role in the British isles than
elsewhere in Europe, it would be useful for the reader to include some
additional text about this. For some diseases, animals meeting at
markets/shows (despite biosecurity measures in place) constitutes a major risk
of dissemination and it would therefore be of great interest to see all the
analyses performed on the dataset with markets and shows included as well as
excluded. As this is relevant for 35% of the movements (p5, l46) it is not
unimportant. At least, Figure S1 in the supplementary material could be placed
next to Figure 2 to illustrate this, and some text added in relevant sections
(Methods, Results, Discussion).
- As requested, we have moved Figure S1 into the main document (now
Figure 2b) and added clarification and explanation to the figure legend (Line
669), methods (Lines 121-129), results (207-209), and discussion (332-335,
339-341, and particularly 368-376). Our analysis reveals and emphasises the
importance of some farms as hubs, in addition to the previously described
role of markets. This effect would be less apparent in an analysis that
included markets as nodes.
- See also our response to Referee 2 (Point 27), who agrees with our
approach of directly linking source and destination farms.
2. Moreover, as bovine TB is referred to (and rightly so), it would be of interest to
relate the movement patterns (e.g. the pattern of the GSCC) to the different
geographical risk areas for TB or, at least, add some comments about this in the
Discussion.
- We fully agree with this comment, however extending the analysis to a
direct assessment of TB risk is a major addition that would extend the
length and scope of this particular paper too far. We hope you will
appreciate that we are therefore dealing with the issue of TB, and the risk
areas, more extensively in a separate paper.
I have some minor comments, listed below:
3. P7, L8: directed or direct?
- This text is now in supplementary Table S1, as per point 30 of Reviewer 2
(below), in the row about the Giant Strongly-Connected Component.
- We use ‘directed’ to indicate a difference between the strong and weak
components, whereas the weak component would include farms that are
connected by an edge in either direction (direct), the strong component
specifically uses only farms linked by edges in a determined direction
(directed).
4. P12, L 36-41. The comparison with Sweden needs an added statement that the
Swedish cattle trading system doesn't include livestock markets, the similarity is
a large number of animals into fattening farms, not a proportion of these via
livestock markets. In addition, Swedish fattening herds only sell directly to
slaughter.
- Done as requested (Line 372).
5. P13, L14-15: "these" farms, not this farms
- Sentence no longer exists. These lines have been rephrased in response to
Reviewer 2.
6. P14, L20: rather "than" random selection
- Done as requested (Line 374).
7. P14, L27-28: perhaps point out that moving infected animals remains the
highest risk (other contacts <100%)
- Done as requested (Line 391)
8. P15 L 9: it appears that you are hinting that contacts and ICC information should
be added to farms' disease status information, this might be pointed out more
clearly in the discussion, with pro's and con's of such a system.
- We now discuss this further at Lines 376-382 and again at Lines 412-421.
9. In addition, the following points would be useful to add to the Discussion:
"Fattening herds" in most countries (except for UK and Ireland) sell only animals
directly to slaughter, in this study it is demonstrated that some have large ICCs AND
large OCCs, is it possible to characterise these more (where are they, are they really
"fattening" herds or something else?)?
- We have clarified the classification of herd types at Lines 134-139 and its
limitations at lines 335-341.
- We looked at location of different types and found that fattening premises
were well-distributed across GB (see the map below), across all cattle dense
areas, therefore did not consider the spatial distribution was worth
reporting in its own right.
10. As TB is mentioned as a disease for which the study is relevant, the finding that
animal movements increased while TB testing almost stopped entirely is worth
commenting on. In many papers the stopped testing has been put forward as
the main reason for subsequent increase in TB prevalence and animal
movements have not been highlighted. This study demonstrates the importance
of movements and it would be a shame not to emphasise it. The many animal
movements still resulted in a lower number of edges in 2001, this should also be
commented on, the particular aspects of restocking depopulated herds could be
elaborated.
- We have added text at lines 349-355.
11. Some herds with low in-degree and out-degree still had large ICCs and OCCs,
this is also worth commenting on (false sense of security?)
- We now address this at lines 298-299 in the results, and Figure 8, and have
added text in the discussion at lines 379-382 and 412-419.
12. High ICC's in the North of England is also worth mentioning in connection with
TB, as a lot of the low risk area for TB is in the North.
- We agree but refer you to our response to Point 2 above. This will be in a
later paper.
Reviewer: 2
The paper titled “Contact chains of cattle farms in Great Britain” describes the cattle
movement network in the study country during a time span of 15 years (2001-
2015). The authors applied several network analysis metric in order to characterize
the 15 yearly networks. Particular attention was given to a metric called “contact
chain” (in the literature known also as “infection chain”), and to the merit of the
authors this metrics was rarely used on such extensive datasets, in particular in GB
(to my knowledge).
The paper has the clear merit to conduct a complete network analysis, including
many metrics that can describe the between-farms contact patterns due to animal
movements, and to conduct this research through a long time-series. However,
novelty elements hardly emerge from both the methods and the
discussion/conclusion, since they applied metrics developed by others and already
used in the context of livestock networks, and the conclusions are rather well-
known in the literature. In fact, the major concern regards the structure and the lack
of a sound scientific question to drive the paper.
Major comments
13. Lack of scientific question drive
Overall, the present study lack of a clear question-answer drive and, in the current
form, looks more like an application of a network analysis measures. This lack is
reflected in the structure of the Introduction and Discussion sections. While the
former is confusing and does not follow a clear logical flow, the latter seems to
partly repeat the results section (except for few paragraphs, such as page 12 the 1st
and 2nd, and page 13, the 3rd), and to partly to state already known. I think that a
descriptive analysis might be still valuable, but only if better justified and well
described.
- We have revisited parts of the introduction in order to improve logical flow,
which we now consider to be clear, i.e. introducing the importance of
network analysis in general and in terms of control measures > variation
arising from pathogen characteristics and the time-scale of infectiousness >
time-ordered networks > some detail of such network analyses as they
pertain to cattle > a discussion of the situation in Britain > the specific
context, highlighting the focus on chronic, slow-moving or latent infections
and bTB > predictions arising.
- We have ironed out repetition, changed perspectives and consolidated
extensive sections of the Discussion.
- We agree that the paper is an application of network measures to a
complete network of particular interest and over an extended period.
Patterns of variation and change in this network potentially have great
epidemiological and economic importance. We feel this study makes a
worthwhile contribution to understanding disease transmission in a sector
where cattle movements have become so numerous and far-reaching.
14. Contact chains calculation
The second major comment regard the calculation of contact chains. The paragraph
reported from Page 7 line 28 to Page 8 line 5 is confusing and it took me a lot to
understand how authors calculated the contact chains.
- We have rewritten and clarified the contact chains methodology (lines 156-
179). A schematic and further detail are provided in the Supplementary
Materials.
15. In my understanding, they calculate the ICC (and OCC) starting each year from
January for 365 days. My concern is that by calculating the contact chains in this
way, they overestimate the chains value. For example, if a given farm (#2)
receive an animal in February from farm #1, then is inactive for a prolonged
time period, and in November sends an animal to farm #3, are farm 1-2-3 in the
same chain? Konschake et al (2014, PlosOne) introduced an infection period for
the calculation of contacts chains to overcome this issue. In this formulation two
contacts needs to happen within the infectious period to be included in the
same chain. The authors formulation could work in the context of slow-
spreading diseases (i.e. bTB) in the absence of control measures, such as
movement restrictions, but not for fast-spreading diseases (i.e. FMD).
- We have clarified our approach in the Introduction at Lines 52-59, 71-83 and
Discussion 383-390, and to emphasise that, in line with the reviewer, we
used a one year period to represent the length of time a slow-spreading
infection, such as bTB, may have come onto a farm before being identified
and control measures being implemented.
16. Another issue with that is the seasonality of movements and “border effect”.
The authors showed that by starting the calculation in different months (over a
range of 3 years) results did not changed much. However, this sounds obvious,
because the periods with more movements will be caught anyway by the chain,
as cattle movement are known to have a marked yearly seasonal behaviour. So,
I do not think this issue is addressed correctly. On the other hand, a “border
effect” could prevent a correct calculation of contact chains. As an example, if I
start to calculate the ICC on Jan 1st of a given year and ignore what happened in
the last period of the previous year. How do the authors addressed this issue?
- We have clarified our methods at lines 160-170 to highlight our evaluation
of a 36 month period and how it resolves problems associated with a border
effect.
17. Finally, in order to combine the information of the ICC and OCC the authors
could use the method showed by Rossi et al (2017, Plos Computational Biology),
or at least discuss their results in the light of this.
- We have clarified in the methods at lines 180-191. We have included a
discussion on our techniques in light of the Rossi paper at lines 377, 386-
390. Our classification of those farms with over 10,000 farms in both their
ingoing and outgoing contact chain was our proxy for a ‘superspreader’
farm.
18. In general, I would refresh the literature on contact chains.
- We have added relevant citations from recent literature throughout the
introduction and discussion.
Minor comments
General
19. The citations numbering is not correct (example, page 4 and 5, no 36 and 38
between 35 and 39, 37 is the same as 33). Also, sometimes citations are
redundant (see page 3, line 14).
- We have corrected these errors.
20. Networks measures are calculated for each year (so, 15 observations per
measure, in my understanding): most of the time the authors reports mean and
SD. I think it would be better to report the median/mean and 95th percentile or
median/mean and range.
- We have changed standard deviation to 95% confidence intervals when
reporting these network measures throughout the results.
Introduction
Page 3
21. Lines 6-8: add citation;
- Citation added at Line 37.
22. Line 9: “animal movements between farms form a directional link from the
source to the destination farm”, it is how we consider movements in a network
framework, more than the movement forming an edge itself;
- Updated at Lines 37-40.
23. Lines 25-27: add citation;
- This line has now been removed in response to previous comments
regarding the introduction.
24. Lines 27-30: support this claim;
- Added citation at line 52.
25. Lines 49-50: “cows”? Or “farms” maybe;
- Text added at lines 61-65 to clarify that the networks were specifically
constructed from individual adult dairy cow movements between farms.
Methods
Page 5
26. There is no brief description of the different types of farms. A reader unfamiliar
with the GB cattle industry might not be aware of the exact difference between
the types of farm. Also, is “suckler” what elsewhere is called “cow-calf”?
- We have added in descriptions of the different herds at lines 134-139.
27. Lines 48-50: I agree with this choice, but it needs to be properly justified and/or
discussed;
- Added text at lines 121-129 for further discussion and justification. See also
our response to Referee 1, point 1, above.
Page 6
28. Lines 15-20: the choice of weight the links based on the number of animals and
not on the number of batches is good to me, but it should be supported or
discussed (see Volkova et al., 2010, already cited);
- Text added at lines 143-145 and Volkova et al. (2010) are cited as [15].
29. Line 30: update igraph citation;
- We have updated the version number and used the citation provided in the
R documentation.
30. Lines 15-56 (and Page 7 lines 3-24): I would suggest the authors to report all
these network metrics, with opportune citations, and brief descriptions in a
table, since none of these represent a novelty in the field. Maybe this could
make the section easier to read;
- We have created a new Table S1 providing these definitions.
Page 7
31. Lines 5-10: the correct citation here is Kao et al., 2006, Interface.
- This text is now included in Table S1. The best paper is ‘Kiss IZ, Green DM,
Kao RR. 2006 The network of sheep movements within Great Britain:
Network properties and their implications for infectious disease spread. J. R.
Soc. Interface 3, 669–677. (doi:10.1098/rsif.2006.0129)’ and has been added
to the references in the Supplementary Materials.
Page 8
32. Lines 7-19: how much the results of this analysis can be affected by a different
threshold choice? I would suggest the authors to repeat the analysis with at
least 2 alternative thresholds. Alternatively, they can use a GLM with
multinomial response variable. In any case, this choice needs more explanation
and discussion;
- We have repeated the analysis as requested with three thresholds; 100,
1000, and 10,000 and included the ROC values (Table S2) and predicted
probabilities for herd size and farm type in the supplementary material
(Figures S5-7). We have added text explaining this in the methods at lines
183-185.
- The threshold of 10,000 was used for the main body of the paper as it had
the highest ROC values for ICCs, OCCs and both contact chains. We defined
by number of farms rather than a percentile as this encompassed very
different numbers of farms for ICCs and OCCs, due to the differences in
distribution between ICCs and OCCs. On balance, we felt it was easier to
interpret with clear farm numbers than proportions.
33. Line 12: I would suggest to show a map with the England’s regions in the
supplementary material, since they are using this information;
- As suggested, we have added a map into the supplementary materials as
Figure S10 and referred to at line 188.
Results
Page 8
34. Could be interested to report the number of isolated farms every year, if they
change or not.
- We have added this at Lines 210-217.
35. Line 55: what does “batched movements” mean?
- We have removed this term here but clarified at lines 118 and again at 219-
221.
Page 9
36. Line 33/Figure S5: should the bars be vertical on this figure? Otherwise the
necessitate a better explanation;
- We have completely reformatted the figure (now Figure S4).
Page 10
37. Lines 4-20: this paragraph is very confusing. Please rephrase;
- Text rephrased as advised.
38. Line 36: quantify “few”;
- Clarified at line 270.
Page 11
39. Lines 48-50: I could not find the ROC curve;
- Added in as Figure S7.
Discussion
Page 12
40. Lines 15-17: quantify “few” and “very many”;
- Clarified at line 318.
41. Lines 31-41: as described, these result seem trivial;
- We have reduced this to a brief mention at Line 332.
Page 13
42. Lines 12-21: this paragraph looks disconnected, please rephrase;
- Rephrased and relocated to line 346.
43. Lines 23-25: add citation, and maybe fully test the power-law distribution on the
degree centrality (see Clauset, Shalizi, Newman, 2009, SIAM Review paper);
- We have added this citation and referred to the definition in the new Table
S1. We calculated the power law for overall degree centrality (Table S4). We
compared a power-law model for the distribution to a log-normal model,
though there is no evidence that either fitted better (Table S4 legend).
Page 14
44. Lines 27-33: instead of “widespread” it could be more precise to talk about the
different spatial scales at which other types of contacts might be important, and
for which kind of infections;
- We have added text and clarified at lines 393-400.
Conclusion
Page 14
45. Lines 39-56: this paragraph should be included in the Introduction.
- We have moved this to the Introduction.

In general, the abstract needs a bit more explanation on the background and the significance of the
paper (as an example, one important result to me is that even after excluding markets, some farms
act as “hubs” anyway).
Second, I would also suggest to fix the syntax of some sentences, to improve the readability and the
flow of the manuscript (example: lines 19-20 or 84-85, but throughout the text).
We have rephrased several sentences in the abstract.
Changed lines 84-85 (now at lines 89-90).
Minor changes to improve readability throughout.
Other minor comments below.
Line 36: “pathogens”?
Changed ‘infections’ to ‘pathogens’ as requested (line 42).
Line 42: influence on what?
Streamlined text (line 44).
Lines 98-107: this paragraph is already explaining some methods, maybe it needs a better
collocation
We have looked at this (lines 102-109) and consider that the text is appropriate to an Introduction
and stops well short of an account of the Methods.
Lines 160-170: I might have intuitively understood what you did exactly to address the “border
effect”, but this part is not clear. Please, rephrase.
Added text for clarification (line 170-175).
Line 182: “and” is bold
Corrected (line 180)
Line 386: in my understanding the ones cited here are not “transmission models” but rather
algorithms to calculate the contact chains
Corrected (line 390)
Line 419: the method is at least 10 years old (first Dube’ paper was published in 2008)
Corrected (line 423)
