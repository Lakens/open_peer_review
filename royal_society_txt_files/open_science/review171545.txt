Summary
Laercio et al. focus on examining the dissimilarity among different scientific disciplines and how
they have evolved over time using expert, citation-based and language-based methods. In
particular, the authors provide an interesting language-based method and find that there is
lexical similarity amongst fields that is not being captured by an expert classification system
(OECD).
Use of full text articles instead of abstracts would have been desirable to capture more linguistic
diversity. It would also be interesting to have seen more advanced linguistic techniques to show
if information such as word order plays an important role in this task. Some references need to be
fixed (details given in comments). Overall, this is an interesting paper and would prove useful to
communities such as Bibliometrics and Scientometrics (e.g. tasks such as finding innovation in
science).
General Comments
- In the abstract ~L35 you reference "pairs". Unclear to the reader exactly what you're pairing yet
so would be helpful to be more specific (e.g. "pairs of disciplines").
- Using additional information such as bigrams may help distinguish fields better
i.e., word order may be important.
- The use of abstracts is understandable, but including the full texts. would have been more
convincing. A paper of interest to the authors may be:
McKeown et al. 2016, "Predicting the impact of scientific concepts using full-text features".
McKeown et al. also used the Web of Science database but found that using full text was more
beneficial than only abstracts for tracking concepts over time. They also use a more complicated
language analysis that may prove helpful in future work.
- It would be nice to see a table with some words that highlight your findings. For example, what
are the most common tokens bringing fields together?
- In Figure 4, why was Psychology used for the boxplot instead of one of the fields used in the
caption of the left panel? (was this choice arbitrary?)

I suggest the following revisions:
- State that only articles in the English language were analysed, and therefore Natural Language
tools for English were used.
- Clarify statement on page 4, line 52: the authors say that the language dissimilarity measure
does not require training corpora, but for every word in an article title/abstract the method
requires to know which field it belongs to.
- Page 5, line 29: Agricolture does not appear in Figure 1.
- Table 1: please comment on the fact that the correlation coefficients for both the first and the
second half are higher than the coefficient for all years.
- Explain lines 19-24 on page 6 in a clearer way.
- Page 8, lines 9 and 10: “Humanities” should be “Arts and Humanities”.
- Explain why the authors focussed on the discipline Physical Sciences on page 8, line 53.
- Explain lines 20-28 on page 11 in a clearer way.
- Clarify whether the two texts should or should not have words in common (page 11 lines 46-47).

OK, we now clarify that these are pairs of disciplines.

We agree that bigrams or higher-order n-grams can provide much more specific information about
science. Our methodology directly applies to this case and we hope our paper will motivate future
applications of our methods using n-grams. However, in practical terms the usage of bigrams would
imply a reduced temporal resolution and a fewer number of disciplines we could use. The reason is that
the larger number of low-frequency bigrams imply that larger corpora have to be used in order to
achieve statistically reliable results.

Thank you for pointing out this interesting reference, we included a citation to it in our manuscript. We
agree that a full text analysis would be preferential, but unfortunately the full-texts for Web Of Science,
and its unique range of disciplines, journals, and years, are not available. We believe it is a strength of
our manuscript that the methods we introduce can be directly applied to full text.
> - It would be nice to see a table with some words that highlight your findings.
> For example, what are the most common tokens bringing fields together?
Thank you for this suggestion, we included this information in Table 2 of our new manuscript, together
with a description of its content in the text.

> of the left panel? (was this choice arbitrary?)
We chose Psychology because it is the discipline that is departing most from the other disciplines in the
1991-2014 period we investigated. We included this information in our manuscript to clarify this point.

We agree with the referee that the reference to training corpora is misleading, we decided to remove it
from our manuscript.

Thank you for this correction, what we meant was "the disciplines inside Agriculture domain". We
corrected it in the text.

This is an interesting observation. At this stage we can only speculate that in more restricted sets of
papers the different dimensions are more similar than when more papers are included. Further studies
are needed to clarify whether this holds in general.
> - Explain lines 19-24 on page 6 in a clearer way.
We reformulated the text to increase clarity, thanks for pointing that out.

The OECD classification uses "Humanities" as the name of this domain, we stick to this notation for
consistency.

This is an arbitrary choice used as for illustration purposes. The statistics for all pairs is summarized in
panel (b) of Fig. 4.

We reformulated and expanded the text to increase clarity, thanks for pointing that out.

Our method works also when the texts have no words in common. In fact, in this case the numerator of
(5.3) is equal to the denominator and the normalized divergence is 1. We clarified this in the text.
