label_comment_1
The manuscript describes synthesis of Hantzsch-type 1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives containing
thiophene moiety via multicomponent reaction. The reaction is not a new one, but the authors
have found an effective catalyst which enables to conduct the reaction under solvent-free
conditions at room temperature in good yields in a short time period. Full and clear data for each
compound is provided in supporting materials.
In my opinion the paper has the next disadvantages and mistakes:
1) Too many spelling and grammar mistakes! Please, check the text!
2) The term «heat free conditions» is not widely used in organic chemistry (I have not found any
paper dealing with it). I think you should just use «at room temperature».
3) «Cerric ammonium nitrate» should have 1 “r” in the word «Ceric».
4) Synthetic procedures in supporting materials describe usage of 0.5mol of CAN instead of
0.5mmol promised in the paper. Which information should be trusted?
5) Section Materials and Methods 3.1: «compounds were characterized anchored in ESI-MS
spectra» but in the supporting materials just EI-MS spectra are described.
6) Compound 5a is not a novel one. It was described in 10.1016/j.tet.2008.04.040. The authors
should cite that paper.
7) Section Materials and Methods 3.2: It is not clear what is monitored by TLC: did you monitor
the reaction progress or the purity of the product?
8) dimEdone
9) Check all the citations, please. They don’t correspond the text.
10) The introduction is not clear. The citations are inadequate. In my opinion the introduction
should be revised. [1] should cite the original paper by Hantzsch.

2. Introduction
39
More than a hundred years ago Hantzsch reaction was reported by Arthur Hantzsch to produced 1,4-dihydro
40
41 pyridine (1,4-DHP) [1]. These are important precursor due to their pharmacological and biological activities,
42 such as antihypertensive, antianginal and cardiovascular disease as calcium channel blockers. According to that
43
44 several clinically important drugs acquired the market in all over the globe with variable new active functional
45 groups in the main skeleton like Nicardipine, Nifedipine, Nimodipine, Felodipine, Isradipine and Amylodipine
46
[2-5]. Recently it is found that number of various attempt were taken up to improve the Hantzsch reaction, using
47
48 different alternative processes [6-9]. However, most of these reactions were reported with new trends as one-pot
49 multi-component reactions (MCRs) in last 10 to 15 years, these reactions were carried out with certain
50
51 disadvantages like: longer reaction time, expensive catalyst, higher temperature and tedious work up procedure.
52 Great diversity in MCRS [10-12] was developed with using various ionic liquids as catalyst with several
53 advantages have been well documented [13-15]. Clinical significance of pyran, thiophene derivatives of 3-
54
55 acetylcoumarine based on 1,4-DHPs is concern it was reported as equivalent cytotoxic effect as the standard
56 CHS 828 against a breast cancer cell line[16]

18 3.1. General
19
20
21 All reagents used in this study were purchased from commercially available sources without further
22 purification, unless specified otherwise. The synthesized compounds were characterized anchored in ESI-MS
23
24 spectra were performed by Shimadzu Gcms-Qp 2010 spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed in a
25 Perkin-Elmer 2400 Series-II elemental analyzers and the results were within ±0.4% of the theoretical values,
26
27 unless otherwise noted. The stereo chemistry and structure of all compounds were confirmed by 1H NMR
28 spectra were recorded on a Bruker Advance III (1H: 400 MHz) spectrometer, with CDCl3 as internal standard;
29 13
30 C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Advance III (13C:100 MHz) spectrometer with CDCl3 as internal
31 standard. Splitting patterns are described as singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), quartet (q), and broad (br); the
32
33 value of chemical shifts (d) are given in ppm and coupling constants (J) in hertz (Hz). IR spectra were recorded
34 on a ABB MB 3000 spectrophotometer. Melting points were determined in open capillary tubes and are
35
uncorrected. All the reactions were monitored by silica gel 60 F254 (Merck) coated TLC plates. Reported Rf
36
37 values corresponds to elution with 4:1 (n-hexane: ethyl acetate) mobile phase. Single crystal X-ray data were
38
collected on Rigaku SCX mini diffractometer by graphite monochromatic Mo-Ka radiation.
39
40
41 3.2. Synthesis of 1,4-DHPS (5a-5c & 5g)
42 5-bromothiophene-2-carboxyaldehyde (1.91g, 0.01 mole), ammonium acetate (0.77g, 0.01mole), different 1,3-
43
44 dione (1-2.5g, 0.01/0.02mole) and CAN (0.28g, 0.5mmole) were added to 100ml Round bottom flask. The
45 mixture was stirred well within 1-2.5 hrs at room temperature, then product fall out and mixture became
46
47 solid. (Monitored by TLC) Wash the product with water and then treated with N-hexane to remove
48 impurities, after drying the crude brown/yellow product was recrystallized by ethanol followed by charcoal
49
50 treatment.

10 5-bromothiophene-2-carboxyaldehyde (1.91 g, 0.01 moles), ammonium acetate (0.77 g, 0.01 moles),
11 acetylacetone (1 ml, 0.01 moles), ethyl acetoacetate (1.3 ml, 0.01 moles) and CAN (0.28 g, 0.5 mmoles) were
12
13 added to 100 ml Round bottom flask. The mixture was stirred well for 3 hrs at room temperature, then product
14 fall out and mixture became solid. We got three possible products 5b, 5c and 5e (Monitored by TLC). Rf value
15 for 5b, 5c and 5e are 0.59, 0.19 and 0.40 respectively. Moreover, in 5f we used methyl acetoacetate (1.1ml, 0.01
16
17 mole)instead of ethyl acetoacetate and got mixture of possible product 5a, 5c and 5f (Monitored by TLC). Rf
18 value for 5a, 5c and 5f are 0.56, 0.20 and 0.46 respectively. 5e and 5f compounds were separated and purified
19
by column chromatography with using n-hexane: ethyl acetoacetate (4:1) mobile phase.
20
21 The antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds (5a-5f) has been evaluated by Broth Dilution
22 Method. The synthesized compounds have been tested for their Antibacterial activity against gram-negative
23
24 bacteria (E. coli MTCC 443, Salmonella typhi MTCC 98) and gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis MTCC
25 441, Streptococcus pneumonia MTCC 1936). Ampiciline were used as standard against bacteria. All compounds
26
(5a-5f) were screened for Antifungal activity against Candida albicans MTCC 227, Aspergillus niger, MTCC
27
28 282 and A.Clavatus MTCC 1323 at a concentration of 500 !g/mL in DMF. Nutrient agar and potato dextrose
29 agars were used to culture the bacteria and fungi, respectively. The plates were inculcated by the bacteria or
30
31 fungi and incubated for 24 h at 37 0C for bacteria and for 72 h at 27 0C for fungi and then the inhibition zones of
32 microbial growth surrounding the filter paper disc (5mm) were measured in millimetres. Graseofulvin was used
33
as standard drug for fungi. Test results are shown in (Table 2) and (Table 3) for antibacterial, antifungal activity
34
35 respectively.

39 4. Results & Discussion
40
41 We prepared number of 1,4-DHPS via multicomponent reactions. According to literature survey for the
42
43 development of synthetic procedures [17-20], mainly catalyst can play an important role in the synthesis of 1,4-
44 DHPS [21-24]. Therefore, we selected CAN catalyst to investigate their effect on product yield under solvent
45
and heat free conditions at room temperature (Table 1). Under these optimized reaction conditions, the simplicity
46
47 and scope of novel one-pot MCRS protocol was explored.
48 The reaction of 5BT-2C 1, ammonium acetate 4 as same starting materials and different 1,3-diones 2,3 was
49
50 performed in presence of CAN under solvent and heat free conditions to obtained desired 1,4-DHPS derivatives
51 with good to excellent yield. Interestingly we received the desired symmetrical products 5a, 5b, 5c and 5g by
52 using same 1,3-diones 2 or 3. If we used as different 1,3-diones 2,3 then we get desired asymmetrical products
53
54 5d, 5e, 5f including symmetrical products 5a, 5b, 5c, 5f. We obtained 5d product in pure form, by dissolving the
55 crude material in (1:4) mixture of ethyl acetoacetate and n-hexane was filtered to separate the undissolved crude,
56
which is obtained in very low amount. The remaining crude may be mixture of the products 5a, 5b (monitored
57
58 by TLC). In the remaining filtrate we got hazy crystals of product 5d (after fifteen to twenty minutes).

The reaction of 5BT-2C 1, ammonium acetate 4 as same starting materials and different 1,3-diones 2,3 was
1 performed in presence of CAN under solvent and heat free conditions to obtained desired 1,4-DHPS derivatives
2 with good to excellent yield. The reaction of 5BT-2C 1, ammonium acetate 4 as same starting materials and
3
4 different 1,3-diones 2,3 was performed in presence of CAN under solvent and heat free conditions to obtained
5 desired 1,4-DHPS derivatives with good to excellent yield. Interestingly we received the desired symmetrical
6
products 5a, 5b, 5c and 5g by using same 1,3-diones 2 or 3. If we used as different 1,3-diones 2,3 then we get
7
8 desired asymmetrical products 5d, 5e, 5f including symmetrical products 5a, 5b, 5c, 5f. We obtained 5d product
9 in pure form, by dissolving the crude material in (1:4) mixture of ethyl acetoacetate and n-hexane was filtered to
10
11 separate the undissolved crude, which is obtained in very low amount.The remaining crude may be mixture of
12 the products 5a, 5b (monitored by TLC). In the remaining filtrate we got hazy crystals of product 5d (after
13
fifteen to twenty minutes). However, we hypothesized properly pre-functionalized 1,3-dione 2, 3 and 5BT-2C. In
14
15 these series 5BT-2C containing electron withdrawing group as –Br, which increase the reactive of aldehyde to
16 make C-C bond formation with 1,3-dione and due to the presence of mild to moderate activating group in 1,3-
17
18 dione makes more nucleophilicity of methylene group of it to interact with 5BT-2C, as well as it makes carbonyl
19 groups more susceptibility to formed C-N bond formation by the interaction with ammonium acetate. A series of
20 smoothly controlled experiments clearly indicates that the 5BT-2C, ammonium acetate, 1,3-diones and cerric
21
22 ammonium nitrate were all necessary substrate for this transformation as mentioned in (Scheme 1).
23 1
H-NMR data show signal in range of 5.1-5.3 d, which confirms one proton present at ipso position on
24
aliphatic carbon. Singlet observe at 1-3 d, which confirm the presence of two similar methyl groups on meta
25
26 position in 1,4-dihydropyridine ring and also got signal’s for methyl and ethyl groups of esters at desired
27 position. The signals doublet of doublet or doublet appears at 6.0-7.0 d which confirmed the presence of
28
29 aromatic protons.13C-APT spectra shows pick in range of 13-20 d confirms presence of methyl groups. Signals
30 at 34-35 d confirms the presence of aliphatic –CH group, whereas carbon in pyridine ring at double bond gave
31
100-110 d. Signals at 120-130 d indicates aromatic –CH groups and signals at 165-170 d value confirms the
32
33 presence of carbonyl groups. In IR data, we got peak near 3340 cm-1 which is for N-H stretching; peak around
34 3000 cm-1 for tertiary -C-H stretching, whereas peaks appears between 1700-1600 cm-1 indicates the –C=O
35
36 stretching. A peak appears between 1350-1300 cm-1 indicates aromatic olefin stretching. Peak appears near 1200
37 cm-1 provides the proof of –C-H stretching of methyl group. Peak appears at 510 cm-1indicates –C-X (C-Br)
38
stretching and some peaks observed between 1000-700 cm-1 confirmed the aromatic ortho- and para- di-
39
40 substituents. In mass spectral analysis, we got peaks at particular mass of compound, which confirmed the
41 present skeleton in the moiety and we got different base peaks at m/z= 332, 318, 265, 230, 145, 57 and 45, these
42
43 m/z values are the major base peaks in all compounds.
44 All the synthesis Compounds 5(a-f) was screened for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative
45
bacteria and results were compared with the Ampicilline as standard drug. Compound 5c was found highly
46
47 active and compounds 5a and 5d showed equipotent activity against the E. coli compared to the standard.
48
Compound 5f showed equipotent activity with S. typhi. Interesting finding of our work is to have excellent
49
50 antibacterial activity of 5b, 5C, 5d, 5e and 5f compounds against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtillus
51 compared with the standard drug, whereas compounds 5a and 5c showed equipotent activity. Similarly, the
52
53 compounds 5(a-f) was screened for antifungal activity with C. albicans and A. niger as microorganism, obtained
54 results was compared with graseofulvin as standard drug shown in (Table 3). It was found that, compound 5e
55
56 showed higher activity than standard. Whereas, compounds 5b and 5f had equipotent activity with the
57 standard, and the compounds 5a, 5c and 5d had low activity.
58
59 The cyto-toxicity of all synthesize compounds were checked against Breast tumor cell lines (BT-549) but
60 we do not receive good activity, which is shown in (Table 5). The compounds 5a was confirmed by a single

5. Conclusion
11
12 In outline, we have confirmed a well-organized solvent-free Green procedure for the Multi component
13
synthesis of dihydropyridine derivatives using CAN catalyst. The result highlighted the solvent-, and heat-free
14
15 procedure as more efficient than the conventional method. The advantages of Hantzsch pyridine synthesis is
16 such as shorter reaction times, simplicity of the reaction, good product yield and the easy workout procedures
17
18 concerned in the reaction build up the economical and easy available CAN a powerful catalyst for the many
19 organic synthesis. Interesting finding of our work is too obtained excellent antibacterial activity such as
20
compounds 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e and 5f was found highly active against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtillus
21
22 compared with the standard drug as Ampiciline, whereas compounds 5a and 5c showed equipotent activity.
23 Antifungal activity is concern, only compound 5e showed higher activity than standard graseofulvin drug and
24
25 compounds 5b and 5f had equipotent activity. The cyto-toxicity of all the compounds has been assessed against
26 Breast tumour cell lines (BT-549) but no activity was found

20 You are welcome to submit your paper to the journal for consideration; however, please note that
21 papers transferred to Royal Society Open Science from Chemical Science are nevertheless reviewed as
22 new papers. Furthermore, you can find more details of our collaboration with the Royal Society of
23 Chemistry athttp://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/chemistry.

14 TITLE: Multi component admittance to thiophene encouraged by the CAN systems under solvent free
15 condition for overview of Hantzsch pyridine synthesis
16
17 Thank you for your recent submission to Chemical Science, published by the Royal Society of Chemistry. All
manuscripts are initially assessed by a team of professional editors who have a wide range of backgrounds
18 from across the chemical sciences.
19
20 After careful evaluation of your manuscript and consultation with the editorial team, I regret to inform you
that I do not find your manuscript suitable for publication in Chemical Science because it does not meet the
21 very high significance and general interest standards required for publication in Chemical Science. Therefore
22 your article has been rejected from Chemical Science. Unfortunately we feel that as the Hantzch synthesis is
23 so well precedented, a study further expanding the scope of this reaction would not be of exceptional
24 interest to our broad readership and would be better suited to a more specialised audience.
25 Work published in Chemical Science is of high general interest and suitability. Work which is sound and of
26 interest to those is a specific field is more suitable for publication elsewhere.
27
Full details of the initial assessment process can be found at:
28
http://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/journal-authors-reviewers/processes-policies/#submissions
29
30 Please note that Chemical Science accepts <10% of submitted manuscripts.
31
However, I strongly encourage you to submit your manuscript to the Royal Society journal Royal Society
32 Open Science, as I believe it will be a more suitable journal for your manuscript. The chemistry section of
33 Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal Society of Chemistry, and we are
34 responsible for all aspects of the peer-review for articles submitted in chemistry. Royal Society Open
35 Science is a fast, open access journal publishing high quality research across all of science, engineering and
mathematics.
36
37 Royal Society Open Science offers:
38 • objective peer review: any judgement of potential impact is left to the reader
• (optional) open peer review: referees sign their reports, and we publish those reports along with author
39 responses
40 • open data: authors are required to make available all supporting data through supplementary information
41 or through deposition in a publicly-available repository
42 • article-level metrics and post-publication comments
• free Open Access publishing, as Article Processing Charges are currently being waived.

44 For more information, please see http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/information-authors or e-
45 mail chemistryopenscience-rsc@rsc.org.
46 If you would like to submit your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science, simply upload your files at
47 http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos. Please mention in your covering letter that the manuscript was
48 previously submitted to Chemical Science and that I encouraged you to submit to Royal Society Open
49 Science.
50 I am sorry not to have better news for you, however, thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider
51 your manuscript. I wish you every success with publication in Royal Society Open Science.
52
Yours sincerely,

Enclose please find herewith revised Manuscript entitled “Green approach for
thesis of bioactive Hantzsch 1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives based on thiophene
iety via multicomponent reaction” by Sharma MG1, RajaniDP2, Patel HM1* for the
lication in your esteemed Journal royal society open science for year 2017. We
rected whole manuscript as per reviewer’s suggetion. The present work is not sent
where for the publication and is the original work.
dly consider our Manuscript for further process for publication and do the needful in the
tter and oblige,

ponse to Reviewer: 1
Too many spelling and grammar mistakes! Please, check the text!
Sir, we checked the manuscript and correct the text as per suggestion given and
ere required.
The term «heat free conditions» is not widely used in organic chemistry (I have
t found any paper dealing with it). I think you should just use «at room
mperature».
We replaced the word heat free condition with room temperature
«Cerric ammonium nitrate» should have 1 “r” in the word «Ceric».
We corrected the spelling of Ceric ammonium nitrate instead of Cerric
monium nitrate.
Synthetic procedures in supporting materials describe usage of 0.5mol of CAN
tead of 0.5mmol promised in the paper. Which information should be trusted?
We used 5% of catalyst ceric ammonium nitrate i.e 05mmol. We checked in
nuscript and corrected to 0.5 mmol.
Section Materials and Methods 3.1: «compounds were characterized anchored in
-MS spectra» but in the supporting materials just EI-MS spectra are described.
Corrected to EI-MS
Compound 5a is not a novel one. It was described in 10.1016/j.tet.2008.04.040.
e authors should cite that paper.
We checked the paper and found that the compound 5a was reported but the
gle crystal was not developed and as per your suggestions we cite this article in
r manuscript with the reference-10.
Section Materials and Methods 3.2: It is not clear what is monitored by TLC: did
u monitor the reaction progress or the purity of the product?
We monitored the progress of reaction with the help of TLC. For which we
ded small note in the manuscript below the section 3.2 Materials & methods.
dimedone
We corrected the errors.
Check all the citations, please. They don’t correspond the text.
As per our knowledge and your suggestions, we change some of the
erences likewise: [1] [10].
The introduction is not clear. The citations are inadequate. In my opinion the
roduction should be revised. [1] Should cite the original paper by Hantzsch.
cite the Original paper of hantzsch as reference [1].
ponse to Reviewer: 2
mments to the Author(s)
he work seems to be good but the level of English is not good enough.
he Language portions must be revised and rewritten wherever mentioned or
t mentioned.
As per the reviewer’s comments, we tried to improve the language portions in
ole manuscript. We also rewrite the some of the sentences wherever we found
stake and as per given suggestions.
