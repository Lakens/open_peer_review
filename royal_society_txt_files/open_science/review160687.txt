Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
This is in principle very interesting and sound study based on great material, but in my meaning,
there are some fundamental interpretational and analytical unclarities that would need to be
straightened out before the conclusions firmly support the data. I believe that the data might
actually support interpretations, but this is not clear before one sees results of some critical
comparisons missing from the mansucript. I also have few other suggestions how the manuscript
could be improved. In fact, I believe there is much more potential in this manuscript (or data) that
has been currently utilized.
Comments and suggestions follow in the order they surfaced when reading the ms.
L32. The rationale for common garden experiment is unclear: what exactly will the knowledge of
heritability do here? This needs to be explained. As I write below, I do not think heritabilities are
of much utility here: the means from common garden study are.
L35-36. This is an interesting proposition, but the “spatial sorting” is quite a complicated
explanation and hard to test. It is also unclear whether it is actually mutually exclusive of natural
selection as written here. At any rate, I believe you would have data to test the hypothesis of
selection, and if the two hypotheses are mutually exclusive (which you need to clarify), you may
be in position to differentiate in between the two (see below).
L38-40. Unfortunately, heritability itself does not say anything about genetic basis of the observed
differences between populations/locations. What you need to do is to compare the mean relative
limb lengths among common garden reared and wild caught toads. Heritability will be helpful in
other ways (in QST-FST analyses; see below).
L40-41. Because of the previous, this conclusion is not supported: you still need to show that the
observed shift is actually genetically based: that is, the population means in the common garden
are significantly different, and follow the pattern observed in the wild. Moreover, there are
complications with these interepretations even with the common garden data, because common
garden experiments basically assume that the way the population respond to the “common
environment” are what could be considered “natural”. This is a general problem with all
common garden studies, so it is not critical, but one would at least need to discuss the
interpretational caveats. For instance, people often do perform common garden experiments
using different environmental treatments to mimic environmental differences between the source
populations, and find that the results differ depending on what environments and population are
compared. A good example of this kind of results where relative limb lengths of amphibian have
been studied is given in Alho et al 2011 (Allen’s rule revisited: quantitative genetics of extremity
length in the common frog along a latitudinal gradient. J Evol Biol 24: 59-70), which reports
analysis of population differentiation and heritability in multiple populations of frogs. Alho et al
study is very relevant for your paper, but you seem to be unaware of it (not cited in your
manuscript).
L49. What about genetic drift and plastic changes?
L55. This is an interesting claim, but the reader would like to know logic behind this. At least, a
reference to back up this claim is needed.
L61. “genes” – I believe you mean alleles. Unless you are suggesting that new genes pop up at
invasion front or are lost in old populations.
L62-63. So, this would mean assortative mating. Assortative mating has consequences for genetics
of traits, and estimation genetic parameters depending on the study design. Might be worth
thinking and looking up.
L88. “We gathered” gives impression that the data was gathered for the purpose of this very
study. Would more honest expression to be one using expressions like “utilized data from…”?
3
L113. What about Alho et al 2011 mentioned above? Probably the most comprehensive
investigation of this topic so far.
L115-116. Heritability does not tell one anything about the population differentiation: this
statement is simply not very sensible. Two populations may have zero heritability for a trait, but
still be genetically differentiated in that trait (e.g. they are fixed for different alleles coding the
trait). Heritability is interesting, but what is of interest for your study, are the population means
from the common garden data. On the same vein, I strongly recommend doing QST-FST type of
analyses of your data (as in Alho et al 2011): this would allow you to formally test if the levels of
observed differentiation exceed drift expectations, and thereby give firm support for adaptive
differentiation in traits of interest. Hence, instead of focusing on heritability, it would be more
relevant to focus on QST.
L129-130. It would nice to see repeatability estimates for the measurements.
L132. Bit more info would be helpful here. Were all individuals from full-sib families? How many
families and individuals per family there were at the end of the experiment?
L158-160. Was this done after log-transformation? Perhaps it would be good to clarify here how
log-transformation influences interpretations?
L162. I was wondering why you opted to use animal model if the “pedigree” was unrelated full-
sib families? If the pedigree was more complex, this is not clear from the manuscript. It is ok to
use animal model, but simple linear model would yield basically similar results – one gains little
from animal model unless the parents were related to varying degrees, and these relationships
were known.
In the same vein, I seem to understand you estimated the heritability by pooling observations of
the individuals from different time points. Unless you included the age of the individuals as a
covariate to correct for age depedent variation, I wonder if not the heritability (and repeatability)
estimates are much deflated because of the extra variance coming from the ontogeny? I think for
your purposes, the meaningful estimate would be perhaps the sizes at adulthood/sexual
maturity? Heritability analyses assume that the same trait is being measured on all subjects, but
pooling measurements from different ages without controlling for age differences violates this
assumption. Different genes might influence the trait in different stages of ontogeny, for instance.
L176. It is not possible to see from table 1 which populations differed.
L178. It is difficult to see from figure that there is a curvilinear pattern.
L202. See above – this not how one can interpret heritability.
L220-227. The spatial sorting idea is interesting, but pretty difficult to get ones head around with.
Could your observations not be explained equally parsimoniously by environmental effects:
individuals at the dispersal front face less competition, and this leads to plastic changes in
leg/arm-length? No adaptive explanation would be needed?
L257-259. I am afraid that I disagree with “strongly support”. To me, the analyses as presented
now do not provide strong support evolutionary basis of the observed population differences.
Showing that the common garden means follow the patterns in the wild, and that the differences
among means exceed drift expectation would provide the strong support.
Finally, the discussion would benefit of discussion about genetic analyses and their assumptions.
Table 1 and 2. These tables would need some refinements. “State” should be explained in header,
degrees of freedom and means squares (also error) should be reported to make the tables
interpretable. Were there no covariates in the models? Such as time of the collection, age of the
individuals etc? I also wonder if were not possible to construct a model which basically combines
the analyses presented in the two Tables: basically data in Table 2 is a subset of data in Table 1,
and TSC is pretty much the same thing as “State” coded differently.
Table 3. Short hand for heritability is usually given with lowercase “h”.
Fig. 1. Please provide some measure of dispersion for dimorphism indices.
Anyhow, I like the paper and ideas, and believe you can address all the issues above with a
careful revision. My apologies if have misunderstood something!

This is a fine study that explores toad morphology (in casu limb lengths) in terms of sexual
selection and dispersal regime. The data set is large and well-analyzed. The results are not over-
interpreted. I have only minor remarks that may help to further clarify the presentation.
Line 71 - I read this sentence several times and I am still not sure that I get the intended meaning.
Please rephrase.
Line 126 – Snout-vent length, is this the same as the (in toads) more regularly measured Snout-
Urostyl length ?
Figure 1 – explain HI, QLD etc. codes. It took me a while to realize that the localities are ordered
according to TSC. Consider adding an arrow indicating direction and/or scaling the horizontal
axis as to reflect TSC. This would help overall understanding and the visual interpretation of
relationships being linear or curvilinear.
Line 201 – change parentheses for square brackets.

Your paper has been reviewed contrastingly by two experts. The first reviewer has made a
thorough review with a lot of suggestions and was in two minds whether to reject the paper.
Thus the criticisms are substantial and should be addressed as fully as possible. I would expect to
send your revision to the same reviewer.

I am happy to see that the ms is now in my mind much improved after the revisions. I am
basically fine with the current version, but in case the authors want to make the story even more
solid, I can make the following point. This the comparison of common garden and wild data. To
me, it looks like the evidence for genetic basis for patterns in the wild comes now from the
argument that the patterns are similar in the two separately analysed data sets (wild vs common
garden) as pictured in Fig. 2. The statistical analyses for these datasets are done separately (tables
2 and 3). Formally speaking, the statistical evidence for the similarity is lacking (although the
patterns in Fig. 2 are convincing). I guess the the remedy for this would be to run a model where
the two data sets are analysed together and having the data source
(wild vs lab) as an additional factor. I understand that this might require some
modifications/averaging to common garden data as the two datasets have slightly different
structures (no family information in wild data). As said, I am not insisting that this required.

Minor comment:
Table 1. Perhaps 2 decimals for MS- and F-values would be enough? In Table 2, F-values could be

Comments to the Author(s)
I am happy to see that the ms is now in my mind much improved after the revisions. I am
basically fine with the current version, but in case the authors want to make the story even more
solid, I can make the following point. This the comparison of common garden and wild data. To
me, it looks like the evidence for genetic basis for patterns in the wild comes now from the
argument that the patterns are similar in the two separately analysed data sets (wild vs common
garden) as pictured in Fig. 2. The statistical analyses for these datasets are done separately (tables
2 and 3). Formally speaking, the statistical evidence for the similarity is lacking (although the
patterns in Fig. 2 are convincing). I guess the the remedy for this would be to run a model where
the two data sets are analysed together and having the data source
(wild vs lab) as an additional factor. I understand that this might require some
modifications/averaging to common garden data as the two datasets have slightly different
structures (no family information in wild data). As said, I am not insisting that this required.
Minor comment:
Table 1. Perhaps 2 decimals for MS- and F-values would be enough? In Table 2, F-values could be
given (for sake consistency) to 2-decimal accuracy and significance levels indicated with *,**,***,°?

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-160687.R1)
The authors would like to thank the reviewer for their helpful comments, we feel that the overall
quality of the manuscript has been much improved following their recommendations.
As per your suggestion, we have included a new analysis (now presented in Table 4) combining
data from wild-caught and common-garden toads in a multiple regression. The model included
full factorial interactions among Sex, State (WA vs QLD) and Source (Wild vs Common-garden)
with SVL as a covariate.
A description of this has been added to the methods (lines 183-189), results (lines 224-233), and
the discussion (lines 313-321).
We have also rounded the MS- and F-values in the tables for consistency.

hors’ Responses to Referee Comments
nuscript ID RSOS-160687 (Hudson et al.) entitled: “It’s lonely at the front: contrasting
lutionary trajectories in male and female invaders”
elow, we have pasted the reviews in their entirety, plus our comments (following asterisks
.
iewer 1:
. The rationale for common garden experiment is unclear: what exactly will the knowledge of
itability do here? This needs to be explained. As I write below, I do not think heritabilities are
much utility here: the means from common garden study are.
We thank the reviewer for his advice on the significance of heritability estimates in this
ation, and we agree that his interpretation is correct. In the previous version we had placed
ue emphasis on demonstrating heritability of the geographically-divergent traits. We accept
reviewer’s point that in fact, differences in mean trait values among common-garden progeny
m different populations, in accord with the patterns seen in wild-caught toads, is stronger
dence of an evolved response. In response to this issue, we have now added an analysis on
mean values from the common garden study. For the most part they precisely mirror
orphism patterns seen in the wild toads. We've clarified that our estimates of heritability are
y included to indicate that limb lengths are able to respond to selection. We have clarified that
urther explore whether or not selection on these traits has occurred, a Qst-Fst analysis would
valuable (but is not possible with our currently available data).
-36. This is an interesting proposition, but the “spatial sorting” is quite a complicated
lanation and hard to test. It is also unclear whether it is actually mutually exclusive of
ural selection as written here. At any rate, I believe you would have data to test the
othesis of selection, and if the two hypotheses are mutually exclusive (which you need to
rify), you may be in position to differentiate in between the two (see below).
We have discussed the relationship between spatial sorting and natural selection elsewhere
ine, R., G. P. Brown, and B. L. Phillips. 2011. An evolutionary process that assembles
notypes through space rather than time. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
A 108:5708-5711) and are reluctant to substantially expand the discussion of this topic here.
have, however, tried to clarify the distinction. Natural selection relies upon differential
ess, and results in changes in allele frequencies through time. Spatial sorting does not involve
er of these features; instead, it results in alleles with specific phenotypic effects becoming
centrated within the same individuals, within one part of the species’ range.
can't test between selection, spatial sorting and drift without gathering extensive molecular
a on the system. We do not have such data, although we hope to expand our work in this
ction in the future. In the revised manuscript, we have toned down any insinuation that we
e demonstrated selection; instead, we have demonstrated the potential for selection to act on
traits involved.
-40. Unfortunately, heritability itself does not say anything about genetic basis of the
erved differences between populations/locations. What you need to do is to compare the mean
tive limb lengths among common garden reared and wild caught toads. Heritability will be
pful in other ways (in QST-FST analyses; see below).
We thank the reviewer for pointing out this important mistake in our previous version. We
e revised this section to read that heritability suggests that "...the traits have the potential to
pond to selection" rather than "... the observed morphological shifts are due in part to
lutionary change".
-41. Because of the previous, this conclusion is not supported: you still need to show that the
erved shift is actually genetically based: that is, the population means in the common garden
significantly different, and follow the pattern observed in the wild. Moreover, there are
plications with these interpretations even with the common garden data, because common
den experiments basically assume that the way the population respond to the “common
ironment” are what could be considered “natural”. This is a general problem with all
mon garden studies, so it is not critical, but one would at least need to discuss the
rpretational caveats. For instance, people often do perform common garden experiments
ng different environmental treatments to mimic environmental differences between the source
ulations, and find that the results differ depending on what environments and population are
pared. A good example of this kind of results where relative limb lengths of amphibian have
n studied is given in Alho et al 2011 (Allen’s rule revisited: quantitative genetics of extremity
gth in the common frog along a latitudinal gradient. J Evol Biol 24: 59-70), which reports
lysis of population differentiation and heritability in multiple populations of frogs. Alho et al
dy is very relevant for your paper, but you seem to be unaware of it (not cited in your
nuscript).
hanks for bringing this very relevant study to our attention.
. What about genetic drift and plastic changes?
We now mention genetic drift in the appropriate sentence. Because our focus is on evolved
nges rather than phenotypically plastic responses, we do not mention plasticity here. There is
doubt that the novel environments encountered by invaders can elicit plastic responses, but
focus here is on the origin of novel evolutionary traits not simply phenotypic novelty..
. This is an interesting claim, but the reader would like to know logic behind this. At least, a
rence to back up this claim is needed.
Dispersal-relevant traits are likely to be under strong selection at the expanding range-edge as
er-dispersing individuals benefit from being able to escape from intraspecific competition
own, G., C. Kelehear, and R. Shine. 2013. The early toad gets the worm: cane toads at an
asion front benefit from higher prey availability. Journal of Animal Ecology 82:854-862).
h-dispersal phenotypes frequently evolve in invasive populations, and these changes are often
ected in morphological shifts. Similarly, changes in life history (i.e. longevity, timing of
roduction, fecundity) have also been observed (e.g., Hudson, C. H., B. L. Phillips, G. P.
wn, and R. Shine. 2015. Virgins in the vanguard: low reproductive frequency in invasion-
nt cane toads. Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 116:743-747). We have now
uded a citation to a recent review (Chuang and Peterson, 2015) that discusses trait evolution
ing the invasion process, and have changed “sexual behaviour” to “reproductive
racteristics”.
. “genes” – I believe you mean alleles. Unless you are suggesting that new genes pop up at
asion front or are lost in old populations.
Yes, thanks for pointing that out. We were referring to shifts in allele frequency at the
asion front, not the evolution of novel genes. The sentence has been changed.
-63. So, this would mean assortative mating. Assortative mating has consequences for
etics of traits, and estimation genetic parameters depending on the study design. Might be
th thinking and looking up.
es, we agree that spatial sorting is a form of assortative mating. We have discussed this
nomenon in our earlier paper on spatial sorting (Shine, R., G. P. Brown, and B. L. Phillips.
1. An evolutionary process that assembles phenotypes through space rather than time.
ceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 108:5708-5711).
. “We gathered” gives impression that the data was gathered for the purpose of this very
dy. Would more honest expression to be one using expressions like “utilized data from…”?
A major focus of the senior author’s PhD research (of which this study is a part) was to
ress the phenomenon of increasing leg length of cane toads during the toad’s invasion of
stralia (as originally documented by Phillips et al. 2006). The data on limb morphology
sented in this manuscript were collected specifically for this study.
3. What about Alho et al 2011 mentioned above? Probably the most comprehensive
estigation of this topic so far.
Thank you for the suggestion. The paper is indeed highly relevant, and we have added this
tion to the MS.
5-116. Heritability does not tell one anything about the population differentiation: this
ement is simply not very sensible. Two populations may have zero heritability for a trait, but
be genetically differentiated in that trait (e.g. they are fixed for different alleles coding the
t). Heritability is interesting, but what is of interest for your study, are the population means
m the common garden data. On the same vein, I strongly recommend doing QST-FST type of
lyses of your data (as in Alho et al 2011): this would allow you to formally test if the levels of
erved differentiation exceed drift expectations, and thereby give firm support for adaptive
erentiation in traits of interest. Hence, instead of focusing on heritability, it would be more
vant to focus on QST.
We regret that this sentence implied that we were using heritability to measure genetic
ergence of the traits. Rather, we meant to indicate that heritability was measured to verify that
traits had the potential to respond to selection. The goal of this study was to document
resting geographic patterns in limb length SSD and to establish that selection could be acting
the traits. We have revised the writing and interpretation throughout the ms to remove any
gestion that we measured or intended to measure genetic divergence. In future, we hope to
a molecular component to this work. We can then conduct Qst-Fst methods on these and
er morphological and behavioural traits to document genetic differentiation between
blished and invasive populations.
9-130. It would nice to see repeatability estimates for the measurements.
We have added a column to the table with these data.
2. Bit more info would be helpful here. Were all individuals from full-sib families? How
ny families and individuals per family there were at the end of the experiment?
We have expanded this section to include more information about the common garden
eriment.
8-160. Was this done after log-transformation? Perhaps it would be good to clarify here how
-transformation influences interpretations?
We had originally used log transformation to look at scaling of various morphological
asures, but for the present purposes that is not necessary. Therefore, for ease of interpretation,
ve redone all the analyses on untransformed values and used SVL as a covariate rather than
residual scores.
2. I was wondering why you opted to use animal model if the “pedigree” was unrelated full-
families? If the pedigree was more complex, this is not clear from the manuscript. It is ok to
animal model, but simple linear model would yield basically similar results – one gains little
m animal model unless the parents were related to varying degrees, and these relationships
e known.
We were more familiar with using an Animal Model. It also allowed us to incorporate parental
rphology into the analysis, which would have been more difficult (impossible?) using a
ple linear model.
he same vein, I seem to understand you estimated the heritability by pooling observations of
individuals from different time points. Unless you included the age of the individuals as a
ariate to correct for age depedent variation, I wonder if not the heritability (and repeatability)
mates are much deflated because of the extra variance coming from the ontogeny? I think for
r purposes, the meaningful estimate would be perhaps the sizes at adulthood/sexual maturity?
itability analyses assume that the same trait is being measured on all subjects, but pooling
asurements from different ages without controlling for age differences violates this
umption. Different genes might influence the trait in different stages of ontogeny, for instance.
Many of the toads had not reached sexual maturity by the end of the study. By incorporating
asures of sub-adults we can include many more individuals and obtain much more robust
mates of heritability. But we have now revised our Animal Model to incorporate SVL (as a
xy for age) to control for ontogenetic changes. Because SVL is now a fixed effect in the
del we used raw (and untransformed) trait measures as dependent variables, rather than
duals (see above).
6. It is not possible to see from table 1 which populations differed.
True. Table 1 merely indicates the level of significance of the population difference. We have
added a reference to Figure 1 (which does depict population differences) in this passage
8. It is difficult to see from figure that there is a curvilinear pattern.
In the left hand panels of Figure 1, limb lengths of males and females tend to follow a U-
ped pattern with time since colonisation. We have now connected the points with a line to
ke the pattern clearer. And we have added the 'U-shape' descriptor to the text to hopefully
ke the pattern more evident.
2. See above – this not how one can interpret heritability.
We have altered this sentence to reflect that heritability estimates indicate that traits have the
ential to respond to selection. They do not indicate that evolved changes have occurred. And,
have clarified that demonstrating that selection has differentiated the populations would
uire Qst-Fst analysis (as in the example of Alho et al).
0-227. The spatial sorting idea is interesting, but pretty difficult to get ones head around with.
uld your observations not be explained equally parsimoniously by environmental effects:
ividuals at the dispersal front face less competition, and this leads to plastic changes in
arm-length? No adaptive explanation would be needed?
he demonstration that common-garden-raised offspring show the same patterns of
rphological divergence as their parents (data now provided in the revised manuscript) show
the geographic divergence in morphology cannot simply be an environmentally-induced
ct. Whether the evolutionary process responsible for that divergence is selection, drift or
tial sorting remains unclear (and we do not have the genetic data to further test among these
rnatives); however, the strong functional consequences of limb-length variation on individual
persal rates strongly hints that drift alone is unlikely to be the main mechanism.
7-259. I am afraid that I disagree with “strongly support”. To me, the analyses as presented
do not provide strong support evolutionary basis of the observed population differences.
wing that the common garden means follow the patterns in the wild, and that the differences
ong means exceed drift expectation would provide the strong support.
We have toned down several parts of the manuscript that may imply that we have
onstrated that selection has occurred and that the populations have genetically diverged.
ead we now emphasised that because the traits have non-zero heritability, the possibility
sts that they COULD respond to selection. The revised manuscript now provides the critical
dence requested by the reviewer, to show that common garden means follow the pattern in the
d.
ally, the discussion would benefit of discussion about genetic analyses and their assumptions.
We have not included any genetic data, so have not added a discussion on these points.
le 1 and 2. These tables would need some refinements. “State” should be explained in header,
rees of freedom and means squares (also error) should be reported to make the tables
rpretable. Were there no covariates in the models? Such as time of the collection, age of the
ividuals etc? I also wonder if were not possible to construct a model which basically
bines the analyses presented in the two Tables: basically data in Table 2 is a subset of data
able 1, and TSC is pretty much the same thing as “State” coded differently.
We agree that TSC (time since colonisation) is essentially a recoded version of State. We have
oved the analysis based on State, because TSC is more pertinent to invasion than are
political boundaries. We've also included MS and MSE and dfs in the revised table. SVL
used as a covariate in the new analysis and appears in the table.
le 3. Short hand for heritability is usually given with lowercase “h”.
Thanks for pointing this out. We have changed H2 to 'heritability'.
. 1. Please provide some measure of dispersion for dimorphism indices.
We've added SEs to the dimorphism Figure. One TSC has no site replication and thus no
asure of variance.

e 71 - I read this sentence several times and I am still not sure that I get the intended meaning.
ase rephrase.
Sentence has now been edited for clarity
e 126 – Snout-vent length, is this the same as the (in toads) more regularly measured Snout-
style length ?
Snout-vent length (SVL) is a measure of the total body length of the animal, as opposed to
ut-urostyle length (SUL), which measures the length of the skull plus spinal column. Both
vide an approximation of overall body size to compare to other morphometric features. In
served specimens or on measurements of bones, SUL is more useful (less prone to error from
tissue or specimen position). For measurements on live specimens however, where the
gth measurement also includes soft tissue (i.e. joints), SVL is a better measure (in our
nion).
ure 1 – explain HI, QLD etc. codes. It took me a while to realize that the localities are
ered according to TSC. Consider adding an arrow indicating direction and/or scaling the
izontal axis as to reflect TSC. This would help overall understanding and the visual
rpretation of relationships being linear or curvilinear.
We've redone the Figure to use TSC on the X-axis in place of location names.
e 210 – change parentheses for square brackets.
Parentheses have been replaced with square brackets as suggested.
We thank both reviewers for their constructive and helpful suggestions.
