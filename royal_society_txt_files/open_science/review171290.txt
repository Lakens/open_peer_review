This paper looked at the participants to perceive changes in reflectance or illumination when
surfaces are stationary or moved. Change in illumination will cause a seen change in chroma of
specular and diffuse shading, and that a reflectance change will only bias seen diffuse shading.
The authors found inter-observer variations in absolute performance, but, imposing motion had
no relative effect on cause discrimination.
Surfaces were systematically varied in specular and diffuse contents, such as chromatic
scrambled versions. Cues to surface viewing angle were given by either painted marks (marbling)
or shape changes (bumps).
Chromaticity model based on the brightest pixels accounted for performance of the highest
performing observers.
This paper is very nice. But, I think the conclusion might be limited. The conclusion should
change to cover only limited objects made by the authors.
"We cannot rule out the possibility of any benefit of motion in colour constancy for glossy objects
- since we do not exhaustively test other variables associated with motion (speed, for example)"
Different type of macroscopic shapes is another variable that the authors do not use in their
study. This should be mentioned as a possible limitation.
Some more points. I think "Interactions between motion, texture, shape and glossiness" the author
should make clear change in reflectance object like paint splashes. Texture means bumps. That
can be said here.
"leading to distinctive orientation fields in the image that can be used to derive shape
information"
A Marlow JOV paper [2011] showes well that orientation field can explain also specular material
and painting.
Must provide some explaination about why different rotation velocity was used between visual
and vertical axis.
"reflectances changes" I am not sure this might be "reflectance changes"
"With bumpy stimuli, small regions of highlight appear and disappear as local regions of
curvature change orientation with respect to the light sources."
I do not understand. Is this for observer viewing location as well?
This sentence is quite long and should be made more than one…
"However, to observe no effect of relative motion of surfaces and the lights that illuminate them,
for all observers irrespective of their level of performance with static stimuli, and for all
conditions, implies that there are not consistent and separable effects of motion on perceptual
scission and on disruption of local chromatic discriminations."
I found that this paper should be talked about: Kim Marlow & Anderson [2014] They saw
reflectance of an object is perceived differently by the angle of the reflectance changes. The
authors should note their round mable objects are not influenced by such a problematic effect.
I found that the very good paper should be mentioned: Suchow and Alvarez [2011] Motion
silences awareness of visual change. Current Biology
For the data figure, I think the mean of participants should be also plotted.

This study shows that observers' ability of to distinguish between lighting changes and object
reflectance changes is unimpaired by the object's motion. The authors conclude that the cues that
mediate this operational colour constancy depend on high-level scene processing. The finding is
important because although some aspects of scene interpretation may be determined locally,
inferences about realistic changes in the environment are likely to involve more sophisticated
non-local processing.
The experiments have been carefully performed and the analysis is comprehensive. Potential
confounds such as range effects and inter-observer differences have been avoided or
accommodated. I have only minor comments to offer.
GENERAL
1. It might be worth adding a caveat that the present analysis does not exclude low-level
mechanisms mediating operational colour constancy in other discrimination tasks.

motion and depth can sometimes afford similar information about three-dimensional shape, can

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper looked at the participants to perceive changes in reflectance or illumination when surfaces
are stationary or moved. Change in illumination will cause a seen change in chroma of specular and
diffuse shading, and that a reflectance change will only bias seen diffuse shading. The authors found
inter-observer variations in absolute performance, but, imposing motion had no relative effect on cause
discrimination.
Surfaces were systematically varied in specular and diffuse contents, such as chromatic scrambled
versions. Cues to surface viewing angle were given by either painted marks (marbling) or shape changes
(bumps).
Chromaticity model based on the brightest pixels accounted for performance of the highest performing
observers.
This paper is very nice. But, I think the conclusion might be limited. The conclusion should change to
cover only limited objects made by the authors.
"We cannot rule out the possibility of any benefit of motion in colour constancy for glossy objects - since
we do not exhaustively test other variables associated with motion (speed, for example)"
Different type of macroscopic shapes is another variable that the authors do not use in their study. This
should be mentioned as a possible limitation.
We have modified the Conclusion section, paragraph 2, which now contains:
“We cannot rule out the possibility of any benefit of motion in colour constancy for glossy objects - since
we do not exhaustively test other variables associated with motion (speed, for example), or with object
shape (curvature and complexity, for example), which may support better colour constancy. In addition,
our stimuli were of homogeneous in spectral reflectance and were rendered under a single spectral
illuminant, rather than heterochromatic objects in complex lighting environments. A benefit of motion
might be revealed by constructing stimuli that were purposefully ambiguous in the static case.”
Some more points. I think "Interactions between motion, texture, shape and glossiness" the author
should make clear change in reflectance object like paint splashes. Texture means bumps. That can be
said here.
We understand that there is an inconsistency in the literatures in the use of the word “texture” to mean
different things. In computer graphics, texture usually refers to patterns or images determining changes
of reflectance on a surface without modifying the surface geometry. Elsewhere, the word often refers to
bumpiness or relief on the surface, which does result in small changes to shape. In this paper, we chose
to use the first of these definitions throughout. To make this clear, we have added this definition
“(variation or patterning in surface reflectance)” after the first use of “texture” in section 4(c)
“Interactions between motion, texture, shape and glossiness”.
"leading to distinctive orientation fields in the image that can be used to derive shape information"
A Marlow JOV paper [2011] showes well that orientation field can explain also specular material and
painting.
We have added, to the end of that paragraph, a new sentence:
The perception of texture can be reduced if the orientation of lightness changes created by the texture
are consistently aligned with shading created by surface relief (Kim, Marlow & Anderson, 2014), and
rotating or translating highlights so that they are inconsistent with the lightness variation in the diffuse
reflectance reduces perceived gloss (Marlow, Kim & Anderson 2011).
This is also addresses a point from this reviewer below.
Must provide some explaination about why different rotation velocity was used between visual and
vertical axis.
We agree that the presentation of these details may have been confusing. The two velocities refer to the
motion of points on the surface of the object, projected on the image, in degrees of visual angle per
second, not the speed at which the object rotated (which was the same in the two rotation axis
conditions). We have changed that paragraph to make the different speed definitions clearer. The
relevant text now reads:
“In all cases, the direction of rotation about the axis was selected randomly to be clockwise or
anticlockwise by 30°. The rotational motion occurred only during the 0.33s period of animation that
included the spectral change, had constant rotational speed (90°/s) and abrupt onset and offset. Linear
motion of points in the image corresponded to a maximum speed of 5.6°/s (degrees of visual angle per
second) at the outer edge of the sphere for the visual-axis conditions and 21.3°/s (degrees of visual
angle per second) across the centre of the sphere for the vertical-axis conditions.”
"reflectances changes" I am not sure this might be "reflectance changes"
We have made this change.
"With bumpy stimuli, small regions of highlight appear and disappear as local regions of curvature
change orientation with respect to the light sources."
I do not understand. Is this for observer viewing location as well?
This could indeed occur if the observer changed position. We have not modified the text as it specifically
discusses our experiment, in which the observer does not move.
Highlights occur in locations determined by the relative locations and orientations of the source, surface
and viewer. When light from the source is reflected at a point on the surface, in the specular component,
so that it reaches the observer, a highlight (an image of the source, blurred depending on the surface
roughness and compressed depending on the curvature) will be seen. If any of the source, surface or
observer change position or orientation, the conditions that result in a highlight may no longer be true.
This sentence is quite long and should be made more than one…
"However, to observe no effect of relative motion of surfaces and the lights that illuminate them, for all
observers irrespective of their level of performance with static stimuli, and for all conditions, implies that
there are not consistent and separable effects of motion on perceptual scission and on disruption of local
chromatic discriminations."
We have split the sentence into:
“However, we observe no effect of relative motion of surfaces and the lights that illuminate them, for all
observers irrespective of their level of performance with static stimuli, and for all conditions. This implies
that there are not consistent and separable effects of motion on perceptual scission and on disruption of
local chromatic discriminations.”
I found that this paper should be talked about: Kim Marlow & Anderson [2014] They saw reflectance of
an object is perceived differently by the angle of the reflectance changes. The authors should note their
round mable objects are not influenced by such a problematic effect.
As noted above, we have added, to the end of paragraph 1, of section 1(c):
“The perception of texture can be reduced if the orientation of lightness changes created by the texture
are consistently aligned with shading created by surface relief (Kim, Marlow & Anderson, 2014), and
rotating or translating highlights so that they are inconsistent with the lightness variation in the diffuse
reflectance reduces perceived gloss (Marlow, Kim & Anderson 2011).”
We have also added to paragraph 3, section 1(d):
Since surface patterning and bumpiness were never present on the same object, we do not test
interactions between pattern and shading (Kim, Marlow & Anderson,2014).
I found that the very good paper should be mentioned: Suchow and Alvarez [2011] Motion silences
awareness of visual change. Current Biology
We have changed part of section 4(d), paragraph 2 (also modified in relation to Reviewer 2’s first point)
and new paragraph 3, to reference this paper:
“The range of performance levels attained by different observers in this task shows that many of
our observers (1,2,4 and 6) are not limited by the chromatic statistics that are in principle available, and
yet they still show no performance enhancement with relative motion between specular and diffuse
components. Additional cues to allow these components of the image to be disentangled, and cues that
enhance the "realism" of the rendered scenes, do not help. This suggests that the separation of the
surface and lighting contributions to the image is not what is limiting their performance. The observers
who perform relatively poorly in all conditions may simply have poorer chromatic discrimination ability
and so be less able to access the chromatic signals required to discriminate specular and diffuse regions
of the stimuli, regardless of any motion, but we do not directly test this.
For the remaining observers, performance is not impaired by disruption of image locations that
carry most information in terms of chromatic change, nor is there any evidence that the motion itself
impairs the detection of chromatic changes (Suchow & Alvarez, 2011) that are critical to the task.“
For the data figure, I think the mean of participants should be also plotted.
Figure 5 shows the absolute levels of performance for each observer in each condition. We specifically
chose not to plot the mean of all the observers’ data in Figure 5 for two reasons. Firstly, the plots would
become more cluttered. Secondly, and most importantly, there are clear differences between individual
observers, and in some cases (most of the plots for “bumpy” stimuli) the observers seem to separate
into two different groups. We wished to highlight these features, rather than encouraging the reader to
consider only a summary. The main result comes from the relative performance in the different
conditions, which is consistent over observers, and summarised in Figure 6 as the mean normalised
performance over observers.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
This study shows that observers' ability of to distinguish between lighting changes and object reflectance
changes is unimpaired by the object's motion. The authors conclude that the cues that mediate this
operational colour constancy depend on high-level scene processing. The finding is important because
although some aspects of scene interpretation may be determined locally, inferences about realistic
changes in the environment are likely to involve more sophisticated non-local processing.
The experiments have been carefully performed and the analysis is comprehensive. Potential confounds
such as range effects and inter-observer differences have been avoided or accommodated. I have only
minor comments to offer.
GENERAL
1. It might be worth adding a caveat that the present analysis does not exclude low-level mechanisms
mediating operational colour constancy in other discrimination tasks.
We designed the stimuli so that the cues that are available in operational colour constancy tasks with
multiple surfaces, such as “pop-out” of inconsistently changing surfaces (Foster et al. 2001), are not
available. However, for our stimuli, illuminant changes do impose a multiplicative transformation on
cone excitations within the object, whereas reflectance changes with nonzero specularity do not (Lee
and Smithson, 2016). Poor chromatic discrimination might limit the discrimination of highlights from
diffuse reflections (particularly in the low-specularity stimuli) and so limit performance for some
observers.
To make a more explicit link between our stimuli and others that have identified important low-level
mechanisms, we have made the following changes to the text.
We have added, to the end of section 4(a), a link between our stimuli and the more typical stimuli that
include multiple 2D surfaces.
“We designed the stimuli so that the cues that are available in operational colour constancy tasks with
multiple surfaces, such as “pop-out” of inconsistently changing surfaces [52], are not available.
However, for our stimuli, illuminant changes impose a single multiplicative transformation on cone
excitations from pixels within the object, whereas reflectance changes introduce different
transformations of diffuse regions and those that additionally include a non-zero specular component
[9](Figure 3).”
We have added, to section 4(d), description of the ideal observer model:
“...has perfect colour discrimination and...”
and to paragraph 2 of that section:
“The observers who perform relatively poorly in all conditions may simply have poorer chromatic
discrimination ability, and so be less able to access the chromatic signals required to discriminate
specular and diffuse regions of the stimuli, regardless of any motion, but we do not directly test this.”
In the final sentence of the paper we have added “with these stimuli” so that it now reads:
“Since motion disrupts frame-by-frame low-level image statistics, the results imply that operational
constancy with these stimuli depends on a high-level scene interpretation, which is maintained in all
conditions.
And in the abstract we have added “we measure”:
“Since motion significantly disrupts frame-by-frame low-level image statistics, we infer that the
operational constancy we measure depends on a high-level scene interpretation.”
2. The authors touch on the differing effects of depth on operational colour constancy. Since motion and
depth can sometimes afford similar information about three-dimensional shape, can a little more be said
on this topic?
We agree with the reviewer, and have noted the association between information conveyed by
stereopsis and motion parallax in section 1(c), paragraph 2. Since, we do not manipulate binocular
disparity in this study, we have chosen not to discuss it in further detail in the Introduction.
In the Discussion (section 4(g)) we have reiterated the link between motion and depth, and have
included additional references to studies that have investigated depth-cues in colour constancy.
“Since motion and depth can sometimes afford similar information about three-dimensional shape, it is
also useful to consider experiments that have manipulated binocular depth cues. Viewing three-
dimensional objects with binocular depth information has been shown to give no advantage in
operational colour constancy tasks [61,62]. However, binocular depth has provided an advantage in
other colour constancy experiments where it may be used to segment the scene in to different depth
planes (Werner, 2006) or allow the interpretation of inter-reflections between surfaces (Bloj et al., 1999)
In our previous study, also on operational colour constancy, we found that severely disrupting spatial
cues to surface shape, by phase scrambling the image, did affect performance [9], and in other studies
real stimuli that include multiple cues to three-dimensional shape do appear to enable better constancy
assessed by a match-to-sample task [35]…”
ANALYSIS
1. The pattern of performance is clear enough to the eye, but given the experimental design, some
readers would expect a routine repeated-measures ANOVA or the equivalent.
We have included this analysis, reported in the new paragraph in the results section:
“An ANOVA on the d' values, with surface type, motion condition and specularity as repeated-measures
factors, reinforces these observations. None of the effects involving rotation type are statistically
significant, and the only effects that are significant are those of surface type F1,4=7.94, p=0.048),
specularity (F4,16=45.04, p<0.01), and their interaction (F4,16=6.70, p<0.01), which are the results that
can be seen by eye.”
2. The ordering of figures is a personal choice, but I found the summary account of Fig. 6 easier to
follow than the individual data of Fig. 5. Is it feasible for mean data to be reported first?
We have carefully considered the reviewer’s suggestion. We agree that the relative performance data
are perhaps simpler to understand, but we’d rather present the raw data (absolute performance) before
presenting data that have been further processed (normalised values, showing relative performance).
PRESENTATION
1. The opening parenthesis in the formula on p. 3, top, appears initially as part of the formula and is not
resolved until the next line.
We have added “i.e.” after the opening parenthesis, to separate parenthesis from the equation.
However, we would welcome alternative suggestions at the typesetting stage.
2. This also a matter of personal choice, but the same point is sometimes repeated, for example, floor
and ceiling effects (pp. 13 and 14).
We agree that the second mention of floor and ceiling effects is repetitive, and have removed the
sentence containing this (section 4(d), start of second paragraph).
