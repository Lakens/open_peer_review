This MS reports a study of the responses of parent great tits to aversive stimuli presented on their
nests and relates the responses to several metrics of fitness. There is general interest in studies
assessing among-individual variance in behavioral tendencies, and the fitness consequences of
such variation. This study adds some new data to the mix, but in my view is limited in several
key ways.
A major concern I have with the paper are the statistics. Three main dependent variables were
used in the study: 1) a latency measure (time delay from start of trial to when the focal bird
reentered the box), 2) inspection time, and 3) number of fledglings. All three were analyzed
appropriately with a mixed model structure, but the authors used a negative binomial
distribution as the link function. In the case of the repeatability analyses, a Poisson distribution
was used as the link function.
My statistical concerns fall into two types. One is that some potentially interesting aspects of the
data could have been analyzed more completely using the mixed model structure. If I understood
the sampling correctly, most pairs were measured twice, once with each model. Some of these
were measured a third time, half with a repeat of the novel object and one a control with no
object. So, most pairs then got 3 measures, and a few pairs only had the control set-up. Why not
do a full mixed model with all the treatments and data, and calculate repeatability from this?
Instead it seems you did repeatabilities on various subsets of the data. Nothing wrong with this
but it is a bit limiting. Using all the data at once is robust to the fact that some pairs only had 1
measure taken (a few controls). I took the liberty of running a simple version of this in SAS for the
latency to enter, logged (see comments below). First the overall repeatability analysis showing
that box (presumably female) ID explains 46% of variance over the whole experiment (my
apologies for the formating):

Adding in the treatment and order of treatments just to check (without all the other covariates,
which would need to be included) shows that both objects are greater than control but eyes are
much greater than both controls and plain object:

I would note as well that this approach would allow you to use BLUP values from the mixed
model in the fitness analyses instead of means (lines 236-237). Both means and BLUPs have bias
issues, but generally means are worse.
Second and more fundamentally, none of the response variables measured is distributed as a
negative binomial. By definition, a negative binomial is a series of yes/no events in which you are
counting up the number of one outcome before the other outcome occurs. Each event is
independent, such as would occur if you counted the number of non-ones you rolled on a six-side
die until you got a 1. Latency and inspection time are almost certainly not a negative binomial. I
suppose one could argue that if you assume the bird makes a decision to return or not every
second, then you have counted up the number of “no” decisions before the first “yes”. But these
are clearly not independent, as the probability of a bird returning in the first second is much,
much lower than in the 1000th sec. This applies to both time variables. Number of fledglings is
also neither a Poisson nor a negative binomial, for the same reason. They are not an accumulation
of “yes” outcomes from a set of independent events, despite being count data. So, it is my opinion
the negative binomial is the incorrect link function to use for all of these.
That said, I’m sure these data pose a problem because they are skewed. However, time data in
particular are always a bit dicey, but we have to make do. One possibility is to do survival
analysis, but I do not think the survival analysis stats can extract some of what you’d like to. That
would work for the treatment differences, but probably not repeatability. I personally would
have used a log (as I did above) or square root transform on the time data and then parametric
stats. Because time is not really a count variable arising from a binomial or Poisson process, this
would not have the issues that transforming true count data does. It is possible that the transform
would not make the residuals perfectly fit a normal distribution, but I bet they’d be close.
I’m not sure why the repeatability analyses use a Poisson distribution instead. They should be the
same as all other analyses of that variable.
Fledgling success is another matter. Possibly there are a large number of 0s, and then a smear of
other values. No way to make that normal. You could leave it as a Poisson, but it would be
worthwhile discussing in more detail the issues with that. A rank correlation test or
randomization test might actually be best. The later can be fairly easily done in R by taking your
observed data and randomly associating behavior with fledglings, calculating a correlation
coefficient, doing it 10,000 times, and ask where the observed correlation is in the distribution of
randomized ones. This would retain the observed distributions of the data, whatever they really
are.
I also have some comments on terminology/interpretation:
1. I would think of the two objects you used in the experiment as both being novel objects. You
seem to conclude that because great tits have seen sparrowhawk eyes before, that object is not
novel. However, great tits have surely seen white, brown, and black colors before, and while they
probably haven’t seen legos, they have seen plastic bits and sticks of roughly similar size and
shape. It seems a save assertion to say that all objects an individual encounters are slightly novel
(even their nest box probably is slightly different looking each time they visit), and no object is
completely novel. I guess I would just consider both of these novel because they suddenly appear
on top of the box where nothing was before. The hawk mimic you could predict might be more
4
threatening because of the eyes, but almost certainly you can’t assume the birds recognize this as
a hawk.
2. Repeatabilities are only as useful as the data set used to calculate them. In this case, you have
separate measures taken a few days apart. Thus, the repeatability is appropriately interpreted as
indicating between-individual differences evident within a nest attempt. Yet, you use the fitness
analysis to suggest that selection on personality is occurring (lines 370-373). This is probably an
over-interpretation. It is intriguing that there is a link between risky behavior and reproductive
success in the same breeding attempt, but it seems there could be lots of confounds, such as time
of year, other environmental conditions on the territory, etc. I would urge caution in making this
claim.
3. Line 344-352: I do not think the evidence is strong enough to suggest that the two models
measure different things. While the statistical results differ, this conclusion depends on
interpreting several cases of one significant result compared one non-significant result as
showing a significant different. This is not the case. Lack of significance does not mean there is no
effect. In the case of repeatabilities, I’m sure that the standard errors of the estimates overlap
considerably, and so they ought to be considered the same—one happens to be over the threshold
for significance and one is a bit below the threshold, but they are generally pretty similar.
In summary, I think this study collects some useful data, but the analysis and the interpretations
need to be refined considerably so that a reader can fully appreciate the patterns in the measured
responses.

The paper by Davidson et al addresses the adaptive significance of risk aversion in the context of
personality theory. Pace of life theory vs state-dependent theory is discussed as an underlying
framework to explain individual variation in risk aversion, but it is not entirely clear if this study
5
is intended as an explicit test of these two explanatory models? If so, more information on
individual physiological and metabolic states vs traits would probably have been required, data
that would be hard to obtain without the application of more invasive methods and/or long term
monitoring of individual developmental trajectories. The paper still tells an important story on
how (in the same study population and setting) behavior can be repeatable and linked to fitness
traits for some behavioral measures, but not for others.
I have one major issue that I’d like to see clarified, then only minor comments.
Unless I misunderstand the study design (always a possibility), two behavioral variables are
registered:
1) Latency to enter the nest box again, after disturbance, and
2) Inspection time, time spent at the nest site after returning but before entering.
Correct? In summary the results indicate that test conditions (if the female had to be flushed for
the nest or just left) and habituation across successive trials was significant factors for inspection
time, whereas individual repeatability and links with reproductive success and body condition
were significant for latency to enter. These are interesting results, and demonstrate how some
behaviors are more affected by specific experimental conditions, and some depend more on
individual condition (and hence perhaps therefore are more repeatable). But I struggle with how
the authors sometimes refer to “time to return” and sometimes “time to enter”. Time to enter
would be composed of time to return plus time to inspect before entering. Would it not then be
better to report three variables: Time to return to site, inspection time, and time to enter? Would
such an approach change the conclusions? Obviously, if inspection time is zero return time and
entering time would be the same, which may muddle the analysis. But give this a thought, and at
least not refer consecutively to “return time” and “time to enter”.
Minor comments: Ln 118: “Adults were caught at the nest at day 10 post-hatching to tag
individuals and collect biometrics.” State already here, specifically what biometrics were
registered.
At the end of section 2.3.1., provide final n for the different groups.
Statistics: It is stated that birds that did not return to the nest during the trial period were given
an upper latency of 2400 seconds (i.e. 40 minutes). This obviously skews the data distribution,
and the authors justly apply a log-link function. But at least the Tukey post hoc test also assumes
homogeneity of variance between groups, was this assured?

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
I have now received reviewers from two experts in the field. Both have raised important concerns
regarding the statistics, though reviewer 1 raised several very important and rather specific issues
for which he provided a thorough discussion. Although reviewer 1 provided a lot of feedback
regarding your statistical approach/methods, it is important that this feedback does not
overshadow the other (perhaps more important) issues he raises: that interpretations of your data
and the context of the measures you collected are potentially problematic, and your
interpretations require either more justification or care in how they are characterized. Reviewer 2
also had some questions regarding your interpretations. The scope of these data may also be a bit
narrow given the specific contexts that were tested. A careful and cautious discussion of your
results both in terms of how the data are analyzed, presented, interpreted and then ultimately
discussed is necessary for this paper. Unfortunately your paper is not appropriate for publication
in its current form. However both reviewers felt that the study had some important merit. For
this reason, I recommend that the paper is rejected, but I also recommend the opportunity to re-
submit it, should you feel you can address these issues sufficiently.

This revised MS on the responses of parent great tits to presentations of novel objects on their
nests is much improved from the earlier submission. The results appear to have been fairly robust
to the shift in statistical approaches, but the current approach seems quite reasonable.
Line 72 and elsewhere: Differences are BETWEEN, variance is AMONG.
Line 101: Change “which” to “that”.
Line 196: The phrase “so they were normally distributed” is not necessary since a normal
distribution is not necessary before analysis. Later on you note that the residuals were normally
distributed, so that would be sufficient.
Line 214: Explain why you used adjusted repeatability. I think use of adjusted repeatability in
measures of personality is usually misleading. You are subtracting out some (but not all) forms of
plasticity by doing this and thus artificially inflating repeatability. The only reason to do it would
be if some bias exists in the dataset and you want to extend the repeatability to a broader
population. Adjusted repeatabilities are also not comparable across studies since most studies
don’t duplicate fixed factors exactly. At the least, I recommend providing the unadjusted
repeatability (from a model with just random effects and no fixed effects) as well.
Line 284: Do you mean “r” here, since this is a correlation? I usually interpret Beta as a slope.
Discussion: The surprising lack of correlation between the two behavioral measures that seem
like they should be linked has been found in some other contexts. I would immodestly direct
your attention to Moldoff & Westneat (2016, Behavioral Ecology) as one example where response
11
to novelty was measured with two latencies that occurred in sequence, but were unexpectedly
poorly correlated at multiple levels. We had a (feeble) explanation, but since you focus on this,
maybe you will have some better ideas?
Line 384 (section): It may be worth mentioning the possibility that the link (albeit somewhat
weak) between latency to enter and number of fledglings might be reversed. If females with
larger broods at the time of the measurements of behavior value the brood more, they may be
more eager to enter. You test for an effect of clutch size, but what about brood size just before the
trials?
Table 1. I think these model results would be more informative if they included the variance
components (random effects plus residual) as well.

This revised MS on the responses of parent great tits to presentations of novel objects on their
nests is much improved from the earlier submission. The results appear to have been fairly robust
to the shift in statistical approaches, but the current approach seems quite reasonable.
Line 72 and elsewhere: Differences are BETWEEN, variance is AMONG.
Line 101: Change “which” to “that”.
Line 196: The phrase “so they were normally distributed” is not necessary since a normal
distribution is not necessary before analysis. Later on you note that the residuals were normally
distributed, so that would be sufficient.
Line 214: Explain why you used adjusted repeatability. I think use of adjusted repeatability in
measures of personality is usually misleading. You are subtracting out some (but not all) forms of
plasticity by doing this and thus artificially inflating repeatability. The only reason to do it would
be if some bias exists in the dataset and you want to extend the repeatability to a broader
population. Adjusted repeatabilities are also not comparable across studies since most studies
don’t duplicate fixed factors exactly. At the least, I recommend providing the unadjusted
repeatability (from a model with just random effects and no fixed effects) as well.
Line 284: Do you mean “r” here, since this is a correlation? I usually interpret Beta as a slope.
Discussion: The surprising lack of correlation between the two behavioral measures that seem
like they should be linked has been found in some other contexts. I would immodestly direct
your attention to Moldoff & Westneat (2016, Behavioral Ecology) as one example where response
to novelty was measured with two latencies that occurred in sequence, but were unexpectedly
poorly correlated at multiple levels. We had a (feeble) explanation, but since you focus on this,
maybe you will have some better ideas?
Line 384 (section): It may be worth mentioning the possibility that the link (albeit somewhat
weak) between latency to enter and number of fledglings might be reversed. If females with
larger broods at the time of the measurements of behavior value the brood more, they may be
more eager to enter. You test for an effect of clutch size, but what about brood size just before the
trials?

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
I have now received reviewers from two experts in the field. Both have raised important concerns
regarding the statistics, though reviewer 1 raised several very important and rather specific issues for
which he provided a thorough discussion. Although reviewer 1 provided a lot of feedback regarding
your statistical approach/methods, it is important that this feedback does not overshadow the other
(perhaps more important) issues he raises: that interpretations of your data and the context of the
measures you collected are potentially problematic, and your interpretations require either more
justification or care in how they are characterized. Reviewer 2 also had some questions regarding your
interpretations. The scope of these data may also be a bit narrow given the specific contexts that were
tested. A careful and cautious discussion of your results both in terms of how the data are analyzed,
presented, interpreted and then ultimately discussed is necessary for this paper. Unfortunately your
paper is not appropriate for publication in its current form. However both reviewers felt that the study
had some important merit. For this reason, I recommend that the paper is rejected, but I also
recommend the opportunity to re-submit it, should you feel you can address these issues sufficiently.

This MS reports a study of the responses of parent great tits to aversive stimuli presented on their
nests and relates the responses to several metrics of fitness. There is general interest in studies
assessing among-individual variance in behavioral tendencies, and the fitness consequences of such
variation. This study adds some new data to the mix, but in my view is limited in several key ways.
A major concern I have with the paper are the statistics. Three main dependent variables were used in
the study: 1) a latency measure (time delay from start of trial to when the focal bird reentered the
box), 2) inspection time, and 3) number of fledglings. All three were analyzed appropriately with a
mixed model structure, but the authors used a negative binomial distribution as the link function. In
the case of the repeatability analyses, a Poisson distribution was used as the link function.
My statistical concerns fall into two types. One is that some potentially interesting aspects of the data
could have been analyzed more completely using the mixed model structure. If I understood the
sampling correctly, most pairs were measured twice, once with each model. Some of these were
measured a third time, half with a repeat of the novel object and one a control with no object. So,
most pairs then got 3 measures, and a few pairs only had the control set-up. Why not do a full mixed
model with all the treatments and data, and calculate repeatability from this? Instead it seems you did
repeatabilities on various subsets of the data. Nothing wrong with this but it is a bit limiting. Using all
the data at once is robust to the fact that some pairs only had 1 measure taken (a few controls). I took
the liberty of running a simple version of this in SAS for the latency to enter, logged (see comments
below). First the overall repeatability analysis showing that box (presumably female) ID explains 46%
of variance over the whole experiment (my apologies for the formating):

Adding in the treatment and order of treatments just to check (without all the other
covariates, which would need to be included) shows that both objects are greater than control
but eyes are much greater than both controls and plain object:

I would note as well that this approach would allow you to use BLUP values from the mixed
model in the fitness analyses instead of means (lines 236-237). Both means and BLUPs have
bias issues, but generally means are worse.
Second and more fundamentally, none of the response variables measured is distributed as a
negative binomial. By definition, a negative binomial is a series of yes/no events in which you
are counting up the number of one outcome before the other outcome occurs. Each event is
independent, such as would occur if you counted the number of non-ones you rolled on a six-
side die until you got a 1. Latency and inspection time are almost certainly not a negative
binomial. I suppose one could argue that if you assume the bird makes a decision to return or
not every second, then you have counted up the number of “no” decisions before the first
“yes”. But these are clearly not independent, as the probability of a bird returning in the first
second is much, much lower than in the 1000th sec. This applies to both time variables.
Number of fledglings is also neither a Poisson nor a negative binomial, for the same reason.
They are not an accumulation of “yes” outcomes from a set of independent events, despite
being count data. So, it is my opinion the negative binomial is the incorrect link function to
use for all of these.
That said, I’m sure these data pose a problem because they are skewed. However, time data in
particular are always a bit dicey, but we have to make do. One possibility is to do survival
analysis, but I do not think the survival analysis stats can extract some of what you’d like to.
That would work for the treatment differences, but probably not repeatability. I personally
would have used a log (as I did above) or square root transform on the time data and then
parametric stats. Because time is not really a count variable arising from a binomial or Poisson
process, this would not have the issues that transforming true count data does. It is possible
that the transform would not make the residuals perfectly fit a normal distribution, but I bet
they’d be close.
I’m not sure why the repeatability analyses use a Poisson distribution instead. They should be
the same as all other analyses of that variable.
Fledgling success is another matter. Possibly there are a large number of 0s, and then a smear
of other values. No way to make that normal. You could leave it as a Poisson, but it would be
worthwhile discussing in more detail the issues with that. A rank correlation test or
randomization test might actually be best. The later can be fairly easily done in R by taking
your observed data and randomly associating behavior with fledglings, calculating a
correlation coefficient, doing it 10,000 times, and ask where the observed correlation is in the
distribution of randomized ones. This would retain the observed distributions of the data,
whatever they really are.
Thank you for having a close look at our statistics and for your valuable advice. We will address each
issue separately.
1) Data distribution: We appreciate that for this particular count data, as time goes by, the
probability that a bird will come back is not consistent/independent. We have now log-
transformed our data. The fit of the model as viewed by QQ plots and residual variance plots are
marginally better fits than the negative binomials. We also now include all data points (i.e. the
second object presentation for the subset of birds). We also appreciate the time you took to have
a look at the data and run an analysis yourself, however, there is a significant interaction term
(flush*treatment) which was not included in your analysis and so therefore we cannot draw from
the main effect you found for treatment only. So overall, our results are generally the same as
our original submission using the log-transformation. Our post-hoc Tukey test on the
interactions shows there is no difference between eyes and objects within flush treatments.
However, the object when the female was not flushed compared to the eyes when the female
was flushed is now significantly different. We discuss this result in lines 318-321 “.
2) Repeatabilities: We originally used a poisson model that dealt with overdispersion by including
individual level random effects because we used the rptR function, which does not offer negative
binomials. We appreciate these are different ways of modelling the data and that instead we
should be consistent. We have now calculated repeatabilities manually from the glmm model
outputs from above, by dividing the variance of the ID term by the sum of the variance of the ID,
residual and the other random term (i.e. site). We also now include all data points and no longer
use subsets of data for multiple analyses. Inspection time is marginally significant at 0.05.
3) Analysis of fitness against aversion score: We had considered the different options for analysing
this data and we thought that using a mean score would be appropriate for latency to Enter
given the results had no significant co-variables between objects and eyes. However, we
appreciate that using means can introduce error. We avoided the use of BLUPs because they
have recently come under a lot of scrutiny for similar reasons (e.g. Hadfield et al 2010). An
alternative approach is a multivariate analysis; however, these analyses are data hungry and not
suited to our data because of our sample size and the need to control for significant fixed effects,
which would reduce power even further. We have now chosen to use an analysis that we have
used in previous published papers to extract individual values (e.g. Quinn et al 2009). Latency to
enter and inspection time were extracted from a GLM (with individual as a fixed effect) by
adding the parameter for that individual to the constant which gives an estimate with respect to
the fixed effects. We appreciate that this method can also introduce bias; therefore, we highlight
in the manuscript the limitations of this approach and our reasoning for not performing a
multivariate analysis given the low sample size. Incidentally, we ran both methods (BLUPS and
our method presented in the ms) to see if one was less conservative than the other, but both
method obtained similar results. As you have pointed out, a negative binomial may not be
appropriate for our analysis because of the distribution. We now run the data in a glmm with a
gaussian distribution because body condition is normally distributed, and although fledgling
numbers is not perfectly normally distributed, it does come close, aside from the zeros. When we
look at the model fit between the negative binomial, poisson and gaussian, the data best fits the
gaussian, and so we have chosen to report the results from this analysis. As a consequence, our
previously significant effect for latency to enter on fitness is now a trend, but we obtain the same
results for body condition.
I also have some comments on terminology/interpretation:
1. I would think of the two objects you used in the experiment as both being novel objects.
You seem to conclude that because great tits have seen sparrowhawk eyes before, that object
is not novel. However, great tits have surely seen white, brown, and black colors before, and
while they probably haven’t seen legos, they have seen plastic bits and sticks of roughly
similar size and shape. It seems a save assertion to say that all objects an individual
encounters are slightly novel (even their nest box probably is slightly different looking each
time they visit), and no object is completely novel. I guess I would just consider both of these
novel because they suddenly appear on top of the box where nothing was before. The hawk
mimic you could predict might be more threatening because of the eyes, but almost certainly
you can’t assume the birds recognize this as a hawk.
We completely agree with your interpretation, and had included in the discussion that the two
stimuli may have both been perceived as novel (lines 334-336), but we now include a further
sentence to make sure that this interpretation is more explicit. Indeed, our intention was to
provide two stimuli that may differ in context as there is a substantial amount of literature in
support of the interpretation that eye shapes elicit anti-predator responses in birds, including
great tits. Nevertheless, we do appreciate that the eyes may not be perceived as a predator, and
that there is an ongoing debate surrounding this.
2. Repeatabilities are only as useful as the data set used to calculate them. In this case, you
have separate measures taken a few days apart. Thus, the repeatability is appropriately
interpreted as indicating between-individual differences evident within a nest attempt. Yet,
you use the fitness analysis to suggest that selection on personality is occurring (lines 370-
373). This is probably an over-interpretation. It is intriguing that there is a link between risky
behavior and reproductive success in the same breeding attempt, but it seems there could be
lots of confounds, such as time of year, other environmental conditions on the territory, etc. I
would urge caution in making this claim.
We have re-written this paragraph and have been more conservative in our interpretations with
regards to adaptive potential of aversion, particularly given our results now indicate a non-
significant trend (P < 0.1) between fledgling number and latency to enter. We have also edited
our manuscript title to reflect this.
3. Line 344-352: I do not think the evidence is strong enough to suggest that the two
models measure different things. While the statistical results differ, this conclusion depends
on interpreting several cases of one significant result compared one non-significant result as
showing a significant different. This is not the case. Lack of significance does not mean there
is no effect. In the case of repeatabilities, I’m sure that the standard errors of the estimates
overlap considerably, and so they ought to be considered the same—one happens to be over
the threshold for significance and one is a bit below the threshold, but they are generally
pretty similar.
We have re-written this paragraph and have been more conservative in our interpretations. We
hope that our more reserved summary of these differences is more appropriate and does not
suggest that we are interpreting differences in significance as significant differences. However,
we do think it is important to discuss the results found for both behaviours, namely that the two
behaviours did not correlate and that inspection time appears to be sensitive to external
variables, and that, unlike latency to enter, there is no relationship between body condition and
fledgling number. As such, we have now included graphs of the results for inspection time and
body condition and inspection time and fledgling number to illustrate these differences. Our
intention was to highlight how our study fits in with the literature discussing the need to
validate behavioural measures to be certain we are testing what we think we are testing (cf.
Alecia Carter’s animal behaviour paper on how not to measure boldness, and her Biological
Reviews paper on ‘what are behavioural ecologists measuring?’).
In summary, I think this study collects some useful data, but the analysis and the
interpretations need to be refined considerably so that a reader can fully appreciate the
patterns in the measured responses.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_9
The paper by Davidson et al addresses the adaptive significance of risk aversion in the context
of personality theory. Pace of life theory vs state-dependent theory is discussed as an
underlying framework to explain individual variation in risk aversion, but it is not entirely clear
if this study is intended as an explicit test of these two explanatory models? If so, more
information on individual physiological and metabolic states vs traits would probably have
been required, data that would be hard to obtain without the application of more invasive
methods and/or long term monitoring of individual developmental trajectories.
Thank you for your helpful comments. Our intention was to introduce different theories as to
why traits like body condition and fledgling number may be linked with personality, but not a
test against these two theories, particularly given that they may not be mutually exclusive. We
have reworked some of our introduction so that it does not imply we plan to explicitly test this
theory, and we have substantially rewritten (and cut down) our discussion on pace of life for a
less rich interpretation and so this should address the issue of lacking more data on metabolic
rate and other physiological traits as you suggest. Moreover, we include these limitations that
you rightly point out in this discussion (lines 383-385)
The paper still tells an important story on how (in the same study population and setting)
behavior can be repeatable and linked to fitness traits for some behavioral measures, but not
for others.
I have one major issue that I’d like to see clarified, then only minor comments.
Unless I misunderstand the study design (always a possibility), two behavioral variables are
registered:
1) Latency to enter the nest box again, after disturbance, and
2) Inspection time, time spent at the nest site after returning but before entering.
Correct? In summary the results indicate that test conditions (if the female had to be flushed
for the nest or just left) and habituation across successive trials was significant factors for
inspection time, whereas individual repeatability and links with reproductive success and body
condition were significant for latency to enter. These are interesting results, and demonstrate
how some behaviors are more affected by specific experimental conditions, and some depend
more on individual condition (and hence perhaps therefore are more repeatable). But I
struggle with how the authors sometimes refer to “time to return” and sometimes “time to
enter”. Time to enter would be composed of time to return plus time to inspect before
entering. Would it not then be better to report three variables: Time to return to site,
inspection time, and time to enter? Would such an approach change the conclusions?
Obviously, if inspection time is zero return time and entering time would be the same, which
may muddle the analysis. But give this a thought, and at least not refer consecutively to
“return time” and “time to enter”.
Thank you for pointing this out – we had used the term “return” synonymously with “enter”,
which is confusing, and we should have always referred to entering the nest box. To clarify, the
two behavioural measures are as follows:
Latency to enter: time taken to enter the nest box from the start of the trial
Inspection time: total time spent perched on the nest entrance hole and looking in and outside
of the nest.
We have now replaced any mention of “return” with “enter”.
It is not possible to measure a return time to the site area per se as the video camera recorded a
small area around the nest box only, so it is feasible that birds were in proximity, but not at the
nest. This would be an interesting variable to measure if a second camera had a wider angle, for
instance. Indeed, not knowing when birds were away or present in the site introduces some noise
to the data, but it should not systematically bias our results.
Minor comments: Ln 118: “Adults were caught at the nest at day 10 post-hatching to tag
individuals and collect biometrics.” State already here, specifically what biometrics were
registered.
This has been added : “including wing length and body weight”
At the end of section 2.3.1., provide final n for the different groups.
Statistics: It is stated that birds that did not return to the nest during the trial period were
given an upper latency of 2400 seconds (i.e. 40 minutes). This obviously skews the data
distribution, and the authors justly apply a log-link function. But at least the Tukey post hoc
test also assumes homogeneity of variance between groups, was this assured?
We have now log-transformed the data so they fit a normal distribution following the advice of
reviewer 1. We checked homogeneity of variance and normality of residuals. We include this
detail in the methods, line 210-211

This revised MS on the responses of parent great tits to presentations of novel objects on their nests is
much improved from the earlier submission. The results appear to have been fairly robust to the shift in
statistical approaches, but the current approach seems quite reasonable.
Line 72 and elsewhere: Differences are BETWEEN, variance is AMONG.
Thank you, this has been changed throughout the manuscript
Line 101: Change “which” to “that”.
This has been changed
Line 196: The phrase “so they were normally distributed” is not necessary since a normal distribution is
not necessary before analysis. Later on you note that the residuals were normally distributed, so that
would be sufficient.
This has been omitted
Line 214: Explain why you used adjusted repeatability. I think use of adjusted repeatability in measures
of personality is usually misleading. You are subtracting out some (but not all) forms of plasticity by
doing this and thus artificially inflating repeatability. The only reason to do it would be if some bias
exists in the dataset and you want to extend the repeatability to a broader population. Adjusted
repeatabilities are also not comparable across studies since most studies don’t duplicate fixed factors
exactly. At the least, I recommend providing the unadjusted repeatability (from a model with just
random effects and no fixed effects) as well.
We now explain the rationale behind using adjusted repeatability as a means to control for significant
fixed effects that may influence individual behaviour. We now report both adjusted and non-adjusted
repeatability.
Line 284: Do you mean “r” here, since this is a correlation? I usually interpret Beta as a slope.
We have now removed this and report the z and p value which reflects the result outputs we provide in
the table.
Discussion: The surprising lack of correlation between the two behavioral measures that seem like they
should be linked has been found in some other contexts. I would immodestly direct your attention to
Moldoff & Westneat (2016, Behavioral Ecology) as one example where response to novelty was
measured with two latencies that occurred in sequence, but were unexpectedly poorly correlated at
multiple levels. We had a (feeble) explanation, but since you focus on this, maybe you will have some
better ideas?
Thank you for bringing this paper to our attention which is very relevant to our own findings. The
domain-specific versus domain-general hypothesis seems like a logical interpretation and so we cite it
here.
Line 384 (section): It may be worth mentioning the possibility that the link (albeit somewhat weak)
between latency to enter and number of fledglings might be reversed. If females with larger broods at
the time of the measurements of behavior value the brood more, they may be more eager to enter. You
test for an effect of clutch size, but what about brood size just before the trials?
We agree, this is an important point which we touched on in our methods (i.e. clutch size may influence
motivation), but we did not expand on this in our discussion. We have now included this interpretation in
