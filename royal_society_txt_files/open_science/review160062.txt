The authors have presented a much reworked version of the manuscript. It is clearer, tighter and
more focused. As I wrote before, it is a well replicated study. The materials and methods are
described in more detail and the analyses are now easier to understand.
I have a few remaining comments:
Lines 102-119: I still think that the name of the study organism should be somewhere in the
methods paragraph about the study organism.
Line 103: Perhaps ‘nest workers from the interior of 23 colonies’ rather than ‘indoor workers’?
I asked previously for more information about the lab collection (lines 110-111 of the previous
version of the manuscript). In the point by point reply the authors wrote that the ants were kept
in standard lab conditions for one week after collection, but this information about the duration is
not in the revised version of the manuscript and at lines 126-127 of the revised manuscript it is
written that they were fed for one day. I would suggest that the habituation time of one week is
included in the mauscript.
In my original review I made a comment regarding line 120 (and the discussion in general) that I
was missing a rationale for, and discussion about, the choice of 4 days as the sampling point for
the gene expression. In their reply, the authors wrote: “Pilot data showed the ants started dying
quickly after 4 days of starvation. So to maximize the effect of starvation yet minimize mortality,
we chose day 4 as the day of sampling.” However, I did not find any mention of this in the
revised manuscript. I would suggest that this rationale is included in the materials and methods
and that the time point is covered in the discussion. In the absence of time course data, we have
no idea about the dynamics of relative gene expression, one gene may show an acute phase
change and another a sustained expression change, and this might be treatment dependent.
Using only one time point will necessarily provide only a snapshot of what is happening at that
particular timepoint. It could be that other time points would also be informative and/or
potentially show different patterns. This could for example affect the interpretation about
physiological trade-offs (e.g., line 253), if one gene is up or down regulated with different
dynamics over the 4 days period. The time point is therefore an important point to discuss.
Line 156: The primer sequences are now in a supplementary table, but I did not see the RTqPCR
efficiences, as previously suggested. I would recommend that this informaiont is also included.
Lines 159-162: Please provide references for the functions of these genes.
Line 191: There is no Fig. S1.

The manuscript was generally well written and has a clear set of questions to answer. To me it
seems that there are just few stylistic issues that require clarifications or corrections. One possible
improvement would have been if there would have been more than one geographic location or
population studied. Regional fixation processes may play some role in a single population.
Anyway, I think this is a good piece of science and is well publishable.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
The authors aim test whether inbreeding influences starvation resistance in ants. This is a
relevant question. The authors find no such effect. However, they also performed gene
expression analyses of multiple candidate genes in multiple tissues during starvation in ‘more
5
normal’ and ‘more inbred’ ants. Here they found some differences. However, the analyses are
based on a single “housekeeping” gene. Starvation should impact metabolism thus the extent to
which a single gene is appropriate for normalisation is unclear.
Therefore, major revision of the manuscript and possible further experiments are necessary.
Major issues:
Why not to ROC curve analysis rather than fig 1?
P4 L28-L33:
What is the role of the weird caste determination system on this? It is known that depending on
the caste determination system, homozigosity in the sex determination locus will cause females
develop into diploid males, which can affect the production of queens and colony survival.
P6 L5-L10:
For how long were the ants kept in controlled conditions (food, humidity, temperature) in plastic
boxes before the beginning of the experiments?
P6 L34-39:
Altough fig. 1 shows the relationship between mortality and level of inbreeding, it would be
appropriate to make a figure showing the mortality curve for control and experimental
treatments, e.g., days of starvation vs mortality rate. This would give an idea on how starvation
increases mortality in each experimental group.
P6 L36-38:
It is not clear if these ants were taken directly from a natural population, housed in plastic boxes
and fed for 1 day before the beginning of the experiments or if they were sampled from those 23
colonies that were already housed in plastic boxes and were fed as described in the study
organism section. Additionally, what would the expected causes of death for control group be if
they were fed normally?
P6 L45-L54:
I suggest to change the aim by taking inbreeding out, since there is no information on the gene
expression profiles for the candidate genes in non-inbred conditions. The aim would be: to verify
whether starvation affects gene expression.
P7 L50:
Which Vitellogenin was used as candidate gene - several ants are known to have several
vitellogenins?
P7 L55-60 and P8 L3:
Why were not the three housekeeping genes used for all samples and why was RPS9 chosen as
endogenous control if it was differentially expressed between tissues?
P8 L15-29:
Were all qPCR run in a single or between multiple plates? If multiple, how was it done to
normalise between plates?
P9 L21-28:
What was the purpose of using a housekeeping gene: stabilize gene expression between
treatments only, or between tissues as well?
6
P11 L1-L23:
Is not possible that the housekeeping gene is down regulated, and that's why we are seeing an
overall down-regulation pattern for candidate genes?
P11 L58 and P12 L3-L7:
According to P9 L21-L25, how can tissue-specific responses to inbreeding be accurately measured
if the housekeeping gene was differentially expressed in both tissues sampled?
Minor issues:
P4 L13:
typo: ‘in’ written twice.
P6 L10:
typo: two full-stops at the end of the sentence.
P9 L13:
I couldn’t find fig. S1.
P9 L57:
typo: 'There’ must be replaced by ‘their’.
P11 L5:
As genus, 'Drosophila' should be written in italic.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have presented a much reworked version of the manuscript. It is clearer, tighter and more
focused. As I wrote before, it is a well replicated study. The materials and methods are described in
more detail and the analyses are now easier to understand.
I have a few remaining comments:
Lines 102-119: I still think that the name of the study organism should be somewhere in the methods
paragraph about the study organism.
We have now added the species name to the start of the materials and methods (page 5, lines 110).
Line 103: Perhaps ‘nest workers from the interior of 23 colonies’ rather than ‘indoor workers’?
The suggested change is indeed clearer, and we have now implemented this on page 5, line 110.
I asked previously for more information about the lab collection (lines 110-111 of the previous version
of the manuscript). In the point by point reply the authors wrote that the ants were kept in standard
lab conditions for one week after collection, but this information about the duration is not in the
revised version of the manuscript and at lines 126-127 of the revised manuscript it is written that they
were fed for one day. I would suggest that the habituation time of one week is included in the
mauscript.
We have now clarified the timing of the experiments in the manuscript (page 6, line 126-127; page 6,
line 135; page 7, line 142).
In my original review I made a comment regarding line 120 (and the discussion in general) that I was
missing a rationale for, and discussion about, the choice of 4 days as the sampling point for the gene
expression. In their reply, the authors wrote: “Pilot data showed the ants started dying quickly after 4
days of starvation. So to maximize the effect of starvation yet minimize mortality, we chose day 4 as
the day of sampling.” However, I did not find any mention of this in the revised manuscript. I would
suggest that this rationale is included in the materials and methods and that the time point is covered
in the discussion. In the absence of time course data, we have no idea about the dynamics of relative
gene expression, one gene may show an acute phase change and another a sustained expression
change, and this might be treatment dependent. Using only one time point will necessarily provide
only a snapshot of what is happening at that particular timepoint. It could be that other time points
would also be informative and/or potentially show different patterns. This could for example affect the
interpretation about physiological trade-offs (e.g., line 253), if one gene is up or down regulated with
different dynamics over the 4 days period. The time point is therefore an important point to discuss.
We have added the rationale to the materials and methods (page 7, lines 147-149), and mention the
limitations that this brings in the discussion (page 12, lines 264-268).
Line 156: The primer sequences are now in a supplementary table, but I did not see the RTqPCR
efficiences, as previously suggested. I would recommend that this informaiont is also included.
Table S1 now includes primer sequences as well as efficiencies.
Lines 159-162: Please provide references for the functions of these genes.
We now provide references for both the immune-related genes (Lemaitre & Hoffmann, 2007) as well as
stress- and metabolism-related genes (Chapman 2012), page 8, lines 167-173.
Line 191: There is no Fig. S1.
Thank you for pointing this out. This was a mistake on our part, as it should have been Fig. 1. We have
now amended this in the manuscript (page 9, line 203). Furthermore, we have added a figure S1 in
response to a request by Reviewer #4.

population studied. Regional fixation processes may play some role in a single population. Anyway, I
think this is a good piece of science and is well publishable.
Minor comments:
119: remove the extra .
We have removed the extra period at the end of the sentence (page 6, line 126).
129: define “when needed”
We have now clarified this point (page 6, line 138) to reflect better when the ants were watered.
142: TRISure – is it a buffer or what
TRIsure is a reagent used for RNA isolation. We have clarified this on page 7, line 154.
191: Maybe Fig. S1 should be as Fig. 1
Thank you for pointing this out. The Reviewer is completely right and we have changed the manuscript
accordingly (page 9, line 203).

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors aim test whether inbreeding influences starvation resistance in ants. This is a relevant
question. The authors find no such effect. However, they also performed gene expression analyses of
multiple candidate genes in multiple tissues during starvation in ‘more normal’ and ‘more inbred’ ants.
Here they found some differences. However, the analyses are based on a single “housekeeping” gene.
Starvation should impact metabolism thus the extent to which a single gene is appropriate for
normalisation is unclear.
Therefore, major revision of the manuscript and possible further experiments are necessary.
Major issues:
Why not to ROC curve analysis rather than fig 1?
We are not very well acquainted with ROC curves, but as far as we understand ROC inspects a binary
classifier regarding correct predictions and false positives. We do have a binary classifier (starved vs
control), but we also have a continuous predictor (Inbreeding level). Therefore we are not certain whether
we can still use ROC or not. That said, even if possible, a ROC curve would be a visual inspection tool,
but it would not show the effect of predictors on a response variable (only how well the predictor
functions). Fig 1 in the manuscript shows that in both treatments, inbreeding has no significant effect on
mortality, which should convey our message clearly to the reader.
P4 L28-L33:
What is the role of the weird caste determination system on this? It is known that depending on the
caste determination system, homozigosity in the sex determination locus will cause females develop
into diploid males, which can affect the production of queens and colony survival.
Diploid males indeed could have a strong effect on colony fitness. We added a passage to the
introduction to provide more background (page 4, lines 75-81).
P6 L5-L10:
For how long were the ants kept in controlled conditions (food, humidity, temperature) in plastic
boxes before the beginning of the experiments?
We have now added this information to the manuscript (page 6, line 126-127; page 6 line 135).
P6 L34-39:
Altough fig. 1 shows the relationship between mortality and level of inbreeding, it would be
appropriate to make a figure showing the mortality curve for control and experimental treatments,
e.g., days of starvation vs mortality rate. This would give an idea on how starvation increases mortality
in each experimental group.
We now include a figure in the supplementary materials, showing the effect of starvation on mortality
(page 9, line 203).
P6 L36-38:
It is not clear if these ants were taken directly from a natural population, housed in plastic boxes and
fed for 1 day before the beginning of the experiments or if they were sampled from those 23 colonies
that were already housed in plastic boxes and were fed as described in the study organism section.
Additionally, what would the expected causes of death for control group be if they were fed normally?
We have clarified this point in the materials and methods (page 6, lines 126-127, 131, 135; page 7, line
142). Causes of death in control groups would mostly be natural causes, such as aging, in conjunction
with possible stress caused by collection. Colonies can survive for considerable times in the lab (even
through hibernation).
P6 L45-L54:
I suggest to change the aim by taking inbreeding out, since there is no information on the gene
expression profiles for the candidate genes in non-inbred conditions. The aim would be: to verify
whether starvation affects gene expression.
Here we beg to disagree. Our study population contains many colonies of ants ranging from non-inbred
(HL close to zero) to highly inbred (HL ca 0.5). Inbreeding has been shown to influence various fitness
parameters in this population (pages 4-5, lines 82-93). Our experiments contained colonies from the
entire range of inbreeding values (including non-inbred ones). Therefore, we would argue that our
analysis of inbreeding does contribute to our study, albeit the outcome suggests there is no effect.
P7 L50:
Which Vitellogenin was used as candidate gene - several ants are known to have several vitellogenins?
Thank you for noticing this important point. Ants indeed have multiple vitellogenins. In this study we
used VG1, which is homologous to the one found in honey bees. We have added this to the manuscript
(page 8, line 172).
P7 L55-60 and P8 L3:
Why were not the three housekeeping genes used for all samples and why was RPS9 chosen as
endogenous control if it was differentially expressed between tissues?
Working with this natural population, we found that the other tested housekeeping genes were not
expressed in a stable manner, and were thus not suited for our study (page 8, lines 174-176). RPS9 did
show stable expression, although not between tissues. This still allowed us to answer our question of how
gene expression is affected within the two separate tissues, and it also allows for analysing the
interaction of tissue and starvation, as interactions do not rely on the ‘base’ level of expression, but on
the direction of change.
P8 L15-29:
Were all qPCR run in a single or between multiple plates? If multiple, how was it done to normalise
between plates?
Due to the large amount of samples, qPCR was done in multiple plates. To account for inter-plate
variation, we added the house keeping gene to each plate and each sample (page 8, lines 182-184.
P9 L21-28:
What was the purpose of using a housekeeping gene: stabilize gene expression between treatments
only, or between tissues as well?
A housekeeping gene that shows stable expression between both tissue and treatments would certainly
have been preferred. However, we could not find such a stable gene. This most likely has to do with our
study system being a natural population, which brings with it high variation. Therefore, we had to use
the next best thing, a housekeeping gene stably expressed between treatment, but not tissue. This
allowed for analysing the effect of treatment within each tissue, as well as analysing if there was a
significant difference in how the tissues reacted to the treatment (the interaction between tissue and
treatment). The only thing we cannot analyse/interpret is potential differences in the baseline of
expression between tissues. We now clarify this in the results (page 9-10, lines 206-211).
P11 L1-L23:
Is not possible that the housekeeping gene is down regulated, and that's why we are seeing an overall
down-regulation pattern for candidate genes?
The housekeeping gene shows stable expression across treatments (control vs starvation). Thus, any
effect seen would be due to actual differences in gene expression of the genes of interest (page 9, line
206).
P11 L58 and P12 L3-L7:
According to P9 L21-L25, how can tissue-specific responses to inbreeding be accurately measured if
the housekeeping gene was differentially expressed in both tissues sampled?
Tissue-specific responses are analysed through an interaction. An interaction does not take into account
the baseline of expression (which we cannot analyse due to differential expression between tissues), but
analyses the direction of change in gene expression, depending on tissue. As an example, a gene could
be much more expressed in the midgut than in the abdomen. However, the interaction analyses if the
effect of starvation is different depending on the tissue. Thus, if after starvation, gene expression went
down in the midgut, but remained stable in the abdomen, this would manifest itself as a significant
interaction, which can be analysed even if the baselines themselves cannot be compared. We have now
clarified this in the results section (page 9-10, lines 206-211).
Minor issues:
P4 L13:
typo: ‘in’ written twice.
We have now removed the 2nd ‘in’.
P6 L10:
typo: two full-stops at the end of the sentence.
The extra full-stop has now been removed (page 6, line 126).
P9 L13:
I couldn’t find fig. S1.
This was a mistake and should have been figure 1. We have removed the S (page 9, line 203).
P9 L57:
typo: 'There’ must be replaced by ‘their’.
This is corrected in the new version of the manuscript (page 10, line 224).
P11 L5:
As genus, 'Drosophila' should be written in italic.
Drosophila is now italicized (page 11, line 250).
