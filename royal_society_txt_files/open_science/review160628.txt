This paper has a lot of interesting findings, relating to the potential dynamics of Trichoderma
spp. associated with leaf-cutter ants. Diverse approaches were employed. I did find it difficult to
fully evaluate the science of the study because of missing details on the methods and other issues
related to the presentation. I do feel that addressing this will result in this being a nice
contribution to the field. I’ll point these out as it relates to the three main findings, as follows:
1) Trichoderma in leaf material. This experiment involved substantial sampling and found a
significant difference in abundance of Trichoderma in rejected leaves versus leaves entering the
nest. This is interesting, but I do think the authors should address two aspects. First, the incidence
of Trichoderma is extremely low—just 1.1%. Is this really biological relevant? Second, the
material going into the nest was relatively fresh, while the rejected leaves could be significantly
‘less fresh’. Did the researchers make any efforts or have any knowledge on how long these leaf
fragments might have been sitting on the ground and if that might have impacted their results?
2) Testing endophytism. It might be helpful to add some info on how standard these methods are
and the expectations of such a method.
3) Behavior of ants in presence of Trichoderma. This is a critical part of the work conducted.
However, the details on the experiment are too vague. It is not clear the number of colonies. It
sounds like they measured ant death and garden, but it is not very clear. It is not clear the
relevance why ant survivorship is really relevant, as isn’t the issue garden health? I also have
concerns regarding the stability of the sub-colonies. I guess I wonder if Trichoderma might only
have an effect of speeding up the decline of the sub-colony that is already deteriorating (i.e., no
effect would be found if the garden/colony is healthy). This would fit with the work by Currie
and Stuart 2001, which showed that in healthy intact colonies worker ants appear to be able to
readily groom out Trichoderma. I don’t think this means the results are not still interesting, just
that they should address this potential.

This manuscript brings interesting results regarding the interaction between endophytic fungi
and the leafcutter ant, Atta sexdens rubropilosa. Results indicated high prevalence of
Trichoderma species in the leaf material rejected by ant colonies. In addition, the mutualistic
fungus grown by the ants inhibited the same Trichoderma species in vitro. Collectively, these
results support the idea that Trichoderma threatens the ant-fungus symbiosis and that ant
workers are able to recognize and eliminate this threat during quality control of the leaf
substratum. The manuscript is well written and nice to read. Although original and relevant
results are presented in this work, I have some concerns:
General comments
1. Line 95-97: “…is Trichoderma recognized as a threat to this (second) system and, if so, what
mechanisms are involved, does it truly pose a threat?”. This work pursued a long deemed
question in attine ant research. I feel this research question is not explored in the discussion (I
couldn’t grasp the answer), instead that section is devoted to argue the “bodyguard hypothesis”
(not mentioned in the introduction). Why not explored this hypothesis as the main focus of the
study?
2. Results showed that Trichoderma species are inhibited by Leucoagaricus and that mini-
colonies treated with these fungi did not significantly differed in general aspects with control
colonies. Based on these results, does Trichoderma truly pose a threat to ant colonies? That’s why
I believe the proposed research question was not explored in this study.
3. L. 91-92: I disagree with this statement because not all Trichoderma species are “obligate”
mycoparasites of the fungi cultivated by attines. Some of the species found in this study are
mycoparasites and some are not. In addition, no specific experiment was carried out to address
whether the Trichoderma species are mycoparasites. Thus, I suggest removing this word from the
title, abstract and also revising its proper use in the entire manuscript.
4. L. 255-256: If few Trichoderma isolates were obtained in the substratum carried by ant workers,
how one can explain the high abundance of this fungus in the rejected material? My concern here
is that some of the isolated Trichoderma from the rejected leaves could have come from the soil
where the leaves were in contact with prior sampling. Thus, soil-borne Trichoderma might have
colonized the leaves (as a general saprobe). How long the leaves were sitting in the nest entrances
before sampling? This might explains why the rate of endophytism found in this study was low. I
would add a discussion on this matter.
5. L. 274-282: To answer the proposed research question I wonder why the growth rate of the
mutualistic fungus was not assessed? If the idea is to use Trichoderma in a Trojan-horse
management, thus which Trichoderma isolate has an impact on the mutualistic fungus?
6. L. 299-304: All colonies incorporated rice containing Trichoderma conidia in the fungus
garden? Did the ants avoid rice with spores? Did the rice have spores on its surface? I believe
more details should be provided in this part.
Specific comments
L. 31-32: please, revise this statement (suggest offer ?).
4
L. 33: “…mycoparasite Trichoderma”: not all species obtained in this study are mycoparasites.
Please remove “mycoparasite”.
L. 71-72: Remove “to give some examples”.
L. 88: remove “leaf-cutting ants” and write only “Atta laevigata” so that it does not generalize to
all leafcutters.
L. 109: In this statement it is better to made clear what substratum was “sampled”.
L. 121-122: please, inform the amount of antibiotic used.
L. 140: to be more specific replace “genomic region” to “gene” as elongation factor is a gene.
L. 143-144: please, describe all the conditions used for PCR. If reference #30 has these conditions,
please, made it clear in the text.
L. 178-180: What is medium A? Reference #35 does not mention the name “medium A”.
L. 185: What are “plugs”? Are they mycelium fragments of the mutualistic fungus and
Trichoderma? The term “plugs” does not seem the best one. Also revise this term in other parts of
the manuscript.
L. 212-235: I believe more information should be included in this part to describe the experiment:
how many colonies were used per treatment? Did all minicolonies have brood?
L. 217: replace “food” for “leaves”
L. 262-263: please, provide the supplementary material.
L. 311-312: please see my general comment #3.
L. 352-353: “…due to potential adverse effects on Leucoagaricus”. It would be interesting to
analyze the growth rate of the mutualistic fungus in the presence of Trichoderma.
Table 1: Trichoderma endophyticum is mentioned in lines 287-289 but there is none listed in the
table. Please, revise.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The author begin to address my comments, but I feel the paper still needs to be modified, as
follows:
1. Incidence of Trichoderma. I found the authors response less than compelling. The authors
should add text to the discuss pointing out to the reader low incidence found in leaves and then
address how this fits with their argument about the 'Trojan Horse', both in terms of making the
case for support for the idea, but also the limitations.
2. Behavior of ants.
The added details helps a lot, including clarifying that this is ant survivorship. But, there is still
confusing. They state in the response that they didn't measure garden health, but in the figure
legend they note colony death was determined by death of the mutualistic fungus. If they have it,
as they state they do, death of mutualist fungus should be given, as ant survivorship is directly
linked to this.
The reference added to support the sub-colonies being stabile is not helpful, as it doesn't negate
the obvious lack of stability as indicated by their own data (i.e., ant survivorship dramatically
decreases within 14 days in their controls). Please address by removing reference and instead
adding discussion on the limitations of their approach based on lack of stability to the text.
Given the authors indicate that this is paper is about ant behavior, they should add to the
discussion how their work fits with the findings of Currie and Stuart 2001, which supports leaf-
cutters being able to easily groom out Trichoderma.

All my comments and suggestions were addressed by the authors. I'm satisfied with the new
version of the manuscript. Great job! I only have minor comments that authors are invited to
consider:
L. 93 and 336: I believe the following work would also fit as reference for the present manuscript:
Montoya et al. (2016) Unraveling Trichoderma species in the attine ant environment: description
of three new taxa. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, v. 109, 633-651. 10.1007/s10482-016-0666-9. This
paper described the existence of several Trichoderma species in attine ant colonies and also made
comments on the ecology of this fungus. Thus, it is a nice addition to the present manuscript.
L. 103: remove "(Mata Atlantica)"... this term is already described in the preceding words
"Atlantic forest".
L. 114: Following my general comment #4 (see previous review - reviewer 1), I believe a specific
statement should be included regarding the state of degradation of the rejected material. This will
probably satisfy potential readers that question whether rejected material was already degraded
before sampling. I only highlight this issue because reviewer #2 and I made similar comments.
L. 156-157: this statement is not clear, please, revise.
L. 219: "ant in"

case for support for the idea, but also the limitations.
2. Behavior of ants.
The added details helps a lot, including clarifying that this is ant survivorship. But, there is still
confusing. They state in the response that they didn't measure garden health, but in the figure
legend they note colony death was determined by death of the mutualistic fungus. If they have it,
as they state they do, death of mutualist fungus should be given, as ant survivorship is directly
linked to this.
The reference added to support the sub-colonies being stabile is not helpful, as it doesn't negate
the obvious lack of stability as indicated by their own data (i.e., ant survivorship dramatically
decreases within 14 days in their controls). Please address by removing reference and instead
adding discussion on the limitations of their approach based on lack of stability to the text.
Given the authors indicate that this is paper is about ant behavior, they should add to the
discussion how their work fits with the findings of Currie and Stuart 2001, which supports leaf-
cutters being able to easily groom out Trichoderma.

Comments to the Author(s)
All my comments and suggestions were addressed by the authors. I'm satisfied with the new
version of the manuscript. Great job! I only have minor comments that authors are invited to
consider:
L. 93 and 336: I believe the following work would also fit as reference for the present manuscript:
Montoya et al. (2016) Unraveling Trichoderma species in the attine ant environment: description
14
of three new taxa. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, v. 109, 633-651. 10.1007/s10482-016-0666-9. This
paper described the existence of several Trichoderma species in attine ant colonies and also made
comments on the ecology of this fungus. Thus, it is a nice addition to the present manuscript.
L. 103: remove "(Mata Atlantica)"... this term is already described in the preceding words
"Atlantic forest".
L. 114: Following my general comment #4 (see previous review - reviewer 1), I believe a specific
statement should be included regarding the state of degradation of the rejected material. This will
probably satisfy potential readers that question whether rejected material was already degraded
before sampling. I only highlight this issue because reviewer #2 and I made similar comments.
L. 156-157: this statement is not clear, please, revise.
L. 219: "ant in"
L. 274: very important correction: replace "3,000" to "6,000".

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript brings interesting results regarding the interaction between endophytic fungi
and the leafcutter ant, Atta sexdens rubropilosa. Results indicated high prevalence of
Trichoderma species in the leaf material rejected by ant colonies. In addition, the mutualistic
fungus grown by the ants inhibited the same Trichoderma species in vitro. Collectively, these
results support the idea that Trichoderma threatens the ant-fungus symbiosis and that ant
workers are able to recognize and eliminate this threat during quality control of the leaf
substratum. The manuscript is well written and nice to read. Although original and relevant
results are presented in this work, I have some concerns:
General comments
1. Line 95-97: “…is Trichoderma recognized as a threat to this (second) system and, if so,
what mechanisms are involved, does it truly pose a threat?”. This work pursued a long
deemed question in attine ant research. I feel this research question is not explored in the
discussion (I couldn’t grasp the answer), instead that section is devoted to argue the
“bodyguard hypothesis” (not mentioned in the introduction). Why not explored this
hypothesis as the main focus of the study?
*** We have amended the Introduction to include the ‘bodyguard hypothesis’ and the
‘Trojan horse strategy’ (L.95-98). And, highlight the well-documented properties that
Trichoderma species possess to pose a threat to the symbiont (L. 90-93). As mentioned in the
Discussion, this is a preliminary study to assess ant reaction to the presence of Trichoderma
which is being followed up by testing the bodyguard hypothesis. Since the actual mechanisms
involved were not investigated in our study – as the Reviewer has noted - this objective has
been removed from the questions posed at the end of the Introduction.
2. Results showed that Trichoderma species are inhibited by Leucoagaricus and that mini-
colonies treated with these fungi did not significantly differed in general aspects with control
why I believe the proposed research question was not explored in this study.
*** See above on the amended aims of the study: we have established that Trichoderma is
perceived as a threat by the rejection of endophytic Trichoderma from the nest and that
Leucoagaricus reacts to the presence of Trichoderma.
3. L. 91-92: I disagree with this statement because not all Trichoderma species are “obligate”
mycoparasites of the fungi cultivated by attines. Some of the species found in this study are
mycoparasites and some are not. In addition, no specific experiment was carried out to
address whether the Trichoderma species are mycoparasites. Thus, I suggest removing this
word from the title, abstract and also revising its proper use in the entire manuscript.
*** Yes, we agree that this was misapplied and the term mycoparasite has been removed
from title and text (L. 1,34,41,94,319,328,412). And, as stated above, we did not investigate
the mechanisms involved but give examples of how Trichoderma act as antagonists,
particularly in reference to the Agaricales. By implication, therefore, the same mechanisms
are considered to be operating in the Trichoderma-Leucoagaricus association.
4. L. 255-256: If few Trichoderma isolates were obtained in the substratum carried by ant
workers, how one can explain the high abundance of this fungus in the rejected material? My
concern here is that some of the isolated Trichoderma from the rejected leaves could have
come from the soil where the leaves were in contact with prior sampling. Thus, soil-borne
Trichoderma might have colonized the leaves (as a general saprobe). How long the leaves
were sitting in the nest entrances before sampling? This might explains why the rate of
endophytism found in this study was low. I would add a discussion on this matter.
*** We think that the reviewer has misinterpreted the results of the study: there is a ‘high
abundance’ of Trichoderma in the rejected material because the ants selectively remove the
material containing this fungus – that was the basis of our first study [22] that showed clear
differences in the guilds of endophytes in the leaves being carried into the nests compared
with rejected leaves. The rejected leaves would have been on the soil for between 1-6 days
(period between collections), but since the leaf material was not degraded – due to this short
exposure time – and the Trichoderma isolates were identified as endophytic strains (based on
DNA sequencing, see phylogenetic trees, Fig. 2), we are confident that they are not from the
soil.
5. L. 274-282: To answer the proposed research question I wonder why the growth rate of the
mutualistic fungus was not assessed? If the idea is to use Trichoderma in a Trojan-horse
management, thus which Trichoderma isolate has an impact on the mutualistic fungus?
*** Yes, as stated previously, the threat/mechanism/ impact on Leucoagaricus was not
investigated and the search is still on for more antagonistic Trichoderma isolates with higher
endophytic ability. Most isolates eventually overgrew and colonised the symbiont
demonstrating their antagonistic potential and this is expanded upon in the text (L. 290-294;
367-368). It is worth pointing out that the growth rate of Leucoagaricus is more or less an
order of magnitude slower than that of Trichoderma, so we would not expect any observable
and meaningful differences in Leucoagaricus growth in vitro.
garden? Did the ants avoid rice with spores? Did the rice have spores on its surface? I believe
more details should be provided in this part.
*** Yes, all colonies incorporated the rice containing Trichoderma: in other words, the ants
did not avoid the spores in the rice. This is now clarified in the text (L.318-319). Regarding
the presence of spores on the rice surface, we tried to use rice without spores for the pre-test,
but this was not possible.
L. 31-32: please, revise this statement (suggest offer ?).
*** Done (L. 30)
L. 33: “…mycoparasite Trichoderma”: not all species obtained in this study are
mycoparasites. Please remove “mycoparasite”.
*** Done – all references to mycoparasite removed (L. 1,34,41,94,319,328,412)
L. 71-72: Remove “to give some examples”.
*** Done (L. 73-74)
L. 88: remove “leaf-cutting ants” and write only “Atta laevigata” so that it does not
generalize to all leafcutters.
*** Done (L. 91)
L. 109: In this statement it is better to made clear what substratum was “sampled”.
*** Done (L. 112)
L. 121-122: please, inform the amount of antibiotic used.
*** Done (L. 123)
L. 140: to be more specific replace “genomic region” to “gene” as elongation factor is a gene.
*** Done (L. 141)
L. 143-144: please, describe all the conditions used for PCR. If reference #30 has these
conditions, please, made it clear in the text.
*** Done (L.143-146)
L. 178-180: What is medium A? Reference #35 does not mention the name “medium A”.
*** Done – rephrased sentence to offer details of the medium rather than referring to
‘medium A’ (L.180-183)
L. 185: What are “plugs”? Are they mycelium fragments of the mutualistic fungus and
Trichoderma? The term “plugs” does not seem the best one. Also revise this term in other
parts of the manuscript.
*** Done – replaced by disc (taken with a cork borer) (L. 182,191,192,194,195,242,243)
L. 212-235: I believe more information should be included in this part to describe the
experiment: how many colonies were used per treatment? Did all minicolonies have brood?
*** Done – more detail included (L. 217-220)
*** Done (L. 224)
L. 262-263: please, provide the supplementary material.
*** We apologize for this mistake and we will add the file with resubmission. Its omission
was an oversight at first submisssion.
L. 311-312: please see my general comment #3.
*** Done (see above, response to #3.)
L. 352-353: “…due to potential adverse effects on Leucoagaricus”. It would be interesting to
analyze the growth rate of the mutualistic fungus in the presence of Trichoderma.
*** See above (response to #5).
Table 1: Trichoderma endophyticum is mentioned in lines 287-289 but there is none listed in
the table. Please, revise.
*** Done (L. 307-308)

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper has a lot of interesting findings, relating to the potential dynamics of Trichoderma
spp. associated with leaf-cutter ants. Diverse approaches were employed. I did find it difficult
to fully evaluate the science of the study because of missing details on the methods and other
issues related to the presentation. I do feel that addressing this will result in this being a nice
contribution to the field. I’ll point these out as it relates to the three main findings, as follows:
1) Trichoderma in leaf material. This experiment involved substantial sampling and found a
significant difference in abundance of Trichoderma in rejected leaves versus leaves entering
the nest. This is interesting, but I do think the authors should address two aspects. First, the
incidence of Trichoderma is extremely low—just 1.1%. Is this really biological relevant?
*** As stated in the text, Trichoderma is predominantly an endophyte of woody tissues – its
natural incidence in leaves is low but its presence in leaves and the apparent recognition of
this by the ants is relevant to the proposed strategy. Suitable isolates would be exploited to
inoculate crop plants and thus artificially raise the incidence of Trichoderma. This is how any
inundative biological control strategy is achieved. We also discuss the possibility that ants
may avoid those plants that harbour high populations of Trichoderma but this would be a
separate and complicated study. Thus far, our published results show that, as expected,
Trichoderma has a predeliction for woody tissues – our unpublished work shows that there is
great variation between plant groups, for example, the stems of tree ferns are dominated by
Trichoderma - but its occurrence in leaves, albeit at a much lower incidence, is still
biologically relevant. In addition, to those trees that do harbour Trichoderma, protection from
leafcutters would be of high biological relevance, and we have added a comment to this effect
(L348-349).
be significantly ‘less fresh’. Did the researchers make any efforts or have any knowledge on
how long these leaf fragments might have been sitting on the ground and if that might have
impacted their results?
*** See response to Reviewer 1 (#4.)
2) Testing endophytism. It might be helpful to add some info on how standard these methods
are and the expectations of such a method.
*** Done – discussion added on the drawbacks to the inoculation method employed (L. 425-
428).
3) Behavior of ants in presence of Trichoderma. This is a critical part of the work conducted.
However, the details on the experiment are too vague. It is not clear the number of colonies.
It sounds like they measured ant death and garden, but it is not very clear. It is not clear the
relevance why ant survivorship is really relevant, as isn’t the issue garden health? I also have
concerns regarding the stability of the sub-colonies. I guess I wonder if Trichoderma might
only have an effect of speeding up the decline of the sub-colony that is already deteriorating
(i.e., no effect would be found if the garden/colony is healthy). This would fit with the work
by Currie and Stuart 2001, which showed that in healthy intact colonies worker ants appear to
be able to readily groom out Trichoderma. I don’t think this means the results are not still
interesting, just that they should address this potential.
***We have included the number of colonies (L 217) and are grateful to the referee for
spotting this oversight As the aim of the experiment was to investigate “The behaviour of
leaf-cutting ants in the presence of Trichoderma” (L.219), rather than the health of the fungal
garden, this was not a parameter that was measured. In hindsight, perhaps this parameter
should also have been included.
***We wanted to know how the ants would behave when supplied with substrate colonised
by Trichoderma as a first step to developing a control strategy. As shown, the worker ants did
not recognise Trichoderma as a threat and took the bait into the colony. There is increasing
evidence that there is a quality-control area within the nest [22] and it is at this stage when
any threat to colony health is perceived. Probably in these smaller laboratory colonies this
quality-control area is not yet established, which is why the workers continue to take the rice.
The results show that Trichoderma affects the colony – either directly or indirectly leading to
ant mortality - and thus survival is a relevant parameter to measure.
***Regarding the doubts raised about the use and stability of mini-colonies, we have
included a new reference (Jaccoud et al. 1999) (L.247-248). This study concluded that mini-
colonies are stable and viable experimental units, since ant behaviour was the same as that in
colonies with a queen.
