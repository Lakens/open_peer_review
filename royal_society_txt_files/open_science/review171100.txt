The paper is really interesting and well written. I'd like to highlight the following points:
1) the paper is complex due to the large amount of experimental analysis that have been
performed, perhaps a scheme of al the performed activities could help to better understand the
work.
2) I don't understand how the authors calculated the stresses, in particular if the applied loads are
divided by the the area the calculated values are different with respect the remote stresses (pag
7).
3) more details on the values of the maximum stresses, sigmahmax, are needed
4) the obtained results are interesting, but they are very specific, depending on materials, applied
loads.. Do the authors consider how to extend the obtained results to other different conditions?

This is a well-written paper, describing a competent piece of research. I have the following minor
comments:
1. There are relatively few fatigue results. Please provide the actual lives as well as the median
and range. It would also be good to give the standard deviation for each series.
2. More explanation should be given regarding the decision to use different loads for the different
types of specimen. At first sight this just complicates interpretation of the results.
3. Please state explicitly the length of the ‘first crack’ which was observed.
4. On p11, the authors say that the trends in delta K_effective and in growth rate are ‘very
similar’. What one might have expected is to plot all data as da/dN against delta K_eff to see if
they collapse onto a single curve. Could this be done and commented upon?
5. The authors discuss the plastic zone size, but do not say explicitly whether it is the cyclic or
monotonic zone which is being considered. From the method used, I assume it is the former.
6. I am not quite sure what fig 7 is really supposed to show. The cyclic plastic zone may be small,
but what about the monotonic zone which is approximately four times as large. Then, one has the
plastic wake, which will stretch back along the crack. If these were shown, the region affected by
crack-associated plasticity will be much larger. Please comment.

Comments to the Authors:
General comments:
I enjoyed reading the paper and the subject matter is of sufficient interest for me to recommend
publication provided certain point as listed below are considered and acted upon.
1. The manuscript needs to be edited to improve technical clarity – the terminology is not
always as precise as it could be. Some key concerns include:
a. The stress redistribution following the compressive overload is described as a stress
relaxation. This is confusing as it suggests a creep based mechanism and doesn’t well
describe the process occurring here. Why is this not simply described as a
redistribution or modification of the stress profile?
b. One of the findings is a ‘suppression of the plastic zone’. This not really correct –
there is a reduction in crack tip plastic zone size due to the compressive residual
stress field, the associated Kres distribution and the reduction in Keff, max
c. The compressive overload is simply described as a fatigue load. This makes it difficult
to separate portions of the manuscript where the impact of this compressive
overload is being described and sections where the impact of crack propagation is
discussed. In general, these sections should be better separated.
d. The manuscript too frequently relies on vague qualifiers (e.g. probably, about) in
place of quantifiable values or statements.
2. The results and, in particular, the associated figures, need more care and attention. Figure
captions are not descriptive enough, axis labels are not always included and some of the
figures are potentially superfluous (i.e. do not add value or are essentially repeats).
Abstract:
The abstract should be reworked to improve the dissemination of the manuscript’s findings. The
points noted in the general comments section (particularly point 1.) are most broadly applicable
here.
Introduction/Background:
The introduction and background provide a good, generalized overview of the subject and
techniques employed. They also provide a clear rationale for the subsequent work.
1. The description of the use of weight functions is not quite correct. The weight function
method is used to calculate Kres from sres. You then superpose Kres on Kapp to give you Keff.
2. Although trivial, it might be helpful to show the equation used to calculate strain from the
change in lattice spacing. Note that you are measuring d0 not do as you state later in the text.
Experimental Description:
The experimental description was generally good although there are a few areas of concern, where
the method was either unclear or potentially flawed. These need to be addressed properly.
1. A larger Papp, max is used for the un-expanded samples relative to the cold-expanded samples.
Although the authors state that this was to ensure the yield stress was not exceeded in each
of the respective samples, it is unclear why both set of tests were not completed at the
lower stress. Ultimately, results are presented in terms of Keff but no mention is made of the
fact that Kapp is not the same in all samples.
2. How exactly was stress computed from strain – what assumptions were used (plane
stress/plane strain). Please include the equation used for this.
3. Was the Youngs modulus a plane specific value i.e. Ehkl? If not, does the 311 plane have a
stress-strain response similar to the global response?
4. It would be helpful if the caption for Table 2 noted that sh,max was a linear superposition of
sres and sapp. This is mentioned in the text but is not immediately apparent when looking at
this table.
Results:
The results themselves are generally good and broadly meet the aims of the work but the figures
need to be improved.
1. The upper, middle and lower sub-figure descriptors are not particularly helpful. I would
prefer each sub figure to be individually labelled with letters.
2. In the text it would be helpful to the reader if the sub-figures were referred to directly i.e.
refer to Figure 5c and 5d not just Figure 5, which contains 6 sub-figures.
3. The captions for many of the figures are not descriptive enough. They should be more
explicit. For example, in Figure 5 (middle) it should be made clear that <U+0394>Keff has been
calculated from TSA measurements.
4. I’m not sure how helpful Figure 4 is. The (upper) sub-figures are essentially reproduced in
Figure 5 (upper). Could the most pertinent details from this not be added to Table 3 (e.g.
number of cycles for crack initiation)?
5. Figure 6 should have axis labels and ideally be converted from pixels to mm.
6. It is very difficult to see any changes in residual stress distribution in the maps in Figure 8 –
does this Figure add value? The data is replicated in the line profiles in Figure 10 and much
easier to assess in that instance.
7. The rationale behind the FCG rate minima is explained by a change in crack tip stress state
driven by the variation in applied stress (due to the stress concentrator) and in change in
residual stress wrt. crack length. It would be interesting to see these stress profiles plotted
against one another – this would be a more robust way to defend this assumption.
Conclusions:
The conclusions in themselves are reasonable but the terminology and approach should be
improved in line with the general comments.

AUTHORS’ RESPONSES TO REVIEWERS’ COMMENTS
Reviewer #1:
The paper is really interesting and well written. I'd like to highlight the following points:
1. The paper is complex due to the large amount of experimental analysis that have been
performed, perhaps a scheme of all the performed activities could help to better understand the
work.
<U+F0D8> The structure of the manuscript has been clarified by numbering the sections which should help
readers to navigate the different analysis sections. In addition, a new paragraph has been
introduced at the start of the description of the experimental work, which provides an overview
of the experimental analyses.
2. I don't understand how the authors calculated the stresses, in particular if the applied loads are
divided by the area the calculated values are different with respect the remote stresses (pag 7).
<U+F0D8> Thank you for highlighting the difference. Yes, the remote stresses were calculated by dividing
the applied loads by the cross-sectional area of the specimen. The difference is due to the fact
that the actual thickness of the specimen was measured to be slightly different than the nominal
thickness of the sheet from which they were manufactured. The measured specimen thickness
has been provided on page 7.
3. More details on the values of the maximum stresses, sigmahmax, are needed
<U+F0D8> The method of determining sh,max has been described in more detail on page 8.
4. The obtained results are interesting, but they are very specific, depending on materials, applied
loads. Do the authors consider how to extend the obtained results to other different conditions?
<U+F0D8> An addition paragraph on the applicability of the results to other materials and loading scenarios
has been included on page 17-18 of the revised manuscript.
Reviewer #2:
General comments:
I enjoyed reading the paper and the subject matter is of sufficient interest for me to recommend
publication provided certain point as listed below are considered and acted upon.

1. The manuscript needs to be edited to improve technical clarity – the terminology is not always
as precise as it could be. Some key concerns include:
a. The stress redistribution following the compressive overload is described as a stress
relaxation. This is confusing as it suggests a creep based mechanism and doesn’t well
describe the process occurring here. Why is this not simply described as a
redistribution or modification of the stress profile?
<U+F0D8> The term ‘stress relaxation’ is the common parlance in the literature, see for
examples references 13, 16 and 17, which was our reason for using it. However, we
appreciate that in some circumstances it could be associated with creep-based
mechanisms. Hence, we have added ‘or redistribution’ when stress relaxation is first
mentioned in the abstract and conclusions, as well as including it more frequently in
the body of the manuscript.
b. One of the findings is a ‘suppression of the plastic zone’. This not really correct –
there is a reduction in crack tip plastic zone size due to the compressive residual
stress field, the associated Kres distribution and the reduction in Keff, max
<U+F0D8> We have replaced the word ‘suppression’ with ‘reduction’ as suggested.
c. The compressive overload is simply described as a fatigue load. This makes it difficult
to separate portions of the manuscript where the impact of this compressive
overload is being described and sections where the impact of crack propagation is
discussed. In general, these sections should be better separated.
<U+F0D8> The structure of the manuscript has been made more explicit; and, in addition, it has
been made clear throughout the manuscript that a single compressive load was
applied rather than a compressive fatigue load.
d. The manuscript too frequently relies on vague qualifiers (e.g. probably, about) in
place of quantifiable values or statements.
<U+F0D8> Two of the three occurrences of ‘probably’ have been deleted; ‘about’ was used a
qualifier eight times and five of these have been deleted.
2. The results and, in particular, the associated figures, need more care and attention. Figure
captions are not descriptive enough, axis labels are not always included and some of the figures
are potentially superfluous (i.e. do not add value or are essentially repeats).
<U+F0D8> These issues have been addressed in the revised manuscript. Please see our response to
comments 1 - 6 in the ‘Results’ section for more details.
Abstract:
The abstract should be reworked to improve the dissemination of the manuscript’s findings. The
points noted in the general comments section (particularly point 1.) are most broadly applicable
here.
<U+F0D8> The points noted in the general comments have been implemented in the abstract and the
abstract has been reworked, as suggested.
2
Introduction/Background:
The introduction and background provide a good, generalized overview of the subject and
techniques employed. They also provide a clear rationale for the subsequent work.
1. The description of the use of weight functions is not quite correct. The weight function method
is used to calculate Kres from sres. You then superpose Kres on Kapp to give you Keff.
<U+F0D8> Thank you for highlighting the ambiguity in our description. We have reworded it to make it
clearer.
2. Although trivial, it might be helpful to show the equation used to calculate strain from the
change in lattice spacing. Note that you are measuring d0 not do as you state later in the text.
<U+F0D8> The equation has been included, as suggested; and the mistake in the subscript has been
corrected.
Experimental Description:
The experimental description was generally good although there are a few areas of concern, where
the method was either unclear or potentially flawed. These need to be addressed properly.
1. A larger Papp, max is used for the un-expanded samples relative to the cold-expanded samples.
Although the authors state that this was to ensure the yield stress was not exceeded in each of
the respective samples, it is unclear why both set of tests were not completed at the lower
stress. Ultimately, results are presented in terms of Keff but no mention is made of the fact that
Kapp is not the same in all samples.
<U+F0D8> The maximum applied load for the cold-expanded specimen was higher compared to the un-
expanded specimens. The statement about the applied loads on page 8 has been rewritten to
make it clearer. The reason for applying a relatively lower load on the un-expanded specimens
has also been provided.
2. How exactly was stress computed from strain – what assumptions were used (plane stress/plane
strain). Please include the equation used for this.
<U+F0D8> The stresses were calculated using Hooke’s law. The underlying assumptions and the equations
have been provided on page 10.
3. Was the Youngs modulus a plane specific value i.e. Ehkl? If not, does the 311 plane have a stress-
strain response similar to the global response?
<U+F0D8> The Youngs Modulus was not plane specific. The justification for choosing (311) plane to
determine macroscopic residual strains has been added on page 9.
4. It would be helpful if the caption for Table 2 noted that sh,max was a linear superposition of
sres and sapp. This is mentioned in the text but is not immediately apparent when looking at
this table.
<U+F0D8> Brief description of sh,max has been provided in the caption for Table 2.
Results:
The results themselves are generally good and broadly meet the aims of the work but the figures
need to be improved.
3
1. The upper, middle and lower sub-figure descriptors are not particularly helpful. I would prefer
each sub figure to be individually labelled with letters.
<U+F0D8> The sub-figure descriptors have been included using letters in the revised manuscript.
2. In the text it would be helpful to the reader if the sub-figures were referred to directly i.e. refer
to Figure 5c and 5d not just Figure 5, which contains 6 sub-figures.
<U+F0D8> This has been done, as suggested.
3. The captions for many of the figures are not descriptive enough. They should be more explicit.
For example, in Figure 5 (middle) it should be made clear that <U+0394>Keff has been calculated from
TSA measurements.
<U+F0D8> Additional text has been added to many captions in an effort to make the captions more
descriptive of the data.
4. I’m not sure how helpful Figure 4 is. The (upper) sub-figures are essentially reproduced in Figure
5 (upper). Could the most pertinent details from this not be added to Table 3 (e.g. number of
cycles for crack initiation)?
<U+F0D8> The data in the top row in figure 5 could be deduced from figure 4; however, the authors believe
that it is clearer to present both the data in both formats. In addition, the data in the remainder
of figure 4 allows a comparison to be made between the entry and exit faces of the specimens.
Thus, the authors would prefer to leave figure 4 in the manuscript.
5. Figure 6 should have axis labels and ideally be converted from pixels to mm.
<U+F0D8> The labels on the side and bottom of the squares in figure 6, which is figure 8 in the revised
manuscript, are not strictly axes but indicate the pixels from the data acquisition system. A
conversion to millimetres would imply a Cartesian coordinate system with a common origin,
which would be misleading. Hence, the authors would prefer not to make this change and note
that the magnification is given in the caption.
6. It is very difficult to see any changes in residual stress distribution in the maps in Figure 8 – does
this Figure add value? The data is replicated in the line profiles in Figure 10 and much easier to
assess in that instance.
<U+F0D8> The authors believe that this figure provides value by illustrating the residual stress fields and
providing more context for the discussion of the results. The authors would prefer to include this
detailed data in the manuscript.
7. The rationale behind the FCG rate minima is explained by a change in crack tip stress state
driven by the variation in applied stress (due to the stress concentrator) and in change in
residual stress wrt. crack length. It would be interesting to see these stress profiles plotted
against one another – this would be a more robust way to defend this assumption.
<U+F0D8> Figure 6 (revised numbering) has been added to the revised manuscript to show the suggested
hoop stress profiles and some additional supporting text included.
Conclusions:
The conclusions in themselves are reasonable but the terminology and approach should be
improved in line with the general comments.

<U+F0D8> The conclusions have been modified in line with the general comments, as requested.
Reviewer #3:
This is a well-written paper, describing a competent piece of research. I have the following minor
comments:
1. There are relatively few fatigue results. Please provide the actual lives as well as the median and
range. It would also be good to give the standard deviation for each series.
<U+F0D8> Table 3 has been expanded to include the additional data requested.
2. More explanation should be given regarding the decision to use different loads for the different
types of specimen. At first sight this just complicates interpretation of the results.
<U+F0D8> This issue has been addressed in response to comment #1 under Experimental Description from
reviewer #2.
3. Please state explicitly the length of the ‘first crack’ which was observed.
<U+F0D8> This information has been provided in Table 3.
4. On p11, the authors say that the trends in delta K_effective and in growth rate are ‘very similar’.
What one might have expected is to plot all data as da/dN against delta K_eff to see if they
collapse onto a single curve. Could this be done and commented upon?
<U+F0D8> The da/dN against <U+0394>K plots have been provided in Figures 5e and 5f of the revised manuscript
and they collapse onto a single curve. Some additional supporting text has been added to the
manuscript.
5. The authors discuss the plastic zone size, but do not say explicitly whether it is the cyclic or
monotonic zone which is being considered. From the method used, I assume it is the former.
<U+F0D8> Yes, we believe that cyclic plastic zones are being evaluated by the TSA system; this has been
clarified when the measurement technique is introduced in the manuscript.
6. I am not quite sure what fig 7 is really supposed to show. The cyclic plastic zone may be small,
but what about the monotonic zone which is approximately four times as large. Then, one has
the plastic wake, which will stretch back along the crack. If these were shown, the region
affected by crack-associated plasticity will be much larger. Please comment.
<U+F0D8> We have added information to figure 7, which is figure 9 in the revised manuscript, about the
crack wake based on the plastic zone size at shorter crack lengths and modified the text
according.
