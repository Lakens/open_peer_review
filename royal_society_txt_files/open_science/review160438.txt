Overall I feel that this manuscript contains a well thought out experimental design which
addresses an important topic in ecology and microbiology concerning microbial interactions.
Specific points:
Materials and methods: More detail is needed about the CSLM techniques within this section of
the manuscript or in the supporting information. It is not clear if a fluorescent protein expressing
strain is being used for the experiments or if live/dead staining is being utilised. Also additional
information on how images were taken such as the axis in which the images were taken would be
helpful to the reader to gain an understanding of scale.
Figure legends overall would benefit from additional detail, specifically of the statistical tests
used where *'s mark significant results. Scale bars in figure 2, figure 5 a/b and 6 should be added.
More explicit notes should be made that figures 6 and 7 are generated from data collected from
the author's simulations.
Overall the work was well discussed, but the manuscript would benefit from a wider discussion
of the Pseudomonas and Burkholderia in general, as although observed as environmental
pathogens in this manuscript's context, the work has potential to reach into the pathogenic study
of these species of bacteria.
Additional discussion of the limitations of the author's simulations/model, as well as its potential
to include other variables or organisms could be discussed. Future directions of this study would
also be a welcome addition to this manuscript

Review: deciphering a survival strategy during the interspecific competition between bacillus
cereus MSM-S1 and pseudomonas sp. MSM-M1
Summary of the paper
Having isolated and characterised two bacteria species the authors examined their growth rates
in nutrient broth and semi solid agar plates, this showed that the species MSM-S1 grew to a
higher optical density and a higher CFU than MSM-M1. The authors propose that, as these two
species were isolated at the same location, survival of the slow growing strain seems unlikely.
Co-cultures of the two isolates demonstrated that S1 growth was diminished in the presence of
M1. Seemingly the M1 growth did not increase during the co-culture. The authors examined the
morphology of the S1 cells at the edge closest to the M1 and the other side of the colony using
confocal and SEM. Demonstrating a clear effect on the S1 cells in the form of spore formation and
apparent stress responses. Finally, a model was created which simulates the data and ideas
present in the manuscript and confirms the observations that there is a chemotactic response of
S1 to the presence of M1. The authors propose that this evidence demonstrates there is
production of an inhibitor that acts as a survival strategy of the M1 species.
Issues and criticism
Formatting and style- The line counts do not match the actual lines. There are a number of
formatting errors present.
Typos-
Page 4 line 36 (using incorrect page line numbers), reads ‘inhibitory molecule (s) released’
Should read ‘inhibitory molecule(s) released’
Page 11 line 16 reads ‘(Figure 4a).However’ should read ‘(Figure 4a). However’
Page 15 line 10 reads ‘in (Figure2d). If the’ should read ‘in (Figure2d). If the’
Page 17 line 47 reads ‘MSM-S1and’ should read ‘MSM-S1 and’
Page 18 line 36 reads ‘inhibitor dynamics..’ should read ‘inhibitor dynamics.’
Style-
Page 11 line 27-32 ‘Is it due…’ I feel this could be rewritten as it currently reads a little strangely
to me.
The authors use the phrase ‘on the other hand’ 5 separate times (pages 9, 10, 11,16, and 18.)
Concept
Conceptually the principle that an inhibitor is released as a survival strategy is limited. The
authors make a number of assumptions regarding the evolutionary history of this interaction. It is
framed as a simple production of a X to harm Y. Their experiments suggest to me that S1 is able
4
to detect a cue (likely metabolic) from M1 and avoid growth towards it. Evolutionary this is
different from the production of an inhibitor which I would suggest has to have evolved because
of the function it has on S1. This is highlighted to me in the experiment detailing the same effect
of agar grown in the absence of S1 (as mentioned on page 12 line 5-10). The authors make one
such reference to this idea in their discussion in the final sentence. I would suggest that this is a
crucial hypothesis that requires investigation.
The authors have also not shown if the presumed inhibitor is capable of killing S1. A simple
experiment could be performed to show if that is the case or not. I would also suggest comparing
these results with a well characterised Bacillus cereus for comparison.
With regards to the model, I believe it is sufficient and mostly well-constructed, I would however
question its relevance in this situation. I am unsure exactly how the model informs the
experiment. If the authors believe that it will make predictions or inform future work, they
should state that. A criticism I have of the models construction is the inclusion of a cost for the
production of the inhibitor. It is unclear as to why this is a factor within the model. If the null
hypothesis is that there is no inhibitor instead S1 observes metabolic cues, then I would suggest
M1 is not paying a cost to the production.
References
The use of reference 7 seems out of place when discussing bacterial social evolution theory and
should be removed or in some way bridged to explain how work on social theory in Humans in
applicable to microbes.
Opinion
The authors have performed a solid body of work and I can find no fault with the data presented,
my major concern is the hypothesis that is being suggested. It is with this in mind that I feel the
manuscript should be rejected. As it currently stands I do not believe the experiments conducted
can adequately address the hypothesis the authors have advanced. I suggest that evidence of
regulation in the presence of a competitor or that the production of the chemical is not a
metabolic by-product would strengthen the case for the proposed hypothesis. Further I see an
equally valid argument could be made with the evidence presented as to how S1 survives in the
common niche if it has its growth down regulated in the presence of the M1 inhibitor. Finally, as
so often is asked, identifying the chemical in questions would be a large and substantial boost to
any future work. The authors may wish to refocus this work to address a null hypothesis that this
interaction is not caused by an inhibitor but by a cue.

I suggest we accept with minor revisions but ask them to take the referees comments into
consideration. Specifically I think that they need to rethink their discussion to discuss the idea
that the interaction they are describing could be due to one strain sensing a chemical cue. To
unravel the true interaction would obviously require a huge amount of work but they can
certainly mention this idea in a revised version

Issue 1
“Authors’ Response: We have checked the fate of Bacillus cereus (MSM-S1) cells when they
encountered the inhibitory molecule(s) produced by the Pseudomonas sp. (MSM-M1). We have
performed scanning electron microscopy to see the morphology of S1 cells when they
encountered the inhibitory molecule. Results are presented in figures 4 and 5 which clearly
showed induction of spore formation in Bacillus cereus cells in the presence of molecule(s)
secreted by the Pseudomonas sp. Thus, the growth inhibitory effect of the secreted molecule(s)
was demonstrated. In the revised manuscript, we have compared these results with other report
on Bacillus cereus and incorporated in the Discussion Section (Page: 19, Line: 432-436).”
I still feel this has not addressed my question; does the interaction lead to S1 cell death or just
down regulation of cell growth?
Issue 2
“It seems natural to assume that MSM-M1 incurs a metabolic cost for producing the inhibitor that
inhibits the growth and advance of the MSM-S1 colony and also induced spore formation in
MSM-S1 cells.”
However, the experimental data does not support this claim. Growth inhibition was observed
when S1 was not physically close to m1 as shown in figure 5. This suggests that the inhibitor is
made constantly and not in response to the presence of S1. Investment in a costly inhibitor makes
little sense if it is not regulated in some manner. Further supporting that the inhibitor is not an
inhibitor but a metabolic cue detected by S1.
Issue 3
“As we have demonstrated using our numerical simulations (see mathematical modelling section
and fig.7), neither inhibition of growth rate of MSM-S1 nor inhibition of diffusion rate of MSM-S1
nor a combination of these factors can explain the observed pattern in the absence of negative
chemotactic interaction.”
Have the authors considered a model where negative chemotactic response is replaced by cell
death of S1?
Issue 4
“We therefore disagree with the statement of the referee that “Further I see an equally valid
argument could be made with the evidence presented as to how MSM-S1 survives in the common
niche if it has its growth down regulated in the presence of the MSM-M1 inhibitor.”
I feel I may have not clarified my position here as the response do not seem to address the initial
issue I was raising. In this paper the question is stated as how can M1 survive in the wild if it
grows slower, the evidence presented here shows that some interaction with M1 slows the
apparent growth of S1, this then leads to the question if S1 is now not growing as fast or as
effectively how does it survive in the wild?
Issue 5
“It would be impossible to distinguish between a chemical cue secreted by MSM-M1 as a
metabolic by-product and an inhibitor that MSM-M1 produced as an evolutionary response for
surviving in the same ecological niche as the faster growing MSM-S1, without identifying the
chemical.”
I would disagree and further suggest that the authors have shown good evidence that this is in
fact due to a cue and not an evolved response from M1. Returning to the earlier point showing
that the response still occurs when M1 is grown in the absence of S1 suggests that the response is
not dependent on the presence of a competitor. Further a costly inhibitor could be open to social
11
cheating the authors could easily devise an experiment to search for examples where M1 mutants
do not repulse the S1 then examine if there is social cheating. Under a simple frame work we
would expect an inhibitor to produce a relative fitness advantage for cheats while a cue would
not alter the fitness of either the mutant or ancestor in any relative manner (I.e. a metabolic
mutant might have a different fitness but would not change its relative fitness in the presence of
an ancestor).
I have not checked for typos as thoroughly as my first review but I have noticed one mistake on
page 12 line 256, I think they meant could and not would.

“Overall I feel that this manuscript contains a well thought out experimental design
which addresses an important topic in ecology and microbiology concerning

Authors’ Response: Thank you for appreciating our manuscript for its importance
in understanding ecological and microbiological aspects of bacterial interactions.
Specific points:
“Materials and methods: More detail is needed about the CSLM techniques within
this section of the manuscript or in the supporting information. It is not clear if a
fluorescent protein expressing strain is being used for the experiments or if live/dead
staining is being utilized. Also additional information on how images were taken
such as the axis in which the images were taken would be helpful to the reader to
gain an understanding of scale.”
Authors’ Response: In the revised manuscript, we have incorporated details of the
CSLM techniques. We have incorporated the staining procedure in the detailed
method presented in the ‘Supplementary Section’ and we have incorporated
information about the axis taken in the figure legend/caption (Page: 25 Line: 603-
604) for Figure #3 in the revised version of the main manuscript.
“Figure legends overall would benefit from additional detail, specifically of the
statistical tests used where *'s mark significant results. Scale bars in figure 2, figure
5 a/b and 6 should be added.”
Authors’ Response: We have incorporated the additional details of statistical tests
in the figure legends/captions (Page: 24 & 25, Line: 581 & 597-598) in the revised
manuscript. We have also included scale bars in Figures 2, 5 a/b and 6 (simulation
results) in the revised manuscript.
“More explicit notes should be made that figures 6 and 7 are generated from data
collected from the author's simulations.”
Authors’ Response: We have incorporated notes in the legends/captions for figures
6, 7 and 8 of the revised manuscript which state that the images/figures were
generated based on simulations. (Page: 26, Line: 618-619, 624, 626-627)
“Overall the work was well discussed, but the manuscript would benefit from a wider
discussion of the Pseudomonas and Burkholderia in general, as although observed
as environmental pathogens in this manuscript's context, the work has potential to
reach into the pathogenic study of these species of bacteria.”
Authors’ Response: We have incorporated importance of such studies for the
opportunistic pathogens like Pseudomonas and Burkholderia in the ‘Discussion
section’ of the revised manuscript. (Page: 17, Line: 389-392)
“Additional discussion of the limitations of the author's simulations/model, as well
as its potential to include other variables or organisms could be discussed. Future
directions of this study would also be a welcome addition to this manuscript.”
Authors’ Response: Our mathematical model is quite generic and can be easily
extended to include more interacting species. We have clearly explained the
justification and significance of each of the terms used in the dynamical equations.
The strength of the mathematical model is evident from the fact that it beautifully
reproduces the experimentally observed pattern of the two bacterial colonies,
including the appearance of an inhibition zone. We have also clearly explained how
the mathematical model supplements the experimental results (see response to
Reviewer 2 below). In the revised version of the manuscript, we further discussed
about pros and cons about the model (Page: 19-20 Line: 437-447) and future
direction of this study is also incorporated in the last paragraph (Page: 20 Line: 453-
455) of the ‘Discussion Section’ of the revised manuscript.

Review: deciphering a survival strategy during the interspecific competition between
bacillus cereus MSM-S1 and pseudomonas sp. MSM-M1
Summary of the paper
Having isolated and characterised two bacteria species the authors examined their
growth rates in nutrient broth and semi solid agar plates, this showed that the species
MSM-S1 grew to a higher optical density and a higher CFU than MSM-M1. The
authors propose that, as these two species were isolated at the same location, survival
of the slow growing strain seems unlikely. Co-cultures of the two isolates
demonstrated that S1 growth was diminished in the presence of M1. Seemingly the
M1 growth did not increase during the co-culture. The authors examined the
morphology of the S1 cells at the edge closest to the M1 and the other side of the
colony using confocal and SEM. Demonstrating a clear effect on the S1 cells in the
form of spore formation and apparent stress responses. Finally, a model was created
which simulates the data and ideas present in the manuscript and confirms the
observations that there is a chemotactic response of S1 to the presence of M1. The
authors propose that this evidence demonstrates there is production of an inhibitor
that acts as a survival strategy of the M1 species.

Style-
“Page 11 line 27-32 ‘Is it due…’ I feel this could be rewritten as it currently reads a
little strangely to me.”
Authors’ Response: As suggested, we have changed the style of writing of the
sentence (Page: 11, Line: 240-242) in the revised manuscript.
“The authors use the phrase ‘on the other hand’ 5 separate times (pages 9, 10,
11,16, and 18.)”
Authors’ Response: We have reduced the number of instances of the phrase ‘on the
other hand’ with other appropriate alternative phrases in some sentences.
Concept
“Conceptually the principle that an inhibitor is released as a survival strategy is
limited. The authors make a number of assumptions regarding the evolutionary
history of this interaction. It is framed as a simple production of a X to harm Y. Their
experiments suggest to me that S1 is able to detect a cue (likely metabolic) from M1
and avoid growth towards it. Evolutionary this is different from the production of an
inhibitor which I would suggest has to have evolved because of the function it has on
S1. This is highlighted to me in the experiment detailing the same effect of agar
grown in the absence of S1 (as mentioned on page 12 line 5-10). The authors make
one such reference to this idea in their discussion in the final sentence. I would
suggest that this is a crucial hypothesis that requires investigation.”
Authors’ Response: Yes, we agree that the production of an inhibitor that
specifically evolved as a response to competition from a faster-growing S1 as
opposed to a generic chemical cue released by M1 are two very different things.
However, we emphasize that both have the same effect on regulating the colony
growth dynamics of the two species. With the current set of experiments, we are
unable to delineate what this chemical is. Nevertheless, we are able to show that this
chemical inhibits the colony growth of its competitor towards it, thus leading to the
formation of the observed zone of inhibition. We have added a paragraph in the
discussion section that deals with these issues.
Based on your comment we have modified the Abstract (Page: 2, Line: 28),
Results (Page: 12, Line: 255-259) and Discussion (Page: 19-20, Line: 437-447) in
the revised manuscript.
“The authors have also not shown if the presumed inhibitor is capable of killing S1.
A simple experiment could be performed to show if that is the case or not. I would
also suggest comparing these results with a well characterised Bacillus cereus for
comparison.”
Authors’ Response: We have checked the fate of Bacillus cereus (MSM-S1) cells
when they encountered the inhibitory molecule(s) produced by the Pseudomonas sp.
(MSM-M1). We have performed scanning electron microscopy to see the
morphology of S1 cells when they encountered the inhibitory molecule. Results are
presented in figures 4 and 5 which clearly showed induction of spore formation in
Bacillus cereus cells in the presence of molecule(s) secreted by the Pseudomonas sp.
Thus, the growth inhibitory effect of the secreted molecule(s) was demonstrated. In
the revised manuscript, we have compared these results with other report on Bacillus
cereus and incorporated in the Discussion Section (Page: 19, Line: 432-436).
“With regards to the model, I believe it is sufficient and mostly well-constructed, I
would however question its relevance in this situation. I am unsure exactly how the
model informs the experiment. If the authors believe that it will make predictions or
inform future work, they should state that. A criticism I have of the models
construction is the inclusion of a cost for the production of the inhibitor. It is unclear
as to why this is a factor within the model. If the null hypothesis is that there is no
inhibitor instead S1 observes metabolic cues, then I would suggest M1 is not paying
a cost to the production.”
Authors’ Response: The mathematical model supplements the experimental results
in several ways while successfully reproducing the experimentally observed colony
growth pattern. It allows us to show that negative chemotaxis is crucial for the
formation of the inhibition zone between the two colonies and in determining the
observed shape of the colonies. In the absence of negative chemotaxis, the two
colonies overlap (Fig. 7). The numerical simulations also enable us to confirm that
nutrient depletion alone cannot explain the formation of the inhibition zone since the
two colonies are found to overlap in the absence of the inhibitor. Additionally,
neither inhibition of growth rate of MSM-S1 nor inhibition of diffusion rate of
MSM-S1 or a combination of these factors can explain the observed pattern in the
absence of negative chemotactic interaction. We have stated about the model as
information for future work in the Discussion Section of the revised manuscript
(Page: 20, Line: 446-447).
It seems natural to assume that MSM-M1 incurs a metabolic cost for
producing the inhibitor that inhibits the growth and advance of the MSM-S1 colony
and also induced spore formation in MSM-S1 cells. Definitely, our future studies
will focus on deciphering the chemical nature of the secreted molecule. If this
chemical is only a metabolite then the cost term in our model can be set to zero or a
very low value and checked against other scenarios’, where this chemical is an
inhibitor with a comparatively larger cost of production. As mentioned in our reply
for the previous point we have elaborated the possibility that this chemical can be a
metabolite. However, it is not an essential component for explaining the shape of the
colonies and the presence of an inhibition zone in the present study.
As suggested, we have stated the relevance of the modeling part in the
revised version of the manuscript (Page: 20, Line: 446-447).
References
“The use of reference 7 seems out of place when discussing bacterial social
evolution theory and should be removed or in some way bridged to explain how work
on social theory in Humans in applicable to microbes.”
Authors’ Response: We have removed the reference for the main text and
‘Reference Section’ and have adjusted the ordering of other references in the revised
manuscript accordingly.
Opinion
“The authors have performed a solid body of work and I can find no fault with the
data presented, my major concern is the hypothesis that is being suggested. It is with
this in mind that I feel the manuscript should be rejected. As it currently stands I do
not believe the experiments conducted can adequately address the hypothesis the
authors have advanced. I suggest that evidence of regulation in the presence of a
competitor or that the production of the chemical is not a metabolic by-product
would strengthen the case for the proposed hypothesis. Further I see an equally valid
argument could be made with the evidence presented as to how S1 survives in the
common niche if it has its growth down regulated in the presence of the M1 inhibitor.
Finally, as so often is asked, identifying the chemical in questions would be a large
and substantial boost to any future work. The authors may wish to refocus this work
to address a null hypothesis that this interaction is not caused by an inhibitor but by
a cue.”
Authors’ Response: As we have demonstrated using our numerical simulations (see
mathematical modelling section and fig.7), neither inhibition of growth rate of
MSM-S1 nor inhibition of diffusion rate of MSM-S1 nor a combination of these
factors can explain the observed pattern in the absence of negative chemotactic
interaction. We therefore disagree with the statement of the referee that “Further I
see an equally valid argument could be made with the evidence presented as to how
MSM-S1 survives in the common niche if it has its growth down regulated in the
presence of the MSM-M1 inhibitor.” The issue is not just about the survival of
MSM-S1 but also of the shape of the two colonies resulting from the interactions
between the respective species, the inhibitor and the nutrient.
It would be impossible to distinguish between a chemical cue secreted by
MSM-M1 as a metabolic by-product and an inhibitor that MSM-M1 produced as an
evolutionary response for surviving in the same ecological niche as the faster
growing MSM-S1, without identifying the chemical. The analysis presented here
cannot rule out the former. Nevertheless, since MSM-S1 and MSM-M1 inhabit the
same ecological niche, it is not far-fetched to argue that the chemical inhibitor could
indeed have been an evolutionary response of MSM-M1. Even if the inhibitor turns
out to be a simple metabolic by-product, our analysis which reveals the critical role
played by negative chemotaxis in shaping the colony growth dynamics, remain valid.
Identifying the chemical is beyond the scope of this work but it would indeed be a
fascinating direction to explore in a future work. We have added an additional
paragraph in the discussion section clarifying these issues (Page: 19-20, Line: 437-
447) in the revised manuscript.
