The presented analysis of the channel activity of the Na+,K+-pump induced by interaction with
palytoxin is novel and provides valuable new information about the functioning of the Na+,K+-
pump. The major finding, as described on page 12, is that "it was not possible to reproduce the
behaviour of the single channels induced by PTX when the stochastic model represented the
pump as a monomeric complex (Fig. 3)". To provide an adequate reproduction of the
experimental data, the authors had to allow the possibility that the protein could exist as a
diprotomer.
This is very interesting, but I have a few comments for consideration by the authors.
1. Discussion p. 10 and 12
The authors write on p. 10 "if we admit the Na+/K+ pump functioning as a diprotomer" and on
p. 12 "if the Na/K pump function as a diprotomer". I think these statements are too general. The
authors have only analysed the channel activity of the Na+/K+ pump, not its normal
physiological pump activity. There is a significant amount of data indicating that the Na+/K+
pump can pump ions in its monoprotomeric form (e.g. Cornelius, BBA 1235: 197; Martin and
Sachs, Biochemistry 38: 7485). I think it would be better if the authors were more careful and
stated instead that a description of the channel activity of the Na+/K+ pump induced by
palytoxin requires one to include the formation of diprotomers.
2. ATP binding, p. 12
It seems as if the authors have slightly misinterpreted the work of Clarke (ref 15). In this paper
ATP is first suggested to bind with high affinity to a diprotomer. However, the binding of this
ATP was suggested by Clarke to cause a dissociation of the diprotomer into individual
monoprotomers, so that the second ATP binds with a lower affinity to a monoprotomer. At
physiological ATP levels it was suggested that the monoprotomer is the predominant species
present in the membrane.
3. Palytoxin effects
It's possible that the channel activity induced by palytoxin could be completely unrelated to the
normal pump function of the enzyme. If it is true that palytoxin stabilises a diprotomer, could it
be possible that the formation of a diprotomer actually creates the channel? Could it be that the
channel through which the ions are passing is not in fact the ion transport pathway of the Na+,K+
pump at all, but rather through a channel between Na+,K+ pump molecules created by the
formation of the diprotomer and stabilised by palytoxin. This is not the explanation generally
considered (e.g. in refs. 4-6). However, in the light of the authors results it could be an alternative
hypothesis worth considering.
4. English usage
The English could be improved. Many times the authors use the word "epoch". "Period" would be
better. At the bottom of p. 5 "Posteriorly" should be replaced by "Afterwards".

label_comment_2
The manuscript by Villalonga et al attempts to obtain detail of the Na/K pump functional
characteristics by performing model-based simulations of experimental data previously
published by laboratories studying the palytoxin Na/K ATPase interaction.
The authors reanalyze and simulate the data from Artigas and Gadsby’s publications, including
single channel data. They performed simulations and probabilistic queries using the statistical
model checker generated according to the stochastic semantics, but there is no mention
whatsoever onto why is this method better than others..
The simulations appear to reproduce that data, but given the minimal amount of single channel
data available, it would be impossible to discard any complex model of the kind presented here.
Much simpler models may simulate the data well too. There are several insurmountable
problems here; for instance:
There are major inconsistencies within the same article that point to problems with the
calculations. The data simulated in Fig. 2 (top panel) in Figure 6 (right panel) should have similar
opening rates as they are in the same conditions. However, in one case the current has reached
steady state in 40 s, while in Fig. 6 it would not reach steady state in more than 50 s. This simply
indicates that the chosen experiments for each simulation are not the most statistically
representative of what happens with the PTX induced opening rate in the absence of ATP.
Artigas and Gadsby (2004 Fig. 8) showed a much slower opening rate without ATP (the situation
simulated here) and with saturating concentrations of PTX; See also Artigas and Gadsby, 2002.
Both those papers described the changes in opening rate induced by the lack of ATP, but they are
not included in these simulations.
The data in Fig. 3 are limited to a unique single channel experiment. How do the authors know
that the gating of a different channel would be identical to this one? How do they know that this
channel did not reopen after some time? It is not shown in the original data by Artigas and
Gadsby, probably because the main point was only to show that the open probability was
reduced in the absence of ATP. To test the validity of these quantitatively explicit models the
authors will require a lot more single channel data, with and without ATP, with different Na
concentrations, etc. Also, there is absolutely no consideration of other alternative explanations. In
4
particular, if the model considered the fact that the pumps go through cycling reactions with or
without toxin.
In particular, a much more plausible interpretation for the observation is well known in the ion
channel field. Ion channels operate in gating modes in which transitions between different gating
modes is very slow compared to the transition rates within a gating mode. There is no
consideration of this, no citation to this type analysis, even though these PTX-pump channels are
obviously acting in more than one mode in the absence of ATP. The simulations do not include
the interactions with other ligands, like Mg2+ that were present in the solution of Artigas and
Gadsby experiments and are known to be important for pump function, including Mg++. There
is no need for a diprotomeric enzyme to explain that data.
Related to the criticism above; how can the authors simulate one experiment of latency to first
single-channel opening event and draw conclusions from it? The same experiment repeated one
hundred times could produce very different latencies to first opening than the one presented in
Artigas and Gadsby’s paper. The authors failed to simulate one single channel trace and rushed
to build a model in which the number of parameters in increased beyond control. There is no
mention at any point of how the detailed balance sets some of the rates as the model is
unavoidably a cycle. The initial model of the pump presented here is not even a cycle, like the
Albers-Post scheme! Mentioned in Table I
The authors state:
“The binding of two PTX molecules may occur only if the pump is a diprotomeric complex [14].
Evidences of pump functioning as a diprotomer are being reported [15] and, furthermore, the
experiments described above [5,6] where carried out in conditions where it is possible to consider
the existence of pumps functioning as diprotomeric complexes [15].”
But the reality is that in the limited model build by the authors with constraints that are
absolutely unjustified, they cannot simulate the two (or more) modes of channel function. What
all this means, most probably, is that the pump is in (at least) two modes. For instance, if we
could imagine a gating in the phosphorylated pump and gating of dephosphorylated pumps as
the two main modes (which need not to be) the role of pump phosphorylation could simply be to
increase the probability of observing a high Po mode of function, but both, the phosphorylated
and dephosphorylated pumps can present both modes of gating, and the transitions between the
two modes is slow, compared to the transition within modes.
Unfortunately, although the simulations give the impression to reproduce that data the end result
is an over interpretation of the data, the short live recordings used to propose the model make
this a modelling exercise. There is absolutely no evidence of a diprotomeric ATPase in the data
that originated the simulations. The binding of two palytoxin molecules per diprotomeric pump
is absolutely speculative. Although this is not to say that in some tissues the diprotomeric
enzymes do not exist.

Comments to the Author:
label_comment_3
The manuscript has been reviewed by experts in the field and some of the comments reported are
very critical on some of the author's conclusions or hypotheses on the mechanisms of functioning
of the studied pump.
In particular the hypothesis tested by simulations of a diprotomeric state by assuming the
protein could exist as a diprotomer should be backed up by a more appropriate discussion and
commented in light of existing experimental evidences or by proposing possible experimental
investigations that could support that assumption.
Additionally, the interpretation of some of the results suggested by reviewer 2 should be closely
investigated and discussed, namely that Ion channels operate in gating modes in which
transitions between different gating modes is very slow compared to the transition rates within a
gating mode.
A point by point accurate response to this reviewer is requested in a revised form.
We also strongly recommend that the manuscript is edited by a native speaker prior to any re-
submission.

Dear Editor,
We are glad to have our manuscript accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science. As
the Reviewer 1 had declared, we agree that our manuscript provides valuable information about
the functioning of the Na+/K+-pump. Considering the comments of the Reviewer 2, the results
that we provided are, without doubt, more than modeling exercise. Our results show that the
12
representation of a whole cell experiments is possible only if we consider a population of pump
channels not interacting with each other. In another words, it was not possible to reproduce the
activity of a population of pump channels based on a multiple simulation of monomers. We
showed that it is necessary to consider the pump acting as a diprotomer as previewed by Clark
(2009).

functioning of the Na±,K±-pump. The major finding, as described on page 12, is that
"it was not possible to reproduce the behaviour of the single channels induced by
PTX when the stochastic model represented the pump as a monomeric complex
(Fig. 3)". To provide an adequate reproduction of the experimental data, the authors
had to allow the possibility that the protein could exist as a diprotomer.
This is very interesting, but I have a few comments for consideration by the authors.
1. Discussion p. 10 and 12
The authors write on p. 10 "if we admit the Na±/K± pump functioning as a
diprotomer" and on p. 12 "if the Na/K pump function as a diprotomer". I think these
statements are too general. The authors have only analysed the channel activity of
the Na±/K± pump, not its normal physiological pump activity. There is a significant
amount of data indicating that the Na±/K± pump can pump ions in its
monoprotomeric form (e.g. Cornelius, BBA 1235: 197; Martin and Sachs,
Biochemistry 38: 7485). I think it would be better if the authors were more careful and
stated instead that a description of the channel activity of the Na±/K± pump induced
by palytoxin requires one to include the formation of diprotomers.
Answer: Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we made the following changes in the
manuscript to clarify this point and avoid general affirmatives.
Page 11: The sentence “The study shows that if we admit the Na+/K+ pump
functioning as diprotomer...” was changed to “ The study shows that if we assume
that the Na+/K+ pump-induced channel functions as a diprotomer...”.
Página 13: The sentence “The existences of an additional substate of the PTX
induced channels can be justified if the Na/K pump function as a diprotomer .” was
changed to “The existence of an additional substate of the PTX-induced channels can
be justified if the Na/K pump works as a diprotomer in the presence of the toxin.”
The sentence “In the present work, the stochastic model considering the pump
as a diprotomer...” was changed to “In this work, the stochastic model considers the
pump channel to be a diprotomer”
Abstract: The sentence “The probabilistic analyses and simulations allow suggesting
that the Na+/K+ pump function as diprotomeric complex...” was changed to “The
probabilistic analyses and simulations suggest that the palytoxin-induced Na+/K+
pump channel functions as a diprotomeric complex...”
2. ATP binding, p. 12
It seems as if the authors have slightly misinterpreted the work of Clarke (ref 15). In
this paper ATP is first suggested to bind with high affinity to a diprotomer. However,
the binding of this ATP was suggested by Clarke to cause a dissociation of the
diprotomer into individual monoprotomers, so that the second ATP binds with a lower
affinity to a monoprotomer. At physiological ATP levels it was suggested that the
monoprotomer is the predominant species present in the membrane.
Answer: Considering the reviewer’s comments, we made the following changes to
make the text clearer regarding the Clarke hypothesis:
(i) page 13: The sentence “causing dissociation of the diprotomer into individual
monomers and” was inserted after “Moreover, the second ATP molecule binding to
the diprotomer exhibits a lower affinity (~40 time less intense),”
(ii) page 13: The sentence “Similarly to the behaviour recorded for two ATP
molecules binding [17],” was removed.
3. Palytoxin effects
It's possible that the channel activity induced by palytoxin could be completely
unrelated to the normal pump function of the enzyme. If it is true that palytoxin
stabilises a diprotomer, could it be possible that the formation of a diprotomer
actually creates the channel? Could it be that the channel through which the ions are
passing is not in fact the ion transport pathway of the Na±,K± pump at all, but rather
through a channel between Na±,K± pump molecules created by the formation of the
diprotomer and stabilized by palytoxin. This is not the explanation generally
considered (e.g. in refs. 4-6). However, in the light of the authors results it could be
an alternative hypothesis worth considering.
Answer:
As suggested by the reviewer, the hypothesis was included as the fourth paragraph
of subitem 4.1 of the Discussion:
The most accepted hypothesis of the formation of the Na/K pump channels
induced with PTX suggests that this formed channel includes the path for the
transport of Na+ and K+ by the pump4-6. Although not excluding this hypothesis, the
simulations presented in this study also suggest an alternative hypothesis; PTX
binding to the pump may stabilise the diprotomeric structure of the pump, resulting in
a channel permeable to monovalent cations. This channel may not be directly
involved in the transporting paths of Na+ and K+ through the pump structure. The
channel may be formed by the molecular chain created by the diprotomer formation
and stabilised by PTX.
4. English usage
The English could be improved. Many times the authors use the word "epoch".
"Period" would be better. At the bottom of p. 5 "Posteriorly" should be replaced by
"Afterwards".

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_9
The manuscript by Villalonga et al attempts to obtain detail of the Na/K pump
functional characteristics by performing model-based simulations of experimental
data previously published by laboratories studying the palytoxin Na/K ATPase
interaction.
The authors reanalyze and simulate the data from Artigas and Gadsby’s publications,
including single channel data. They performed simulations and probabilistic queries
using the statistical model checker generated according to the stochastic semantics,
but there is no mention whatsoever onto why is this method better than others.
Answer:
To clarify the advantages of the method we used, we included Tables 5 and 6 in the
Results, showing that the probability measures for the occurrence of a determined
event and its usage inform the data interpretation. Additionally, this information was
included in the Discussion in the following paragraph:
2o. paragraph: The UPPAAL-SMC platform was useful for fast adjustment of
the parameters of the model. As described in Tables 5 and 6, the probabilistic
information based on the Statistical Model Checker generated the stochastic
semantics and provided a reduced number of simulations and, at the same time,
offered simulations that better represent the average behaviour and better interpret the
toxin effects
The simulations appear to reproduce that data, but given the minimal amount of
single channel data available, it would be impossible to discard any complex model
of the kind presented here. Much simpler models may simulate the data well too.
Answer:
The model published in 2008 (Rodrigues et al., 2008) was adjusted to simulate the
activation of the macroscopic current induced by ionic channels, which involves the
PTX channel induction of a population of pumps. This model was modified
considering the possibility that the pump would have a diprotomeric structure, which
is a hypothesis that has been discussed and presented in the literature. An increase
in the number of substrates represented was induced to reproduce the behaviour of
single PTX-pump channels. Despite the increase in substrates and transitions
between substrates, the alterations were made such that the adjustments of the
model still reproduce the opening and closing behaviours of the induced channels
and do not prevent the reproduction of the activation of the induced macroscopic
current. Therefore, this model also describes the effect of the Na+ ion on the
channels induced by PTX. To reinforce the contribution of the model, we rewrote the
third paragraph of the Discussion.
There are several insurmountable problems here; for instance:
There are major inconsistencies within the same article that point to problems with
the calculations. The data simulated in Fig. 2 (top panel) in Figure 6 (right panel)
should have similar opening rates as they are in the same conditions. However, in
one case the current has reached steady state in 40 s, while in Fig. 6 it would not
reach steady state in more than 50 s. This simply indicates that the chosen
experiments for each simulation are not the most statistically representative of what
happens with the PTX induced opening rate in the absence of ATP. Artigas and
Gadsby (2004 Fig. 8) showed a much slower opening rate without ATP (the situation
simulated here) and with saturating concentrations of PTX; See also Artigas and
Gadsby, 2002. Both those papers described the changes in opening rate induced by
the lack of ATP, but they are not included in these simulations.
Answer:
As the model was changed to reproduce the behaviour of induced channels, the
adjustment of constants of rates had to be redone. Although we reduced the degrees
of freedom greatly (Table 7) for the model to continue reproducing the behaviour of
the macroscopic current (Fig. 2 - top panel), the behaviour was not quantitatively
identical to the previous model. However, the current activation rate in Figure 6 is still
within the experimental range (Artigas and Gadsby, 2002, 2003, 2004). For example,
for a PTX concentration of 500 nM, Artigas and Gadsby (2004) measured an
activation rate of 0.06 ± 0.02 s-1 in the absence of nucleotides. This corresponds to a
time of approximately 100 s to reach the maximum current for the PTX
concentration-- five times higher than that used in this work. Therefore, the model
proposed in this paper reproduces the PTX-induced current behaviour in isolated
channels and in a population of neurons even considering that all of the pump
population has a diprotomeric structure.
As the manuscript does not address the difference in the rate of activation of
the current in the two figures, the following text was included in the last paragraph of
the Results to compare the data and indicate its relationship with works published in
the current literature:
The activation rate of the macroscopic current induced by PTX (104 pumps) for the
induced channel functioning as a diprotomer (Fig. 6) was slower (1/<U+F074> = 0.02 s-1) than
that adjusted for the model of the channel functioning as a monomer (Fig. 2, 1/<U+F074> =
0.07 s-1). However, this slower rate is also within the experimentally recorded range,
in the absence of nucleotides and when the pump is perfused only with solution
containing the physiological ligands [4-6]..
The data in Fig. 3 are limited to a unique single channel experiment. How do the
authors know that the gating of a different channel would be identical to this one?
How do they know that this channel did not reopen after some time? It is not shown
in the original data by Artigas and Gadsby, probably because the main point was
only to show that the open probability was reduced in the absence of ATP. To test
the validity of these quantitatively explicit models the authors will require a lot more
single channel data, with and without ATP, with different Na concentrations, etc.
Answer:
Some of the parameters and constants of the model were taken from the adjustment
performed with the model that represented the pump as a monomer that simulated
the macroscopic current induced by the PTX. The rest of the constants were
adjusted using an isolated channel activity record and considering descriptions made
by Artigas and Gadsby [4-6]. Therefore, the data used for tuning are more than the
behaviour of a single channel induced by the toxin. In addition, different signals are
presented for PTX-induced channel activity in the literature4-6 in the absence of
nucleotides, which present similar behaviours.
Moreover, since this is a probabilistic model as in the experiments, each of the
simulations may present a different behaviour. However, we present simulations with
the model that show an average behaviour and represents the qualitative
descriptions of Artigas and Gadsby4-6. Validating the model, it was possible to
reproduce the behaviour of the macroscopic current. Without a doubt, more
experiments with isolated channels would also contribute to improving the model
adjustments. Moreover, the results of the presented simulations offer particular
observations that could guide new experiments with a more focused vision. Taking
into account the questions of the reviewer the third paragraph of the Discussion was
modified in order to improve the text:
The proposed model, implemented in UPPAAL-SMC, can be used as a
profitable tool to guide and/or analyse experimental procedures for recording single
channels in different ionic concentration conditions for Na+. This may contribute to
improving the model and, consequently, to comprehending the kinetics of PTX-
induced channels. For the pump functioning in the absence of PTX and considering
Na+ as the sole physiological ligand, the proposed model was based on the kinetics of
the substate transitions described in the Albers-Post model. Moreover, the substates
that may be occupied by the diprotomeric complex were represented according to
reported hypotheses [15]. The substates and substate transitions of the PTX-Na+/K+-
ATPase complex were proposed following a reported kinetic model [9] and, therefore,
some constants were the same (Table 9). The parameters of the reactions were
directly related to the channel induction and its activity and consequently, with the
induced current, were adjusted based on the current due to a few ionic channels [5,6].
Moreover, validating the performed adjustments, it was possible to reproduce the
dynamic of several channels (Fig. 5 and 6). It can be observed that the macroscopic
current activation rate after the adjustments was smaller (Fig. 6) than that before
adjustments when considering the pump functioning as a monomer (Fig. 2). However,
this value is still within the experimental range [4-6].
Also, there is absolutely no consideration of other alternative explanations. In
particular, if the model considered the fact that the pumps go through cycling
reactions with or without toxin.
Answer:
We did not consider the case of the pump running in the cycle because we simulated
only cases in which the pump was perfused exclusively with Na+ (extra- and
intracellular) as a physiological ligand of the pump. Therefore, the pumping cycle
does not occur completely, and we based on our investigations on this exact
experimental condition in the work. In this case, the reactions involving Na+ and
spontaneous transitions of the enzyme, without phosphorylation, are in operation.
For clarity of text, we changed the first paragraph of the Methodology:
In this work, we investigate the PTX-pump channel formed in the presence of
Na+ and absence of ATP according to experimental recordings [5,6]. This is a
condition where the pump may still bind Na+ exhibiting changes to different states;
however, the normal cycle of ionic transport does not occur, and this situation
represents an important reduction in the number of reactions and substates for the
Na+/K+-ATPase. Two groups of reactions were taken into account to model the PTX-
Na+/K+ pump complex [9]: i) reactions extracted from the Albers-Post model for the
pump (Table 1) and ii) reactions representing interactions between PTX and the pump
(Table 2). These reactions do not describe the complete cycle for the transport of Na+
and K+ through the pump. They describe only the dynamic of the pump in the
presence of Na+ and absence of the other ligands.
In particular, a much more plausible interpretation for the observation is well known
in the ion channel field. Ion channels operate in gating modes in which transitions
between different gating modes is very slow compared to the transition rates within a
gating mode. There is no consideration of this, no citation to this type analysis, even
though these PTX-pump channels are obviously acting in more than one mode in the
absence of ATP.
Answer:
As the reviewer notes, the PTX-induced channel features more than one gating
mode. In the model, we are proposing two gating modes to represent the activity of
an isolated channel. We consider this observation interesting and therefore included
the following text in the Discussion as the last paragraph of subitem 4.1:
Additionally, the model proposed in the present work suggests that the channel
induced when bound to a single PTX molecule presents two gating modes, defined by
different levels of activity between which the channel may transition instantaneously
[18]. One gating mode is described by the transition between the states E1:PTXEc
and E1:PTXEo (reaction pd6), characterising a high level of channel activity with a
relatively high value for the opening channel probability. The second gating mode is
represented by the reaction pd10, which is described as a transition between the states
(Na+)2E1:PTXEo and (Na+)2E1:PTX(Na+)2E. This second gating mode can represent
a low opening probability rate and characterises a quiescent state, which is interpreted
as an interval between bursts [18]. In the model, the transition between these two
gating modes is caused by the Na+ occlusion in the <U+F061> chain of the diprotomer, which
is bound to PTX (reactions pd4 and pd7). As can be observed in Table 9, the
transitions between substates of the same gating modes (reactions pd6 and pd10) are
faster than transitions between substates of different gating modes (reactions pd4 and
pd7): <U+F061>pd6, <U+F062>pd6, <U+F061>pd10 and <U+F062>pd10 are greater than <U+F061>pd4, <U+F062>pd4, <U+F061>pd7 and <U+F062>pd7. This is an
expected behaviour since, by definition, transitions between gating modes are
observed on a slower time scale [18].
The simulations do not include the interactions with other ligands, like Mg2± that
were present in the solution of Artigas and Gadsby experiments and are known to be
important for pump function, including Mg±±.
Answer:
Considering the complexity of PTX interactions with the enzyme Na / K-ATPase and
its modulation by the physiological ligands of the pump, we decided to investigate
only the behaviour of the induced channels in the presence of Na+. For example,
when ATP is added to the perfusion solution, the number of reactions and substrates
involving the PTX-Na / K-ATPase complex is greatly increased [Rodrigues et al.,
2008; Artigas and Gadsby, 2004] even in the absence of K+. In the particular case of
Mg2+, it has an effect on the pump mainly in relation to the phosphorylation of the
enzyme when ATP is present. In addition, weak binding of Mg2+ to the enzyme in the
absence of ATP can be expected (Pilotelle-Bunner et al., 2009). In fact, we think that
the reviewer’s observation is adequate considering that our text was not clear about
the delimitations of the conditions where the enzyme was investigated. To clarify, we
changed the first paragraph of the Methods:
In this work, we investigate the PTX-pump channel formed in the presence of
+
Na and absence of ATP according to experimental recordings [5,6]. This is a
condition where the pump may still bind Na+ exhibiting changes to different states;
however, the normal cycle of ionic transport does not occur, and this situation
represents an important reduction in the number of reactions and substates for the
Na+/K+-ATPase. Two groups of reactions were taken into account to model the PTX-
Na+/K+ pump complex [9]: i) reactions extracted from the Albers-Post model for the
pump (Table 1) and ii) reactions representing interactions between PTX and the pump
(Table 2). These reactions do not describe the complete cycle for the transport of Na+
and K+ through the pump. They describe only the dynamic of the pump in the
presence of Na+ and absence of the other ligands.
There is no need for a diprotomeric enzyme to explain that data.
Related to the criticism above; how can the authors simulate one experiment of
latency to first single-channel opening event and draw conclusions from it? The same
experiment repeated one hundred times could produce very different latencies to first
opening than the one presented in Artigas and Gadsby’s paper.
Answer:
The adjustments made to the model were based on the behaviour of the
macroscopic current induced by PTX and in a few recordings of isolated channel
activity. However, as can be observed, it is possible to reproduce the behaviour of an
isolated channel’s activity and reconstruct the macroscopic current induced by the
toxin. Therefore, the simulations support the hypothesis that considering the pump as
a diprotomer allows for the reproduction of the effect of the toxin on the Na / K pump
when Na+ is present as the only physiological binder. However, recordings of the
activity of isolated channels under the same conditions with changing Na+
concentration, in the absence of nucleotides, could improve the model and the
adjustments. However, this does not invalidate the importance of our findings. In fact,
it may stimulate the efforts of other groups in performing new experiments,
contributing to unravelling these mechanisms. We took this issue into account in the
new version of the third paragraph of the Discussion:
The proposed model, implemented in UPPAAL-SMC, can be used as a
profitable tool to guide and/or analyse experimental procedures for recording single
channels in different ionic concentration conditions for Na+. This may contribute to
improving the model and, consequently, to comprehending the kinetics of PTX-
induced channels. For the pump functioning in the absence of PTX and considering
Na+ as the sole physiological ligand, the proposed model was based on the kinetics of
the substate transitions described in the Albers-Post model. Moreover, the substates
that may be occupied by the diprotomeric complex were represented according to
reported hypotheses [15]. The substates and substate transitions of the PTX-Na+/K+-
ATPase complex were proposed following a reported kinetic model [9] and, therefore,
some constants were the same (Table 9). The parameters of the reactions were
directly related to the channel induction and its activity and consequently, with the
induced current, were adjusted based on the current due to a few ionic channels [5,6].
Moreover, validating the performed adjustments, it was possible to reproduce the
dynamic of several channels (Fig. 5 and 6). It can be observed that the macroscopic
current activation rate after the adjustments was smaller (Fig. 6) than that before
adjustments when considering the pump functioning as a monomer (Fig. 2). However,
this value is still within the experimental range [4-6].
The authors failed to simulate one single channel trace and rushed to build a model
in which the number of parameters in increased beyond control. There is no mention
at any point of how the detailed balance sets some of the rates as the model is
unavoidably a cycle. The initial model of the pump presented here is not even a
cycle, like the Albers-Post scheme! Mentioned in Table I
Answer:
In Table 7, the principle of microscopic reversibility was used to calculate the
constants ßpd12 and apd13. It was not possible to respect the principle of microscopic
versatility in the case of the cycle involving reactions pd4, pd6, pd7 and pd10, as
discussed in the second paragraph of subitem “4.2: Na + interactions with the PTX-
Na + / K + -ATPase complex.” To make it clearer that we used the principle of
microscopic reversibility, we included the following sentence at the beginning of this
paragraph:
“As shown in Table 9, the microscopic reversibility principle was used for the
determination of the parameters <U+F062>pd12 and <U+F061>pd13, reducing the degree of freedom
during the parameter adjustment process.”.
From the Albers-Post cycle, the present model only represents reactions and
substrates involving Na + as the only physiological ligand present. To clarify, the title
of Table 1 has been changed from "Reactions for the Albers-Post model" to:
Reactions and substates of the Na+/K+-ATPase considering only Na+ as the sole
physiological ligand present, extracted from the Albers-Post model.
The authors state:
“The binding of two PTX molecules may occur only if the pump is a diprotomeric
complex [14]. Evidences of pump functioning as a diprotomer are being reported [15]
and, furthermore, the experiments described above [5,6] where carried out in
conditions where it is possible to consider the existence of pumps functioning as
diprotomeric complexes [15].” But the reality is that in the limited model build by the
authors with constraints that are absolutely unjustified, they cannot simulate the two
(or more) modes of channel function. What all this means, most probably, is that the
pump is in (at least) two modes. For instance, if we could imagine a gating in the
phosphorylated pump and gating of dephosphorylated pumps as the two main
modes (which need not to be) the role of pump phosphorylation could simply be to
increase the probability of observing a high Po mode of function, but both, the
phosphorylated and dephosphorylated pumps can present both modes of gating, and
the transitions between the two modes is slow, compared to the transition within
modes.
Answer: The model was developed to reproduce the behaviour of induced channels
in the presence of Na+ and the absence of ATP. Consequently, the model cannot be
used to interpret data concerning enzyme phosphorylation. In relation to the gating
modes that the channel induced by PTX present, as previously described, we
included the following text in the Discussion as the last paragraph of subitem "4.1
PTX interactions with the Na+ / K+ -ATPase - evidence of the pump functioning as a
diprotomer":
Additionally, the model proposed in the present work suggests that the channel
induced when bound to a single PTX molecule presents two gating modes, defined by
different levels of activity between which the channel may transition instantaneously
[18]. One gating mode is described by the transition between the states E1:PTXEc
and E1:PTXEo (reaction pd6), characterising a high level of channel activity with a
relatively high value for the opening channel probability. The second gating mode is
represented by the reaction pd10, which is described as a transition between the states
(Na+)2E1:PTXEo and (Na+)2E1:PTX(Na+)2E. This second gating mode can represent
a low opening probability rate and characterises a quiescent state, which is interpreted
as an interval between bursts [18]. In the model, the transition between these two
gating modes is caused by the Na+ occlusion in the <U+F061> chain of the diprotomer, which
is bound to PTX (reactions pd4 and pd7). As can be observed in Table 9, the
transitions between substates of the same gating modes (reactions pd6 and pd10) are
faster than transitions between substates of different gating modes (reactions pd4 and
pd7): <U+F061>pd6, <U+F062>pd6, <U+F061>pd10 and <U+F062>pd10 are greater than <U+F061>pd4, <U+F062>pd4, <U+F061>pd7 and <U+F062>pd7. This is an
expected behaviour since, by definition, transitions between gating modes are
observed on a slower time scale [18].
Unfortunately, although the simulations give the impression to reproduce that data
the end result is an over interpretation of the data, the short live recordings used to
propose the model make this a modelling exercise. There is absolutely no evidence
of a diprotomeric ATPase in the data that originated the simulations. The binding of
two palytoxin molecules per diprotomeric pump is absolutely speculative. Although
this is not to say that in some tissues the diprotomeric enzymes do not exist.
Answer: We hope that the changes made in the manuscript have changed the reviewer’s
perception of our work. As the first reviewer observed, our work on “the channel
activity of the Na+,K+-pump induced by interaction with palytoxin is novel and provides
valuable new information about the functioning of the Na+,K+-pump.” Following the
first reviewer’s comments, our simulations suggest an alternative hypothesis
considering that the PTX binding to the pump may stabilise the diprotomeric structure
of the pump, resulting in a channel permeable to monovalent ions. This channel may not
directly involve the transporting paths of Na+ and K+ through the pump structure. The
channel may be formed by the molecular chain created by the diprotomer formation and
stabilised by PTX. Therefore, we are very confident that the new version of the
manuscript will easily remove the conception that our work is just a modelling exercise.
