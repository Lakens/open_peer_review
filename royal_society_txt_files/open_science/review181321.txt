Liu and colleagues present a computational drug repurposing practice using the data from the
Connectivity Map (CMap) and the LINCS L1000 dataset with various types of software tools
developed on top of those datasets. Concretely, they used publicly available drug-induced gene
expression dataset to identify expected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as input for those
drug repurposing tools. Their analyses identified two small molecule compounds from the
LINCS L1000 dataset with unknown activities as novel HDAC inhibitors and mitomycin C as a
topoisomerase inhibitor. Importantly, the authors also confirmed those activities by molecular
docking and cell-based activity assays.
In my opinion, the design of the study and the methodologies are technically sound. The authors
also presented convincing evidence for their newly discovered activities for the compounds and
drugs. I also applaud for the authors for leveraging publicly available datasets and tools for
knowledge discovery. I have the following comments and suggestions on the details:
1. It will be interesting to quantify the binding affinities of the novel HDAC inhibitors and
mitomycin C using dose-response curves.
2. What method did the authors used to identify the DEGs from the HDAC inhibitor-treated
cancer cell lines?

Review: Systematic Polypharmacology and Drug Repurposing via an Integrated L1000-based
Connectivity Map Database Mining
3
Summary:
The document describes the process of utilizing publically available gene-expression databases to
infer drug mode of action for novel chemical compounds. The authors focus on two drug classes.
HDAC inhibitors and topoisomerase inhibitors. First drug candidates are identified by their gene
expression profile using the CLUE interface from the L1000 dataset. Then direct target gene
activity is measured for a select set of candidate compounds.
General comments:
The approach to identify MOA for novel compounds using L1000 data is well described in this
document. This is a very nice example of how drug repurposing can work successfully. It also
illustrates nicely that not every drug pair with matching gene expression signatures has the same
MOA. The approach however still seems to have a high success rate. The claim that the MOA of
the drugs has been completely established is debatable, but the study brings forth a lot of good
points that suggest that for some of the drugs a MOA could be predicted. There are minor
inconsistencies in the strategy. Not all genes are tested with the docking method. Why not? Not
all drugs are screened in an experiment (like in Figure 1G). This might be due to compound
availability, but it would make a stronger point if the same method would be applied
consistently.
Major Comments:
1) Is 50uM a typical dose for rifabutin? It seems high. If Rifabutin has similar MOA would
increased viability at a relatively high dose of 5-10uM be expected? What is the viability of cells
when treated with known HDAC inhibitors such as SAHA? The authors conclude that rifabutin
is not an HDAC inhibitor. Why is the signature similar to HDAC inhibitors?
2) same with KM-00927. The idea proposed here is to be able to predict the mode of action of a
drug. But in both cases, drugs similar to HDAC inhibitors are not HDAC inhibitors. Many drugs
would kill cells at 50uM.
3) How can be concluded that the L1000 is better than the CMap build 02 from this result?
4) The authors do a great job with inferring that BRD-K75081836 is an HDAC inhibitor. However,
the analysis is a bit inconsistent compared to the two other drug candidates tested. HDAC
activity was directly measured in Figure 1G which led them to dismiss the two prior candidates
to be directly binding to HDAC. They have shown that signature similarity can be misleading, so
it could again be the case here. The docking analysis is nice but is only performed for this drug,
why not the other two? The message of the paper will be strengthened if BRD-K75081836 is
included in figure 1G.
5) How exactly where the top 50 perturbations connected to topoisomerase I/II found? I assume
the authors selected 4 TOP1-i and 10 TOP2-i drugs in L1000. Why those drugs? Daunorubicin
shows up as a result labeled as TOP-i but was not part of the selected drugs in the query. How
are the drugs ranked and what was used to calculate similarity? Is it the CLUE interface?
6) What was the reasoning of not following up on SIB-1893 as it ranked higher than
Mycophenolic-acid and Mepacrine?
7) The authors state in the conclusion that KM-00927 and BRD-K75081836 are HDAC inhibitors.
While there is some evidence, especially plausible for the later drug due to structural similarity to
SAHA, in both cases experimental evidence is not given. The claim is based on signature
similarity, but in the case of KM-00927, a direct HDAC activity measurement in Figure 1G
contradicts a direct interaction. The evidence for mitomycin C as a TOP2-i is convincing.
Molecular docking would have been interesting in this case too.
8) To provide a template for other researchers that want to do drug repurposing and MOA
detection of novel compounds this paper would profit from a concise description of the strategy
that could be applied for other drugs as well.
9) In the description of the method, the authors say the L1000FWD tool refined the strategy in
selecting drug candidates. Were was the L1000FWD used to prioritize drugs? Or was the tool
4
merely used as a visual aid to show the similarity structure of the drugs? Did the identification of
the three major clusters of topoisomerase have any impact on the analysis? How was the
knowledge of the three clusters used in the analysis?
Minor Comments:
1) Abstract: , which has been believed to reduce time- and cost-consuming, and bypass safety
concerns. (I would recommend rewriting this sentence)

contribute largely to their therapeutic benefits [19], we proposed that CMap is a suitable tool for
the discovery of novel HDAC inhibitors based on comparing the similarity of gene-expression
profiling (gene signatures) between the established HDAC inhibitors and CMap drugs."
- who is "their"?
- why would that suggest that CMap is a useful tool?
11) How is the Average mean score calculated? Isn't average mean redundant?

similar, but is there a way to quantify this?

Appendix A
Point-by-Point Responses to the Reviewers’ Comments
Reviewer #1
1. It will be interesting to quantify the binding affinities of the novel HDAC inhibitors
and mitomycin C using dose-response curves.
Our responses:
We thank the reviewer’s suggestion. Our results found that KM-00927 and BRD-
K75081836 were novel HDAC inhibitors, and mitomycin C was a novel topoisomerase
IIB inhibitor. However, we thought that it is not suitable to quantify the binding
affinities of these compounds to their targets according to the present results. First, we
demonstrated that KM-00927 inhibited HDAC activity in an indirect manner. Second,
we cannot perform in vitro HDAC activity assay to prove the interaction between BRD-
K75081836 and HDACs because of the unavailability of BRD-K75081836 in
commercial. Third, as a DNA alkylating agent, mitomycin C may alkylate DNA and
form covalent adducts with DNA, then trapping topoisomerases. In vitro incubation of
drug and enzyme may be unmeaningful.
2. What method did the authors used to identify the DEGs from the HDAC inhibitor-
treated cancer cell lines?
Our responses:
We thank the reviewer’s reminding. The method for the preparation of DEGs has been
added to “Materials and methods” (p.13, lines 5-12) as follows.
For the CMap build 02 analyses, the DEGs (File S1) from HDAC inhibitor-treated
cancer cell lines, including SAHA-treated HCT116 (GSE22061 [20]), SAHA-treated
MDA-MB-231 (GSE60125), and FK228-treated HCT116 cells (GSE22061 [20]), were
prepared using the GEO online tool GEO2R (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/)
[9]. GEO2R performs comparisons on original submitter-supplied processed data tables
using the GEOquery and limma R packages from the Bioconductor project [9]. The cut-
off criteria for DEGs were set at adjusted p value < 0.01 and |logFC| > 2.

Our responses to major comments #1 and #2:
We thank the reviewer’s comments. To address the reviewer’s concern regarding drug
dosages, we have added the following statements in “Results and discussion” (p.9, the
second paragraph).
There are several types of HDAC inhibitors with efficacies in the nanomolar to
millimolar ranges. The most potent types include cyclic peptides (such as
depsipeptide/FK228, apicidin, and trapoxin), hydroxomic acids (such as trichostatin A
and SAHA), and benzamides (such as entinostat/MS-275 and mocetinostat), which
inhibit HDAC activity in the nanomolar and low micromolar ranges and kill cancer
cells in the sub-micromolar ranges. The ketones (such as <U+F061>-ketomides and
trifluoromethyl ketone) and short-chain fatty acids (such as valproic acid,
phenylbutyrate, and sodium butyrate) exhibit HDAC inhibition and cancer cell killing
in the micromolar and millimolar ranges, respectively [24-26]. Despite the least potency
of sort-chain fatty acid to inhibition HDAC, some of them are used in clinic. For
example, valproic acid is used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder [27, 28]. In addition,
valproic acid is still identified as a potent anticancer agents and encouraging results are
found in clinical trials [29]. KM-00927 is a synthetic drug with unknown function. Our
results found that KM-00927 was a potent and indirect HDAC inhibitor, which induced
histone acetylation and killed cancer cells in micromolar ranges (10 to 50 µM). We
thought that KM-00927 could be developed as an anticancer drug in the future.
However, whether inhibition of HDAC activity contributes to its anticancer activity
warrants further investigations.

3) How can be concluded that the L1000 is better than the CMap build 02 from this
result?
Our responses:
We thank the reviewer’s comments. We deleted or modified the following sentences to
avoid overstating the conclusion.
“Thus, we speculated that the LINCS may provide a more reliable prediction thant the
CMap.” (deleted in p.4, lines 7-8).
“These results also support our speculation that L1000-based next-generation CMap
(LINCS) provides a more accurate prediction than its previous version (CMap build
02).” (modified in p.7, lines 17-19).
“Our results indicated that the L1000-based next-generation CMap had a convenient
and reliable prediction for drug repurposing and polypharmacology.” (deleted in p.5,
lines 2-4).
4) The authors do a great job with inferring that BRD-K75081836 is an HDAC inhibitor.
However, the analysis is a bit inconsistent compared to the two other drug candidates
tested. HDAC activity was directly measured in Figure 1G which led them to dismiss
the two prior candidates to be directly binding to HDAC. They have shown that
signature similarity can be misleading, so it could again be the case here. The docking
analysis is nice but is only performed for this drug, why not the other two? The message
of the paper will be strengthened if BRD-K75081836 is included in figure 1G.
Our responses:
We thank the reviewer’s comments and suggestions. However, we regret that the in
vitro HDAC activity cannot be performed to demonstrate the interaction of BRD-
K75081836 and HDACs because of the unavailability of this drug in commercial. We
performed the molecular docking of rifabutin and KM-00927 to HDAC2 according to
the reviewer’s suggestions, and the following statements have been added to “Results
and discussion” (p.9, the first paragraph).
Furthermore, we performed molecular docking of rifabutin and KM-00927 to HDAC2
in parallel. The results found that the total fitness energies of rifabutin and KM-00927
were lower than those of SAHA and BRD-K75081836 (Table 3), further supporting
the results that rifabutin and KM-00927 did not interact and inhibit HDAC activity in
vitro (Figure 1G).
Table 3 The interaction profile of HDAC2 and drugs by iGEMDOCK analysis
Drug Total fitness energy VDW Hbond Elect
SAHA -113.62 -80.11 -33.51 0
BRD-K75081836 -127.5 -85.63 -40.75 -1.12
Rifabutin -96.35 -89.88 -6.47 0
KM-00927 -63.67 -59.38 -4.29 0
Note: Fitness (kcal/mol) is the total energy of a predicted pose in the binding site and it
is calculated by the following equation: Fitness = vdW + Hbond + Elect. The terms,
vdW, Hbond, and Elect, indicate van der Waal energy, hydrogen bonding energy, and
Elect term is electro statistic energy, respectively
5) How exactly where the top 50 perturbations connected to topoisomerase I/II found?
I assume the authors selected 4 TOP1-i and 10 TOP2-i drugs in L1000. Why those
drugs? Daunorubicin shows up as a result labeled as TOP-i but was not part of the
selected drugs in the query. How are the drugs ranked and what was used to calculate
similarity? Is it the CLUE interface?
Our responses:
The criteria for selecting the queried 14 topoisomerase inhibitors has been added to
“Materials and methods” (p.13, lines 20-23) as follows. Although daunorubicin
belongs to “CMap class”, its description is indicated as “RNA synthesis inhibitor”.
Therefore, daunorubicin is excluded based on the above criteria.
For the prediction of novel topoisomerase inhibitors, the “perturbation classes” and
“perturbation type” were set as “CMap class” and “compound”, respectively. Drugs
with description “topoisomerase inhibitor” were selected for generation of a heat map
(Figure 3).
For the calculation and ranking of drug similarity, we have added the following
statements in “Materials and methods” (p.13, lines 23-29).
The drug similarity was ranked according to the CMap connectivity score (ranging from
-100 to 100) that corresponds to the fraction of reference gene sets with a greater
similarity to the perturbagen than the current query. For example, a score of 95 indicates
that only 5% of reference gene sets showed stronger connectivity than the current query
to the perturbagen. In general, connectivity scores higher than 95 and lower than -95
were considered as strong scores [7].

6) What was the reasoning of not following up on SIB-1893 as it ranked higher than
Mycophenolic-acid and Mepacrine?
Our responses:
We agree the reviewer’s comment that SIB-1893 is worth for further analysis. However,
current results aimed to support our drug repurposing strategy and we found that many
drugs (including SIB-1893) have similar patterns with mycophenolic mofetil (the
prodrug of mycophenolic acid) and mycophenolic acid. In addition, mycophenolic
mofetil has the highest rank among the candidate drugs. Therefore, mitomycin C and
mycophenolic acid (the active metabolite of mycophenolic mofetil) were used as a
representative. The related descriptions have been included in the original version of
this manuscript (“Results and discussion”, p.10, the second paragraph).
7) The authors state in the conclusion that KM-00927 and BRD-K75081836 are HDAC
inhibitors. While there is some evidence, especially plausible for the later drug due to
structural similarity to SAHA, in both cases experimental evidence is not given. The
claim is based on signature similarity, but in the case of KM-00927, a direct HDAC
activity measurement in Figure 1G contradicts a direct interaction. The evidence for
mitomycin C as a TOP2-i is convincing. Molecular docking would have been interesting
in this case too.
Our responses:
We thank the reviewer’s comments and suggestions. Molecular docking was performed
according to the reviewer’s suggestion, and the related statements have been added to
“Results and discussion” (p.11, the last paragraph to p.12, the first paragraph).
To investigate the interaction between mitomycin C and topoisomerase IIB, molecular
docking was performed. As shown in Table S2, the binding affinity of mitomycin C to
topoisomerase IIB was lower than that of etoposide, suggesting that additional
mechanism(s) might be involved in the action of mitomycin C. An enzymatic
bioreduction of mitomycin C is required for its activation and cytotoxic effect. Upon
reduction, mitomycin C is converted into a highly bis-electrophilic intermediate that
alkylates and crosslinks DNA [42]. Mitomycin C alkylations are specific for the
guanine nucleosides in the CpG sequences [43]. It has been shown that psorospermin,
a plant-derived antitumor agent, alkylates the guanine at the topoisomerase II cleavage
site to trap the topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complex [44]. In addition, clerocidin, a
topoisomerase II poison, alkylates and forms covalent adducts with guanines, then
trapping topoisomerase II enzymes [45]. These studies support the action of mitomycin
C to promote the formation of topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complex (Figure 5B).
Therefore, our results provide an additional mechanistic insight into the mode of action
of the anticancer agent mitomycin C, which may extend its clinical application for
treating cancers or other diseases. However, the exact mechanism warrants further
investigation.

8) To provide a template for other researchers that want to do drug repurposing and
MOA detection of novel compounds this paper would profit from a concise description
of the strategy that could be applied for other drugs as well.
Our responses:
We thank the reviewer’s suggestion. A workflow has been depicted in Figure 6 to
illustrate our analytic strategy, and the related statements have been added to
“Conclusion” (p.12, the last paragraph) as follows.
According to our analysis, a workflow is therefore proposed (Figure 6). The gene
signatures of drugs can be either prepared from GEO datasets or directly obtained by
querying the CLUE database using the “Touchstone” tool. Similar drugs can be further
compared by the L1000FWD visualization of gene signatures to select candidates
sharing similar MOAs. Finally, candidate drugs are validated by molecular docking and
in vitro assays.
Figure 6
9) In the description of the method, the authors say the L1000FWD tool refined the
strategy in selecting drug candidates. Were was the L1000FWD used to prioritize drugs?
Or was the tool merely used as a visual aid to show the similarity structure of the drugs?
Did the identification of the three major clusters of topoisomerase have any impact on
the analysis? How was the knowledge of the three clusters used in the analysis?
Our responses:
We thank the reviewer’s comments. We have added the following statements in
“Materials and methods” (p.13, the last line to p14, lines 1-3).
For L1000FWD analysis, drug data can be queried and accessed by inputting drug name
on the website (http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/L1000FWD/). Drugs sharing similar
MOAs will be clustered together [11].

HDAC inhibitors and CMap drugs."
- who is "their"?
- why would that suggest that CMap is a useful tool?
Our responses:
We thank the reviewer’s comments. We have modified the following statements in
“Results and discussion” (p.5, the last two lines to p.6, lines 1-4).
Transcriptional reprogramming is believed to contribute largely to the therapeutic
benefits of HDAC inhibitors. Because CMap is established based on drug transcriptome
profiles, we proposed that CMap is a suitable tool for the discovery of novel HDAC
inhibitors by comparing the similarity of gene-expression profiling (gene signatures)
between the established HDAC inhibitors and CMap drugs.
11) How is the Average mean score calculated? Isn't average mean redundant?
Our responses:
We changed the heading “Average mean score” to “Average score” to avoid
misleading with “Mean score” in each dataset. In addition, we have modified the note
in Table 1 to describe the calculation of “Average score” as follows:
The mean scores of common HDAC and HSP90 inhibitors were listed in this table,
which was ranked by average score that is calculated by adding up the mean scores and
dividing the total by the numbers of scores.
12) Figure 2B) the authors claim that the structure of the drug is similar. I agree that
they look similar, but is there a way to quantify this?
Our responses:
To address the reviewer’s concern, we have performed chemical structure similarity
analysis, and the following statements have been added to “Results and discussion”
and “Materials and methods”.
In “Results and discussion” (p.8, lines 15-22):
To quantify the structural similarity between BRD-K75081836 and hydroxamic acid-
based HDAC inhibitors, hierarchical clustering of drugs was performed using the
ChemBioServer (http://chembioserver.vi-seem.eu/) [23]. Indeed, BRD-K75081836,
but not other drugs (KM-00927, rifabutin, and geldanamycin), was structurally similar
to hydroxamic acid-based HDAC inhibitors including SAHA, trichostatin A, scriptaid,
and panobinostat. Among them, SAHA was the most similar one to BRD-K75081836
(Figure S1).
In “Materials and methods” (p.14, lines 5-11):
Chemical structure similarity analysis by the ChemBioServer
The ChemBioServer is a web application for filtering, clustering, and visualizing of
chemical compounds [23]. For the hierarchical clustering of compounds, a SDF files
containing the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) of drugs was
uploaded to the ChemBioServer. The parameters were set as follows: distance =
Soergel (Tanimoto coefficient); clustering linkage = Ward; and clustering threshold =
0.4.

Reviewer #3
1. One concern about this paper is they used just CMap and just LINCS for
prediction of HDAC inhibitors. This is a single case and it would have been more
convincing to show the potential shortcomings of these isolated methods, when
compared to the pipeline with integration of L1000FWD, if predictions were made
and experimentally validated for topoisomerase II inhibitors.
Our responses:
We thank the reviewer’s comment and suggestion. It is undoubted that CMap has been
successfully applied for drug repurposing and polypharmcology analysis since it is
developed in 2006. In addition, the data sets from CMap serve as a basis for the
development of other analytic tools. The purpose of this study is not to depreciate the
contribution of CMap in this field. We emphasize that the integration of L1000FWD
into CMap and LINCS predictions could exclude the drugs with dissimilar gene
signatures. In this notion, we thought that we may overstate our conclusion in the
original manuscript. Therefore, the following modifications have been made.
(1) The following sentences have been deleted or modified to avoid overstating the
conclusion.
“Thus, we speculated that the LINCS may provide a more reliable prediction thant
the CMap.” (deleted in p.4, lines 7-8).
“These results also support our speculation that L1000-based next-generation
CMap (LINCS) provides a more accurate prediction than its previous version
(CMap build 02).” (modified in p.7, lines 17-19).
“Our results indicated that the L1000-based next-generation CMap had a
convenient and reliable prediction for drug repurposing and polypharmacology.”
(deleted in p.5, lines 2-4).
(2) A workflow (Figure 6) has been depicted to describe our analytic strategy, and the
following statements have been added to “Conclusion” (p.12, the last paragraph).
According to our analysis, a workflow is therefore proposed (Figure 6). The gene
signatures of drugs can be either prepared from GEO datasets or directly obtained by
querying the CLUE database using the “Touchstone” tool. Similar drugs can be further
compared by the L1000FWD visualization of gene signatures to select candidates
sharing similar MOAs. Finally, candidate drugs are validated by molecular docking and
in vitro assays.
Figure 6
2. For the commercially unavailable putative HDAC inhibitor, a molecular docking
protocol (iGEMDOCK) was leveraged to computationally support the potential of
this drug to inhibit HDAC2. Binding scores and poses were compared between
this drug and a known HDAC inhibitor (SAHA) to the HDAC2 target. However, it
is unclear in the methods how the binding site was determined. Furthermore, it is
not clear how the drugs 3D structure was minimized, nor what "empirical scoring
function" was used for the fitness scoring in this molecular docking program.
Our responses:
We thank the reviewer’s comments. We have modified the statements in “Materials
and methods” (p.14, the third paragraph) as follows.
Docking simulations were performed with iGEMDOCK [39]. A structure of HDAC2
(4LXZ) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank. The 3D drug structures in MOL2
format were prepared using the software, Open Babel v2.4.1 [40]. The binding site of
the target was prepared, and energy-minimized compounds were imported. The
docking protocol is set to 80 generations per ligand and a population size of 300 random
individuals. All docking conformations were performed 10 times using a genetic
evolutionary algorithm, and the fitness of the docked structures was calculated. The
binding site for docking was defined by the bound ligand included in the downloaded
HDAC2 protein structure, and the binding site radius was set to 8Å. The binding affinity
of a drug to HDAC2 was estimated by the fitness value calculated via the following
formula: Fitness (kcal/mol) = VDW + Hbond + Elect, where the VDW term is van der
Waal energy, Hbond term is hydrogen bonding energy, and Elect term is electro statistic
energy.
