This is an interesting and important paper, because it proposes a basis for a realistic link between
the micro and macro behaviour that underlies self-organization within cities. This is usually
posed in abstract terms where for example random differences at the local level lead to
instabilities that in turn lead to the emergence of structure and macroscopic characteristics of
urban systems. The key idea is that the urban context affects people’s behaviour, and that
people’s behaviour leads to the urban context. This is an important insight and to a testable
outcome where people with positive Higgins focus tend to live in big, bustling cities, while those
with more caution tend to live in smaller, less dynamic urban centres. This is confirmed by the
evidence cited in the paper.
Beyond this paper, I feel that these ideas will also help in understanding the pattern of the
occurrence and diffusion of innovations, which are also involved in shaping the urban hierarchy.
It seems likely therefore that Higgins’ regulatory focus theory, may play a role in explaining the
dynamic theory and pattern of innovation. Some cities seem to continue for very long periods to
expand and change over time, while others, such as Detroit for example, can evolve through
successful growth to painful decline, as real innovations cease to pervade them. So, I think that
this micro-macro link put forward in this paper is important and should be published.

Review:
A synergetic perspective on Urban scaling, Urban Regulatory Focus and their interrelations
The paper proposes a basic hypothesis on the nature of large-fast cities to small-slow cities, and
then proceeds to relate scaling to this observation.
On page 4, the authors say:
Large cities are usually characterized by fast-paced competitive urban dynamics, compared to
small cities which are usually relaxed and slow-paced with a focus on safety, stability, and
security.
This seems too simplistic and contradictory to agglomeration economics observations that while
some small cities (say with diverse economic functions, but no primary leading economic
function) could indeed be relaxed, slow-paced and focus on safety, stability, and security, some
others (say with a very specific economic function, such as highly automated manufacturing etc.)
may be extremely fast-paced and volatile: the city is subject to large and fast fluctuations because
it is tethered to the global economy, and global variations would have a large effect on the
functioning of the city. So, not all large cities are the same, and not all small cities are the same.
2.1 Synergetics
The demonstration of the LASER - please add a paragraph showing an urban analogy. For
example, if there is enough demand, a new public transit line is created. But because the new
public transit line is created, it creates more residential demand around it, etc. In transport
terminology, the idea is called latent demand - the tendency that congestion can't be solved by
introducing new roads, because putting in a new road just brings to the front latent demand that
is activated by the new road link.
4
2.2 SIRNIA
The idea of SIRNIA needs to be more clearly expressed. As it is now written, it is not clear exactly
what is meant. For example: Is "I can use a chair as a door stopper" SI or PI? And why? The
mapping appears very subjective and arbitrary. Maybe clearer explanation needed.
Later author's describe non-affordable objects, but what about the transformations of functions
and affordances? In the case of a chair as a door stopper, the presumably the SI remains the same,
but the PI has changed. How is the change in information expressed?
Critique of strong AI approaches: can be extremely brittle, since the number of possibilities can
never be captured exhaustively.
In the urban context, what does "fast" or "slow" pace mean? Is it:
1. the walking speed of individuals
2. travel times
3. the speed of formation or dissolution of new firms
4. the rates of in or outmigration of goods or people or financial flows
5. the rates of economic processes, such as manufactuing
6. any number of other variables measuring "fast" or "slow"
My concern here is the following: If I have a city that is very small, but is very fast in the sense
that it is a specialist manufracturing city for example, is it fast or slow? Or consider that travel
times increase as a city gets larger, and if congestion sets in, it will take longer in a larger city to
cover the same distance than in an uncongested smaller city - so does that mean that larger cities
are slower, and smaller cities faster, since below a critical threshold, congestion will never
appear?
I found that the entire assumption behind the model is highly simplistic, and does not relate to
urban reality, since there are just way too many exceptions to the rules that are stated here. If we
take these rules as given, then the math for the model follows, so I will not write much about that.
But, the theoretical basis is too simplistic.

I believe that my previous acceptance of the paper as it was perhaps did not take into account
sufficiently the very interdisciplinary nature of the journal. Therefore, some additional
paragraphs and clarifications that the authors have supplied were necessary. I do believe the
topic is important because it considers the creative possibilities within an evolution, as the
peoples decisions affect the outcomes and circumstances, and these both change as a result of the
evolution. I have published some ideas in the past (late 1980s) concerning evolutionary 'drive',
where the capacity of a population to evolve is affected and indeed organized by the evolution
itself, and thus the pathways into the future are richer than most work is concerned with. In other
words, the 'error-making, mutations, innovations, experiments of a population are also a result of
evolution. So, the interplay of the success or failure of explorations/innovations etc. with the
desire to explore or innovate is all part of the complexity of reality. This paper is one of the rare
ones that actually moves beyond a mechanical, though non-linear, response of agents. For that
reason it makes an important contribution.

Dear Editor
The manuscript "A Synergetic Perspective on Urban scaling, Urban Regulatory Focus and their
Interrelations" , by H. Haken and J. Portugali , present a mathematical framework based on
regulatory focus theory to study the behavior of citizens in small and large cities.
All the question were clarified by the author. But I am skeptical if the results are robust. So, I
suggest a modification in the last paragraph of section 4.4, page 22, the authors wrote: “All in all
our model captures qualitatively and quantitatively how the cities context changes the mean bias
of persons and the variance/standard deviation. “
The experimental data used in the present manuscript were based on 201 graduate students from
the University of Tel-Aviv. I think it is too early to say that the empirical data are valid to draw
conclusions about behavior of persons living in large and small cities. It is safer to state that more
data and studies are needed to validate the model. However, there is some evidence based on the
report of the experiment in the article [7].
Limitations of the mathematical model derivation, according to the answers of the last report,
are related to the fact that available the data contain mean and standard deviation (article [7])
9
only. We do not know if the assumption will survive when confronted with large data sample.
Finally, I suggest two references to credit others articles which derives models about statistical
regularities of cities assuming self-similarity fractal structures (page 5, section 1.4) :
Chen, Y., & Zhou, Y. (2008). Scaling laws and indications of self-organized criticality in
urban systems. Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, 35(1), 85-98.
Ribeiro, F. L., Meirelles, J., Ferreira, F. F., & Neto, C. R. (2017). A model of urban scaling
laws based on distance dependent interactions. Royal Society open science, 4(3), 160926.
Minor correction: on page 18, formula 15 change(b_0 ) ¯ for b_0 .
After this complementation , in my opinion, the manuscript is suitable to be publish on Royal
Society Open Science journal.

ption of Figure 2 the authors say self-organizing agent . I know the concept of selforganized systems. All agent
ties are self-organizing agents? What is this? I think the authors should say just agent. What matter is that

explained by the two new paragraphs added to Sect. 2.2 (p. 9-10), there is a difference
ween complex systems in the material, organic and city domains: In the first, the reviewer is
t: the parts (agent) give rise to the self-organized system. In the second, each part (e.g.
mal) is itself a complex self-organized system and this has to be taken into consideration.
lied to cities, it means that cities are dual complex systems: the city as a whole is a complex
-organized system and each urban agent is also a complex self-organized system. As further
lained in the newly added paragraph ( pages 9—10), cities further differ from both, as some
heir parts (such as buildings, roads, etc.) are artifacts and as such simple systems with the
lication that cities are hybrid complex systems.
re 2 left and Figure 3 are the same in my opinion. It is better to eliminate figure 2 or substitute Figure2 left by

omotion focused motivation the proxy for higher response bias? Why more prevention-focused motivation was
ified as behavior slower response? I think is better to supply more information to explain higher or lower

owing the newly added paragraphs in Sect. 1.3, this statement should now be clear.

istorical note may be in order. Fokker (a PhD student of Planck) and Planck derived their
ation in the context of the Langevin equation of Brownian motion, where the physical
cesses at the microscopic level are sufficiently well known. In our present “city” paper, the
ation is quite different, because we don’t have sufficient information on the (social,
nomic, ..) processes on the microscopic level. All we have is the number of people, the mean
e <U+0001D44F> and the standard deviation. To derive, nevertheless, an equation, whose solution can be
pared with experimental data, we resort to the method of making unbiased guesses on
plex systems when only few data (“sparse data”) are known. Starting from Jaynes’
imum (information) entropy principle, and assuming a Markov process, Haken (1988, 2000)

apply the concept of time-scale separation: change of city dynamics is much slower than that

Making contact with observed data
I expected the authors could use real data to validate the model. So, the question is, why I should belief in the
ent model? Why the author did not bring real data in this section? Is the present model a good model?
manuscript is not clear and ready for publication. The point is, a lot of assumptions are made and no one can
e if they are correct or not. The authors should clarify the issues presented here and justify the model better.
ideal would be to identify a concrete case where variables and parameters were calibrated with real data.
se note, firstly, that we have no data on “field experiments” in real cities. Rather, we use data
ed by laboratory experiments with groups of people. Secondly, in our revised Sect. 4.4 we
e calculated (“calibrated”) all parameters for all cases of “real” data and discussed the results
wing that there is a good agreement between those data and our model with the implication
our model is a good one.
sponses to Reviewer 3
page 4, the authors say:
e cities are usually characterized by fast-paced competitive urban dynamics, compared to small cities which are
lly relaxed and slow-paced with a focus on safety, stability, and security.
seems too simplistic and contradictory to agglomeration economics observations that while some small cities
with diverse economic functions, but no primary leading economic function) could indeed be relaxed, slow-
d and focus on safety, stability, and security, some others (say with a very specific economic function, such as
ly automated manufacturing etc.) may be extremely fast-paced and volatile: the city is subject to large and fast
uations because it is tethered to the global economy, and global variations would have a large effect on the
tioning of the city. So, not all large cities are the same, and not all small cities are the same.
esponse to the above comments and in order to clarify the various issues, we’ve re-written
ts. 1.2 and 1.3 and added a new paragraph at the end of Sect. 1.3. See pages 3-5 in the
ched.

demonstration of the LASER - please add a paragraph showing an urban analogy. For example, if there is

ee new paragraphs were added to Sect. 2.1 showing, firstly, formal mathematical applications
he laser paradigm to urban phenomena; secondly, many urban analogies, including the ‘latent
and’ example suggested by the reviewer. A note was also added to the caption of Fig. 1. See
es 7—9 in the attached.
SIRNIA
idea of SIRNIA needs to be more clearly expressed. As it is now written, it is not clear exactly what is meant.
example: Is "I can use a chair as a door stopper" SI or PI? And why? The mapping appears very subjective
arbitrary. Maybe clearer explanation needed.
o new paragraphs were added at the beginning of Sect. 2.2 to clarify the notions of SIRN, IA
their conjunction. See pages 9-10.
r author's describe non-affordable objects, but what about the transformations of functions and affordances? In
ase of a chair as a door stopper, the presumably the SI remains the same, but the PI has changed. How is the
ge in information expressed?
owing this comment we realize that the side-remark (and its figure 3) about the non-
rdable objects as PI does not clarify the issue and instead creates confusion. Since it is
ntially anecdotical and not needed to the main discussion, we have decided to omit it.

the urban context,
does "fast" or "slow" pace mean? Is it:
e walking speed of individuals
avel times
e speed of formation or dissolution of new firms
e rates of in or outmigration of goods or people or financial flows
e rates of economic processes, such as manufactuing
y number of other variables measuring "fast" or "slow"
ew paragraph was added to sect. 1.1 (pages 2-3) about pace of life in cities.
oncern here is the following: If I have a city that is very small, but is very fast in the sense that it is a specialist
ufracturing city for example, is it fast or slow? Or consider that travel times increase as a city gets larger, and
ngestion sets in, it will take longer in a larger city to cover the same distance than in an uncongested smaller
- so does that mean that larger cities are slower, and smaller cities faster, since below a critical threshold,
estion will never appear?
nd that the entire assumption behind the model is highly simplistic, and does not relate to urban reality, since
e are just way too many exceptions to the rules that are stated here. If we take these rules as given, then the
for the model follows, so I will not write much about that. But, the theoretical basis is too simplistic.
noted in the newly added paragraphs (pages 4-5), we are fully aware of exceptions—the
tence of small but fast-paced cities (e.g. Oxford, Silicon valley, …). Urban scaling studies
h as Bettencout’s et al, refer to generic cases and general statistical regularities, to which
e are always exceptions. Ross and Portugali [7], and thus our present study and model, refer
ntially to slow vs. fast paced cities irrespective of their size; the link to city size is due to
ies [1, 6] that despite many exceptions, still indicate positive relations between city size and
e of life.

sponses to the reviewers
would like to thank the reviewers for the time spent in reviewing our manuscript, and for the
ments and questions made, which helped us improve our manuscript. Please find below a
nt-by-point reply to all final comments made by the reviewers toward publication.
ponse to Reviewer 1
esponse to Reviewer’s 1 comments we’ve added the following sentence (with a footnote) at
end of the Conclusions (page 25): “Note that our approach sheds light on the creativity of
lutionary processes, in which people’s error-making, mutations and innovations, are also a
lt of evolution.1 While interesting and significant, these issues should await a subsequent
dy.”
sponses to Reviewer 2
’ve responded to all comments made by Reviewer 2:
suggested by Reviewer 2, we’ve modified the last paragraph of Sect. 4.4 and it is now reads
ollows: “While our model captures qualitatively and quantitively how the city context
nges the mean bias of persons and the variance/standard deviation, we are aware that it
based on experimental data of 201 graduate students from the University of Tel-
. Surely, more data and studies are thus needed to validate the model and to draw more
eral conclusions about behavior of persons living in large and small cities.
ne with Reviewer 2 comment, we’ve added to Sect. 1.4 (page 5) the two references that
ves models about statistical regularities of cities assuming self-similarity fractal structures.
