The manuscript by Liu et al. is a nice piece of research and should be accepted. I recommend
certain minor revisions with the language used and it would be nice if help of native english
speaker could be sought. In general, the modulator effect of GQDs on Aß1-42 aggregation is
very well explained and well-characterized by the techniques like TEM, XPS, FTIR and CD.
Finally, MTT assay is also done which proves GQD are bio-compatible and can serve as good
therapeutic tool against Alzheimer's.

In this manuscript, authors studied the regulatory effects and mechanism of graphene quantum
dots (GQDs) on 1-42 ß-amyloid (Aß1-42) aggregation. Based on their study, the mechanism of
the regulatory effects of GQDs on the Aß1-42 aggregation was proposed. This manuscript is well
suitable for publication in Royal Society Open Science after minor revision.
1. It’s better to describe more clearly (with more detail) about the experimental procedures,
especially concerning the fiber formation and inhibition process (including pH adjustment).
2. Fig. 3 indicated the time mass ratio of GQDs and Aß1-42 peptide was 1: 1. How to determine
the ratio?
3. Some typo or format problems: H2SO4 and HNO3, etc.

Response to the Reviewer #2’s comments
We would like to express our sincere thanks to your positive comments. Those
comments are all valuable for improving our paper. We have revised the manuscript
point-by-point according to your comments. The main revisions are listed as follows:
Point 1:
It’s better to describe more clearly (with more detail) about the experimental
procedures, especially concerning the fiber formation and inhibition process
(including pH adjustment).
Author’s Response:
Thanks a lot for your kindly advices. We have described the experimental
procedure more clearly according to your suggestion.
The fiber formation of Aß1-42 was prepared by incubating the peptide solution at 37 <U+2103>
for 72 h. In the brief, Aß1-42 powder was dissolved in
1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) at a concentration of 1 mg mL-1, and further
incubated at 37 <U+2103> for 6 h. Then the dissolved Aß1-42 solution was separated into 100
µL per tube and dried under nitrogen gas. Afterwards, the dried Aß1-42 peptide was
re-dissolved in PBS buffer at a concentration of 20 µM with 10 µL DMSO as
cosolvent. The Aß1-42 peptide was put in a constant temperature shaker at 37 <U+2103> and
incubated for 72 h to form the mature fibril.
In the inhibition process of Aß1-42 peptide aggregation by GQDs, the Aß1-42 peptide
was dissolved into PBS at a concentration of 50 µM in the presence of 10 µL DMSO.
The GQDs was lyophilized and re-dissolved into PBS at a concentration of 10 mg/mL.
After that, a certain amount of Aß1-42 peptide and GQDs with the mass ratio of 100: 1,
10: 1, 1: 1, 1: 5 were mixed and PBS buffer was added into the mixture to adjust the
final concentration of Aß1-42 peptide at 20 µM. The free Aß1-42 peptide with the
concentration of 20 µM was prepared as control. After being incubated for 72 h, the
inhibitory effect of GQDs in Aß1-42 peptide aggregation was investigated by TEM,
DLS and CD.
The same procedure was used to investigated the regulatory effect of GQDs in
Aß1-42 peptide aggregation at pH 10. When the mixture prepared according to the
method mentioned above was incubated for 72 h, 0.1 M NaOH was added into the
mixture with 5 µL per drop, the pH of the system was monitored by a mini pH
detector. The mixture was incubated for another 72 h in a constant temperature shaker
at 37 <U+2103> before detected by TEM, DLS when the pH was adjusted to 10.
(line 112-13, 6-17 in page 4)
Point 2:
Fig. 3 indicated the mass ratio of GQDs and Aß1-42 peptide was 1: 1. How to
determine the ratio?
Author’s Response:
Thanks a lot for your suggestion. We are so sorry for missing the relevant
information of the method to determine the mass ration of GQDs and Aß1-42 peptide in
experimental section.
Briefly, Aß1-42 powder was dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP)
at a concentration of 1 mg mL-1, and further incubated at 37 <U+2103> for 6 h. Then the
dissolved Aß1-42 solution was separated into 100 µL per tube and dried under nitrogen
gas. Afterwards, the dried Aß1-42 peptide was re-dissolved in PBS buffer at a
concentration of 50 µM with 10 µL DMSO as cosolvent. The GQDs was lyophilized
and re-dissolved into PBS at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. then the GQDs was added
into the Aß1-42 peptide solution with the mass ratio of 1: 1. After that, additional PBS
was added into the mixture to adjust the final concentration of Aß1-42 peptide at 20 µM.
Last, the morphology of the mixture was observed by TEM after being incubated for
72 h.
Point 3:
Some typo or format problems: H2SO4 and HNO3, etc.
Author’s Response:
Thanks a lot for your suggestion. We are sorry for the careless mistakes in the
manuscript. We have checked the whole article and all the similar mistakes have been
corrected.
