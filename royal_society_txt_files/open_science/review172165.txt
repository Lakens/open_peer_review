This manuscript investigated a combined dopamine-peptide surface modification of stainless
steel.
The hypothesis is reasonable, but, as with many of these type of studies the question about the
long term robustness of the surface modification is highly relevant for the translation of these
ideas to practical applications. This study, does not discuss this aspect, which is disappointing,
The choices of peptides used in this study is not explained and apart from some sequence data,
there is little or no description about them.
The overall result, which, although shows a statistical difference between the peptide coated
surfaces and the controls, is only a marginal improvement and would not seem to me to be
something that would prompt other researcher o pursue this further.
The study is reasonable well designed, there are appropriate use of controls, some statistical
analysis and a reasonable degree of surface characterisations.
The biofilms assays are quite limited. There was no bactericidal testing undertaken. There was no
time dependent studies undertaken, the effect of medium, TSB interaction with the surfaces was
not properly addressed.

Although the paper is interesting from a general point of view regarding lowering the adherence
of bacteria onto metal surfaces, the data presented in this paper are not convincing enough to be
published as such.

At first, how can the authors based the successful grafting of dopamine onto SS using the FTIR
spectra presented in figure 1 and 3. All I can see, and all most of the specialist of FTIR will see in
these spectra is noise due to water fringes and more likely very bad pruging of the system.How
can the authors decipher accurate wavelength reading such as 1450 (page 9)
despite the very poor quality FTIR specrta, the correlation in between sets of data are not
convincing or badly explained. For instance, from the text accompanying figure 2, one can
understand that there is a relation between the quantity of nitrogen on SS surface and the contact
angle. However, when %N is increasing from 5 to 40 mg/L and then decreasing , the WCA keep
decreasing through the all range of concentration?
Then the authors speak about the validity of their antibiofilm stainless steel surfaces for use in
ship tribology or medical implant. I am not sure that 304 SS is relevant for biomedical implant.
On the samme idea using S. Aureus and E coli for ship biofouling is probably not relevant either.
finally, the authors do a study of the surface structuration by using different polishing disk,
enabling different surface rugosity (a very well know phenomenon) and observe that a higher
grain will lower the adhesion of bacteria. I could have been nice to try to analyse a bit more into
details the reasons of that either that a simple statement.
For all these reasons, I think the paper could be of interest to the reader but definitely not under
this form, and more than major corrections are needed to highly improuve the quality of this
paper. Therefore I suggrejection of this manuscrit .

Therefore I suggest rejection of this manuscript.

The revised version has some improvements but there are two issues outstanding;
1. My original point 1 about the robustness of the method has not been properly addressed. Its
explanation is poor and the there is alack of statistical analysis. I'm also not sure the duration of
the analysis (up to 96 hours) is sufficient.
2. The quality of English is still poor.

label_comment_4
The authors have answered well most of the questions raised by both referees, and especially
improved the quality of physical and chemical characterisation by means of XPS instead of ATR
FT-IR.
It is now clear that PolyDopa was indeed bound to the SS surface.
However, I do have new questions about the new experiments and set of data.
1/Starting with XPS.
The authors present only the XPS data of N1s in the case of polydopa (PD) coatings.
This indeed proves the grafting of PD, but I dont agree with the conclusions of the authors by
simply analysing the N1s data.
The authors should include the survey spectra for all samples (as sup info) but should most of all
add the spectra obtained for Iron and Chromium. This would have a double meaning. First of all,
it is known that polydopa films in the conditions used in this manuscript could have a thickness
upgoing to 50 nm. By showing and analysing Fe2p Xps xps spectra, one could estimate, first, the
thickness of the PD film by looking at the decrease of the signal of iron. Secondly, keeping in
mind that the mean free pass of iron (chromium) electrons in organic layer will be close to 3 or 4
nm, that would mean that the iron (chromium) signal wild be extinct for a thickness of PD close
to 10-12 nm. Therefore when looking at the N1s signal, one should first look at the N1s/Fe2p
(N1s/Cr2p) ratio instead of simply the intensity of N1s.
In fact, when the authors state that a plateau is reached on the N1s intensity increased for
concentration values of dopa higher than 40 mg/mL, maybe this plateau appears simply because
the thickness of the PD film is higher than 12 nm, and that film analysed is only the PD film and
that there is no influence of the SS underlying metal. Thus the quantity of N1s detected will
always be identical regardless of the evolution of the concentration of the Dopa-tris solution used.
Therefore, when looking at the sole N1s signal, I am sure 100% sure that the conclusion of the
authors is valid. Further calculations should be made on the XPS data.
2/ P1 and P2 grafting. The authors state page 10 that the antibacterial capacity of P1 is higher
than P2, based on the data presented on figure 9. This statement can be correct only if there is the
7
same amount of both P1 and P2 grafted on the surface.
When looking at Figure 3, the XPS data for S2p clearly demonstrate the presence of P1 and P2 at
the surface, since sulfur is a marker for both P1 and P2 due to the presence of 2 containing S
fragments in positions 2 and 15. However, keeping in mind that there is the same amount of S in
both peptides, and also keeping in mind that XPS is quantitative, from figure 3, one has the
feeling that there is 3 to 4 time more P1 at the surface than P1. Therefore the statement about the
higher antibacterial activity of P1 over P2 can be simply due to a higher surface concentration of
P1 and not to its inherent capacity.
To confirm this statement I suggest the authors provide/perform two set of data. First of all,
calculate the surface density of P1 and P2 and correlate this density with the antibacterial activity.
In addition, MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) in solution for both peptides should also be
performed, in order to evaluate the bactericidal efficiency of each peptide.
Only these data can confirm or not the statement about the better efficiency of one peptide over
the other one.
3/ I appreciate the effort made by the authors to try to correlate the roughness of the different
polished SS surfaces with the bacterial adhesion, and the literature cited tend to confirm the data
presented by the authors.
However, I do have additional questions about the polishing.
First of all, what is the polishing grain used for the experiments involving PolyDopa films and P1
and P2 films? Is it #600, or all grains were used for the further surfaces modifications?
Secondly, I come back on the thickness of the polydopa film. If a thickness of 50 nm of PD films is
achieved on the SS polished surfaces, do the authors have an idea of the Sa and Sq of these
resulting films? If the thickness of PD is homogeneous and follows the roughness of the polished
surface, the antiadhesive properties observed on simply polished surfaces, should be transferred
to the grafted surfaces. However, one should also consider that the surface polymerisation of
dopa can smooth the initial roughness.
Once these questions will be answered, I think that the paper can be published.

Response to Reviewer(s)' Comments:
Reviewer: 1
1. The hypothesis is reasonable, but, as with many of these type of studies the question about the
long term robustness of the surface modification is highly relevant for the translation of these
ideas to practical applications. This study, does not discuss this aspect, which is disappointing,
Response: Thanks for the reviewers good suggestions. Now we have conducted robustness assay
for the modified surface, i.e. the modified samples have been immersed and shaked in liquid for
different length of time before assessing their antibiofilm capacity. The detailed experimental
method and outcome are supplemented in the revision of the manuscript, section 2.5 and 3.3.2.
2. The choices of peptides used in this study is not explained and apart from some sequence data,
there is little or no description about them.
Response: Besides the information of peptide sequences and GRAVY value, we have added
design rationales for the two peptides in section 2.3 of the revised version.
3. The overall result, which, although shows a statistical difference between the peptide coated
surfaces and the controls, is only a marginal improvement and would not seem to me to be
something that would prompt other researcher to pursue this further.
Response: This study is to develop a new technique for antibiofilm surface. The statistical
difference of antibiofilm capacity between the peptide treated surfaces and the controls confirms
that the technique is feasible and worth to be investigated. The further research is on-going to
optimize the surface property on peptide design, hydrophobicity, surface charge and hydration
capacity. Some suggestions for further development of this technique have been included in the
last paragraph of discussion section.
4. The biofilms assays are quite limited. There was no bactericidal testing undertaken. There was
no time dependent studies undertaken, the effect of medium, TSB interaction with the surfaces
was not properly addressed.
Response: In response to the reviews comments, we have conducted bactericidal assay for the
peptides under PBS and TSB medium respectively. The outcomes of the resistance capacity of the
treated samples to S. aureus and the effect of medium on the resistance capacity have been added
in section 2.5 and 3.3.3.

spectra presented in figure 1 and 3? All I can see, and all most of the FTIR specialists will see in
these spectra is noise due to water fringes and more likely very bad pruging of the system. How
can the authors decipher accurate wavelength reading such as 1450 (page 9) despite the very poor
quality FTIR spetra, the correlation between sets of data are not convincing or badly explained.
For instance, from the text accompanying figure 2, one can understand that there is a correlation
between the quantity of nitrogen on SS surface and the contact angle. However, when %N is
increasing from 5 to 40 mg/L and then decreasing, the WCA keep decreasing through the entire
range of concentration?
Response: We agree that the FTIR spectra were with noise signals, which was mainly due to the
thin grafting surface and the ATR sampling technique. We have conducted XPS study and replaced
all FTIR and EDS data by XPS spectra. The new data confirm that XPS spectra was more
sensitive for elements analysis and grafting efficiency study of the modified surface than FTIR
and EDS techniques. However, the outcome tendency was consistent with previous FTIR and EDS
study, i.e. the percentage of N increased from 5 to 40 mg/L then reached plateau for dopamine
reacted samples. WCA did not decrease through the entire range of concentration. It decreased
from 5 mg/L reaction and reached plateau from 20 mg/L. The details of the XPS outcome are
added in section 2.1 and 2.4 with new figures (Figure 1, 2, 3).
2. Then the authors speak about the validity of their antibiofilm stainless steel surfaces for use in
ship tribology or medical implant. I am not sure that 304 SS is relevant for biomedical implant. On
the same idea using S. aureus and E coli for ship biofouling is probably not relevant either.
Response: We appreciate the reviewers comments. We agree that the metal sample and the types
of bacteria in this study were not the exact candidates in ship tribology or medical implant.
However, they are relevant to the two cases. 316L stainless steel is iron material used in medical
implant. Its composition, containing 16% chromium, 10% nickel and 2% molybdenum, is very
similar to 304 material with 18% chromium and 8% nickel. The addition of molybdenum is to
help resist corrosion to chlorides. Whilst S. aureus and E coli can be found in waste water and
river causing biofouling as well as in human body. In addition, 304 SS and S. aureus and E coli
have been used in other antimicrobial capacity study, offering good references and comparison to
our study. We have included these papers in the revised manuscript as references (Reference
no.18-20 and 22-25).
3. Finally, the authors do a study of the surface structuration by using different polishing disk,
enabling different surface rugosity (a very well know phenomenon) and observe that a higher
grain will lower the adhesion of bacteria. It would have been nice to try to analyse in a bit more
detail the reasons for that than just providing a simple statement.
Response: Thanks for the reviewers good suggestions and instructions. We have added extra
discussion for the potential mechanisms of the surface rugosity phenomenon in section 3.3.4 and
discussion. Based on our analysis, we propose that the attachment point theory might be one of the
mechanisms to explain our outcome.

Comments to the Author(s)
The revised version has some improvements but there are two issues outstanding;
1. My original point 1 about the robustness of the method has not been properly addressed. Its
explanation is poor and the there is a lack of statistical analysis. I'm also not sure the duration of
the analysis (up to 96 hours) is sufficient.
Response:
We have addressed the issue of robustness of the modified surfaces through a new robustness
assay with associated explanation in our previous revised version. The reason that we selected up
to 96 hours duration for this assessment was that we found that the initial increase of OD value
stopped for the samples over 24 hours immersion and shaking treatment (Figure 8). The increase
of OD values was likely due to the loss of some of the physically bound peptides, thus causing the
slight decrease of their antibiofilm capacity after the samples subjecting to liquid immersion and
shaking. However, extending such treatment from 24 to 96 hours did not change OD values
further on the basis of statistical analysis (Table 1). Basing on these results, the duration of 96
hours was believed sufficient to test its robustness. Importantly, the peptide-treated surfaces after
96 hours washing still showed the better antibiofilm capacity than the control surfaces (Figure 6
and 7). These results indicated that remained peptides on the sample surfaces were firmly bound
and still possessed antibiofilm property. We have added extra text in the Results section to explain
the observations. We agree that more comprehensive assays could be undertaken to understand the
robustness mechanisms of the treated surface in the future.

duration.

2. The quality of English is still poor.
Response:
Thanks for the reviewers comments. The English of the revised version has been carefully and
thoroughly checked.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have answered well most of the questions raised by both referees, and especially
improved the quality of physical and chemical characterization by means of XPS instead of ATR
FT-IR.
It is now clear that PolyDopa was indeed bound to the SS surface.
However, I do have new questions about the new experiments and set of data.
1/Starting with XPS.
The authors present only the XPS data of N1s in the case of polydopa (PD) coatings.
This indeed proves the grafting of PD, but I dont agree with the conclusions of the authors by
simply analysing the N1s data.
The authors should include the survey spectra for all samples (as sup info) but should most of all
add the spectra obtained for Iron and Chromium. This would have a double meaning. First of all, it
is known that. By showing and analysing Fe2p Xps xps spectra, one could estimate, first, the
thickness of the PD film by looking at the decrease of the signal of iron. Secondly, keeping in
mind that the mean free pass of iron (chromium) electrons in organic layer will be close to 3 or 4
nm, that would mean that the iron (chromium) signal wild be extinct for a thickness of PD close to
10-12 nm. Therefore when looking at the N1s signal, one should first look at the N1s/Fe2p
(N1s/Cr2p) ratio instead of simply the intensity of N1s.
In fact, when the authors state that a plateau is reached on the N1s intensity increased for
concentration values of dopa higher than 40 µg/mL, maybe this plateau appears simply because
the thickness of the PD film is higher than 12 nm, and that film analysed is only the PD film and
that there is no influence of the SS underlying metal. Thus the quantity of N1s detected will
always be identical regardless of the evolution of the concentration of the Dopa-tris solution used.
Therefore, when looking at the sole N1s signal, I am sure 100% sure that the conclusion of the
authors is valid. Further calculations should be made on the XPS data.
Response:
Thanks for the reviewers constructive suggestions. The survey spectra of all samples have been
added into the manuscript now (Figure 1). The reviewers comments and prediction are correct.
When the low dopamine concentration, 5 <U+F06D>g/ml, was used, a small peak at around 710 eV (iron
signal) appeared in the survey spectra, indicating that the bound dopamine did not cover the
sample surface or the thickness of dopamine layer was smaller than 10 nm. It was clear that no
iron or chromium signal was detected when the used dopamine concentrations were larger than 10
<U+F06D>g/mL. Therefore, it is believed that the dopamine binding to whole tested sample surface has
occurred and the dopamine grafting layer was higher than 10 nm when the dopamine
concentrations were large than 10 <U+F06D>g/mL. To further clarify the sample preparation procedure for
XPS measurement, we also added more detailed description of the sample washing procedure
which ensured removal of physically trapped dopamine in Section 3.2.
Section 3.2: At the end of reaction, dopamine-treated discs, denoted as SS-D, were removed from
the reaction mixture and ultrasonically washed for 20 min in deionized water to remove polymeric
dopamine or physically trapped products, followed by rinsing with a large amount of deionized
water and air-dried
2/ P1 and P2 grafting. The authors state page 10 that the antibacterial capacity of P1 is higher than
P2, based on the data presented on figure 9. This statement can be correct only if there is the same
amount of both P1 and P2 grafted on the surface.
When looking at Figure 3, the XPS data for S2p clearly demonstrate the presence of P1 and P2 at
the surface, since sulfur is a marker for both P1 and P2 due to the presence of 2 containing S
fragments in positions 2 and 15. However, keeping in mind that there is the same amount of S in
both peptides, and also keeping in mind that XPS is quantitative, from figure 3, one has the feeling
that there is 3 to 4 time more P1 at the surface than P1. Therefore the statement about the higher
antibacterial activity of P1 over P2 can be simply due to a higher surface concentration of P1 and
not to its inherent capacity.
To confirm this statement I suggest the authors provide/perform two set of data. First of all,
calculate the surface density of P1 and P2 and correlate this density with the antibacterial activity.
In addition, MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) in solution for both peptides should also be
performed, in order to evaluate the bactericidal efficiency of each peptide.
Only these data can confirm or not the statement about the better efficiency of one peptide over
the other one.
Response:
We appreciate the reviewers constructive and thoughtful comments. We agree that statement of
antibacterial capacity of P1 is higher than P2 is not appropriate. We have made changes in the
manuscript accordingly.
Our initial goal of this was to assess whether peptide bound steel samples have antibacterial
capacity, but not to compare the peptides antibiofilm/antibacterial capacity per se. The overall
antibacterial capacity of peptide-treated steel samples will depend on the peptides antibacterial
capacity and its quantity grafted on the surfaces. Our results confirmed that both P1 and P2 had
antibacterial capacity. After the calculation of the integrated area of S2p peak in XPS spectra, it
was demonstrated that P1 had higher reactivity to bind to dopamine-modified steel surface than P2
under the same reaction condition (around 2.5 times higher integrated area for the S2p peak of
SS-P1 than that of SS-P2). Hence it is likely that higher bound P1 peptide led to better
antibacterial capacity. However, the data in the current study did not provide sufficient evidence
of higher antibacterial activity of P1 over P2. In light of this, we have changed our statement in the
Result and Discussion parts as:
The P1-modified steel discs (SS-P1) showed the stronger antifouling and antibacterial property
than SS-P2. Such difference may be attributed to the different conformation and sequence of the
amino acid residues in the polypeptides, which led to distinct grafted peptide content on the steel
sample surface as shown in S2p peak and integrated area in the XPS spectra (Figure 1). The higher
content of cationic kysine (K), and hydrophilic serine (S) and threonine (T) in P1 was likely to be
beneficial to the higher reactivity to the polydopamine and the relatively stronger
antibiofilm/antibacterial effect obtained.
3/ I appreciate the effort made by the authors to try to correlate the roughness of the different
polished SS surfaces with the bacterial adhesion, and the literature cited tend to confirm the data
presented by the authors.
However, I do have additional questions about the polishing.
First of all, what is the polishing grain used for the experiments involving PolyDopa films and P1
and P2 films? Is it #600, or all grains were used for the further surfaces modifications?
Secondly, I come back on the thickness of the polydopa film. If a thickness of 50 nm of PD films
is achieved on the SS polished surfaces, do the authors have an idea of the Sa and Sq of these
resulting films? If the thickness of PD is homogeneous and follows the roughness of the polished
surface, the antiadhesive properties observed on simply polished surfaces, should be transferred to
the grafted surfaces. However, one should also consider that the surface polymerisation of dopa
can smooth the initial roughness.
Response:
Thanks for the reviewers good suggestions. We apologize for the lack of clarity in the description
of the polishing procedure. We used different sand papers of 180, 240, 600, 1000, 1200 and 2000#
coat grit for the last step to polish the samples before they reacted with dopamine and peptides
sequentially in order to compare the topographic effect on the reactivity to peptides and the
antibiofilm capacity. Only P1 was used for this topographic study. For the experiments involving
PolyDopa, P1 and P2 reaction and comparisons, the final polishing grain for the sand paper was
600#. The more detailed description has been added in the Method section.
The Sa and Sq were 0.78 µm and 0.34 µm for the surfaces polished by 600# sand paper,
respectively. The Sa and Sq value would be unlikely changed significantly after binding dopamine
or peptide layers, which were estimated to be at a 50 nm thick scale, if we can measure them.
Realistically, we could not measure Sa and Sq accurately values after peptide reactions by two
reasons. First, the current lateral and vertical resolutions of the surface profile measuring
instrument were 0.1 and 0.2 µm respectively; second, the peptide layer will be very soft in
comparison to the iron underneath, which will make the measurement inaccurate.
Measured from the ultra-deep 3D micro-system images (Figure 11-B), it can be seen that the
largest grooves depths could be 2.336 µm for the surfaces polished by 600# sand paper. The initial
roughness of the polished surface will be difficult, if not impossible, to become smoother by the
polymerisation of dopamine due to the thin layer of polydopamine products (around 50 nm). We
have ultrasonically washed dopamine-treated discs for further reaction, which reduced the
contamination of polymeric dopamine or physically trapped products.
Once these questions will be answered, I think that the paper can be published.
