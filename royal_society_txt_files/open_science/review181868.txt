Reviewer: Rebecca Hirst (University of Nottingham, UK)
Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to review this paper. The manuscript is very clearly
written and easy to follow. It is clear how this study builds upon existing literature to answer an
interesting question. The pre-registration and organisation of supplementary material and data

are also very clearly presented for future researchers to use. I only have two minor
comments/suggestions:
1. For the analyses in this paper the McGurk effect is quantified as the difference between
incongruent and auditory only. However, it looks as though Proverbio et al also compared
congruent and incongruent trials (in addition to incongruent vs auditory only). A short
justification as to why this effect was not explored in this study could make it easier to compare
between studies.
2. I was unable to open the .zil data files on my mac operating system. Perhaps providing data in
a second format (or providing info on how to open the .zil files - even if it means the user should
find a windows computer) would increase data accessibility further (although another format
may not work with the available R scripts?).
Nevertheless, from what I have read, I would recommend this paper for publication, and I look
forward to reading the results.

Revision of paper: Are skilled musicians subject to the McGurk effect?
The paper presented is full of falsehood, imprecisions, misunderstandings and incorrect
statements referred to Proverbio et al. (2016) study. Plus, there is a complete lack of theoretical
knowledge. Sounds and phonemes are not the same thing!! Also stimuli used in the two studies
were different, and, especially, Proverbio et al’s stimuli were not noisy.
Abstract
The authors stat that “sounds are often mis-perceived” in McGurk effect. This is incorrect.
Sounds are perceived fine, phonemes are mis-catagorized
The authors state in the abstract:
“it is not clear, however, if this is intended to mean that skilled musicians do not experience the
McGurk effect at all, or if they just experience it to a lesser magnitude than non-musicians”
This is not scientific language!! The paper by Proverbio et al. (2016) showed that:
<<The analyses of data performed as a function of the phonemes auditorily perceived showed
the statistical significance of “condition” factor (congruent vs. incongruent conditions) (F
8,112 = 3.646; p < 0.0008), but only for controls. The analysis of group effects and Tukey post-hoc
tests showed no significant difference between the congruent and the McGurk conditions in
musicians but only in controls.>>
In scientific terms: there was no difference in the ability to correctly categorize phonemes in the
AV congruent vs incongruent condition (meaning at all). The tendencies visible in the figure but
not statistically significant cannot be considered as “to a lesser magnitude”, this is not the
scientific methods
3
The authors state: “The study also does not statistically demonstrate either of these conclusions”
This is totally false, as explained below, and should be imperatively changed!
The authors state: “as it does report a numerical (albeit non-significant) McGurk effect for
musicians, and does not report a significant difference between musicians' and non-musicians'
McGurk effect sizes.”
Again this is not correct, and, indeed, false. Proverbio et al. (2016) showed a significant decrease
in the ability to correctly categorize phonemes in controls but NOT in musicians, and reported all
the statistics!
<<as a function of the phonemes auditorily perceived showed the statistical significance of
“condition” factor (congruent vs. incongruent conditions) (F 8,112 = 3.646; p < 0.0008), but only
for controls
s a function of the labial (lip movements) perceived was statistically significant (F 8,112 = 2.685;
p < 0.0097), but only for controls.>>
ABSTRACT. The authors state “and changing from a between- to a within-participants
manipulation).!!
In Proverbio et al et al. 2016 the manipulation was WITHIN participants. ???
Introduction
The authors state: “People comprehend physical stimuli, they integrate information from
multiple sensory modalities to generate a psychological percept. “
This is too generic, include appropriate scientific quotations relative to AV integration processes.
Again please use a scientific language!
For example, the way people perceive a sound can be modulated by visual sensory information
accompanying the sound. Perhaps the most famous example of this is the McGurk effect,
whereby people tend to mis-perceive sounds.
This is incorrect. The McGurk effect has nothing to do with “sounds”, but with phoneme
categorizations. The too processes are completely different (please read and include some
literature)
Line 42 “experience changes some mechanisms of basic sound perception” again there are many
evidences that musical ability modify linguistic perception and ability. We are not talking only
about a finer acoustic ability
Page 2 (lines 47-51) the experiment did not reveal a significant difference between musicians'
accuracy in audiovisual "McGurk" stimuli and audio-only stimuli, they nevertheless showed a
large numerical effect in the direction of a typical McGurk effect (higher accuracy in audio-only
than audiovisual stimuli).
This is profoundly incorrect and false, and should be imperatively changed!
In Proverbio et al. (2016) study, both musicians and controls showed no difference between the
auditory unimodal and audiovisual congruent conditions
(Musicians: visual = 10%; auditory = 90%; audiovisual = 93.75%. Controls: visual = 11.25%;
auditory = 93.75%; audiovisual = 95%)
The authors state on page 2 (lines 51-52) the experiment likely had low power to detect a
significant effect, as this critical comparison was between only 10 participants who heard audio-
only stimuli and 20 who saw audiovisual stimuli
That’s’ totally incorrect and false. In Proverbio et al. (2016) say (right before the results)
“In this study, 80 healthy, age-matched, graduate male and female volunteers were tested both in
multimodal (McGurk condition) and unimodal (only auditory and only visual) conditions.”
4
Did you even read the paper?!)
The authors state on line 27 page 4: “As Proverbio and colleagues had 30 musicians and 30 non-
musicians”
This is again incorrect!
The stimuli used were different from Proverbio et al (2016)
The authors state: “we limited ourselves to consonants that form existing morphemes in both
Mandarin and Cantonese in the frame /_a/. We did not use /n/ because /n/ and /l/ are
merged in many southern dialects of Mandarin and Cantonese. We also did not use /g/ because,
while both /ka<U+02E5> / and /ga<U+02E5> / are not very meaningful in Mandarin (they are mainly used in
phonetic borrowings, like <U+5496><U+5561>/ka<U+02E5> fei <U+02E5> / coffee"), /ka <U+02E5> / is much more frequent.”
The stimuli used by Stephen Politzer-Ahles & Lei Pan are full of acoustic noise, and this is
absolutely not comparable to the experimental conditions used by Proverbio et al (2016) study in
which there was silence in background! Phoneme perception is worsened by the noise presence.

label_comment_3
The authors have presented a plan to replicate a recent paper that compared the McGurk effect
between musicians and non-musicians in Italy. The methods are straightforward and I think the
original manuscript is a good one to attempt to replicate.
I am overall in favor of this replication attempt, but think the authors should do a bit more work
to emphasize the generalizability of the current findings. Specifically, a power analysis of sorts
would help determine if even n=60 per group is adequate to find small effects. As the authors' are
aware from the Gelman articles they cite, a problem with studying small effects with small
sample sizes is that any statistically significant effect tends to be exaggerated -- see also [1] below
for application of this idea to between-group studies of the McGurk effect. This is important to
ensure that these replication results are more decisive.
Second, the authors note that the "ga" syllable was not used (or will not be used), because of the
subjects' native language. References concerning the robustness of the McGurk effect in their
chosen population should be included to address head on any possibility of floor effect hiding
any potential group effect.

Comments to the Author:
Three expert reviewers have now assessed your submission. Reviewers 1 and 3 are positive and
recommend in principle acceptance (IPA) after addressing some disrepancies between the
analyses in the replication study compared with the original study, the rationale for the sample
size (and consequent statistical power), concerns about the eliciting stimuli, and the accessibility
of key materials. Reviewer 2, however, is much more critical, recommending rejection. The
reviewer points to key differences between the replication study compared with the original
study, as well as apparent errors of fact in describing the original study. Given the positive nature
of reviews 1 and 3, I am going to invite a major revision. Please note that to achieve Stage 1 IPA, it
is imperative that these issues are either resolved or sufficiently rebutted. Concerns about major
deviations from the original methodology are the most serious issue, as the Replications format at
label_version_2
RSOS is designed for close replications rather than conceptual replications.

Editor Comments to Author (Professor Chris Chambers):
The revised manuscript was returned to two of the three original reviewers who assessed the
initial Stage 1 submission (Reviewers 1 and 2). Reviewer 1 is now satisfied with the manuscript
and recommends IPA (though please note the reviewer's point about noise in the stimuli for the
Discussion at Stage 2). Reviewer 2 remains unsatisifed and recommends rejection.
The reviews are therefore strongly polarised, with Reviewers 1 and 3 in favour of IPA and
Reviewer 2 against. Having read your submission, your response to Reviewer 2, and the original
target paper for the replication, I am satisfied that you have adequately rebutted the concerns of
Reviewer 2. Stage 1 IPA is therefore granted.

This is the third time I have read this manuscript (although the first time I have read the results
and discussion). The manuscript reports an attempted replication of Proverbio et al (2016),
reporting that Musicians are not susceptible to the McGurk effect. The results suggest that
12
Musicians are in fact susceptible to the effect, perhaps more so than non-musicians. I found the
manuscript and the available data clear and easy to navigate. I do have a few comments on the
results/discussion:
1. Although I am aware that this was not in the pre-registered analysis plan, it is curious that the
two coding conditions are not statistically compared - such that it could be said that including
stimuli with inconsistent place articulation results in significantly lower accuracy than consistent
place articulation? Even if this is not explored statistically, it seems this could be given some
mention in the discussion. This is important to guide future research design, and also because the
authors suggest that lower McGurk effects in Proverbio et al’s study might in part have been due
to the type of stimuli included.
2. Page 12, line 34 “If anything, is musicians are better than non-musicians at processing speech in
noise” another very relevant reference here is Coffey et al “Speech-in-noise perception in
musicians: A review”
3. Page 13 line 4 “The present study obviously rules out those conclusions: if musicians are
indeed subject to the McGurk effect, then McGurk studies do not provide any evidence for brain-
level functional reorganization as a result of musical training.” This seems quite a bold claim
considering this study still reported between groups differences (albeit in the opposite direction
to Proverbio and colleagues!). Differences between groups surely suggests that the McGurk
effects might show some functional differences – although the exact nature of these would need
brain imaging studies to confirm the nature of plasticity (which the authors acknowledge this
study does not rule out).

The authors have revealed the results of their replication attempt. They find substantial McGurk
effect in musicians and non-musicians, contra the previous report. The increased sample size,
suitable and pre-registered analysis plan, and robust experimental design provide confidence
that these results easily meet the requirements for a solid replication study. Because the results
are not in-line with the past paper, there will likely be substantial push back from any potential
strong adherents to the original result. For this reason, and to make the paper more suitable to a
general audience, I've suggested several changes below that will make the report easier to
understand. Most importantly, a table that directly addresses points of similarity and
dissimilarity between the papers is essential prior to publication.
Results
Page 9, bottom paragraph
The authors provide two comparisons between musicians and non-musician levels of mcgurk. CI
says no diff, GLMM says yes, likely b/c of odds-ratios are more sensitive to changes in
probability scale. It would be helpful for a non-specialist reader to have this apparent (not actual)
13
contradiction explained away.
Additionally, the authors should make clear which parameters are being referred to when
presenting the coefficients from the GLMM. For instance, in the sentence, "The statistical analysis
confirmed that musicians have a highly significant McGurk effect (b=-2.34, z=-18.37, p<.001), and
that it in fact is significantly larger than the non-musicians' McGurk effect (b=0.46, z=2.72,
p=.007)" I would think the first parameter is the main effect (intercept term) of condition (Incong
< audio) and the second parameter is the interaction between condition and group, but this
should be made explicit. Similar for secondary analysis, page 10, lines 38-42.
Discussion
The authors should remind the reader of the relative sample sizes in the first sentence, rather than
just referring to the proportional increase.
I found the first paragraph of the discussion hard to follow as it tallies similarities and differences
between the results. A figure here with appropriate confidence intervals would bring great clarity
and provide a useful summary of the replication attempt.
The second paragraph also devolves a bit into diatribe listing the problems with the original
study's numerical analysis. I think this is a serious issue, and thus should not be relegated to a,
quite long, 79-word parenthetical remark. Instead, the authors should create separate paragraphs
for each reason a direct comparison of the numerical results is difficult/impossible.
A rehash of major differences between the original and replication study would be helpful,
perhaps as a table. This allows readers to form their own opinion about how closely the
replication followed the original. I think the point about musicians (in general) perceiving the
McGurk illusion is well-demonstrated by this new paper, but perhaps there were things in the
original study that made a null-finding more likely, e.g., sample/population characteristics,
stimuli used etc. Again, having this information in a table will facilitate easy comparison and
provide some structure for the discussion.
Minor Points

Page 12, line 16-17 should be made stronger than just "we believe our result… to be the more
robust one." Indeed, all the improvements listed render the new results simply more robust.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Professor Chris Chambers):
The manuscript was returned to two of the three reviewers who assessed the protocol at Stage 1.
Both reviewers are positive about the Stage 2 submission and recommend publication following
minor revision, focusing on clarifications to the presentation, including the interpretation of the
results and the Discussion. Concerning point #1 from Reviewer 1, it would be acceptable for the
authors to report an additional analysis if it is noted that this analysis was undertaken in addition
16
to the approved Stage 1 plan. Provided the authors address the reviewers' comments thoroughly
in revision, final acceptance should be forthcoming without requiring further in-depth review.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have revealed the results of their replication attempt. They find substantial McGurk
effect in musicians and non-musicians, contra the previous report. The increased sample size,
suitable and pre-registered analysis plan, and robust experimental design provide confidence
that these results easily meet the requirements for a solid replication study. Because the results
are not in-line with the past paper, there will likely be substantial push back from any potential
strong adherents to the original result. For this reason, and to make the paper more suitable to a
general audience, I've suggested several changes below that will make the report easier to
understand. Most importantly, a table that directly addresses points of similarity and
dissimilarity between the papers is essential prior to publication.
Results
Page 9, bottom paragraph
The authors provide two comparisons between musicians and non-musician levels of mcgurk. CI
says no diff, GLMM says yes, likely b/c of odds-ratios are more sensitive to changes in
probability scale. It would be helpful for a non-specialist reader to have this apparent (not actual)
contradiction explained away.
Additionally, the authors should make clear which parameters are being referred to when
presenting the coefficients from the GLMM. For instance, in the sentence, "The statistical analysis
confirmed that musicians have a highly significant McGurk effect (b=-2.34, z=-18.37, p<.001), and
that it in fact is significantly larger than the non-musicians' McGurk effect (b=0.46, z=2.72,
p=.007)" I would think the first parameter is the main effect (intercept term) of condition (Incong
< audio) and the second parameter is the interaction between condition and group, but this
should be made explicit. Similar for secondary analysis, page 10, lines 38-42.
Discussion
The authors should remind the reader of the relative sample sizes in the first sentence, rather than
just referring to the proportional increase.
I found the first paragraph of the discussion hard to follow as it tallies similarities and differences
between the results. A figure here with appropriate confidence intervals would bring great clarity
and provide a useful summary of the replication attempt.
The second paragraph also devolves a bit into diatribe listing the problems with the original
study's numerical analysis. I think this is a serious issue, and thus should not be relegated to a,
quite long, 79-word parenthetical remark. Instead, the authors should create separate paragraphs
for each reason a direct comparison of the numerical results is difficult/impossible.
A rehash of major differences between the original and replication study would be helpful,
perhaps as a table. This allows readers to form their own opinion about how closely the
replication followed the original. I think the point about musicians (in general) perceiving the
McGurk illusion is well-demonstrated by this new paper, but perhaps there were things in the
original study that made a null-finding more likely, e.g., sample/population characteristics,
stimuli used etc. Again, having this information in a table will facilitate easy comparison and

Comments to the Author(s)
This is the third time I have read this manuscript (although the first time I have read the results
and discussion). The manuscript reports an attempted replication of Proverbio et al (2016),
reporting that Musicians are not susceptible to the McGurk effect. The results suggest that
Musicians are in fact susceptible to the effect, perhaps more so than non-musicians. I found the
manuscript and the available data clear and easy to navigate. I do have a few comments on the
results/discussion:
1. Although I am aware that this was not in the pre-registered analysis plan, it is curious that the
two coding conditions are not statistically compared - such that it could be said that including
stimuli with inconsistent place articulation results in significantly lower accuracy than consistent
place articulation? Even if this is not explored statistically, it seems this could be given some
mention in the discussion. This is important to guide future research design, and also because the
authors suggest that lower McGurk effects in Proverbio et al’s study might in part have been due
to the type of stimuli included.
2. Page 12, line 34 “If anything, is musicians are better than non-musicians at processing speech in
noise” another very relevant reference here is Coffey et al “Speech-in-noise perception in
musicians: A review”
3. Page 13 line 4 “The present study obviously rules out those conclusions: if musicians are
indeed subject to the McGurk effect, then McGurk studies do not provide any evidence for brain-
level functional reorganization as a result of musical training.” This seems quite a bold claim
considering this study still reported between groups differences (albeit in the opposite direction
to Proverbio and colleagues!). Differences between groups surely suggests that the McGurk
effects might show some functional differences – although the exact nature of these would need
brain imaging studies to confirm the nature of plasticity (which the authors acknowledge this
study does not rule out).

Appendix A
Reviewer 1
For the analyses in this paper the McGurk effect is quantified as the
difference between incongruent and auditory only. However, it
looks as though Proverbio et al also compared congruent and
incongruent trials (in addition to incongruent vs auditory only). A
short justification as to why this effect was not explored in this
study could make it easier to compare between studies.
Their key analysis on which they base the claim that skilled
musicians do not show the McGurk effect is based on just
comparing incongruent and auditory only; the congruent
audiovisual trials only seem to be used in follow-up analyses
breaking down the effect in different phonemes (although I
don't see any explanation of why they switched from one
comparison to the other). We have added the following
parenthetical in the main text to explain this: "(Proverbio and
colleagues'2 key analysis comparing musicians and non-
musicians is based on comparing audio-only and audiovisual
incongruent conditions, as shown in their Figure 1 and the first
paragraph of their Results section. The only time they use the
audiovisual congruent condition to quantify McGurk effects is
in follow-up analyses examining interactions with different
phonemes [their Figures 2 and 3].)".
I was unable to open the .zil data files on my mac operating
system. Perhaps providing data in a second format (or providing
info on how to open the .zil files - even if it means the user should
find a windows computer) would increase data accessibility further
(although another format may not work with the available R
scripts?).
Sorry for this confusion. We have added some extra
instruction on the OSF page now (under the "wiki" section)
explaining several ways .zil files can be opened. We have also
added a .csv file that has all the results compiled in one place;
hopefully this will make it easier to access the data.
Reviewer 2
The authors stat that “sounds are often mis-perceived” in McGurk
effect. This is incorrect. Sounds are perceived fine, phonemes are
mis-catagorized
As this issue is immaterial to the claims at stake in the paper
(we are only interested in whether or not the McGurk effect is
different between musicians and non-musicians, and have no
commitment to any particular theoretical description of it or its
locus), we are happy to change the way this background
information is described. We have done so throughout the new
manuscript, rewording these parts to present the McGurk
effect as something specifically about the categorization of
speech sounds; these are indicated with Track Changes in the
revised manuscript. (We have not used the term "phoneme",
as a phoneme is not the same as a speech sound; multiple
speech sounds can be realizations of the same phoneme).
The authors state in the abstract:
“it is not clear, however, if this is intended to mean that skilled
musicians do not experience the McGurk effect at all, or if they just
experience it to a lesser magnitude than non-musicians”
This is not scientific language!! The paper by Proverbio et al.
(2016) showed that:
<<The analyses of data performed as a function of the phonemes
auditorily perceived showed the statistical significance of
“condition” factor (congruent vs. incongruent conditions) (F
8,112 = 3.646; p < 0.0008), but only for controls. The analysis of
group effects and Tukey post-hoc tests showed no significant
difference between the congruent and the McGurk conditions in
musicians but only in controls.>> In scientific terms: there was no
difference in the ability to correctly categorize phonemes in the AV
congruent vs incongruent condition (meaning at all). The
tendencies visible in the figure but not statistically significant
cannot be considered as “to a lesser magnitude”, this is not the
scientific methods
If I have understood this comment correctly, the reviewer is
saying that we should not claim that musicians showed a
numerical pattern in the direction of a McGurk effect in
Proverbio et al. (2016) because that pattern was not
significant.
Simply put, this is not how statistics works. As we all learn in
introductory statistics courses, failure to reject the null
hypothesis does not license acceptance of the null hypothesis.
In the context of a McGurk experiment, what that means is:
the fact that some group is not significantly less accurate on
incongruent than other conditions does not mean that their
accuracies are exactly the same. Lack of statistical significance
does not allow one to include that there is no difference "at
all" (R2's words). The authors seem to be thinking in terms of
old-style Neyman-Pearson decision theory, whereby p=.05 is
an absolute cutoff, and indeed many people still do attempt to
operate this way (see review in, e.g., Gigerenzer, 2004), but
that is only a framework for how to decide what to do on the
basis of statistics (i.e., to decide "my theory was supported"
or "my theory was not supported); it does not mean that we
close our eyes and pretend that a real observed numerical
difference is suddenly not there. An observed value is an
observed value, no matter what its associated p-value is.
The reviewer also seems to have misunderstood what we
mean by "magnitude". Magnitude refers the raw size of an
effect (in whatever units make sense
for measuring this effect), not to its
statistical significance. Let me
contextualize this by giving an
example in McGurk terms. Imagine
we have two groups (see example
image to the right), and Group A is
10 percentage points less accurate
on identification of McGurk stimuli
(audiovisual incongruent) than
audio-only stimuli, and Group B is
20 points less accurate. Further,
imagine that Group A's 10-point
McGurk effect is statistically
significant (as indicated in the figure
by the confidence interval that does not include zero),
whereas Group B's is not (perhaps Group B has a much
smaller number of participants, or the effect has a very high
standard deviation around 20; those are two reasons that a
numerically large effect might not be statistically significant).
We would still say that Group B's effect had a larger
magnitude, even though it is less significant. Magnitude and
significance are not the same thing. See Gelman and Carlin
(http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/retropo
wer20.pdf) for more discussion of magnitude and magnitude
errors.
By this token, everything already in the current manuscript is
reasonable. It is indeed true that the question of whether
musicians' McGurk effect is 0 is a different question than that
of whether musician's McGurk effect is
smaller than non-musician's McGurk effect.
(To put it in statistical terms: one potential
H0 is McGurkmusician = 0, and another possible
H0 is McGurknonmusician – McGurkmusician = 0;
these are different hypotheses which need
different tests, and it is not clear which one
is the most relevant for testing the
theoretical claims made by Proverbio et al.,
2016.) It is also true that in their
experiment (particularly, in Figure 1, which I
reproduce to the right for ease of exposition)
musicians show a numerical but non-
significant McGurk effect, which is smaller in
magnitude than non-musicians' McGurk
effect but which is bigger than zero, and
which is not significantly different from non-
musicians' McGurk effect (Proverbio and
colleagues' words: "No interaction between group and
condition was found for this contrast."). In short, there is no
need to change anything in the manuscript in response to this
comment from the reviewer, because none of the parts
pointed out are actually incorrect, and the reviewer's concern
appears to stem from a misunderstanding of statistics.
The authors state: “The study also does not statistically
demonstrate either of these conclusions” This is totally false, as
explained below, and should be imperatively changed!
The two possible conclusions the reviewer is referring to are
(1) that musicians' McGurk effect is smaller than non-
musicians', and (2) that musicians' McGurk effect is zero. We
are correct that the study by Proverbio and colleagues (2016)
does not statistically demonstrate these. Regarding #1, their
study does not report a significant interaction or difference-of-
differences to show that musicians have a smaller McGurk
effect than non-musicians; rather, the crucial interaction is
non-significant, as shown in the sentence quoted above in our
response to the previous comment. The only statistical
evidence they have for the claim that musicians' McGurk effect
is smaller is that non-musicians have a significant McGurk
effect (when "McGurk effect" is quantified by comparing the
congruent and incongruent trials, rather than comparing the
audio-only and incongruent trials as is shown in Figure 1)
whereas non-musicians do not. But this does not prove that
their effects are significantly different. Our manuscript already
cites Gelman & Stern (2006), titled "The difference between
'significant' and 'not significant' is not itself statistically
significant". Here is, verbatim, what our manuscript already
says: "Furthermore, the experiment also tested a control
group of participants without musical experience, and there
was not a significant interaction between the groups and the
type of stimuli perceived. Without a significant interaction, the
conclusion that non-musicians had a McGurk effect and
musicians did not is not necessarily justified: the fact that one
group shows a significant effect and another group does not
show a significant effect is not in of itself sufficient evidence
that the two groups are significantly different from one
another3." I don't know what more can be said, as this is
already quite clear.
Regarding the second possible conclusion, this is also not
statistically demonstrated in the Proverbio et al. (2016) paper.
As we have explained in our response to the previous
comment above, the fact that an effect is not statistically
significant does not mean that the effect is zero. There are
methods for getting statistical evidence to support the claim
that an effect is probably zero (equivalence hypothesis tests,
Bayes factors, etc.) but none of those were carried out in that
paper.
The authors state: “as it does report a numerical (albeit non-
significant) McGurk effect for musicians, and does not report a
significant difference between musicians' and non-musicians'
McGurk effect sizes.”
Again this is not correct, and, indeed, false. Proverbio et al. (2016)
showed a significant decrease in the ability to correctly categorize
phonemes in controls but NOT in musicians, and reported all the
statistics!
As discussed in our responses to the other comments above,
the reviewer's concern here is unfounded because it is based
on a misunderstanding of how statistics works. What we said
there (that musicians have a non-zero McGurk effect, which is
neither significantly different from zero nor significantly
different from non-musicians' McGurk effect) is not at all
inconsistent with the fact that Proverbio et al. (2016) showed
a significant McGurk effect in non-musicians but not
musicians.
ABSTRACT. The authors state “and changing from a between- to a
within-participants manipulation).!!
In Proverbio et al et al. 2016 the manipulation was WITHIN
participants. ???
It was not within participants. Here let me explain how I know
that.
First we need to know what "the manipulation" was. A McGurk
effect could be quantified by comparing performance on
audiovisual incongruent trials to performance on audio-only
trials, or to performance on audiovisual congruent trials. In
the study by Proverbio and colleagues (2016) the critical claim
(that musicians don't have a McGurk effect) seems to be
based on the former comparison: that is what they show in
their Figure 1, and that is the comparison they use for the
most direct analysis. (They switch to using the latter
comparison when they start breaking down these comparisons
within each phoneme; for our study, we had no hypotheses
about interactions with phoneme, so we ignore this.)
Therefore, for the purposes relevant to this discussion, "the
manipulation" is the comparison between audio-only and
audiovisual incongruent stimuli.
Now, was that manipulated between or within participants?
Before the Results section, Proverbio and colleagues (2016)
state, "In this study, 80 healthy, age-matched, graduate male
and female volunteers were tested both in multimodal
(McGurk condition) and unimodal (only auditory and only
visual) conditions". This sentence is semantically ambiguous:
it could mean that each of these people participated in each
condition (a distributive reading) or it could mean each of
these conditions was participated in but not necessarily by the
same people (with 80 unique people in one condition and 80
unique people in the other, or with x{x<80} unique people in
one condition and 80-x in the other). More unambiguous is a
statement the authors make in the Stimuli section: "To avoid
an excessive time length of the experimental procedure each
subject was presented with 64 videos in the McGurk condition
(40 Ss), or to the unimodal auditory condition (20 Ss), or to
the unimodal visual condition (20 Ss)." This unambiguously
states that the people who participated in the audio-only
condition were not the same people who participated in the
audiovisual incongruent condition; i.e., it was a between-
participants manipulation.
We don't need to just guess from the writing; we can also see
the data. Below, I reproduce for ease of exposition Proverbio
and colleagues' (2016) Table 1, showing the response
proportions for musicians in the audiovisual stimulation
conditions. It is clear that the percentages in every cell are
multiples of 5, which means there were 20 observations in
each cell. (The chance that there were 40 observations per cell
but never any "2.5%" sort of responses is infinitesimally
small.) This means there were 20 musicians, not 40, in this
stimulation condition. In other words, not all musicians
participated in the same stimulation condition; in other words,
this is a between-participants manipulation.
The authors state: “People comprehend physical stimuli, they
integrate information from multiple sensory modalities to generate
a psychological percept. “ This is too generic, include appropriate
scientific quotations relative to AV integration processes. Again
please use a scientific language!
We consider a detailed theoretical literature review about the
McGurk effect to be beyond the scope of this short paper,
which is just a methodologically rigorous replication study. In
any case, even if the statement that the reviewers have
quoted here is general, the reviewer has not argued that it is
incorrect. Indeed, it is the first sentence in the body of the
text, so of course it is general; most articles start with a
statement of a general phenomenon or issue and then work
down to the specifics, and ours is no exception. The reviewer
has also not explained what about this statement is not
"scientific" (other than the fact that it's not longer or more
detailed or including more references; none of these are
generally accepted as criteria for letting something qualify as
"scientific"). Therefore, we have opted not to change it.
For example, the way people perceive a sound can be modulated
by visual sensory information accompanying the sound. Perhaps
the most famous example of this is the McGurk effect, whereby
people tend to mis-perceive sounds.
This is incorrect. The McGurk effect has nothing to do with
“sounds”, but with phoneme categorizations. The too processes are
completely different (please read and include some literature)
This issue was raised in Reviewer 2's first comment. As we
indicated in our response to that comment, we have edited
the wording about this issue throughout the manuscript. This
particular sentence (the first paragraph of the comment
copied above is a quotation from our manuscript) is one of the
ones we have edited; in the revised manuscript, we now say
"whereby people tend to mis-perceive speech sounds", rather
than just sounds.
Line 42 “experience changes some mechanisms of basic sound
perception” again there are many evidences that musical ability
modify linguistic perception and ability. We are not talking only
about a finer acoustic ability
This we have also changed; see the above comment. We
replaced "basic sound perception" with "speech perception".
Page 2 (lines 47-51) the experiment did not reveal a significant
difference between musicians' accuracy in audiovisual "McGurk"
stimuli and audio-only stimuli, they nevertheless showed a large
numerical effect in the direction of a typical McGurk effect (higher
accuracy in audio-only than audiovisual stimuli).
This is profoundly incorrect and false, and should be imperatively
changed!
In Proverbio et al. (2016) study, both musicians and controls
showed no difference between the auditory unimodal and
audiovisual congruent conditions
(Musicians: visual = 10%; auditory = 90%; audiovisual = 93.75%.
Controls: visual = 11.25%; auditory = 93.75%; audiovisual = 95%)
The reviewer has misunderstood our statement. We are
talking about the comparison between audio-only and
audiovisual incongruent stimuli; audiovisual congruent stimuli
are irrelevant here. We have added the word "incongruent" in
the parenthetical there to make this clear. Proverbio and
colleagues' (2016) musicians did indeed show a numerical
McGurk effect in this comparison, as shown in their Figure 1
(copied above).
The authors state on page 2 (lines 51-52) the experiment likely had
low power to detect a significant effect, as this critical comparison
was between only 10 participants who heard audio-only stimuli and
20 who saw audiovisual stimuli
That’s’ totally incorrect and false. In Proverbio et al. (2016) say
(right before the results) “In this study, 80 healthy, age-matched,
graduate male and female volunteers were tested both in
multimodal (McGurk condition) and unimodal (only auditory and
only visual) conditions.”
Did you even read the paper?!)
See our response a few comments above. Proverbio and
colleagues' (2016) paper had 20 musicians in the audiovisual
condition, 10 in the audio condition, 10 in the visual condition,
and likewise 20 nonmusicians in the audiovisual condition, 10
in audio, and 10 in visual.
The authors state on line 27 page 4: “As Proverbio and colleagues
had 30 musicians and 30 non-musicians”
This is again incorrect!
The reviewer has mis-quoted us. The relevant part they are
quoting from is: "As Proverbio and colleagues2 had 30
musicians and 30 non-musicians in the critical conditions"
(emphasis added). The "critical conditions" are audio-only and
audiovisual stimulation; the visual stimulation condition is not
relevant to any of the claims made. In the audio-only and
audiovisual stimulation conditions, they did indeed have 30
musicians and 30 non-musicians, as explained in our comment
directly above this one. Here it is laid out in a table:
Audiovisual Audio Visual
Musicians 20 10 10
Non- 20 10 10
musicians
These are the numbers of participants in Proverbio and
colleagues' (2016) design, as reported in their Methods
section (specifically, under "Stimuli") and as reflected in
Tables 1 and 2 of their paper (see our discussion of their Table
1 a few comments above).
The stimuli used by Stephen Politzer-Ahles & Lei Pan are full of
acoustic noise, and this is absolutely not comparable to the
experimental conditions used by Proverbio et al (2016) study in
which there was silence in background! Phoneme perception is
worsened by the noise presence.
The difference between our stimuli is something we intend to
discuss in the Discussion section of the paper. For now, a few
points bear mentioning:
<U+F0B7> The presence of noise should not be relevant to the
possibility of replicating the effect, as if noise worsens
phoneme perception in one condition it should also do
so in all the others. The only way it would have a
different effect in the audiovisual incongruent condition
is through the McGurk effect. Thus, the presence of
noise does not confound the results. And the noise is
the same for musicians and non-musicians, so it does
not confound the comparison between these.
<U+F0B7> The paper by Proverbio and colleages (2016) does not
make any mention of noise levels in the methods
section; thus, the paper is not making any claims about
the relevance of this factor to the experiment. Of course
any replication study will have small differences with
the original (things like what kind of room it is
conducted in, etc.). Those differences are not
considered meaningful unless there was an a priori
claim that the original study's effects would only hold
under these certain kinds of conditions. If the ability to
observe an effect depends on adherence to some
certain experimental conditions that were never
mentioned (so-called "hidden moderators",
http://datacolada.org/63), this is something that needs
to be discovered. In any case, if our results replicate
Proverbio and colleagues' (2016), this will suggest that
noise level is not a big deal for this effect. If they do not
replicate Proverbio and colleagues' (2016), this will
mean that their claim was incorrect or needs to be
refined: either skilled musicians are indeed subject to
the McGurk effect, or the claim needs to be sharpened
to something like "Skilled musicians are not subject to
the McGurk effect unless there is sufficient noise". In
any case, that would be important information to know.
Reviewer 3
Specifically, a power analysis of sorts would help determine if even
n=60 per group is adequate to find small effects. As the authors'
are aware from the Gelman articles they cite, a problem with
studying small effects with small sample sizes is that any
statistically significant effect tends to be exaggerated -- see also
[1] below for application of this idea to between-group studies of
the McGurk effect. This is important to ensure that these replication
results are more decisive.
We would like to have performed a power analysis, but this
was not possible as the effect size from the original study is
not known. (This is hinted in the manuscript but we did not
draw much attention to it: the last "limitation" we point out
about the study in the Introduction is that their analysis is not
replicable. We did not want to spend a lot of time harping on it
in this short paper, but the details are all publicly available in
the online comments to that article. In short, the results
shown in their tables do not match the numbers shown in their
figures or in their prose, and it is not clear how the values
were transformed.) Without knowing that, we did not consider
power analysis meaningful. We would like to have registered a
"small telescopes" kind of analysis to judge whether this
study's results are consistent with the original study, but given
that we pre-registered a mixed-effects regression analysis and
the original study uses ANOVA based on inscrutable values
that cannot be reproduced, we did not see any meaningful
way to calculate power or a d33% effect size; we could of
course do some procedures to get some numbers but we don't
believe they would be meaningful, given all the unknowns still
at play. We figure this study will be a step in the right
direction because with our openly available data, people will
be able to analyze the results any way they want and get
estimates of the effect size and thus be able to perform power
calculations for their future studies.
Without knowing exact power, the best we can do is do things
we know will increase power. We know that, all else being
equal, increasing N will increase power; thus, we doubled the
sample size. We also know that, all else being equal,
increasing the precision of the estimate will increase the
power; that is why we pre-registered a targeted "McGurk"
analysis that focuses only on the stimuli where McGurk effects
are expected, because we figured this will get a more precise
estimate of the effect we are looking at and thus will increase
our power. We also use mixed effect logistic regression, which
is a more appropriate statistical model for this kind of data
and thus should offer more power than arcsin+ANOVA. Finally,
the last way to increase power is to increase the magnitude of
the effect. We didn't do anything specifically designed for this,
and I guess it's an open question whether any details of our
experiment design (using Chinese speakers, the way we
recorded stimuli, the way we presented the experiment, etc.)
would increase or decrease the magnitude of the effect. But
we are at least confident that our experiment has higher
power than the original (even if we don't know its exact
power), given that we improved 3 out of the 4 things that
could affect power. We have now updated the manuscript such
that the list of 5 changes in the Introduction section explicitly
states how these should increase power.
We would like to thank the reviewer for providing useful
references related to this topic. We have integrated them into
the revised version of the manuscript.
Second, the authors note that the "ga" syllable was not used (or
will not be used), because of the subjects' native language.
References concerning the robustness of the McGurk effect in their
chosen population should be included to address head on any
possibility of floor effect hiding any potential group effect.
We would like to thank the reviewer for raising this issue. We
have added a paragraph in the "Participants" section
addressing the language issue. In short, we agree with the
recent literature that Chinese speakers probably do not
necessarily have a different McGurk effect than speakers of
other language, and even if they do, that biases our results in
favor of not finding a McGurk effect in musicians (i.e., in favor
of supporting the original study). So if the results come out
not supporting the original study, the choice of participant
population would not be a confound.
Appendix B
Are skilled musicians not subject to the McGurk effect?
This is the second time I have reviewed this paper, and I believe that
it is well written and technically sound in its analyses. The reviewers
addressed my concerns regarding analytical comparisons and
accessibility of data. I have a few remaining minor comments
regarding the documentation of OSF files and theoretical
considerations that may be considered in the discussion:
1. The .csv document is easier to access and interpret. However,
a “ReadMe” doc defining each of the variables in the .csv file
would be helpful. For example – what does “vidPoA” stand
for? In turn, what do “velar” and “labial” ect represent? I
realise that the authors have already provided an explanation
to some extent in the wiki, however, this could be clearer
(plus having the “ReadMe” doc in the data folder may make it
more obvious where this is stored).
2. Although this is not in response to my comment, the author’s
response to Reviewer 2 regarding the noise in stimuli may
need further. Specifically, the authors state:
“Thus, the presence of noise does not confound the results.
And the noise is the same for musicians and non- musicians,
so it does not confound the comparison between these .“
Although this is true, there are theoretical hypotheses that
need to be considered. Specifically, if musicians are less
susceptible to the McGurk effect due to some form of
“auditory dominance” and sensory dominance is considered
as an ability to detect signal in noise within the dominant
modality, it might be that musicians actually detect the sound
more clearly within acoustic noise relative to controls. This
hypothesis is discussed briefly in the discussion of Hirst et al
2018 “The threshold for the McGurk effect in audio-visual
noise decreases with development“, in which it is stated
“dominance may map onto an ability to identify a relevant
signal (i.e. speech sound or lip movement) within the
dominant modality rather than general susceptibility to
noise in that modality.”. Based on this, it would be predicted
that musicians “perceive” the speech sound more clearly in
noise, and therefore rely less on visual signals to guide their
perception – basically, they should be less influenced by visual
information, and show smaller McGurk effects. As such, if
acoustic noise is present, it is possible that this would actually
inflate differences between musicians and nonmusicians.
Although I believe this matter is less central to the core claims
tested in this paper, if the authors intend to claim in the
discussion that noise in stimuli would not have influenced
between group differences, this is something that could be
considered.

“An exact power analysis was not possible, as the exact effect
size and variance structure in Proverbio and colleagues'2 data
is unknown and their results not reproducible” (comma after
“possible”).

Dear Dr. Chambers,
Thank you for the opportunity to submit a Stage 2 manuscript. We
would also like to express our thanks to all reviewers for taking the
time to review the paper, and to Reviewer 1 for their new
suggestions. We have taken R1's suggestions and added a
README.txt file to OSF, added a paragraph discussing the
background noise issue (towards the end of the Discussion), and
making the typographical change. Our submission includes a Stage
2 manuscript with Track Changes to show the new additions with
the results.
Best,

hough I am aware that this was not in the pre-registered analysis plan, it is
ious that the two coding conditions are not statistically compared - such that it
ld be said that including stimuli with inconsistent place articulation results in
nificantly lower accuracy than consistent place articulation? Even if this is not
lored statistically, it seems this could be given some mention in the discussion.
s is important to guide future research design, and also because the authors
gest that lower McGurk effects in Proverbio et al’s study might in part have been
to the type of stimuli included.
I'm actually not sure how to do this within one statistical model, so what I
have done instead is do a kind of indirect hack at a conceptually related
comparison: seeing if the "ambiguous" stimuli (the ones coded differently in
our two analysis schemes) pattern with the incongruent or the congruent
stimuli. The logic is explained in the new paragraph at the end of the results
section. I think this will also provide the same kind of guidance the reviewer is
looking for, as it clearly shows that it makes sense to treat the "ambiguous"
stimuli as congruent rather than incongruent.
Page 12, line 34 “If anything, is musicians are better than non-musicians at
cessing speech in noise” another very relevant reference here is Coffey et al
eech-in-noise perception in musicians: A review”
Added.
Page 13 line 4 “The present study obviously rules out those conclusions: if
sicians are indeed subject to the McGurk effect, then McGurk studies do not
vide any evidence for brain-level functional reorganization as a result of musical
ning.” This seems quite a bold claim considering this study still reported
ween groups differences (albeit in the opposite direction to Proverbio and
eagues!). Differences between groups surely suggests that the McGurk effects
ht show some functional differences – although the exact nature of these would
d brain imaging studies to confirm the nature of plasticity (which the authors
nowledge this study does not rule out).
We have updated this final paragraph to clarify that we just mean conclusions
about that kind of functional reorganization are ruled out. As the reviewer
correctly notes, our results may well be consistent with some other kind of
functional reorganization, just not the kind the original study described.

authors provide two comparisons between musicians and non-musician levels
mcgurk. CI says no diff, GLMM says yes, likely b/c of odds-ratios are more
sitive to changes in probability scale. It would be helpful for a non-specialist
der to have this apparent (not actual) contradiction explained away.
Thank you for pointing this out; we have added the following text to clarify:
"(While the significant model coefficient for this effect may appear to
contradict the confidence interval reported above, which includes 0%, the
source of this apparent discrepancy is that the reported confidence interval is
converted into percentage units, whereas the model coefficient and associated
p-value is based on odds ratios, which are more sensitive to differences in
probability. The calculation of these values is shown in the data analysis code
on OSF.)"
itionally, the authors should make clear which parameters are being referred to
en presenting the coefficients from the GLMM. For instance, in the sentence,
e statistical analysis confirmed that musicians have a highly significant McGurk
ct (b=-2.34, z=-18.37, p<.001), and that it in fact is significantly larger than
non-musicians' McGurk effect (b=0.46, z=2.72, p=.007)" I would think the first
ameter is the main effect (intercept term) of condition (Incong < audio) and the
ond parameter is the interaction between condition and group, but this should
made explicit. Similar for secondary analysis, page 10, lines 38-42.
We have added the requested clarification. In the first part pointed out (the
"Replication analysis" section) we now have the following text: "The statistical
analysis confirmed that musicians have a highly significant McGurk effect (b=-
2.34, z=-18.37, p<.001), based on the simple effect coefficient for stimulus
condition (which refers to the difference between audio-only and audiovisual
incongruent for musicians, since musicians were coded as the baseline level of
the group factor). Furthermore, musicians' McGurk effect was in fact
significantly larger than the non-musicians' McGurk effect (b=0.46, z=2.72,
p=.007), as shown by the condition-group interaction coefficient." In the
second part (the "Targeted analysis" section) we have just added the names of
the coefficients in the same parentheticals that report the numerical
coefficients and stuff.
authors should remind the reader of the relative sample sizes in the first
tence, rather than just referring to the proportional increase.
Done! We now have: "In a pre-registered study with more than double 60
musicians and 60 non-musicians (compared to 30 musicians and 30 non-
musicians in the original study)...".
und the first paragraph of the discussion hard to follow as it tallies similarities
differences between the results. A figure here with appropriate confidence
rvals would bring great clarity and provide a useful summary of the replication
empt.
This is a good idea and we are willing to do whatever is necessary to make the
writing to follow. But we aren't sure how to make a graph like this that will
clarify things. It would be easy for us to make a graph showing our effect sizes
and CIs. But, as explained in the Discussion, we have little idea what the real
effect sizes and CIs for Proverbio et al. are, so I'm not sure what we would put
in this graph for comparison. Nevertheless, the reviewer's point that this
paragraph is hard to follow is well taken, so we agree something should be
done. We have attempted to satisfy this request by adding a schematic
graph—not showing actual effect sizes and CIs (since those are not known for
Proverbio et al.) but showing a sort of idealization of where we think those
effects probably fall relative to ours (essentially it's just a visualization of the
same patterns that are verbally described in that paragraph).
second paragraph also devolves a bit into diatribe listing the problems with the
inal study's numerical analysis. I think this is a serious issue, and thus should
be relegated to a, quite long, 79-word parenthetical remark. Instead, the
hors should create separate paragraphs for each reason a direct comparison of
numerical results is difficult/impossible.
We have divided this paragraph into several paragraphs now and walked
through the issues in more detail.
ehash of major differences between the original and replication study would be
pful, perhaps as a table. This allows readers to form their own opinion about how
sely the replication followed the original. I think the point about musicians (in
eral) perceiving the McGurk illusion is well-demonstrated by this new paper, but
haps there were things in the original study that made a null-finding more likely,
., sample/population characteristics, stimuli used etc. Again, having this
rmation in a table will facilitate easy comparison and provide some structure for
discussion.
We have now added such a table in the Discussion section.
We have also done each of the minor suggestions.
