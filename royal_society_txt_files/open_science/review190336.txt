The author described an electrochemical synthesis of 2,5-diacetoxy-2,5-dihydrofuran and
provided a method for the separation of stereomers. This report is useful, because the pure
isomer has been obtained and thus the stereoselectivity of the electrochemical reaction was
obtained. Furthermore, DFT calculations also were carried out for the understanding of the
reaction mechanism. This reviewer recommends acceptance of this manuscript for publication
after minor revisions.
1. I suggest to remove “structure” in the title, as this work mainly deals with stereoselectivity and
mechanism, while chemical structure is known.
2. Only 2,5-diacetoxy-2,5-dihydrofuran was synthesized in this work, why the R = small or bukyl
groups were shown in the graphic abstract?

This study provides new mechanistic insight into a 2-electron oxidation of furan leading to
valuable 1,4-substituted products. The chemical process with Pb(IV) is compared to an elegant
electrosynthesis process. The mechanism and steric effects on cis-/trans product ratio are
considered. The work offers new insights based on several analytical approaches (including
theory) and the conclusions are clear and supported by high quality data. Publication is
recommended.

The manuscript is well written and structured. Good quality figures support the text. Title and
abstract are consistent with the main text. Supporting information are useful. Citation of
references is appropriate and sufficient. Some minor revision ideas:
(A) could the counter electrode process in the electrosynthesis be identified?
(B) in table 1, could both acetate and butyrate results be listed?
(C) 80% faradaic efficiency is suggested but for the butyrate only less than 50%. Any suggestions?
Could unidentified products be present (e.g. furan ring-opening)?
(D) +3V vs Pt sounds like a very high and somewhat arbitrary choice of potential. Was there any
attempt to record CVs or to vary the potential?
(E) was the synthesis always stopped at 10% conversion? Could a better conversion be achieved?
Could a plot of yield versus conversion be given?
(F) was succinate considered as a reagent?

Reviewer(s)' Comments to Author:
Appendix A
We thank the referees for their careful reading of our manuscript and for the useful suggestions that
they have made. In the following, we respond to all the referees’ comments (shown in italics) in turn
(our answers are in bold type). Where we have made changes to the manuscript and SI in response to
these changes, we have highlighted these in yellow. We believe that the changes made to the
manuscript have improved it significantly, and we thank the referees for their help in this.
Reviewer: 1
The author described an electrochemical synthesis of 2,5-diacetoxy-2,5-dihydrofuran and provided a
method for the separation of stereomers. This report is useful, because the pure isomer has been
obtained and thus the stereoselectivity of the electrochemical reaction was obtained. Furthermore,
DFT calculations also were carried out for the understanding of the reaction mechanism. This
reviewer recommends acceptance of this manuscript for publication after minor revisions.
1. I suggest to remove “structure” in the title, as this work mainly deals with stereoselectivity and
mechanism, while chemical structure is known.
The work also reports the crystal structure of cis-2,5-diacetoxy-2,5-dihydrofuran for the first time,
and the information provided by this structure is central to correctly interpreting the NMR spectra
of the species produced by the electrosynthesis reactions. Therefore, we prefer to leave
“structure” in the title to emphasise this.
2. Only 2,5-diacetoxy-2,5-dihydrofuran was synthesized in this work, why the R = small or bukyl
groups were shown in the graphic abstract?
Whilst only 2,5-diacetoxy-2,5-dihydrofuran was isolated and separated into its stereoisomers, 2,5-
dibutyl-2,5-dihydrofuran was also synthesised as a mixture of cis and trans isomers (whose ratios
we determine). Therefore, we consider the graphical abstract to be appropriate.
Reviewer 2:
This study provides new mechanistic insight into a 2-electron oxidation of furan leading to valuable
1,4-substituted products. The chemical process with Pb(IV) is compared to an elegant electrosynthesis
process. The mechanism and steric effects on cis-/trans product ratio are considered. The work offers
new insights based on several analytical approaches (including theory) and the conclusions are clear
and supported by high quality data. Publication is recommended.
The manuscript is well written and structured. Good quality figures support the text. Title and abstract
are consistent with the main text. Supporting information are useful. Citation of references is
appropriate and sufficient. Some minor revision ideas:
(A) could the counter electrode process in the electrosynthesis be identified?
At this stage, we have not yet studied the reactions at the counter electrode in any detail. We used
a three-electrode set-up for our experiments, so the potential at the counter electrode is likely to
be large and negative. Under these conditions, the prevailing reactions are likely to be degradation
of the species most abundant in solution (solvent and supporting electrolyte). However, we cannot
speculate further at this stage.
(B) in table 1, could both acetate and butyrate results be listed?
The butyrate results are now listed in this table as new entry 6, along with a brief note on conditions
in the table footnotes.
(C) 80% faradaic efficiency is suggested but for the butyrate only less than 50%. Any suggestions? Could
unidentified products be present (e.g. furan ring-opening)?
Our Faradaic yields are based on the isolated masses of purified products free of any other species
(such as solvents and electrolyte salts). Most problematic in this case is the removal of the acetate
or butyrate salts. For the acetic acid/acetate mixes, washing with water and concentration under
reduced pressure removed the acetate/acetic acid rather effectively. However, in the case of
butyrate/butyric acid, washing with water was only partially effective and (as we say in the
Experimental section) we had to column our product material to fully remove these species. This
also caused considerable loss of product material, which is the main reason for the apparently
diminished Faradaic yield in this case. A statement to this effect has been added to the main text
where we discuss the Faradaic yield for 2,5-dibutoxy-2,5-dihydrofuran.
(D) +3V vs Pt sounds like a very high and somewhat arbitrary choice of potential. Was there any
attempt to record CVs or to vary the potential?
We did indeed record a cyclic voltammogram and this is now shown in Figure S10 in the supporting
information. We also call out this new figure where we first discuss the potential we chose for the
oxidation reaction. There is a broad (irreversible) oxidation peak at around +2.5 V vs. Pt in the CV.
Oxidations were run at potentials somewhat higher than this to overcome solution resistance and
to speed up the rate of oxidation.
(E) was the synthesis always stopped at 10% conversion? Could a better conversion be achieved? Could
a plot of yield versus conversion be given?
As we mention in the main text on page 14, in the results that we report we limited the total charge
passing during these experiments to no more than 30% of that required to produce full conversion
of the furan. We did this because (as we also mention) even when cooled in an ice bath, furan is still
rather volatile in our experimental set-up and if we attempted higher conversions (which would
require longer experiments) conversions suffered due to this loss of starting material. Faradaic
yields also suffered as a result. Hence, we did experiment with other conversions, but found that
30% represented a good compromise between a fair level of overall conversion without the issues
of starting material evaporation becoming significant. Better conversions might be possible with an
improved experimental set-up (more effective cooling, or the use of a flow-cell arrangement) and
we will explore these options more thoroughly in future work.
(F) was succinate considered as a reagent?
We did not (yet) investigate succinate as a reagent. However, this is a most interesting suggestion
for future work because succinate has two carboxylic acid groups and so there would be the
possibility of forming polymeric materials or (given the short chain length in succinate) also the
possibility of intramolecular reactions. The ratio of cis to trans isomers in the latter case would be
very interesting to probe. We thank the referee for this suggestion.
