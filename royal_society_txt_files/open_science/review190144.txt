Appendix A
Dear Editor and Reviewers:
Thank you very much for reviewing and commenting on our paper, “The
Fracture Failure of Granite after Varied Durations of Thermal Treatment: An
Experimental Study” (Manuscript ID: RSOS-190144). Your comments were
valuable and helped us revise and improve this paper; they will also help guide
our future research. We have revised our manuscript and made corrections to
address your concerns. The revised portions of our manuscript are highlighted in
red. The main corrections to the paper and our responses to reviewer comments
follow:
Reviewer #1:
Comment 1: Page 6 line 36, It should be "and" rather than "or".
Response: Thank you for your comment. We have corrected this error.
Comment 2: Why are these specimens heated first, and then processed by cutting
it artificially?
Response: Thank you for your comment. The process of heating and cooling
produces a temperature difference, causing thermal stress. The thermal stress is
concentrated at the tip of the artificial notch, causing a fracture toughness test
deviation. As such, the heat treatment was done first, followed by artificial cutting.
Comment 3: Fracture behavior of granite are widely discussed by many
researchers, I suggested the authors make some comparison your results with
published articles.

Fracture and Strength Character of Pre-cracked Granite Under Stress
Relaxation Condition[J]. Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering,
2018,51(5):1401-1412.
Response: Thank you for the articles that you recommended. We have read these
papers carefully, and compared them to our research. As a result, some supplemental
materials have been added to the revised version; they are appropriately cited.
Comment 4: Kindly keep a uniform style of referring.
1
Response: Thank you for your advice. We have corrected the references in the
revised manuscript.
Reviewer #2:
Comment 1: The authors shows three mode in figure 2. However, in the manuscript,
only mode 1, mode 2 and mode 1+2 appear. Please explain it, or show a sketch of
mixed mode. The mode 3 should be revised, it is not readerable.
Response: Thank you for your comment. In this manuscript, only mode-I, mode-II
and mixed (I+II) fracture toughness have been studied. The mode-III fracture
toughness is one of the basic fracture modes. It has only been shown in this
manuscript and has not been studied.
Comment 2: P4 line 15, Most laboratory research currently uses a 2-hour temperature
exposure duration, with a few studies using 8 hours. Please add some references here.
Response: Thank you for your advice. We have carefully reviewed this aspect of
research. And in the revised draft correctly summed up the research status, while
some supplemental materials have been added to the revised version; they are
appropriately cited.
Comment 3: P4 line 54, “S/D=0.61 and a/R=0.5. With a/R and S/R fixed”. Why do
the authors just use one of them,S/D or S/R?
Response: Thank you for pointing out mistake. The correct statement in this
manuscript should be S/D. We read the manuscript carefully and corrected the
mistake.
Comment 4: In this study, a=30° is selected to explore mixed-mode (I+II) fracture.
Why do the authors choose 30°?
Response: Thank you for your comment. This study sets S/D=0.61 and a/R=0.5.
According to the research (Lim et al, 1993), when the angle of the pre-notch is a=54°,
it will be mode II. Other angles will lead to mixed-mode (I+II) fracture. We chooses
a=30° is reasonable and is conducive to sample processing.
Comment 5: Table 1, please add the average values and the standard deviations of
2
each group.
Response: Thank you for your comment. Table 1 provides the basic data of the
experiment. The average of the experimental data is given in Figure 9. The data is
analyzed by the average value. Therefore, it is not necessary to list the standard
deviations of each group in Table 1.
Comment 6: P8 line 4, “toughness of granite gradually reduced with temperature”. I
think it changes with heating time, not temperature. And the results do not decrease
gradually.
Response: Thank you for pointing out mistake. The correct statement in this
manuscript should be heating durations. We read the manuscript carefully and
corrected the mistake.
Comment 7: P10 line 11, “the free water inside it evaporates”. What’s the water
content of the samples?
Response: Thank you for your comment. The natural moisture content of granite is
0.6%. The granite used in this manuscript is taken from the natural environment. As
the temperature rises, the water in the rock gradually evaporates. As it lacks the
lubrication provided by moisture, the frictional resistance of the granite matrix to
applied force increases.
Comment 8: In figure 9c, Mixed-mode (I+II) fracture toughness (a=3°). What’s a=3°
mean?
Response: Thank you for pointing out mistake. The correct angle should be 30°. We
read the manuscript carefully and corrected the mistake.
Comment 9: Figure 10, please show us which sample do the authors choose in each
group?
Response: Thank you for your comment. From 10h to 60 days of heating durations,
the curves are selected from 300-10h-0-3, 300-10d-0-1, 300-30d-0-2, 300-60d-0-3.
