This paper reports the preparation of a porphyrin- gold nanoparticles electrode and its
application for the determination of catechol (CC) by cyclic voltammetry. The application is of
great interest and the procedure is some kind new and straightforward. As such, I think the
paper can be of interest for the broad readership of Royal Society Open and I recommend
publication after major revision and after addressing the comments listed below.
1. One of my main concerns is that the authors modified both ITO and GCE electrodes, but in the
paper the only use GCE for characterization and detection. Why to include ITO? Please delete it
or include the result obtained with such electrode, and compare. Or explain the reason/purpose
behind the modification of ITO.
2. The table with the comparison with other methods for catechol detection is very good, yet
some related discussion and comparison should be included in the conclusions. Authors should
remark the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method over existing alternatives and
convince the readers to use their alternative.
3. Include or clarify the data about the reusability of the modified GCE. It should be
prepared/modified daily or it can be reused several times?
4. Figure 3: Include a graph showing the roughness mapping along the electrode.

This paper reports about development of a new electrochemical device consisted of bilayers of
CoPRu/AuNPs for sensing catechol. The authors clearly show the effectiveness of the device to
evaluate concentration of the catechol by peak heights in CV curves during electrochemical
operation. This article proposes a promising technique to detect undesired materials such as the
catechol sensitively and quantitatively, and is suitable for publication in the Royal Society Open
Science. However, I would encourage the authors to offer some discussions on the points
described below, prior to it being accepted for publication.
1) In the scheme 1, the authors have mentioned threefold bilayers are constructed by repeating
step 1 & 2. Where is the reaction site of 2nd and 3rd polymerization? Are the AuNPs of 1st layer
covered wholly by 2nd and 3rd CoPRu layers? Is the situation that AuNPs have no contacts with
liquid acceptable? How about the layered structure? It is difficult to understand the device
structure because its surface is not smooth as shown in Scheme1 but is quite rough as in Fig. 3.
Why did the authors choose threefold bilayers? Is this a optimal number of bilayers?
2) How did the authors measure the surface roughness in Fig. 3? If the electroactive area increases
with increasing surface area by roughen the surface, peak heights of CV curves must increase
linearly with increasing surface roughness evaluating by AFM images. Did the author confirm it?

mments from the Reviewer 1:
ne of my main concerns is that the authors modified both ITO and GCE electrodes, but in the
er the only use GCE for characterization and detection. Why to include ITO? Please delete it or
ude the result obtained with such electrode, and compare. Or explain the reason/purpose behind
modification of ITO
ponse:
The ITO electrode was used only to characterize the modified electrode, because it is
sible to perform UV / Vis of the film. This characterization is important to show the porphyrin
the Soret band) and the gold nanoparticles (Plasmon band) onto surface of ITO electrode. The
electrode was not used as a sensor because it has a low conductivity when it is compared with
sy carbon electrode.
include the follow the sentence in the manuscript (Section 3.5):
e ITO electrode was not used for electrochemical measurements of catechol because it has low
trical conductivity.”
he table with the comparison with other methods for catechol detection is very good, yet some
ted discussion and comparison should be included in the conclusions. Authors should remark
advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method over existing alternatives and convince
readers to use their alternative.
ponse:
nk you so much for your comments. The follow sentence was added in the conclusion:

) This exceptional sensitivity allows an accurate determination of CC concentration, that is
al for an environmental samples analysis. In addition, it exhibits excellent stability over a period
5 days, with a response of about 97%, due to its initial response on the first day.”
Include or clarify the data about the reusability of the modified GCE. It should be
pared/modified daily or it can be reused several times?
ponse:
change the sentence in section 4.5 as follows:
aily measurements were performed over a period of 15 days, conditioning the [(CoTPRu4)n8+-
E]/AuNPsn- before each analysis (see details in Section 2.3).”
aily measurements were performed over a period of 15 days using the same electrode,
ditioning the [(CoTPRu4)n8+-GCE]/AuNPsn- before each analysis (see details in Section 2.3).”
igure 3: Include a graph showing the roughness mapping along the electrode.
ponse:
The roughness map for the entire electrode was not obtained, the AFM measurements was
ied out using an average area of 107 nm2. For us, it is quite impossible to obtain the roughness
for the entire electrode in only 3 weeks, since the AFM equipment does not belong to our
arch group. However, we will take into consideration the suggestion of the reviewer for further
ks.

n some figures, CV are cropped at -0.4 V and look incomplete (Fig 4 red and black lines, fig 6,

olly by 2nd and 3rd CoPRu layers?

CURSO DE QUÍMICA
electropolymerization of CoTPRu4 porphyrin can occur onto surface of any type of conductive
strate (glassy carbon, platinum, gold, ITO), as already shown in previous work described by
group (Ref. 47). The main step of the formation of the polymer film is the reduction of the
enium complex on the conducting surface of the electrode, after the formation of the binuclear
plexes, consequently the chain process for the polymerization of the film in solution and then,
physical adsorption of the polymer film on the electrode. In this way, it is not necessary to have
ctional groups on the surface of the electrode for the electropolymerization of porphyrin to
ur. The insertion of the AuNPsn- into the polymerized film layer does not compromise the
sfer of electrons, since the AuNPsn- present excellent properties of electrical conductivity. As
viously published by us and others [ref 42 and 43], it is supposed that the interaction of AuNPsn-
cationic specimens occur by a non-covalent interaction, i.e. it occurs by an electrostatic
raction. Therefore, it is believed that the 2nd and 3rd CoTPRu4 layers are covered until the
rge equilibrium are reached.
he situation that AuNPs have no contacts with liquid acceptable?
ponse:
electrochemical process of the catechol (oxidation) occurs at the interface between solution
modified electrode, since the process is controlled by diffusion as shown by the results (Section
- scan rate studies).
w about the layered structure?

structure of the film is based on the electrostatic interaction between positive charges
ctropolymerized porphyrin) and negative charges (gold nanoparticles).
electrostatic interaction of gold anion nanoparticles and ruthenium cationic complexes has
ady been studied by our research group (ref 42 and 43).
s difficult to understand the device structure because its surface is not smooth as shown in
eme1 but is quite rough as in Fig. 3.
ponse:
It was not our intention overestimate the result, scheme 1 is only an illustration of how the
trode was developed, it is not a real description of the surface electrode.
y did the authors choose threefold bilayers? Is this a optimal number of bilayers?
ponse:
electrocatalytic activity of [(CoTPRu4)n8+-GCE]/AuNPs- is dependent of the number of
yers formed onto GCE surface. The choice was made by cyclic voltammetry after several
surements, using different bilayers, in the catechol determination. The results demonstrated
the electrode with three bilayers provides the highest values of the oxidation peak currents
ng the electrodes studies.
change the sentence in section 4.1 (line 20):
e two basic steps described above were carried out threefold, which produced a total of three
yers.”

Thank you so much for your commentaries. The electropolymerization mechanism of the
does not depend on the internal metal of porphyrin, but of the chemical structure of the
pheral complex. In previous works, we studied the electropolymerization of the porphyrins
h several internal metals and free. We found that the redox processes observed in the
ammograms of electropolymerization in the potential range between -0.4 and 1.0 V are
gned to processes of the ruthenium and regardless of the internal metal of porphyrin. Thus, we

assume that the electropolymerization mechanism is originally the same for the porphyrins of
eral formula {M-TPyP[RuCl3(dppb)]4}. Furthermore, it is important that the potential range
ng between -0.4 and 1.0V, because values besides these damage the electropolymerized film,
t is not possible to use potential values until 2.0V as suggested by the reviewer.
They have do ratiometric study in presence of other phenolic or polyphenolic analytes to

Herein we are showing the first electrocatalitic results using bilayer [(CoTPRu4)n8+-

strates, as suggest the reviewer, but it is a furtherance of this work. As soon as possible, we will
