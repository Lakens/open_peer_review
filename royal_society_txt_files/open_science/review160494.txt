Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The work is interesting, especially considering the lack of information about connectivity
worldwide. I think that the paper needs further work to provide to the reader an easier
understanding. Many concepts are just introduced but not really defined and the methodological
part is poorly described.I grouped my comments following the structure of the ms.
ABSTRACT
line13: species name in italic. To be changed also in other part of the ms.
INTRODUCTION
The introduction seems too long to me. It is as long as the discussion and contains a series of
information that could be moved in the material and methods or removed from the ms. For
example, there is a long descriptive paragraph of atmospheric-marine circulation pattern (page3
line 42-60) that is not really useful to me. It could be shortened and moved in a section in
Methods about the study area.
I am not convinced about the use of the terms 'meta-population' and 'sub-populations' in the ms,
especially in the absence of studies that demonstrate this pattern in the area considered by the
authors (no references reported). The two terms indicate the presence of a specific connectivity
pattern in the area and should not be used just to indicate a group of local populations. At page4-
line37 authors state that each MPA contains a sub-population. How are they sure of that?
Many concepts are introduced in the text but not properly defined, taking for granted that they
are known to all people. The paper is about 1.MPA 2.network and 3.connectivity (as stated in the
title), but none of these concepts is properly defined in the introduction.
A better description of the NAO is missing, in particular its two possible phases and their
potential ecological implications that seems to be the main objective of the paper. In fact, later in
the Results, the concept of negative NAO is introduced without any previous description.
Page3 line46: reference mistake?
Fig1: It is not specified what red dots represent in the picture.
METHODS
This part lacks a bit of linearity and clarity. My main concern is that the statistical analyses
applied are not properly explained. Moreover, it is not clear in particular how the information
about NAO were implemented in the model.
A brief description of L. pertusa life cycle and habits should be introduced here to better
understand some of the choices made for model parametrization.
An important point of connectivity studies based on model simulations is the number of particles
released that generally affects connectivity outputs. No mention of this is present in the ms.
How many simulations were run? One per behavioural parameters setting (i.e. 3)? If this is the
case, given that larvae were released from random points, is it possible that different runs with
the same model setting could lead to different connectivity outputs? Did authors check for
consistency among simulations under the same conditions?

Which is the depth profile in the study area?
RESULTS
This chapter should be shortened. Moreover, in general there is not linearity and correspondence
between the 'methods' and the 'results'. Most of the results are reported without a proper
description in the 'methods' and without explaining the reason why authors calculate them.
Page7-line43: what is the NAO index? Not explained. Consequently it's difficult to understand
what Tables 3,4 and 5 show.
Page7-line46: What kind of correlation is? And why authors calculated it? These information
should be provided in the 'methods'.
More than 2/3 of the Results are dedicated to aspects that are not really the objective of the paper
(stated in the title). Only the last part 'Network sensitivity...' is dedicated to what someone
expects in the ms, reading the title. I suggest to shorten the previous parts of the results, giving
more emphasis to the main objective of the paper.

This is an important contribution, not only furthering our knowledge of potential impacts of
climate changes on cold water corals, but also conferring information with important
implications for marine spatial planning and benthic marine management. I found the paper
extremely readable, with clear explanations of analysis, and comprehensive discussion of
implications of the findings. Congratulations!

RESPONSE TO REFEREES
General comments
The reviewers comments were generally positive, with Reviewer 1 finding the work ‘interesting,
especially considering the lack of information about connectivity worldwide’ and Reviewer 2
considering it ‘an important contribution’, ‘extremely readable, with clear explanations of analysis,
and comprehensive discussion of implications of the findings.’.
Below we have responded to the specific points from Reviewer 1 (Reviewer 2 requested no
changes). Considering Reviewer 2’s comments we have tried to do this with a light touch, and have
gone with Reviewer 2’s comments on readability and clarity when Reviewer 1’s comments were less
clear.
We think this addresses the concerns of Reviewer 1 while retaining the results and properties
enjoyed by Reviewer 2.

INTRODUCTION
The introduction seems too long to me. It is as long as the discussion and contains a series of
information that could be moved in the material and methods or removed from the ms. For example,
there is a long descriptive paragraph of atmospheric-marine circulation pattern (page3 line 42-60)
that is not really useful to me. It could be shortened and moved in a section in Methods about the
study area.
This has been done. The highlighted passage has been shortened and moved to Methods. As have
more detailed sections on larval behaviour (Page 4 of original paragraph 1 and 3).
I am not convinced about the use of the terms 'meta-population' and 'sub-populations' in the ms,
especially in the absence of studies that demonstrate this pattern in the area considered by the
authors (no references reported). The two terms indicate the presence of a specific connectivity
line37 authors state that each MPA contains a sub-population. How are they sure of that?
We accept this argument and have removed the terms throughout, referring more generally to
populations and not assuming connectivity patterns in advance.
Many concepts are introduced in the text but not properly defined, taking for granted that they are
known to all people. The paper is about 1.MPA 2.network and 3.connectivity (as stated in the title),
but none of these concepts is properly defined in the introduction.
These concepts are now defined. Introduction paragraph 2.
A better description of the NAO is missing, in particular its two possible phases and their potential
ecological implications that seems to be the main objective of the paper. In fact, later in the Results,
the concept of negative NAO is introduced without any previous description.
Additional description of NAO and definition of positive and negative states included (Intro

METHODS
This part lacks a bit of linearity and clarity.
This section has been largely rearranged, with inclusion of more detail, some transferred from the
Introduction, as requested. We think this has improved the linearity and clarity.
My main concern is that the statistical analyses applied are not properly explained.
These are now explained. Penultimate paragraph.
Moreover, it is not clear in particular how the information about NAO were implemented in the
model.
The meteorology driving the model includes the NAO information. This is now explicitly stated,
Methods paragraph 5.
A brief description of L. pertusa life cycle and habits should be introduced here to better understand
some of the choices made for model parametrization.
Included, Methods paragraph 2.
An important point of connectivity studies based on model simulations is the number of particles
released that generally affects connectivity outputs. No mention of this is present in the ms.
How many simulations were run? One per behavioural parameters setting (i.e. 3)? If this is the case,
given that larvae were released from random points, is it possible that different runs with the same
model setting could lead to different connectivity outputs? Did authors check for consistency among
Important omissions, details now included in Methods paragraph 7.
Which is the depth profile in the study area?
Briefly added to Methods paragraph 1.
RESULTS
This chapter should be shortened. Moreover, in general there is not linearity and correspondence
between the 'methods' and the 'results'. Most of the results are reported without a proper
description in the 'methods' and without explaining the reason why authors calculate them.
This comment has been addressed through the modifications to the Methods section. In the light of
Reviewer 2’s comments about clarity and readability we are reluctant to shorten the section except
in line with the specific points below
Page7-line43: what is the NAO index? Not explained. Consequently it's difficult to understand what
Tables 3,4 and 5 show.
Now explained in Introduction, paragraph 8.
Page7-line46: What kind of correlation is? And why authors calculated it? These information should
be provided in the 'methods'.
Now in Methods.
More than 2/3 of the Results are dedicated to aspects that are not really the objective of the paper
(stated in the title). Only the last part 'Network sensitivity...' is dedicated to what someone expects in
the ms, reading the title. I suggest to shorten the previous parts of the results, giving more emphasis
to the main objective of the paper.
We disagree with this assessment. The first section of the results, “Mediation of dispersal…” is
important to describe the average pathways and connectivity before examining the variability.
“Barriers and…” is examining the sensitivity of larval transport pathways to climate variability, which
is again essential in proceeding to determining the variability in connectivity. On this basis, and given
the comments from Reviewer 2, we have retained the structure and contents of this section.
Page9-line18-27: Why is this paragraph in the results?
Moved to methods, final paragraph.
