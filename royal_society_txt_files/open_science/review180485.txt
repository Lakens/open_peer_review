The manuscript presents a method useful for non-invasive estimation of leaf nitrogen content in
paddy rice using laser-induced fluorescence spectra analyses. Despite this idea is not new, the
innovative aspect of this paper is the focus on genotype specific patterns in fluorescence signal,
3
which is often neglected and, hence, the reliability of the method ignoring the diversity of optical
properties of leaves across the rice germplasm is limited. Thus, the study provides important
information towards practical application of the method.
The study is well introduced, providing all important information. The methods are sufficiently
described; however, some improvements are needed (see comments below). The results are
generally well discussed. However, I suggest to add some more relevant references to make
discussion more complex.
Concluding all, the manuscript, despite the concise, is sound and I recommend to ACCEPT the
manuscript for publication after addressing the comments within MINOR REVISION.
Comments:
- The statistical analyses need to be described providing more details.
- The measurements were limited to one growth stage only. The effects of differences in
phenology need to be also tested. One of future prospects can be a research aimed at whole
vegetation. This should be highlighted in the discussion.
- Moreover, the reliability of the method need to be verified in suboptimal conditions (in stress
conditions, different soil fertility, etc.).
- The authors should mention also the alternative ways of assessment of nitrogen status in leaves
of crops using the fluorescence technique, mainly fluorescence excitation ratio method (Tremblay
et al.: Agronomy Sustain Develop 32:451-464); fast fluorescence kinetics using multiparametric
approach (Kalaji et al. Plant Physiol Biochem 81:16-25); using performance indices (Zivcak et al.:
Plant Soil Environt 60: 210-215 and parallel monitoring of fluorescence parameters in different
leaf positions (Zivcak et al.: Zemdirbyste-Agriculture 101:437–444).

Dear Editor-in-chief,
Thanks for the valuable comments from you and the reviewers. We have revised our
paper very carefully under those comments and suggestions that helped us a lot to
improve the quality of this paper.
Below are our responses to the comments:

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript entitled “Analyzing the effect of paddy rice variety on
fluorescence characteristics for nitrogen application monitoring”
presents an interesting research about the paddy rice variety influence
on the fluorescence characteristics, which is very important for the
concrete scientific field. This manuscript is very original and
innovative, should have good potential to suitable the Royal Society
Open Science journal.
The research problem is well presented and the experiments were
properly planned and measurements were appropriately executed.
The data are sufficient, reliable, and presented only once. Some parts
need to be revised.
1) The soil, types of N-nutrition, climatic conditions and water regime
should be added in the Material and Methods.
Response:
Thank you very much for your valuable comments.
According to your advices, the relevant contents have been added in the Materials
and Methods: “The longitude of the experimental area varies from 113°41’ E to 115°05’
E and the latitude changes from 29°58’ N to 31°22’ N, which is a typical subtropical
monsoon climate. The rainfall and sunshine duration are above 1200 mm and over 1800
hours per year, respectively. Four doses of N fertilization of urea (N1: 0kg/ha, N2:
110kg/ha, N3: 160kg/ha, N4: 210kg/ha) were used during the entire growth period.”
2) In the Summary “Results demonstrated that no nitrogen fertilizer
can be completely distinguished from other N levels for all paddy rice
varieties. The remain N levels can also be well identified from each
other.” is not clear, which need to be reconstructed.
Response:
Thank you very much for your helpful comments.
According to your advices, the sentence has been revised to: “Experimental results
demonstrated that no nitrogen fertilizer can be completely identified for each paddy rice
variety. In addition, other N levels can also be well classified based on fluorescence
characteristics.”.
3) 3.3 Measurements of LNC may be revised to “LNC Measurements”
Response:
Thank you very much for your helpful comments.
The relative content “3.3 Measurements of LNC” has been revised to “3.3. LNC
Measurements.”
Thank you very much for your help again.

Concluding all, the manuscript, despite the concise, is sound and I
recommend to ACCEPT the manuscript for publication after
addressing the comments within MINOR REVISION.
Comments:
1) The statistical analyses need to be described providing more details.
Response:
Thank you very much for your valuable comments.
According to your advices, the relevant content has been added: “Then, 86%, 89.1%,
89.9%, 89.5%, 92.3%, and 93% of the total variance contained in the fluorescence
spectra can be explained using the first two PCs corresponding to Manley Indica,
Shanyou 63, Yangliangyou 6, Y-Liangyou 2, Victory Indica, and II-You 838,
respectively.”; “The value of the F735/F685 ranges from 1.058 to 1.885, and the mean
value is 1.427. The LNC ranges from 0.695 mg/g to 3.05 mg/g, and the mean values
are 1.670mg/g (n=180). The correlation between the fluorescence characteristics
(F735/F685) and the LNC of different paddy rice varieties is shown in Figure3.”.
2) The measurements were limited to one growth stage only. The
effects of differences in phenology need to be also tested. One of future
prospects can be a research aimed at whole vegetation. This should be
highlighted in the discussion.
Response:
Thank you very much for your valuable comments.
According to your advices, the relevant contents have been added: “The effects of
the different stages of paddy rice growth, differences in phenology, and planting area
on the fluorescence characteristics should be discussed to enhance the robustness and
reliability of LIF in crop monitoring. In addition, the fluorescence spectrum of different
paddy rice varieties was measured in this study. The following research should consider
whole vegetation.”.
3) Moreover, the reliability of the method need to be verified in
suboptimal conditions (in stress conditions, different soil fertility, etc.).
Response:
Thank you very much for your helpful comments.
This study mainly aimed is to discuss the effect of paddy rice variety on the
fluorescence characteristics for nitrogen application monitoring. In addition, PCA has
been demonstrated that it is a useful tool to analyze fluorescence spectrum by reducing
the dimensionality of spectra and extract the most crucial spectral feature variables [1-
2]. According to your advices, we consider that analyzing effects of the different stress
conditions and different soil fertility on the fluorescence characteristics for different
paddy rice varieties will be useful to improve the application of LIF. If conditions
permit, we will carry out relevant research in the following work. Thank you very much
for your insight comments again.

4) The authors should mention also the alternative ways of assessment
of nitrogen status in leaves of crops using the fluorescence technique,
mainly fluorescence excitation ratio method (Tremblay et al.:
Agronomy Sustain Develop 32:451-464); fast fluorescence kinetics
using multiparametric approach (Kalaji et al. Plant Physiol Biochem
81:16-25); using performance indices (Zivcak et al.: Plant Soil
Environt 60: 210-215 and parallel monitoring of fluorescence
parameters in different leaf positions (et al.: Zemdirbyste-Agriculture
101:437–444).
Response:
Thank you very much for your helpful comments.
According to your advices, the relevant content has been added in the Introduction:
“In addition, fast fluorescence kinetics was also used to monitor the nutrient stress of
crops [10, 11]. Thus, chlorophyll fluorescence is a useful tool for vegetation detection.”;
“Zivcak et al. discussed the effect of different leaf positions on the fluorescence
characteristics [20].”
