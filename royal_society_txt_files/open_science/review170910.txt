Summary: In general, this is a well-written manuscript describing a carefully planned and
generally well-executed study. The introduction and discussion are thorough, and they
accurately report on the state of the science regarding immune responses to Bd. This study goes
further than many others to show Bd infections detected by PCR as well as by histological
studies. I appreciate the thoroughness of the methods section, which describes step-by-step
raising of the animals, Bd exposure, collection of data on control and exposed frogs, tissue
collection, and RNAseq analysis. I have some minor criticisms and suggestions for change.
Specific Criticism or Suggestions:
Since there are double sets of line numbers, these comments refer to the innermost set of numbers
that line up with the double-spaced text.
1. P. 5., line 104. Please give us some idea of the “moderate temperature” in the
greenhouse. Was that
species?
2. P. 6, line 125. About how large were the wood frogs and bullfrogs at metamorphosis?
3. P. 7, line 142. Please add that all individual frogs of both species tested Bd-negative prior
to experimental exposures. You have reported this, but I think it is important to emphasize that
the bullfrogs collected as tadpoles from the wild were also Bd-negative at the time of exposure.
4. P. 7, line 162. As I read the results and looked at the figures and legends, I was often
uncertain how many individual animals were represented by each data point. Please include
more information in the figure legends to explain how many animals were included in each part
of the experiment and analysis. You indicate that 188 total animals were used. Please provide a
brief table indicating how many of each species were included in each treatment and/or tissue
harvesting for RNAseq or histology.
5. P. 7, lines 157-159. Can you give a bit more information about the 8 frogs that were
exposed to a low number of Section Line Bd cells prior to exposure to the larger dose for this
experiment? In this section, you only mention that they were “frogs”. Please be clear that they
were among the wood frog metamorphs. How many Bd zoospores? Were the zoospores viable
or dead? Since these frogs seemed to show some evidence that this prior exposure led to
activation of an adaptive immune response, this would suggest a possible method for
immunization against Bd (although it was not effective against the higher dose in your
experiment).
6. P. 9, lines 186-191. You describe how many animals were sacrificed to collect samples for
RNAseq. Here again, a very brief table showing the numbers of each species, each treatment, and
each day tissues were sampled would be very helpful.
7. P. 16, lines 351-362 describing the results shown in Fig. 1. Please show the survival
curves in Fig. 1 with discrete symbols instead of a merged line. This might also reveal the
overlapping data. In the legend, please indicate how many animals were included in each
treatment group. Did controls have 100% survival? Was survival of CM-exposed wood frogs the
same as control frogs (i.e., not significantly different) whereas both differed significantly from SL-
exposed wood frogs?
8. P. 16-17, lines 363-372. Please give us some idea of how much the weight changed in
each species? It looks like the change in wood frogs was about half a gram and greater in the
control bullfrogs. About what percentage change?
3
9. P. 17, lines 390-391 describing the results in Fig. 4. What was the variability in the Bd
loads determined by qPCR. The averages shown in Fig. 4. obscure the variability of the qPCR
results. I would like to see a mean and standard error. Also, please indicate the number of
individuals represented by each data point at each time point in the figure legend.
10. Please give us the correlation coefficient for the comparison of qPCR with histology
infection scores. Perhaps, it would be good to show some heavily infected skin of the wood frogs
and less in the bullfrogs to give us some idea of what killed the wood frogs.
11. The number of zoospores used for experimental exposures seems a bit high for these
very small postmetamorphic frogs. Perhaps you can comment on how this might compare to
exposure in the wild. I’m guessing this dose was chosen to assure that immune activation would
be triggered.

This paper reports a comprehensive account of a study of the immunogenetic bases of resistance
to the emerging infectious disease chytridiomycosis in two North American ranid frogs. One
species, the wood frog Rana sylvatica, is noteworthy for having the widest distribution of any
North American frog, from Alaska to Alabama, but shows geographic variation in many traits
and appears not to be undergoing discernible population declines in many parts of its range. The
other, the American bullfrog Rana catesbeiana, is thought to be largely immune to
chytridiomycosis but has been implicated as a carrier of the disease to naïve species in habitats
outside its normal range, in the western USA and around the world. Strangely, even though
highly invasive outside its range, this species appears to be declining in some areas of its native
range. Except for a few days in spring, wood frogs are terrestrial whereas bullfrogs are largely
aquatic. Although the species are sympatric through part of their ranges, they have evolved very
different life histories.
This study compares effects of inoculation of two isolates of amphibian chytrid fungus
(Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, or Bd) cultured from a third species, Rana cascadae (not
4
explicitly stated in the manuscript), on mass, survival, and gene expression. The results reveal
that wood frogs are susceptible to one of the Bd isolates, and infected subjects show up-
regulation of immune-system genes that ordinarily would be expected to clear the disease
whereas bullfrogs are largely unaffected by both Bd isolates and show no comparable changes in
gene expression. Overall, these results are consistent with other recent studies that have shown
that susceptible species show up-regulation of immune-system and some other genes (see recent
review by Fu and Waldman, 2017, Immunogenetics). Additionally, the study found little
evidence of gene expression between Bd strains based on their virulence – which should generate
additional follow-up studies.
Given its substantial scope and use of multiple methods, unusual for such studies, this paper
represents an important contribution to our nascent understanding of immunogenetic responses
to Bd, but some methodological issues need to be addressed and clarified. Some elements of the
experimental design are not optimal, yet do not necessarily invalidate the results.
An unspecified number of wood frog egg masses were collected from the southern part of its
range and shipped to California. These were all presumed to be Bd-naïve. Bullfrog tadpoles were
collected in California from two localities, and an unknown numbers of clutches. These tadpoles
were superficially inspected to select only individuals with normal mouthparts, then assumed to
be Bd-naïve, but visual inspection is not a reliable indicator of chytridiomycosis. The tadpoles
lived for many months in an environment where they could have contacted Bd. Perhaps some
had cleared the pathogen. Tadpoles were found with mouthparts infected with Bd, and
presumably some positive tadpoles were collected and kept in the same bucket/mesocosm as the
negative ones used in the experiments (why were the same mesocosms used for bullfrogs as had
been used for wood frogs?).
Field-collected and laboratory-reared subjects can differ substantially because of environmental
effects, some of which may be long-lasting. For example, aside from genetic variation, gene
expression can be influenced by skin microbes which differ substantially between field-collected
and laboratory reared individuals and may play a role in resistance to Bd. Moreover, adaptive
immune function may develop differently depending on early exposure to environmental factors.
To properly analyse and interpret the results, more details on the numbers of wood frog clutches
tested and how they were divided among mesocosms is needed. Whatever data are available on
the sourced bullfrogs also is needed. Then, at what age/size were subjects inoculated with Bd?
One can infer from the results that experiments were run on subjects shortly after metamorphosis
but specific details on these protocols are needed. Amphibian immune responses change
drastically through ontogeny with limited adaptive immune responses in larvae, metamorphs
highly vulnerable to infection, and then full immune competence only slowly developing after
metamorphosis. Thus these details are critical to properly interpreting the results.
Differential infection procedures for the two species further make comparisons more difficult,
and appear rather arbitrary. One might argue that if bullfrogs were considerably larger than
wood frogs, as the data suggest, appropriate Bd inoculation doses should have been even higher.
However, given the experimental outcomes, this probably is not important.
Specific comments:
Line 131: Feeding regimen seems insufficient for new metamorphs, which would cause
additional stress to subjects
Lines 157-160: Data from previously inoculated subjects should be analysed, or at least
visualised, separately from other data on presumed naïve subjects.
Lines 218-220: Statistical inferences cannot be drawn based on non-overlap of confidence limits.
5
Lines 377-379: What is your explanation for how the subject was re-infected? Possibly this
reflects inaccuracies in PCR detection of infection, which a few recent papers have documented.
Lines 381-382: Range of infection loads would be more relevant here.
Lines 395 - : Although I think this is a good approach, too many significant digits are given for
the infection quantifications.
Lines 540-541: Costs of immune defence previously have been considered with regard to the
Bd/host interaction in amphibian systems, so references might be added.
Lines 575 - : As discussed above, there are many life-history differences between the two species
that might account for their differential susceptibilities to Bd, including their population histories
and habitat preferences. One must also consider that wood frogs vary in life-history characters
across their range, and may show different responses in more northern areas. Recent studies on
cane toads in Australia suggest that invasive species, such as bullfrogs in California, might
experience rapid selection for life-history traits that promote their spread. So similar to variation
in wood frogs, we might expect that introduced populations in rapidly expanding ranges differ in
important traits from those in their historical range. I thus recommend further discussion of how
the different resistance strategies might play out in an ecological context.

Associate Editor's comments:
We have received the reports of two reviewers. They both state that this is a well-written paper
that convincingly demonstrates the differential responses of wood frogs and bull frogs to
zoospores. Both reviewers provide tangible suggestions for the improvement of the manuscript,
and I encourage the authors to make revisions accordingly. Upon revision, I think this will make
a worthy contribution to the literature.

Summary: My previous review was generally quite favorable. Here I will list changes that I
previously suggested and you did not make. Please make them. I also found some additional
problems that should be addressed.
Specific Criticism or Suggestions:
Since there are double sets of line numbers, these comments refer to the innermost set of numbers
that line up with the double-spaced text.
1. P. 5., line 104. I asked for clarification as to what you meant by “moderate temperature”
in the greenhouse. If you mean “in order to moderate temperature”, then please make the change
in the manuscript. As written, it is unclear.
2. P. 7, line 162. I asked for additional information in the figure legends. You have chosen
to present this information in supplemental tables. I find this unacceptable. You are asking the
readers to dig out essential information by looking up supplemental material.
a) For example in the legend for Fig 1a, please indicate that N= 13 control frogs, N = 33 exposed
to Section Line isolate, N = 13 exposed to Carter Meadow isolate, and N = 6 previously exposed
to Section Line isolate and exposed again. Please provide the same information for Fig 1b for
bullfrogs (i.e. 11 control, 5 Carter Meadow, 10 Section Line). The supplemental table is not very
helpful. You need the animal numbers in both places, especially in the figure legend.
b) For Figure 2a and 2b, it would not be difficult, and it would be much clearer if you showed a
small number inserted into the figure indicating the number of animals represented by each
“violin”. You want to make your data as clear as possible.
3. Table S1 is helpful to show how many animals were sacrificed to collect samples for
RNAseq. Thanks for making the change. It is less helpful to understand how many animals are
reported in each of figures 1-4.
4. Lines 362-372. Please indicate in the text how many animals were used for statistical
comparisons. That is, just state “Bd-exposed wood frogs were severely affected, such that only
one of thirty three survived until the end of the experiment. Also explain how man of PE SL Bd
treated frogs died before removal for tissue harvesting.
5. Lines 390-393. In Fig. 3a, I don’t understand why the infection prevalence dropped to 0
for the Section Line exposed animals. Did you only swab after death? Were they humanely
sacrificed when they were very sick? Please provide more information in the text. The legend for
Figure 3 is still unclear. Why delete data for harvesting dates 3, 7, 10 when determining
prevalence. This suggests you are trying to obscure something not reveal something.
6. Lines 396-401. Given that Bd replication from zoospore through sporangium to new
zoospores takes 4-5 days, are you certain that the bullfrogs were actually infected? The histology
scores shown in Figure 5 suggest they were not infected. Please comment in the results and
discussion.
7. In Fig. 6, the bullfrog host-specific contigs all seem to cluster with the controls. This
further suggest that bullfrogs were not infected. Given that there were very few differentially
expressed contigs shown in Fig. 7, this suggests the bullfrogs were not infected whereas the wood
frogs were impacted by disease.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
While I appreciate the authors’ lengthy responses to the referees’ generally favourable comments,
I am not convinced that sufficient revisions have been made to fully address the concerns.
In many sections, the manuscript appears virtually identical to the third chapter of the first
author’s Ph.D. thesis. More extensive editing and revision, as suggested by the referees, would
improve the paper. Update references might be added, for example to studies putatively
identifying immunogenetic bases of Bd resistance, since these appear highly relevant to the
study’s conclusions. Where do the two study species lie along the continuum of immunogenetic
differences demonstrated between Bd-resistant and susceptible species?
Although the study reports valuable data, the experimental design suffers from lack of rigour
and limited sampling. These limitations restrict the extent to which the results can be generalised.
Moreover, the authors’ responses to earlier comments invoke arguments that are dependent on
untested assumptions. These should be identified and addressed.
For example, screening subjects for infection and finding them to test Bd-negative does not
establish that they are naïve to the pathogen. The theme of the paper is the description of
differences in adaptive immunity between species. Certainly, we might expect infected animals to
clear the pathogen if their immune responses are effective. Likewise, I do not understand how the
authors can assume that re-used mesocosms are pathogen-free because subjects previously reared
in them showed no clinical signs of disease.
All wood frog masses were collected from one single site. Possible variation in response among
clutches would give some handle on genetic variation in immune response. However, as larvae
were distributed haphazardly among treatments, that analysis becomes impossible. Even in the
absence of potential biases that this may have unintentionally been introduced, care must be
exercised in interpreting the results. Strictly speaking, conclusions can be drawn about responses
of the population from which the egg masses were collected, but not necessarily extrapolated to
13
other populations and certainly not to the entire species. These species span vast geographic
ranges across which other studies reveal substantial variation in numerous characters.
Studies on Bd loads in bullfrogs reveal substantial variation, as the authors are certainly aware,
from their discussion in a previous paper. Studies of invasive populations of this species outside
North America reveal even higher Bd loads. To simply disregard populations with high Bd loads
as aberrant and discard these data as outliers would be a mistake in my view. The conclusions of
this study rest on the assumption that one species, the bullfrog, is resistant to Bd and the other,
the woodfrog, is susceptible to the pathogen. But if that is true, why are bullfrog populations
declining while woodfrog populations remain stable in many localities within their natural range
where they are sympatric? I am unclear why consideration of such points is considered beyond
the scope of the study.
In my experience, IACUC committees have little knowledge of, nor interest in, proper husbandry
of amphibians. I am not sure why the authors would rely on this to demonstrate appropriate
procedures have been followed. Possible effects of feeding protocol that may influence the results
should be discussed.
In summary, the experiments for the two species were set up using very different protocols,
which makes comparisons less clear than argued by the authors. Although many detailed
analyses are presented in this paper, “stronger inferences about inherent species-level differences
in Bd response” would require a more appropriate experimental design. The impressive results
reported in this paper must be interpreted within the context of the known natural history of
these species and generally accepted principles of statistical inference.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
The manuscript has been re-assessed by both original reviewers, which provided very thorough
and constructive comments for the improvement of the manuscript in their original reports. For
the revised version, both reviewers expressed a justifiable frustration about the lack of rigor in
terms of addressing the original concerns. While the authors spent considerable time replying to
specific comments, this has not necessarily translated into matching modifications and
improvements of the manuscript. Before this manuscript can be considered for publication, the
authors will have to rigorously address all comments by the reviewers. In addition, I would like
to highlight that this is a very voluminous paper both in terms of it text length and the number of
figures. I would encourage the authors to shorten the paper wherever possible and make careful
decisions about what elements to show in the main manuscript and the online supplement (also
see reviewer comments).
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
While I appreciate the authors’ lengthy responses to the referees’ generally favourable comments,
I am not convinced that sufficient revisions have been made to fully address the concerns.
In many sections, the manuscript appears virtually identical to the third chapter of the first
author’s Ph.D. thesis. More extensive editing and revision, as suggested by the referees, would
improve the paper. Update references might be added, for example to studies putatively
identifying immunogenetic bases of Bd resistance, since these appear highly relevant to the
16
study’s conclusions. Where do the two study species lie along the continuum of immunogenetic
differences demonstrated between Bd-resistant and susceptible species?
Although the study reports valuable data, the experimental design suffers from lack of rigour
and limited sampling. These limitations restrict the extent to which the results can be generalised.
Moreover, the authors’ responses to earlier comments invoke arguments that are dependent on
untested assumptions. These should be identified and addressed.
For example, screening subjects for infection and finding them to test Bd-negative does not
establish that they are naïve to the pathogen. The theme of the paper is the description of

Comments to the Author(s)
Summary: My previous review was generally quite favorable. Here I will list changes that I
previously suggested and you did not make. Please make them. I also found some additional
problems that should be addressed.
17
Specific Criticism or Suggestions:
Since there are double sets of line numbers, these comments refer to the innermost set of numbers
that line up with the double-spaced text.
1. P. 5., line 104. I asked for clarification as to what you meant by “moderate temperature”
in the greenhouse. If you mean “in order to moderate temperature”, then please make the change
in the manuscript. As written, it is unclear.
2. P. 7, line 162. I asked for additional information in the figure legends. You have chosen
to present this information in supplemental tables. I find this unacceptable. You are asking the
readers to dig out essential information by looking up supplemental material.
a) For example in the legend for Fig 1a, please indicate that N= 13 control frogs, N = 33 exposed
to Section Line isolate, N = 13 exposed to Carter Meadow isolate, and N = 6 previously exposed
to Section Line isolate and exposed again. Please provide the same information for Fig 1b for
bullfrogs (i.e. 11 control, 5 Carter Meadow, 10 Section Line). The supplemental table is not very
helpful. You need the animal numbers in both places, especially in the figure legend.
b) For Figure 2a and 2b, it would not be difficult, and it would be much clearer if you showed a
small number inserted into the figure indicating the number of animals represented by each
“violin”. You want to make your data as clear as possible.
3. Table S1 is helpful to show how many animals were sacrificed to collect samples for
RNAseq. Thanks for making the change. It is less helpful to understand how many animals are
reported in each of figures 1-4.
4. Lines 362-372. Please indicate in the text how many animals were used for statistical
comparisons. That is, just state “Bd-exposed wood frogs were severely affected, such that only
one of thirty three survived until the end of the experiment. Also explain how man of PE SL Bd
treated frogs died before removal for tissue harvesting.
5. Lines 390-393. In Fig. 3a, I don’t understand why the infection prevalence dropped to 0
for the Section Line exposed animals. Did you only swab after death? Were they humanely
sacrificed when they were very sick? Please provide more information in the text. The legend for
Figure 3 is still unclear. Why delete data for harvesting dates 3, 7, 10 when determining
prevalence. This suggests you are trying to obscure something not reveal something.
6. Lines 396-401. Given that Bd replication from zoospore through sporangium to new
zoospores takes 4-5 days, are you certain that the bullfrogs were actually infected? The histology
scores shown in Figure 5 suggest they were not infected. Please comment in the results and
discussion.
7. In Fig. 6, the bullfrog host-specific contigs all seem to cluster with the controls. This
further suggest that bullfrogs were not infected. Given that there were very few differentially
expressed contigs shown in Fig. 7, this suggests the bullfrogs were not infected whereas the wood
frogs were impacted by disease.

ociate Editor's comments:
have received the reports of two reviewers. They both state that this is a well-written paper
convincingly demonstrates the differential responses of wood frogs and bull frogs to
spores. Both reviewers provide tangible suggestions for the improvement of the manuscript,
I encourage the authors to make revisions accordingly. Upon revision, I think this will make
orthy contribution to the literature.

mments to the Author(s)
mmary: In general, this is a well-written manuscript describing a carefully planned and
erally well-executed study. The introduction and discussion are thorough, and they
urately report on the state of the science regarding immune responses to Bd. This study goes
her than many others to show Bd infections detected by PCR as well as by histological
dies. I appreciate the thoroughness of the methods section, which describes step-by-step
ing of the animals, Bd exposure, collection of data on control and exposed frogs, tissue
ection, and RNAseq analysis. I have some minor criticisms and suggestions for change.
cific Criticism or Suggestions:
ce there are double sets of line numbers, these comments refer to the innermost set of
mbers that line up with the double-spaced text.
P. 5., line 104. Please give us some idea of the “moderate temperature” in the
enhouse. Was that 18<U+F0B0>C or 25<U+F0B0>C? Was this temperature favorable for development of both
cies?
te that we mention using the greenhouse in order to moderate temperature, not because
y provided moderate temperatures per se. To briefly explain, we knew that housing
socosms outdoors during the summer in Davis, CA (where temperatures commonly rise
ve 38<U+F0B0>C/100<U+F0B0>F) would likely be less than ideal for our study species (and potentially
w for the colonization of the mesocosms by local fauna). Thus, housing inside a
enhouse on UC Davis’ campus represented our best option, and this rearing condition
s previously used with success (see Piovia-Scott et al. 2014, The ISME Journal).
socosm water temperature ranged from ~22<U+F02D>26°C, which was certainly preferable to
peratures that mesocosms would have experienced outdoors. We now report these
peratures in the text. These temperatures supported normal development and
tamorphosis of both study species.
P. 6, line 125. About how large were the wood frogs and bullfrogs at metamorphosis?
r first measurements of metamorphosed wood frogs were on 02 May 2014, with a
ple of 145 frogs that had been removed from the mesocosms between 22–30 April 2014.
that time, average snout-urostyle length (SUL) was 20 mm, and average mass was 0.79
Our first measurements of metamorphosed American bullfrogs were on 20 June 2014,
h a sample of 24 frogs that had been removed from the mesocosms between 07–20 June
4. At that time, average SUL was 40 mm, and average mass was 7.82 g. We now report
se data in the manuscript. While we think this information is valuable for readers, we
uld also note that these measurements, given that they are our earliest records, do not
resent animal sizes at the time of Bd exposure. In addition, it is important to appreciate
fact that bullfrog sizes are much more variable than wood frog sizes (i.e., see multiple-
d variation in bullfrog mass at the time of experimental exposures as illustrated in the
in text in figure 2b).
P. 7, line 142. Please add that all individual frogs of both species tested Bd-negative prior
xperimental exposures. You have reported this, but I think it is important to emphasize that
bullfrogs collected as tadpoles from the wild were also Bd-negative at the time of exposure.
ange made as indicated.
P. 7, line 162. As I read the results and looked at the figures and legends, I was often
ertain how many individual animals were represented by each data point. Please include
re information in the figure legends to explain how many animals were included in each part
he experiment and analysis. You indicate that 188 total animals were used. Please provide a
f table indicating how many of each species were included in each treatment and/or tissue
vesting for RNAseq or histology.
agree that understanding sample size is critical for appropriate interpretation of our
ults and can be challenging in this study due to the complex study design. However,
ause of its complexity, we think this information would be cumbersome to present in
ry figure legend, especially given that sample sizes (even within treatments) can change
r the time course of the experiment (due to disease-related morbidity or destructive
pling). Similarly, this sample size information would be difficult to represent visually in
appealing way within the figures, some of which are already very data-rich.
erefore, we have chosen to address this comment through the addition of two
pplementary Tables to the manuscript. Supplementary Table S1 gives sample sizes
oss host species, treatments, and experimental time points that are relevant to data
sented in figures 1–4. We thought this was the most concise way to present all the
ple size information readers may be interested in. Supplementary Table S2 gives
ilar information relevant to tissue harvesting and RNA-seq analyses.
P. 7, lines 157-159. Can you give a bit more information about the 8 frogs that were
osed to a low number of Section Line Bd cells prior to exposure to the larger dose for this
eriment? In this section, you only mention that they were “frogs”. Please be clear that they
e among the wood frog metamorphs. How many Bd zoospores? Were the zoospores viable
ead? Since these frogs seemed to show some evidence that this prior exposure led to
vation of an adaptive immune response, this would suggest a possible method for
munization against Bd (although it was not effective against the higher dose in your
eriment).
have now clarified in text that these previously exposed animals were all wood frogs.
have also included details regarding dosage of these preliminary exposures, which
ged from ~105 to ~3 x 106 total zoospores. As with all exposures reported throughout the
nuscript, these exposures consisted of live, viable zoospores.
clarify, these wood frogs were used in preliminary exposure trials that allowed us to
imize exposure protocols to ensure that Bd exposures would be likely to have at least
e effect on wood frogs, the species we anticipated would be most susceptible to
tridiomycosis. Through the course of these preliminary trials, the primary alterations
t were made to experimental protocols were: 1) direct pipetting of the zoospore broth
o the subject’s venter (rather than simply passive introduction in a bath) and 2)
reased zoospore dosage. After optimization of the exposure protocols, we then had a set
ight previously exposed, surviving wood frogs that we also included in our full
erimental setup for the exact reasons the Reviewer mentions (i.e., we were interested in
ether these animals with prior exposure to Bd might show distinct disease progression
gene expression relative to naïve individuals).
P. 9, lines 186-191. You describe how many animals were sacrificed to collect samples for
Aseq. Here again, a very brief table showing the numbers of each species, each treatment,
each day tissues were sampled would be very helpful.
our response to comment number 4 above and our addition of Supplementary Table S2
ddress this issue.
P. 16, lines 351-362 describing the results shown in Fig. 1. Please show the survival curves
ig. 1 with discrete symbols instead of a merged line. This might also reveal the overlapping
a. In the legend, please indicate how many animals were included in each treatment
up. Did controls have 100% survival? Was survival of CM-exposed wood frogs the same as
trol frogs (i.e., not significantly different) whereas both differed significantly from SL-
osed wood frogs?
did not implement this change partially because using symbols instead of merged lines
uld not resolve the issue of overlapping data. Standard survival curve plotting
cedures only produce a point when animals are removed from the sample (i.e., when the
rent survival curves show a vertical shift downward, indicating removal of individuals).
us, survival curves that are currently completely overlapping would still have points that
pletely overlap. In addition, we think that the continuous curves are a better
resentation of the analysis, which is attempting to characterize survival over continuous
e.
now address sample sizes in this analysis in Supplementary Table S1. As stated in the
ure legend, “the line representing control animals is obscured as this treatment group
100% survival throughout the study.” Our statistical test here is technically detecting
erences among all survival curves. However, clearly CM-exposed wood frog survival
s not differ from control wood frog survival since they both had 100% survival. Post-
pairwise comparisons between control wood frog survival with both SL Bd-exposed
previously exposed SL Bd-exposed wood frogs revealed significant differences in both
es.
P. 16-17, lines 363-372. Please give us some idea of how much the weight changed in each
cies? It looks like the change in wood frogs was about half a gram and greater in the control
lfrogs. About what percentage change?
solute and relative body mass change (from pre-exposure to day 46 post-exposure) for
h control wood frogs and American bullfrogs are now given in text.
P. 17, lines 390-391 describing the results in Fig. 4. What was the variability in the Bd
ds determined by qPCR. The averages shown in Fig. 4. obscure the variability of the qPCR
ults. I would like to see a mean and standard error. Also, please indicate the number of
ividuals represented by each data point at each time point in the figure legend.
agree that representing variation in infection loads is important and represents an
provement on our existing data presentation. Thus, we now present minimum and
ximum infection loads at each time point (where relevant) over treatments in figure 4.
chose to present min/max values because they are extremely similar to intervals that
uld be represented by standard errors, highest posterior density intervals, or other
mary metrics given our sample sizes for positive frogs within treatment groups.
n/max values have the advantage of being more intuitive for readers, and thus we chose
t summary metric.
sample sizes for each data point would be cumbersome to present in the text of the
ure legend, this information is now given in Supplementary Table S1.
Please give us the correlation coefficient for the comparison of qPCR with histology
ction scores. Perhaps, it would be good to show some heavily infected skin of the wood
gs and less in the bullfrogs to give us some idea of what killed the wood frogs.
now report a Pearson correlation coefficient (0.49) to quantify the correlation between
CR and histology infection scores. We don’t feel that single histological images would be
ticularly helpful in interpreting our infection load results. First, histology scores, by
ign, incorporated data across numerous microscopic fields for each individual case.
erefore, any single image may not actually be representative of an individual’s overall
ection load. Second, complete histology score data is already presented in both figure
table format in our manuscript.
The number of zoospores used for experimental exposures seems a bit high for these very
all postmetamorphic frogs. Perhaps you can comment on how this might compare to
osure in the wild. I’m guessing this dose was chosen to assure that immune activation would
riggered.
our knowledge, exposure of wild animals to Bd is difficult to quantify. Certainly, there
data on infection loads detected on many wild amphibian species, but, as our data
strate, established infection loads on amphibian hosts can be dramatically lower than
ial exposure doses. Thus, actual Bd environmental loads would need to be directly

., direct pipetting of exposure broth onto the skin) is probably quite different than wild
des of exposure. Thus, perhaps the best we can do is make reliable comparisons to other
erimental Bd exposure studies, as we attempted to do here. As we state in the
nuscript regarding our exposure protocols, “These doses are similar to those used in
vious studies involving the same amphibian host species and Bd isolates, which ranged
m ~105 to ~108 total zoospores.” So, while our exposures may seem high, they are
ually orders of magnitude smaller than some other doses reported in the literature.
addition, the Reviewer is certainly correct that we attempted to adjust our Bd exposure
es to ensure that there would be some observable effect on wood frogs at least (as we
icipated them to be the more susceptible species). The alternative would have been to
ablish pre-determined exposure doses, perform the exposures, monitor animals, and run
risk that exposures were simply too low to establish infection in either species. Thus, we
formed preliminary exposure trials with wood frogs and Section Line Bd to observe the
cts of different exposure protocols and doses. From this process, we tuned our exposure
tocols and also generated the small set of animals that became the previously exposed
tion Line Bd treatment group in the later, full experimental treatments.

s paper reports a comprehensive account of a study of the immunogenetic bases of resistance
he emerging infectious disease chytridiomycosis in two North American ranid frogs. One
cies, the wood frog Rana sylvatica, is noteworthy for having the widest distribution of any
rth American frog, from Alaska to Alabama, but shows geographic variation in many traits
appears not to be undergoing discernible population declines in many parts of its range. The
er, the American bullfrog Rana catesbeiana, is thought to be largely immune to
tridiomycosis but has been implicated as a carrier of the disease to naïve species in habitats
side its normal range, in the western USA and around the world. Strangely, even though
hly invasive outside its range, this species appears to be declining in some areas of its native
ge. Except for a few days in spring, wood frogs are terrestrial whereas bullfrogs are largely
atic. Although the species are sympatric through part of their ranges, they have evolved very
erent life histories.
s study compares effects of inoculation of two isolates of amphibian chytrid fungus
trachochytrium dendrobatidis, or Bd) cultured from a third species, Rana cascadae (not
licitly stated in the manuscript), on mass, survival, and gene expression. The results reveal
wood frogs are susceptible to one of the Bd isolates, and infected subjects show up-
ulation of immune-system genes that ordinarily would be expected to clear the disease
ereas bullfrogs are largely unaffected by both Bd isolates and show no comparable changes in
e expression. Overall, these results are consistent with other recent studies that have shown
susceptible species show up-regulation of immune-system and some other genes (see recent
iew by Fu and Waldman, 2017, Immunogenetics). Additionally, the study found little
dence of gene expression between Bd strains based on their virulence – which should generate
itional follow-up studies.
en its substantial scope and use of multiple methods, unusual for such studies, this paper
resents an important contribution to our nascent understanding of immunogenetic responses
d, but some methodological issues need to be addressed and clarified. Some elements of the
erimental design are not optimal, yet do not necessarily invalidate the results.
unspecified number of wood frog egg masses were collected from the southern part of its
ge and shipped to California. These were all presumed to be Bd-naïve. Bullfrog tadpoles were
ected in California from two localities, and an unknown numbers of clutches. These tadpoles
e superficially inspected to select only individuals with normal mouthparts, then assumed to
Bd-naïve, but visual inspection is not a reliable indicator of chytridiomycosis. The tadpoles
d for many months in an environment where they could have contacted Bd. Perhaps some
cleared the pathogen. Tadpoles were found with mouthparts infected with Bd, and
sumably some positive tadpoles were collected and kept in the same bucket/mesocosm as the
ative ones used in the experiments (why were the same mesocosms used for bullfrogs as had
n used for wood frogs?).
e Reviewer is correct in stating that wood frogs were raised from egg masses, whereas
erican bullfrogs were collected as tadpoles and kept for rearing following visual
pection of mouthparts. However, it is not the case that we simply assumed these
ividuals to be Bd-naïve. Rather, all individuals of both species that were included in our
eriment were first screened for Bd and confirmed to be Bd-negative. This is now
rified in our manuscript as a result of a comment from Reviewer 1.
dpoles of both species were kept in the same mesocosms (though never co-housed,
erican bullfrogs being introduced only after wood frogs were removed) due to logistical
straints. As indicated in our responses to Reviewer 1, we prioritized having indoor
socosms, and this limited the total number of mesocosms we could maintain. Given that
od frogs were reared from egg masses and raised in newly established mesocosms, it was
likely that they would have any potential history of Bd infection than wild caught
erican bullfrog tadpoles. Furthermore, we found no indication of disease in the wood
g tadpoles housed in the mesocosms or in recently metamorphosed wood frogs.
erefore, we judged any risk of Bd exposure for American bullfrogs that were put into
socosms formerly containing wood frogs to be minimal to nonexistent.
ally, the Reviewer is correct that it is possible despite our visual inspection of American
lfrog mouthparts and subsequent qPCR screening that some individuals may have had
or Bd infections that were cleared at the time of our diagnostic assays. However, we
ieve we approached this issue with diligence and attempted to verify Bd status as best as
sible. In addition, all of our study design decisions were motivated by the desire to have
tamorphic wood frogs and American bullfrogs of approximately the same age (i.e.,
essitating capture of American bullfrogs as wild tadpoles since time spent rearing egg
sses would’ve been prohibitive).
ld-collected and laboratory-reared subjects can differ substantially because of environmental
cts, some of which may be long-lasting. For example, aside from genetic variation, gene
ression can be influenced by skin microbes which differ substantially between field-collected
laboratory reared individuals and may play a role in resistance to Bd. Moreover, adaptive
mune function may develop differently depending on early exposure to environmental factors.
properly analyse and interpret the results, more details on the numbers of wood frog clutches
ed and how they were divided among mesocosms is needed. Whatever data are available on
sourced bullfrogs also is needed. Then, at what age/size were subjects inoculated with Bd?
e can infer from the results that experiments were run on subjects shortly after metamorphosis
specific details on these protocols are needed. Amphibian immune responses change
stically through ontogeny with limited adaptive immune responses in larvae, metamorphs
hly vulnerable to infection, and then full immune competence only slowly developing after
amorphosis. Thus these details are critical to properly interpreting the results.
r wood frog study animals were derived from five egg masses. However, egg mass
liation data do not exist for our wood frogs since egg masses were haphazardly
tributed among three holding buckets before then being haphazardly distributed across
six mesocosms. However, we have no reason to believe this protocol would induce
blematic variation into our experiment. First, wood frog egg masses were all collected at
ngle site. While there can certainly be population variability within amphibian species
Bd response, all of our egg masses represent a single population. Furthermore, even if
re was some variation in Bd response among our wood frog egg masses, this variation
uld be expected to be distributed randomly across our treatment groups given that
erimental treatment assignment was random. Information on American bullfrog
rces is as given in the manuscript (i.e., the collection localities), and egg mass affiliation
ld not be determined for these study animals as they were captured as tadpoles.
en natural variation in time-to-metamorphosis among individuals, age/size at exposure
o varied somewhat within and across host species. The vast majority of wood frogs
tamorphosed during the last week of April 2014. American bullfrogs had a longer
iod of metamorphosis, with some emerging from mesocosms from June through August
4. Experimental Bd exposures were conducted in mid-October 2014. Thus, wood frogs
re ~5.5 months post-metamorphosis and American bullfrogs were ~1.5<U+F02D>4.5 months post-
tamorphosis at the time of Bd exposures. This information is now reported in the
nuscript. Frog sizes near the time of exposure are given in figure 2 (i.e., body mass data
ected at the pre-exposure time point, which was 3 days before exposure).
e Reviewer is certainly correct that immune function can vary across ontogeny, but, if
thing, the variation in species’ ages within our experiment should bolster rather than
t doubt on our findings. Since immune function may correlate positively with age, wood
gs in our study should have been even more capable of fighting Bd infection than
lfrogs since bullfrogs were younger. However, our disease data show that older wood
gs were actually more susceptible than slightly younger bullfrogs, suggesting there are
e inherent species-level differences in susceptibility to Bd.
ferential infection procedures for the two species further make comparisons more difficult,
appear rather arbitrary. One might argue that if bullfrogs were considerably larger than wood
gs, as the data suggest, appropriate Bd inoculation doses should have been even higher.
wever, given the experimental outcomes, this probably is not important.
oosing appropriate exposure doses for the two study species was difficult. Had we
sen to expose both study species using the exact same exposure protocols, we would
ract criticism suggesting that American bullfrogs should have been exposed to higher
spore doses given the size disparity between the two species. Thus, we thought it
ferable to attempt to adjust exposure procedures based on relative size. While choosing
appropriate doses was not straightforward, it was certainly not arbitrary. We judged
t the most relevant “size” metric affecting an amphibian’s propensity to establish a Bd
ection would be its total skin surface area. Mass alone would be insufficient to judge
ropriate exposure doses, and snout-urostyle length (SUL) does not scale linearly with
n surface area. Thus, we calculated surface area for 124 wood frogs and 106 American
lfrogs using the (admittedly very rough) approximation that amphibian body shape is
ic (skin surface area = 6 * SUL^2). These calculations indicated that, within our study
mals, mean approximate surface area of American bullfrogs was about three times
ater than mean approximate surface area of wood frogs. Thus, we exposed American
lfrogs to three times the amount of Bd used for wood frog exposures. Our rationale for
exposure scaling is now addressed in our manuscript.
cific comments:
e 131: Feeding regimen seems insufficient for new metamorphs, which would cause
itional stress to subjects
ere was no indication that the feeding regime was stressful to the study animals, and our
ding protocols were approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. As
wn in figure 2, control animals of both host species gained mass over the course of the
dy, and they generally presented with healthy body condition. In addition, survival
oss control groups of both species was uniformly high, suggesting no problems with
ic animal husbandry. However, if indeed stress did result from our particular feeding
ditions, then this should not greatly affect our experimental inferences given that
ding regimes were consistent across treatment groups within species. It is also possible
use of “biweekly” to describe the feeding frequency led to some confusion; we have
w clarified in text that our feeding was “twice weekly” to avoid the potential
erpretation of “biweekly” as meaning every other week.
es 157-160: Data from previously inoculated subjects should be analysed, or at least
ualised, separately from other data on presumed naïve subjects.
ese data were indeed analyzed separately because we were interested in how previously
osed individuals might differ from naïve subjects, as the Reviewer rightly emphasizes.
erefore, wood frogs previously exposed to Section Line Bd were treated as an
ependent treatment group in all analyses and are also visualized separately.
es 218-220: Statistical inferences cannot be drawn based on non-overlap of confidence limits.
agree that non-overlap of confidence limits on two groups is not a statistically rigorous
thod of judging significance. However, we would clarify that here we are not comparing
groups, but rather comparing an estimated interval on one parameter with a fixed
ue (i.e., comparing to zero). Comparisons of intervals with respect to fixed values is
remely common, and often used to indicate whether or not a particular parameter
ably falls on the positive or negative side of zero, as we have done here to establish
ether the body mass of frogs at various time points is reliably different from baseline
an body mass established at the beginning of the experiment.
es 377-379: What is your explanation for how the subject was re-infected? Possibly this
ects inaccuracies in PCR detection of infection, which a few recent papers have documented.
absolutely agree that this result likely reflects variability in qPCR Bd detection results.
example, Shin et al. 2014 (PLoS ONE) found variation in Bd detection depending upon
ection method and over time within individuals. Their data suggest that Bd assays can
e false negatives, especially at low infection intensities, and this is likely the case with the
ividual frog in question. Because of the potential variability in testing, it can be
portant to consider summary statistics within robust samples, as we do here,
marizing infection prevalence and load within treatment groups. To further address
specific issue, we now include a reference to Shin et al. 2014 in the text at the place
icated by the Reviewer.
es 381-382: Range of infection loads would be more relevant here.
agree that communicating variability in infection loads is important. However, this
ormation is cumbersome to present in text given that range of infection load will differ
ending upon species, treatment group, and time point. Thus, to address this comment
a related one by Reviewer 1, we now present minimum and maximum infection loads
all treatment groups over time in figure 4.
es 395 - : Although I think this is a good approach, too many significant digits are given for
infection quantifications.
histology infection scores (and subsequent analyses, data summary, and visualization)
e been modified to account for the proper precision in our original field-by-field
tology infection quantifications (i.e., all are now presented as rounded to the nearest
ole number).
es 540-541: Costs of immune defence previously have been considered with regard to the
host interaction in amphibian systems, so references might be added.
have added two citations specifically referring to the costs of defense in the amphibian-
system in the text.
es 575 - : As discussed above, there are many life-history differences between the two
cies that might account for their differential susceptibilities to Bd, including their population
ories and habitat preferences. One must also consider that wood frogs vary in life-history
racters across their range, and may show different responses in more northern areas. Recent
dies on cane toads in Australia suggest that invasive species, such as bullfrogs in California,
ht experience rapid selection for life-history traits that promote their spread. So similar to
iation in wood frogs, we might expect that introduced populations in rapidly expanding
ges differ in important traits from those in their historical range. I thus recommend further
cussion of how the different resistance strategies might play out in an ecological context.
ile ultimate understanding of amphibian defenses in an ecological context is desirable,
do not view this as the primary focus of our work. Rather, we are explicitly attempting
educe ecological variation by using an experimental approach with standardized
ring conditions, housing, and controlled exposure protocols. This framework allows us
make stronger inferences about inherent species-level differences in Bd response. Of
rse, a large suite of traits may vary across a species’ range, but we are unclear how
cisely the Reviewer expects immune traits specifically to vary across our study species’
ges. The cane toad case study the Reviewer mentions is an example where selection acts
traits (leg morphology, dispersal behavior) that are directly related to the species’
cess in its invasive range. In contrast, the potential relationship between American
lfrog Bd response and its success in the invasive range is less clear cut. Based on
ilable evidence, American bullfrogs from diverse populations appear to be broadly
istant to Bd infection, and thus it seems unlikely that this seemingly general Bd response
nly associated with introduced populations. In sum, our goal was to study in-depth the
ticular disease responses of two host species in an experimental context where
tinctions between species would hopefully be most apparent. Of course, disease
comes in the wild are going to be affected by a range of factors that are not
orporated here, including intraspecific variation in host species and environmental
iation. We feel discussion of these factors is beyond the scope of this study.

ociate Editor Comments to Author:
manuscript has been re-assessed by both original reviewers, which provided very thorough
constructive comments for the improvement of the manuscript in their original reports. For
revised version, both reviewers expressed a justifiable frustration about the lack of rigor in
ms of addressing the original concerns. While the authors spent considerable time replying to
cific comments, this has not necessarily translated into matching modifications and
rovements of the manuscript. Before this manuscript can be considered for publication, the
hors will have to rigorously address all comments by the reviewers. In addition, I would like
ighlight that this is a very voluminous paper both in terms of it text length and the number of
res. I would encourage the authors to shorten the paper wherever possible and make careful
isions about what elements to show in the main manuscript and the online supplement (also
reviewer comments).
ring this round of revision, we have attempted to thoroughly address all Reviewer
cerns in the manuscript. For Reviewer 1, this involved a number of specific changes to
prove the clarity of our presentation. To respond to many of Reviewer 2’s comments, we
e added a paragraph early in the discussion section that directly addresses issues they
sed. Find our specific responses to Reviewer comments below in bold.

mments to the Author(s)
ile I appreciate the authors’ lengthy responses to the referees’ generally favourable
ments, I am not convinced that sufficient revisions have been made to fully address the
cerns.
many sections, the manuscript appears virtually identical to the third chapter of the first
hor’s Ph.D. thesis. More extensive editing and revision, as suggested by the referees, would
rove the paper. Update references might be added, for example to studies putatively
ntifying immunogenetic bases of Bd resistance, since these appear highly relevant to the
dy’s conclusions. Where do the two study species lie along the continuum of immunogenetic
erences demonstrated between Bd-resistant and susceptible species?
have now cited a paper previously recommended by the Reviewer (Fu and Waldman
7; Immunogenetics) in our introduction and discussion and have expanded material
cing our gene expression results in the context of previous research. We believe that a
ge proportion of the immunogenetic studies on Bd (i.e., Rosenblum et al. 2009,
senblum et al. 2012, Ellison et al. 2014, Ellison et al. 2015, Poorten and Rosenblum 2016,
well as various studies on MHC selection) are now represented in our manuscript.
hough the study reports valuable data, the experimental design suffers from lack of rigour and
ited sampling. These limitations restrict the extent to which the results can be generalised.
reover, the authors’ responses to earlier comments invoke arguments that are dependent on
ested assumptions. These should be identified and addressed.
disagree that our sampling is limited in terms of number of animals given that our
eriment involved 188 individuals, 87 of which were incorporated into the RNA
uencing portion of the study. Perhaps the Reviewer was referring to limited sampling in
ms of population-level variation within species. We now address possible undersampled
ulation-level variation in the second paragraph of the discussion. We hope this
itional material makes plain for readers the potential limitations of our study and the
umptions on which it relies.
example, screening subjects for infection and finding them to test Bd-negative does not
blish that they are naïve to the pathogen. The theme of the paper is the description of
erences in adaptive immunity between species. Certainly, we might expect infected animals
lear the pathogen if their immune responses are effective. Likewise, I do not understand how
authors can assume that re-used mesocosms are pathogen-free because subjects previously
red in them showed no clinical signs of disease.
e Reviewer is correct that, even though we took precautions to ensure animals were Bd-
ve as best as we were able, we cannot guarantee that all study animals (particularly
erican bullfrogs) were Bd-naïve prior to experimentation. We now very directly address
problem in our discussion section while also reiterating our attempts to mitigate this
e (i.e., visual screening of American bullfrog tadpoles for chytridiomycosis in the wild
qPCR screening of all animals for Bd prior to experimentation).
clarify the Reviewer’s latter point, we do not assume mesocosms re-used for American
lfrogs were pathogen-free simply because wood frogs exiting the mesocosms showed no
ical signs of disease but also because those same wood frogs tested Bd-negative prior to
erimentation and were raised from egg masses, where Bd infection is not known to
ur. In conjunction with the negative preliminary Bd screening results of American
lfrogs later emerging from the same mesocosms, it seems a reasonable assumption that
mesocosms were indeed Bd-free rearing environments.
wood frog masses were collected from one single site. Possible variation in response among
ches would give some handle on genetic variation in immune response. However, as larvae
e distributed haphazardly among treatments, that analysis becomes impossible. Even in the
ence of potential biases that this may have unintentionally been introduced, care must be
rcised in interpreting the results. Strictly speaking, conclusions can be drawn about responses
he population from which the egg masses were collected, but not necessarily extrapolated to
er populations and certainly not to the entire species. These species span vast geographic
ges across which other studies reveal substantial variation in numerous characters.
he second paragraph of the discussion section, we now explicitly acknowledge that some
portant characters, including those related to Bd response, may vary among populations
hin amphibian species. Therefore, our results may at least partially reflect population-
cific traits and not the entirety of phenotypic variation within our two study species.
dies on Bd loads in bullfrogs reveal substantial variation, as the authors are certainly aware,
m their discussion in a previous paper. Studies of invasive populations of this species outside
rth America reveal even higher Bd loads. To simply disregard populations with high Bd loads
berrant and discard these data as outliers would be a mistake in my view. The conclusions of
study rest on the assumption that one species, the bullfrog, is resistant to Bd and the other,
woodfrog, is susceptible to the pathogen. But if that is true, why are bullfrog populations
lining while woodfrog populations remain stable in many localities within their natural range
ere they are sympatric? I am unclear why consideration of such points is considered beyond
scope of the study.
e Reviewer makes a number of interrelated but distinct claims here. First, the Reviewer
gests that American bullfrogs have substantial variation in Bd load, citing a previous
er of ours (which we assume is Eskew et al. 2015). In fact, what we concluded in that
dy was that “our data still suggest relatively low infection intensities overall, providing
ther support for the observation that low Bd loads seem to be typical of American
lfrogs” (Eskew et al. 2015). Of course, there is some degree of variation in Bd load
erved among American bullfrog studies, coming as they do from disparate regions and
logical communities. However, the majority of the work we are familiar with suggests
ical American bullfrog Bd loads are well below the rough rule of 10,000 Bd zoospore
ivalents that has been suggested as a lethal Bd infection (Kinney et al. 2011). For
mple, in addressing this comment, we reviewed three additional American bullfrog-Bd
dies not cited in our manuscript (from both the native and invasive range of the species),
of which showed minimal to moderate (< 1,000 zoospore equivalent) Bd loads (Bai et al.
0, Ghirardi et al. 2017, Richards-Hrdlicka et al. 2013). Secondly, however, the Reviewer
orrect that some work suggests American bullfrogs (or at least some populations) may
act be susceptible to chytridiomycosis (Gervasi et al. 2013). We now directly address the
sibility that American bullfrogs are not strictly Bd-resistant in the second paragraph of
discussion. Finally, while it is true that some accounts do mention American bullfrog
lines in their native range (Lannoo 2005, Amphibian Declines), neither disease generally
chytridiomycosis specifically is invoked as a major causal factor. Indeed, we are
rently unaware of any work linking American bullfrog declines in their native range
h chytridiomycosis, and the Reviewer has not specified the research to which they are
erring. Thus, we do not discuss the hypothesis that American bullfrogs may be declining
heir native range due to chytridiomycosis.

did not intend IACUC approval of our procedures to be the sole, or even major,
tification for our feeding protocols. Rather, we would emphasize the fact that control
mals of both species grew significantly over the course of the experiment on the diet they
re provided. Along with the high survival of both species in control treatments, there is
reason to believe animal husbandry was deficient in any way.
ummary, the experiments for the two species were set up using very different protocols,

lyses are presented in this paper, “stronger inferences about inherent species-level differences
d response” would require a more appropriate experimental design. The impressive results
orted in this paper must be interpreted within the context of the known natural history of these
cies and generally accepted principles of statistical inference.
ile we feel that most differences in study protocol between the two species were either
essities resulting from logistical challenges (i.e., gathering American bullfrogs as
poles since they have an extended larval period) or were justified to create appropriate
osure conditions (i.e., different Bd exposure doses to result in equivalent relative
osures for the two species that differed in size), we have now added a section to our
cussion that highlights potential caveats for readers to keep in mind while interpreting
experimental results.

Lines 396-401. Given that Bd replication from zoospore through sporangium to new
spores takes 4-5 days, are you certain that the bullfrogs were actually infected? The histology
res shown in Figure 5 suggest they were not infected. Please comment in the results and
cussion.
e Reviewer is correct that these results could be taken to indicate that many American
lfrogs in the study did not develop infection after Bd exposure. Indeed, our qPCR
ults largely suggest the same given that maximum observed prevalence of SL Bd-
osed American bullfrogs was 50%, as already stated in the manuscript. To fully address
Reviewer’s comment, we have added a paragraph to our histology results section
cussing testing results where qPCR indicated infection but histology did not. In addition,
have taken care in our discussion to state that, “American bullfrogs, even those exposed
he especially virulent SL Bd, had rapid infection clearance or avoided infection entirely
did not develop disease” (emphasis added here).
In Fig. 6, the bullfrog host-specific contigs all seem to cluster with the controls. This
her suggest that bullfrogs were not infected. Given that there were very few differentially
ressed contigs shown in Fig. 7, this suggests the bullfrogs were not infected whereas the
od frogs were impacted by disease.
addition to the changes made to address the Reviewer’s previous comment, we have
dified a portion of our discussion to read: “In contrast to wood frogs, American
lfrogs avoided chytridiomycosis without major changes in gene expression. The highly
ilar gene expression profiles of control and Bd-exposed American bullfrogs (figures 6, 7,
), in conjunction with qPCR and histology results that showed generally low Bd loads or
ence of infection, demonstrate that this species responds rapidly and effectively to limit
invasion with minimal disruption of normal physiology. These results all suggest
erican bullfrogs use constitutively active defenses to combat Bd.”
would note that even if fewer American bullfrogs became infected than qPCR data
gests, our gene expression analyses should still have captured American bullfrog
ponses to Bd exposure. Indeed, that is a major reason for specifically referring to
atments as Bd exposures since clearly all animals did not become infected following Bd
llenge.
