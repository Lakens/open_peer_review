The paper describes a selection strategy for spreading information by specifying a set
of top large-degree vertices.The main idea is to exploit the
significant diffusion of the top large-degree vertices at the beginning of spreading.
The approach seems to be novel and very interesting. I suggest to accept this paper after minor

The authors describe the a selection strategy for spreading information called SIIV, which
consists in properly detecting a set of top-degree vertices as the Initial Informed Vertices.
The paper is well written and the overall organization is good. However, is not completely
proof-checked (you need to correct several typos in it) and there are some problems in tables 2
3
and 3 (e.g., the specification of RIIV and SIIV). In addition, the figures are not clear since you
shouldn't choose colors referring to lines, but, e.g., different line styles.
The paper is a good ad a "guideline paper" in describing the topic of information spreading in
networks, but it is not particularly clear to me the contribution you provided and the novelty of
the paper. Despite the Information Spreading Model that you propose is quite reasonable, the
experiments you design are not useful. In fact, e.g., it is obvious that a proper choice of initial
Informed Vertices performs better than a random one, and this is proved by the fact that, after a
transient, both strategies reach the same performance. Moreover, it is not clear how you choose
the "specific" IIV.

Comment # 4:
The paper is a good ad a "guideline paper" in describing the topic
of information spreading in networks, but it is not particularly clear to
me the contribution you provided and the novelty of the paper. Despite
the Information Spreading Model that you propose is quite reasonable,
the experiments you design are not useful. In fact, e.g., it is obvious
that a proper choice of initial Informed Vertices performs better than a
random one, and this is proved by the fact that, after a transient, both
strategies reach the same performance.
Response:
We agree that a proper choice of initial informed vertices performs
better than a random one, and our experimental results have proved this
point. However, it is also a good question that how to select the initial
spreaders. Actually, many metrics and methods are proposed for
identifying the initial spreaders, but for the short-term spreading with
limited time, the identified method must be of low complexity and low
power consumption. In this paper, we select the degree centrality as the
metric to measure the influence of initial spreaders, because of the low
complexity for identifying the large-degree vertices and the strong
diffusion of large-degree vertices. We propose a selection strategy for
improving spreading efficiency which is suitable to be applied to the
short-term spreading.
Moreover, if there no limitation of the spreading time, it is
obviously that all spreading can reach the same performance. However,
2
in the short-term spreading, the spreading time is limited, the essential
question is that how many people can receive the information during a
limited time. And in this paper, we terminate experiments until the
spreading is convergent because that we want to record the completely
experimental process. In real situations, the spreading cannot be
convergent because of the limited spreading time. For the short-term
spreading, it is important to improve the spreading efficiency at the
beginning of the spreading or during a short limited time.
Comment # 5:
Moreover, it is not clear how you choose the "specific" IIV.
Response:
We select the initial informed spreader according to the degree
centrality of vertices. The specific procedure is that: we first sort all
vertices according to the degree centrality on descending order. Then
we select a set of top large-degree vertices as the initial informed
vertices. This method is of low computational complexity, and the
degree centrality can measure the strong diffusion of vertices. The
degree centrality is suitable to be employed in the short-term spreading.
In the real emergency training, it is easy to find the large-degree
persons in a community, they are always the leaders, managers, or
organizers.
The authors are grateful to the anonymous second reviewer for helpful
