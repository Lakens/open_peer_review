This paper reports Synthesis, DNA Binding Constant, DNA sensor, Azo-guanidine . The authors
observe some attractive interaction between new azo guanidine and DNA. I recommend it to be
published after minor revision.
Can authors can evaluate the effect of interference amino acid , metal ion anion, and protein
Can authors estimate the recovery

1. The numbering of the experimental compounds in the abstract is unclear and should reflect the
more concise listing used in the Results and Discussion – UA1, UA6 and UA7.
2. Reference(s) to the mutagenic properties of SYBER Green in relation to Ethidium Bromide are
required in the introduction section, as is elaboration of relation the hypothesis stated.
3. In the experimental methods section, presentation of the analysis and characterisation of the
synthesised compounds would be improved by graphical comparison or summary.
4. Acros Organics, supplier of the sodium salt degraded DNA should be capitalised.
Some spelling errors are present – such as absance for absence used twice.
5. Suggest more contrasting colours are used to differentiate between UA1 + 0M DNA and UA1 +
80µM DNA in Figure 9.
6. The paper would benefit from a review of the grammar.
7. The conclusions require expansion and clarification.

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper reports Synthesis, DNA Binding Constant, DNA sensor, Azo-guanidine . The
authors observe some attractive interaction between new azo guanidine and DNA. I
recommend it to be published after minor revision.
Can authors can evaluate the effect of interference amino acid, metal ion anion, and
protein?
It is already in pipeline, we are working on the interference of proteins, metal ions
and anions in this regard, but at the moment we do not have results to include in
the current manuscript. And from this review we get the idea of amino acids
interference. In future communications we will investigate and report the protein
interaction studies along with other needed investigations.
Can authors estimate the recovery?
Yes, the major application of these staining agents is to detect DNA in the used
ethanol as mentioned in conclusion. But at the moment we don’t have quantified
recovery results to publish we need repetition of some experiments, so we will
include them in future communications.
The abstract should include the detection limit (LOD) of DNA
The LOD has been included in the abstract as suggested and incorporated using
Track Change mode of MS word.
Looking forward for a positive response.
