This article reported DCB as an effective solvent to prepare epoxy/graphene nanocomposites and
compared its dispersion effectiveness with DMF and ethanol. The article is conducted with
appropriate amount of experimental work and is meaningful in the nanocomposites field. In
general, this work is interesting and provides information for the scientists who are involved in
graphene-polymer nanocomposites. I would recommend the acceptance of this paper after some
minor corrections.
(1). Abstract demonstrated the phenomenon that DCB is better than DMF and ethanol to prepare
epoxy/graphene nanocomposites, but the mechanism should be explained clearly. In addition,
some experimental results can also be reported in the abstract.
(2). Figure 3 shows graphene-DCB dispersion is more stable than other dispersions, however, the
samples haven’t been noted in the caption.
(3). I suggest the authors add some experimental data in Part 4.2.
(4). In 4.3, the authors mention “the first weight loss was attributed to…the second weight loss
shows…”, is there any reference for this?
(5). In 4.4, the authors mentioned uniformly dispersed graphene has increased the Tg, relevant
references should be cited.
(6). It would be fruitful if the authors could give more explanation of the mechanism of the re-
aggregation and dispersion phenomenon.

In this article Wei et al. have submitted article as “Dichlorobenzene: an Effective Solvent for
Epoxy/Graphene Nanocomposites Preparation” in “Royal Society Open Science” is interesting
and can be accepted after minor revision. Here, some genuine suggestions and relevant
comments are raised as point wise for revision.
1. Re-write the Introduction section using some recent and relevant references. Some
references are suggested here as Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 58, 976-1006, 2016;

2. Figure 1 and 2 should be in the result and discussion section.
3. Figure 1 (SEM image) clearly shows the thick graphitic layers and it does not looks like
graphene nanoplatelet. Use some more clear SEM images.
4. The schematic Figure 2 does not shows clear view for the preparation of nanocomposites.
Make it more clear
5. Use the concentration of samples in Ethanol, DMF and DCB in captions of Fig 3.
6. It has been mentioned that TGA was done in Nitrogen atmosphere. It would be good to
measure the TGA in oxygen atmosphere because in Oxygen atmosphene graphene shows more
clear decomposition at different temperature range.
7. Use some higher magnification of Figure 7 for clear view. All SEM images (A-D) does
not shows more changes in morphologies.

This article reported DCB as an effective solvent to prepare epoxy/graphene nanocomposites
and compared its dispersion effectiveness with DMF and ethanol. The article is conducted
with appropriate amount of experimental work and is meaningful in the nanocomposites field.
In general, this work is interesting and provides information for the scientists who are involved
in graphene-polymer nanocomposites. I would recommend the acceptance of this paper after
some minor corrections.
(1). Abstract demonstrated the phenomenon that DCB is better than DMF and ethanol to
prepare epoxy/graphene nanocomposites, but the mechanism should be explained clearly. In
addition, some experimental results can also be reported in the abstract.
(2). Figure 3 shows graphene-DCB dispersion is more stable than other dispersions, however,
the samples haven’t been noted in the caption.
(3). I suggest the authors add some experimental data in Part 4.2.
(4). In 4.3, the authors mention “the first weight loss was attributed to…the second weight

(5). In 4.4, the authors mentioned uniformly dispersed graphene has increased the Tg, relevant

(6). It would be fruitful if the authors could give more explanation of the mechanism of the
re-aggregation and dispersion phenomenon.
Reply to Reviewer 1:
We would like to thank the reviewer for his/her valuable comments. According to the reviewer’s
comments, we have made the following corrections:
1. Abstract has now been rewritten. The reason why DCB produced better dispersion has been
introduced briefly. Some experimental data has been reported as well.
2. The samples have now been noted in the caption.
3. Some data with concrete values has been added.
4 & 5. Thank the reviewer for pointing this out, to prove our conclusions, some relevant references
(i.e. 54 and 55) have now been added in the manuscript.
6. To explain the mechanism for the graphene dispersion, we have added the following texts in the
“Conclusion” part:
Solvents are responsible to provide a low viscous medium, which is an ideal environment for graphene
to disperse. While dispersing, lower viscosities are responsible for promoting the de-bundling of
graphene sheets. This results in the triggering of van der Waals force on graphene surfaces in lower
proximity with each other, thus leading to dispersion.
We would also like to inform our reviewers that we have made some other minor corrections
according to other reviewer’s comments.
We hope that we have addressed all the comments of the reviewer. Once again, thank the
reviewer for his/her work and the valuable comments.

Reply to Reviewer 2:
We are grateful to the reviewer’s comments and would like to thank the reviewer for providing this
valuable feedback. To address the reviewer’s comments, we have made the following changes in our
manuscript:
1. The references have now been updated. Some newly published works have been cited. We would
like to thank the reviewer for providing a good list of reference that we are now using in the
amendment.
2. We have now re-positioned our figure 1 in results and discussion section as suggested by the
reviewer. To address this query and query number 4, we have now removed the controversial figure
2 for the sake of clarity for our audience.
3. Figure 1 is showing stacked multiple layers of agglomerated graphene as a bulk structural material
received from the supplier. Since the paper is about quantifying or comparing the effective of DCB with
DMF and ethanol, and the dispersing of graphene, we strongly believe that it is very necessary to show
the original raw state of as received graphene powder. Figure 1, shows the true reflection of the
challenge we had in this study.
5. Concentration has now been added as suggested by our reviewer.
6. The reason we went for nitrogen was to avoid open burning/ oxidation of resin. It is also adopted
by some other researchers [Ref54, Ref55] to use nitrogen to analyze the thermal decomposition
behavior of these nanocomposites. We could do oxygen study, however, we concern the polymer resin
might burn abruptly in oxygen [Liu, et al. Rsc Adv. 2014;4(36): 18652-18659].
7. We have now incorporated zoomed in box images to address the suggestion made by the reviewer.
The morphology of the agglomerates are now more clear in the amended pictures.
We sincerely believe that the valuable comments will enhance the quality of this paper. We would like
to thank once again our reviewers for their constructive feedbacks!
We would also like to inform our reviewers that we have made some other minor corrections in the
manuscript according to other reviewer’s comments.
