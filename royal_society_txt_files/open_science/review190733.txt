The authors present data of genetic variation which allow to test different models of socio-genetic
interactions involving sex-biased migration, lineage-focused founder effects, and heritable social
dominance. The subject is interesting and the data sound.
Here are a few minor comments:
a) I always find weird that population geneticists keep using 'heterozygosity' for haploid loci.
b) the color coding in fig 2A (ie from 0 to 600 for matrilocal is not a density and the number
should be explain in the figure legend, this applies to subsequent figures
c) p7 delta should be explained line 48 in addition to table 1. An explanation of the value chosen
(0.06) is welcomed, a reference would be even better.
d) First ocurence of PE page 10, it would be nice to define.
e) Fig 6: I would like a discussion about the significance of the difference of 0.3 and 0.32 in the
Timor founder model (and 0.51 and 0.53 in Slatkin's exact test)

To the Authors:
In “Sex-linked genetic diversity originates from persistent sociocultural processes at
microgeographic scales” Chung, Jacobs and colleagues analyse mtDNA (540bp) and Y
chromosome (12 STRs + haplotype informative SNPs) for ~1,100 individuals from two
Indonesian islands characterised by opposite societal systems.
In doing so, they observe a marked opposite skewness in the observed heterozygosity (H) in
matrilocal and patrilocal populations and used different simulation models to identify the best
model explaining the observed heterozygosity. Testing the combination of i) post-marital
movements, ii) social dominance and iii) founder-ideology patterns the authors found that a
founder model with dominance can approximate the observed H pattern in the patrilocal Sumba,
3
while the same model with No dominance provides a better fit for the matrilocal Timor, although
there is a limited power for the latter population.
The work is well conceived and written, and the methods are rigorous, although some
clarifications and additional figures summarising the simulated model could help to raise the
interest of the anthropologists' community. Overall, I would recommend the publication of the
manuscript after some modifications (see comments to the author).
Here are more specific comments:
P2. Introduction: The introductory paragraph is too concise, and do not adequately summarise
what is the actual state of the art in using genetics to characterise the impact of social strategies.
Please consider to expand it.
P2, L8 : This sentence seems truncated, please consider to rephrase it.
P2, L12-14: The few works mentioned in this sentence should be cited.
P2, L50. The term Heterozygosity usually refers to an individual rather than a population metric.
Given that the work is expected to be of interest to the anthropologists’ community, I would
consider adding a brief explanation. For the same reason, it would be very useful to include a
figure summarising the simulated models.

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
5
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript. Make sure it is clear in your data accessibility statement how the data
can be accessed;
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article
so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Please note that Royal Society Open Science charge article processing charges for all new
submissions that are accepted for publication. Charges will also apply to papers transferred to
Royal Society Open Science from other Royal Society Publishing journals, as well as papers
submitted as part of our collaboration with the Royal Society of Chemistry

eply to Reviewers
e thank the editor and reviewers for reading our manuscript, and for their careful and
oughtful comments. We have made a number of changes to the manuscript to directly address
e points they raise. These focus on two main areas. First, general improvements in readability,
mphasizing points specifically noted by the reviewers. And second, clarifying questions about
e form of the models. We believe that these changes address the points that the reviewers
ised, and we are grateful for their help in making this work stronger.

he authors present data of genetic variation which allow to test different models of socio-
enetic interactions involving sex-biased migration, lineage-focused founder effects, and
eritable social dominance. The subject is interesting and the data sound.
ere are a few minor comments:
) I always find weird that population geneticists keep using 'heterozygosity' for haploid loci.
lthough commonly used, we agree that ‘heterozygosity’ can be a confusing term in the context
f haploid loci, especially for readers outside population genetics. To make the text more
ccessible, we now use the term ‘haplotype diversity’ in the text and figures instead.
) the color coding in fig 2A (ie from 0 to 600 for matrilocal is not a density and the number
hould be explain in the figure legend, this applies to subsequent figures.
his is a good point. We now clarify in the figure legends what the contours mean. In short,
ontour lines are estimated based on 104 data points simulated under the relevant model. The
ata points are distributed within a 100 x 100 uniform grid. The probability value for the
ontour line at a given location (x, y), after being divided by the simulation size (104), thus gives
e probability of a data point being found within the grid (x–0.0025, y–0.0025, x+0.0025,
+0.0025).
) p7 delta should be explained line 48 in addition to table 1. An explanation of the value chosen
.06) is welcomed, a reference would be even better.
he meaning of d – the fraction of the population that has a selective advantage over the
ondominant population – is now given in the text, in addition to Table 1. We also provide a
ference explaining the simulated value of 0.06.
) First occurrence of PE page 10, it would be nice to define.
es! We thank the reviewer for noting this omission. The variable PE is now defined at first use
the text.
) Fig 6: I would like a discussion about the significance of the difference of 0.3 and 0.32 in the
imor founder model (and 0.51 and 0.53 in Slatkin’s exact test)
e agree. We now explicitly discuss these differences (0.3 vs 0.32, and 0.51 vs 0.53), and
mphasize that they are not significant. Note that this was our original interpretation; we are
mply now making this point clearer in the text.
