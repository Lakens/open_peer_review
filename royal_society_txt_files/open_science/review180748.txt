The manuscript ‘Public questions spur the discovery of new bacterial species able to degrade
lignin in industrial waste’ presents a new source of bacteria and, potentially enzymes, that may
be involved in lignocellulose degradation. I think this work is interesting from an ecological and
evolutive point of view. However, it is very basic from the microbial point of view and in the
lignin depolymerization field. The work is well written but there are many statements that would
need to be toned down, modified, or eliminated regarding the discovery of enzymes or the
novelty of the work. The secretome results also need to be more critically discussed. During the
last years, there has been a growing number of manuscripts on the field of bacterial lignin
degradation that would need to be reviewed to present a more realistic discussion.
Specifics:
- The introduction is lacking information on what it is known regarding lignin depolymerization
3
by bacteria. Please, include a paragraph about that. Below some key publications on this topic
that contain a good source of references.

- Page 5-line 7: what is exactly ‘Biochoice lignin’? Is that a soluble or insoluble lignin stream?
- Page 5-line 6: Did the authors try higher black liquor concentrations with the bacteria selected?
- Considering that the paper is mostly focused in black liquor, a detailed composition of this
substrate should be given. For instance, many black liquor streams contain carboxylic acids (i.e.
acetate, glycolic acid, etc) and monomeric aromatic compounds (i.e. guaiacol, p-coumaric acid,
ferulic acid, vanillic acid, etc) that can be utilized by bacteria as only carbon source. If this is the
case, authors may be finding aromatic-catabolic bacteria and not lignin-degrading bacteria. Please
present a table with the composition of the black liquor.
- Page 6, line 11. ‘Turbid’ is not a very precise way to present bacterial growth. If possible, present
the values corresponding to optical density measurements (i.e. optical density at 600 nm).
- Page 6-line 45. It is very interesting (and not typical) to find bacteria that are able to grow at a
such large range of pHs (4 to 10). Was the pH verified in the plates? It is worth considering that
the buffering capacity of phosphate buffer (in M9) is between 6 and 8. Thus, different buffers
might be preferred for pHs out of that range.
- Page 7-line 10. ‘… lignin as sole carbon source’. How was the lignin sterilized? Some
sterilization processes (i.e autoclave) can release aromatic compounds from high molecular
weight lignin and be utilized as carbon source by the bacteria. If this is the case, again, we cannot
talk about lignin degradation only.
- Page 7-line 31- ‘ involved in the breakdown of black liquor’. To conclude this, the
characterization of the black liquor (before and after the bacterial treatment) is needed. Again,
were there aromatic compounds or other carbon sources apart from high molecular weight
lignin? What was the lignin content? What was the size distribution of the lignin? If none of these
parameters are given, sentences like this are recommended to be removed along the manuscript.
- Page 7, line 41, Table 4. There is a high number of cytoplasmic proteins in the secretome. Could
that be just an effect of bacterial lysis and not secretion? Please comment on this.
- Page 8- line 27-line 31… It is highly recommended to further review the literature in this topic.
There is a considerable number of bacteria able to utilize black liquors, kraft lignin, and the
aromatic compounds on it. In fact, some of those bacteria are able to break down the lignin,
which is not demonstrated in this work (see references above).
- Page 8, line 37. ‘ lignin as the sole carbon source’. Characterization is needed.
- Page 9-line 40. ‘Brown rot fungi are known to hydrolyze lignin…’. Brown rot fungi do not break
down lignin, they only modify it to attack the cellulose, that is why the residue after the fungal
attack is brown (compared to white-rot fungi, which really degrade lignin). Please read book
chapter from Barry Goodell entitled ‘Brown-Rot Fungal Degradation of Wood: Our Evolving
View’.
- Page 9-line 37. Authors present manganese superoxide dismutase as a potential enzyme
involved in lignin depolymerization. Looking at Table 4, that enzyme was not even found in the
lignin media. Discuss this critically. In addition, manganese superoxide dismutase is presented as
a cytoplasmic protein. Lignin depolymerization is an extracellular process. Please comment on
this as well.
- Table 4. Additional comments: there is another superoxide dismutase that appears in all media
(also in lignin, 3835). This result suggests that this enzyme may not be involved in lignin break
4
down and only be related with detoxification. Authors also include in Figure 1 a Glutathione-S-
transferase (3813) as potential enzyme in the lignin degradation pathway. However, this enzyme
was not found either in the secretomic study in the lignin media (only in cellulose media).
Typically, differential proteomic analyses give insights of the enzymes that are differentially
expressed and needed to metabolize various substrates. However, these results are not conclusive
and not critically discussed. Please consider all these comments to re-distribute the enzymes in
the table (different sections) and be more critical in the discussion.
-Page 10-line 29- ‘Here we have identified a novel source of bacterial enzymes involved in lignin
degradation’. This statement is not correct until it is demonstrated (i.e. lignin characterization or
enzymes assays).
-Page 10-line 35. Microbiologists are routinely looking into new sources of microorganisms and
enzymes in different environments through bioprospecting. This is a very typical tool that this
community uses and specifies in their papers. Saying that scientists ‘focus on screening private
culture collections’ is not right. Please tone down. See references above and the one below.
-Page 10- line 40-41. The search of enzymes in insects or crustaceans has been reported years ago.
Here just an example on a crustacean, the gribble, studied because of the habitat that colonized
and in which powerful cellulases were discovered. Paper: King et al, 2010. Molecular insight into

All submissions, other than those with a single author,
must include an Authors’ Contributions section which
individually lists the specific contribution of each
author. The list of Authors should meet all of the
following criteria; 1) substantial contributions to
conception and design, or acquisition of data, or
analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the
article or revising it critically for important intellectual
content; and 3) final approval of the version to be
published.

manuscript; CD carried out the statistical analyses;
EF collected field data; GH conceived of the study,
designed the study, coordinated the study and helped
draft the manuscript. All authors gave final approval
for publication.

Please acknowledge anyone who contributed to the
study but did not meet the authorship criteria.
• Funding statement
Please list the source of funding for each author.
All changes made refer to those requested by reviewer 2 unless otherwise
noted.
1. Text size in Figure 3 was increased as suggested by reviewer 1.
2. Many of the statements about degradation of lignin and black liquor
were clarified.
a. The title was changed to better reflect the findings. We aim to
follow this work with enzymatic characterization as an
indicator of lignin degradation. Page 1 lines 1-2 clarify that we
have found bacteria able to grow with lignin as a sole carbon
source rather than indicating that the bacteria have been
shown to degrade lignin.
b. Growth on lignin which suggests lignin degradation was
highlighted in the abstract on page 1 line 30
c. Breakdown of black liquor was determined by growth as the
sole carbon source and not confirmed with chemical
characterization. Future research will use these techniques to
identify enzymes from C. lapagei and the other arthropod
isolates. Page 7 line 34
d. Biochoice lignin was autoclaved when added to water
separately from the M9 salts solution. It is possible that during
autoclaving lignin structure can be changed such that
aromatics are released. We have now noted this in the
discussion on page 9 lines 4-10. A reference for this
information was also added. Page 15 lines 8-10
e. Lignin degradation, lignin tolerance, and aromatic utilization
enzymes were identified in this work and this was clarified on
page 10 lines 4-5.
f. Statements about the number of new bacteria that can
degrade lignin and black liquor were further clarified since
chemical characterization was lacking. Page 8 lines 33
g. “Here we have identified a novel source of bacterial enzymes
involved in lignin degradation” was modified to read “…
involved in lignin bioconversion”. Page 11 lines 3-4.
3. The background was updated to include more recent information
about lignin degradation as suggested. Page 2 lines 32-41 and
references page 14 lines 5-21
4. Black liquor characterization was performed previously but details
were added and paper referenced. Changes made on page 4 lines 42-
43.
5. Laccase activity of C. lapagei was determined to better display lignin
degradation ability.
a. Methods for this assay were added on page 6 lines 17-18.
b. Results of this assay are presented on page 8 lines 20-23 and
in Figure 2.
c. The results were discussed on page 10 lines 5-9.
6. The descriptor “turbid” was removed from the description of
inoculum used for secretome analysis. Overnight cultures were
saturated and in stationary phase. The optical density of these
cultures was not measured. Changes to reflect this information were
made on page 6 lines 33-34.
7. A more detailed description of BioChoice Lignin and reference to the
structural characterization was added on page 7 lines 31-34. The
reference was added on page 16 lines 8-10.
8. Statements about the numbers of new species were toned down as
the reviewer correctly pointed out that new species are being
identified and published throughout the peer review process of this
article. Page 9 lines 10-12.
9. Updated references were provided for new work on lignin degrading
bacteria from termites. Page 9 line 17 and references page 16 lines
21-26.
10. Identification of proteins in the secretome is largely dependent on
centrifugation after growth. It is possible that bacterial lysis could
have occurred during growth such that this analysis also identified
some proteins produced in the cytosol. Of the enzymes identified
there were very few with secretion signals. It is also possible some of
these proteins are secreted but secretion signals were not identified
Page 10 lines 14-20 Supporting references can be found on page 17
lines 1-6.
11. Enzyme grouping in Table 4 were more critically discussed It is
possible that many of the enzymes identified when grown on
cellulose and hemicellulose are not directly involved in lignin
degradation but instead detoxification. Page 10 lines 29-35.
12. Brown rot fungi have been shown to be involved in lignin
depolymerization and not lignin degradation. This was further
clarified page 10 lines 39-40.
13. Language about previous attempts to find bacteria or enzymes
involved in this process was toned down and additional more recent
efforts were included. Page 11, lines 37-40
14. New information was also added about lignocellulose degrading
organisms that produce enzymes themselves rather than by relying
on their gut microbiota. Page 11 lines 43-45 and references page 18
lines 1-8
15. In text references were updated throughout the manuscript and well
as in the tables.
Changes not made
1. Figure 1 was not modified as suggested by reviewer 1 to ensure a
high resolution figure.
2. Higher amounts of black liquor were not tested due to pH of
camel cricket gut. 1% black liquor was pH 11.5, 5% black liquor
was pH 12 and 10% black liquor was pH 12.3 it did not seem likely
that bacteria isolated from insects could survive at more basic
pHs. Please note that previous work has isolated a bacterium
directly from black liquor with an optimal pH of 9. Generation
time of this bacterium at pH 12 was over 39 hours (Mathews et al.
2014).
3. The pH of the media for both Congo Red and M9 black liquor was
measured to determine range of pH in which these bacterial
isolates could grow. M9 was not the base for the Congo Red
media and therefore buffering capacity is within range. pH
measurements provided on page 5 lines 17-20.
4. Reviewer 2 commented that the statement on page 10 lines 29-32
about applied value of this information. However we believe that
growth on cellulose, xylan, and biochoice lignin still demonstrate
the value of C. lapegei in lignocellulose degradation and
depolymerization for applications in the bioenergy, wood and
pulping, textiles and chemical production industries.
Appendix B
Editors comments and changes
1. Acknowledgements were added
All changes made refer to those requested by reviewer 2 unless otherwise
noted.
1. Reference 15 was modified to indicate that the subject was black
liquor utilization and not kraft lignin. Page 2, line 38.
2. Page 9 line 13 was modified as suggested to read “utilize” alkaline
black liquor as the carbon source which contains lignin and sugars.
