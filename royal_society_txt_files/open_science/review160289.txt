This is an excellent manuscript and I enjoyed reading it. The nervous structures in Limnognathia
maerski are described in detail. Each part of the manuscript is absolutely appropriate, well
written and well documented. I appreciate very much that the authors are so careful to use "LIR"
when talking about immunoreactivity. I am close to accept the manuscript as it is, but found a
very few very minor things to correct. It is only the reference section that has not received the
same amount of care as the other parts of the manuscript.

The manuscript by Bekkouche and Worsaae is a comprehensive description of the nervous
system and ciliary structures of the micrognathozoan L. maerski by immunohistochemistry and
confocal microscopy. Micrognathozoans are rare animals, of extremely difficult collection, but
with a set of characters (e.g. phylogenetic position, minute size, reduced number of cells, yet
relatively complex morphology, ecological niche) that make them of great interest for the
zoological, ecological, and evolutionary community. This work is thus an important contribution
that significantly advances our knowledge of these animals. The work is sound and well written.
The results are balanced, and the authors clearly state those cases in which the data and
employed techniques were inconclusive. The discussion is scholarly, and it will definitely be a
reference for future studies on these animals and spiralians generally. The figures are beautifully
presented.
I only have a few minor comments/suggestions:
- Line 85: I suggest to change "early branching" by "sister group to the remaining" as the authors
were using in earlier lines.
- Line 104: overnight is doubled in the whole sentence (it's already written at the end of the
sentence in line 108)
- Line 176: “On each lateral side, he recovered…” I don't get who is this he referring to.
- Line 224: If the subpharyngeal ganglia is only visible with DAPI, what was the criterion to
discern nuclei belonging to the subpharyngeal ganglia from the other surrounding organs? Is it
inferred from previous morphological studies? If it is only based on nuclear staining, the authors
might want to be more cautious in the existance of this neural component (both in the results and
the discussion).
- The nephridia are somehow difficult to see in the figures. The only detailed image is Figure 3E.
If the dataset allows it, it would be good to provide more detailed views/projections (maybe as a
small supplementary figure?). I imagine that the confocal stack provides evidence of the complex
arrangement of the nephridia in these animals (e.g. the monociliated terminal cells), but the
reader does not get a fully picture of it from the panels presented.

think you will be able to meet this date please let me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.

When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) Included your supplementary files in a format you are happy with (no line numbers,
vancouver referencing, track changes removed etc) as these files will NOT be edited in
production
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look
forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get
in touch.
Kind regards,

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-160289)
Dear editors,
we are thankful for the reviews which improve the quality of the paper. We agreed on all minor
comments, mainly concerning typographical errors, and do not find necessary to detail them
point by points since they are straightforward changes from the very clear reviewers’ comments.
However, two comments from the reviewer 2 need a short explanation:
Reviewer comment: “-Line 224: If the subpharyngeal ganglia is only visible with DAPI, what was
the criterion to discern nuclei belonging to the subpharyngeal ganglia from the other surrounding
organs? Is it inferred from previous morphological studies? If it is only based on nuclear staining,
the authors might want to be more cautious in the existance of this neural component (both in the
results and the discussion).”

Answer: we developed further the reason of our conclusion with more details in the results, on
the corresponding paragraph (“Subpharyngeal ganglia”).
Reviewer comment: “The nephridia are somehow difficult to see in the figures. The only detailed
image is Figure 3E. If the dataset allows it, it would be good to provide more detailed
views/projections (maybe as a small supplementary figure?). I imagine that the confocal stack
provides evidence of the complex arrangement of the nephridia in these animals (e.g. the
monociliated terminal cells), but the reader does not get a fully picture of it from the panels
presented.”
Answer: we added two new panels to the figure two, with a close up of the protonephridial
ciliation and a schematic drawing
We hope that our modifications answer the reviewer’s comment.
Sincerely,
Nicolas Bekkouche and Katrine Worsaae.
