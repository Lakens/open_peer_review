This is a significant contribution that adds to our limited understanding of the biomechanical
properties of baleen. Since much of the work on this topic has been initiated by the author and
colleagues the present research is a logical extension of this research. Methods are clearly
described. The malleability of baleen and its role in feeding and interactions with oil—have
conservation implications. Perhaps most importantly, this study establishes a framework for
further comparative studies of the properties and biomechanical function of baleen in different
species.

Very interesting read!
Detailed comments:
Page 2, line 39: forms like a sandwich.. This comparison does not really help my imagination.. But
it can be that it is because I am an european and our sandwiches look quite different
3
Page 3, line 10: I wonder why Simon et al 2009 Proc. R. Soc. B is not cited here? They show the
same flow rate during feeding on a live bowhead whale which I think is a very convincing result.
Page 5, line 25: Add A as Fig 1A (as done later in methods) and consider swopping the panels A
and B in figure 1. Since contact angles of water droplets are introduced before the strain testing, it
feels locigal that panel A should be about water droplets.
Page 6, line 8: Add B as Fig. 1B
Page 7, line 51: Change B to A
Page 9, line 8: Add B as Fig. 1B
Page 12, line 20: Consider omitting ”perhaps”. I am sure that the native artists did know.
Page 13, line 32: Add B as Fig. 1B. At least in my version the puddle of water is very hard to see,
almost impossible. I wonder if the picture quality could be enhanced?
Page 15, lines 3-10: I am totally convinced of the extraordinary effect of hydration on the
flexibility of baleen plates but I find it hard to believe that baleen plate resembles rubber. Maybe
soft plastic (but not as soft as plastic bag). This comes from listening to baleen rattles recorded on
feeding bowhead whales and the sound has a hard plastic, broom kind of quality. It certainly
doesn´t bring rubber to mind. In connection with this, I also wonder what the authors really
mean when they state that ”our overall understanding of normal baleen function in likely to be
equally deficient”? Is our overall understaing of baleen morphology so poor, and consequently, is
our understanding of baleen function so poor? Are the authors suggesting a new function for
baleen plates? I agree with the authors that the results in this ms show how important it is to use
hydrated baleen plates in morphological studies, but I am not convinced that this will change the
ultimate view on baleen function. In addition, there have been several studies on kinematics,
feeding behaviour and biomechanics, essentially baleen´s filtration action, of live baleen whales
conducted with the help of, especially D-tags (Goldbogen et al (blue, fin and humpbacks), Simon
et al (Bowhead, humpback ect.). These studies surely shed light on the issue.
Figure:
Figure 1. Change panel A to B. AS mentioned in my comments, the water exuded during the
strength test is not clearly visible.
Figure 2. I dont find this figure very important. The results could be stated as values in the results

I would never have expected a paper on such an arguably arcane topic in morphology to be so
interesting, but I found this study fascinating. Furthermore, despite the technical nature of the
subject, it is written with commendable clarity, and is thus accessible to the general reader. I have
no comments beyond those minor issues raised by the referees, other than to say that the
significance of this work is likely understated given how radically it changes our perception of
baleen.

ponse to comments by Associate Editor:
Thank you for your kind words. We agree that this work is significant because it greatly alters the
people should think about baleen.
ponse to Reviewer #1
We appreciate the support. We agree that this study has major implications for morphology and
servation, and that it establishes a framework for future work on baleen biomechanics (which we are
undertaking).
ponse to Reviewer #2
We are glad you enjoyed the paper and we appreciate your compliments.
1. Page 2, line 39: forms like a sandwich… We have fixed this sentence to make clear that we are
referring to a layered structure with different strata of keratin (though we agree you are
probably thinking of an open-faced sandwich, more common in Europe than the United States).
2. Page 3, line 10: Adding Simon et al. 2009 here is a great suggestion and we have gladly included
a new citation for this paper.
3. Page 5, line 25: We are happy to comply with this suggestion to swap the panels (A & B) in
Figure 1 and to refer to these parts of Figure 1 separately in the text. We have made this change
in the text as well as in Figure 1 itself and in the caption for Figure 1.
4. In addition, all references to Figure 1 now specify panel A or B (which were switched from their
original order). As reviewer #2 noted, such references are found in multiple locations
throughout the paper.
5. Page 12, line 20: We have deleted the word “perhaps” because like the reviewer we agree that
native artists recognized the importance of hydration baleen before bending it to create
artworks or implements.
6. Page 13, line 32: We have changed the panel of Figure 1 that shows the puddle of exuded water,
partly by enhancing the photo quality but also by zooming in more on the point where the
compressive piston contacts the baleen and pushes the water out.
7. Page 15, lines 3-10. The reviewer’s point about rubber being a poor analogue for hydrated
baleen being is well taken, so we have deleted the reference to rubber.
8. Reviewer #2 properly raises a good point that our statement about “our overall understanding
of normal baleen function is likely to be equally deficient” is not worded well and seems like an
exaggeration. We agree with the reviewer’s point that our basic understanding of baleen’s
general function as a filtering apparatus is unlikely to be changed. However, we do feel strongly
that given our new understanding of the extreme flexibility and ductility of hydrated baleen, this
will force a reappraisal of the precise physical mechanism of how baleen filtration works on a
small-scale level (e.g, whether by dead-end or cross-flow filtration, and whether particles are
captured via inertial impaction or direct interception, etc.). We have clarified and refined this
statement in this section.
9. Finally, we agree with Reviewer #2 that field studies about baleen function and kinematics
should be cited here (with regard to the statement above), so we have added some new
citations here.
10. As mentioned above, we have changed the panels in Figure 1 and enlarged the photo of the
water being exuded so that it is easier to see.
11. With regard to Figure 2, we have stated these numerical results in the Results section of the text
but we still feel that this figure has value and should be kept because it clearly shows,
graphically, the extreme difference in contact angle between wet and dry baleen.
