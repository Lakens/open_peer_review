This manuscript described the synthesis of porous Mo2C/C composite by using luffa sponge as
both structure template and carbon source in molten salts media. The biological carbon source
was utilized to prepare the carbide, which is interesting. The manuscript was well established
and the presentation was clear. Therefore, I would recommend its publication after the following
revisions:
1. The textural character of luffa sponge seems to be important and unique for the Mo2C/C
composite, which has been described in the manuscript. However, it's not emphasized in the
conclusion. It would be better if it can be included in the conclusions.
2. The authors prepared samples with molar ratio of C/Mo = 6:1, why use this ratio? And what is
the reason?
3. The equation (1) and (2) should not use the equal signs.
4. The number format of reference 1 in the manuscript was not correct. In addition, there is a
word “area” missing at the end of the introduction section.

In this short paper, the authors report on the synthesis of porous Mo2C/C composites by using
luffa sponge as a template. The results are interesting. However, there are some issues that the
authors need to address before I can recommend its publication.
1. Can the authors elucidate a bit more about the advantages of their synthesis method of
Mo2C/C composites over the reported ones in the introduction?
2. In addition to XRD, can the authors use other method (e.g., XPS) to verify the composition of
the synthesis product?

3. Can the authors comment on how the SBET can be improved?
4. It would be great if at least one practical application of the verified synthesis product can be
demonstrated.
5. I cannot access the authors’ data from the link they provided in the Data Accessibility section.

Dear Editor:
Thank you for your letter dated 24-Apr-2019. This manuscript entitled “Facile
synthesis of porous Mo2C/C composites by using luffa sponge-derived carbon
template in molten salt media” (RSOS-190547) has been carefully revised according
to the reviewer’s comments, and the response is also attached. A point-by-point
response as follows.
Responses to Reviewer 1:
1. The textural character of luffa sponge seems to be important and unique for the
Mo2C/C composite, which has been described in the manuscript. However, it's
not emphasized in the conclusion. It would be better if it can be included in the
conclusions.
Response: The textural character of luffa sponge has been emphasized and added to
the conclusion in the revised manuscript.
2. The authors prepared samples with molar ratio of C/Mo = 6:1, why use this ratio?
And what is the reason?
Response: According to the equation (1) and (2), MoO3 reacts with carbon to create
CO and CO2. If just CO or just CO2 is created, the molar ratio of C/Mo is 2:1 and
3.5:1, respectively, so we choose the molar ratio of C/Mo = 6:1 to make sure that the
products is carbon surplus. In addition, the presence of carbon improves the electrical
conductivity of the product.
3. The equation (1) and (2) should not use the equal signs.
Response: The equal signs have been replaced by arrow symbols in the revised
manuscript.
4. The number format of reference 1 in the manuscript was not correct. In addition,
there is a word “area” missing at the end of the introduction section.
Response: The incorrect number format and missing word have been verified in the
revised manuscript.
Responses to Reviewer 2:
1. Can the authors elucidate a bit more about the advantages of their synthesis
method of Mo2C/C composites over the reported ones in the introduction?
Response: Compare with the reported in the introduction, the advantages of synthesis
method of Mo2C/C composites in this work as follows:
(1) We use carbonized luffa sponge as a carbon template, it is low cost and
environmental friendliness.
(2) The Mo2C grain can uniformly fabricated on the carbon template by molten salt
method, and the Mo2C/C composites can retained the shape and structure of the
original template.
(3) The preparing method is simple, highly efficient and can extend to other carbon
materials for Mo2C/C composites.
2. In addition to XRD, can the authors use other method (e.g., XPS) to verify the
composition of the synthesis product?
Response: The XPS spectrums of the product has been added to the revised
manuscript (Fig. 2).
3. Can the authors comment on how the SBET can be improved?
Response: In this composite, Mo2C coating is significant factors to influence the
SBET, by controlling the Mo2C grain morphology and grain size in different process
parameters, it may be possible to improve the SBET of the product.
4. It would be great if at least one practical application of the verified synthesis
product can be demonstrated.
Response: In this paper, we mainly discussed the preparation method and
characterization of the product, about exploring the application performance of the
product will be the focus of our next work.
5. I cannot access the authors’ data from the link they provided in the Data
Accessibility section.
Response: The link in the Data Accessibility section is available, we have confirmed
it.
Finally, thanks again to the editors and reviewers for giving me the opportunity
to publish my paper in Royal Society Open Science.
