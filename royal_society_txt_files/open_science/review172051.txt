The title and abstract are misleading in terms of the work actually done de novo by the authors in
this paper. The experiments contained herein are extremely limited (1 cartilage sample, no
hydrogels) and the primary emphasis of the paper seems to be more on the modeling than the
experiments.
Throughout the derivation in section 2 it is impossible to tell what the authors are just rehashing
from previous literature and where they are making novel contributions or deviating from what
has been previously published.
Poroelasticity is mentioned but never actually invoked via its constitutive laws in the modeling.
Comments about poroelasticity are therefore handwaving and speculative.
Throughout, the poor use of MS Word equation editor makes some equations unreadable with
critical parameters in tiny font sizes.
Section 4.3 is very strange, where the hydrogel data appear as if from nowhere but methods are
included as though the experiments were done for this work.
Overall the paper is poorly organized, the experimental data are limited, and the original
contributions of the authors are unclear.

The authors study the Slip-based interface failure models to determine the pre-sliding behavior of
the contact probe on cartilage and polyacrylamide hydrogels. It is concluded that the resistance to
slip failure increases as the poroelasticity driven adhesion increases. However, the authors should
also discuss the effect of interactions between the tip and the loosely –dangling polymer chains in
the hydrogel that occurs within the contact zone. The adhesion hysteresis i.e. a different work of
adhesion between approach and retract curves have been observed for polyacrylamide gels and
other organic systems - due to the formation of additional bonds while the indenter stays in
contact with the material during indentation. Thus, with the increase in dwell time, one would
expect the change in adhesion hysteresis and the local viscoelasticity of the material at the contact
zone which can impact the resistance to slip at the onset of sliding. This effect needs discussion in
the paper.

they are perfectly readable to me in the PDF, as are the XLSX files in evince and LibreOffice
respectively. Please take care to ensure interoperability of your file formats when uploading (PDF
is usually safest for text, and as R1 suggests, .csv is fine for unformatted data tables).

The idea that friction increases with dwell time is already well-established, so this isn't new. It
has been known for some time and while it hadn't been studied directly for many years (probably
because the response was anticipated), the recent Reale and Dunn paper you cite did exactly that
for hydrogels. As you acknowledge, they attribute high startup friction to suction at the backside
of the contact; the conventional wisdom is that positive pressure at the leading edge dominates
the high friction. Your results appear consistent with their model that friction is essentially
related to the amount of hydrated tissue the probe interacts with throughout the startup process.
As dwell time increases the entire contact becomes less hydrated; as the probe moves forward, it
encounters more and more hydrated tissue. This is the thrust of the paper and the agreement or
disagreement with this sister paper needs to a major part of the discussion, especially to avoid the
appearance that the omission was intentional.
It is also worth pointing out that the Burris group published a recent review article on hydration
effects of cartilage friction where they demonstrate that high friction in your experiment at
startup is due to hydration (or lack of hydration) rather than classical stiction from a startup
condition. They indented to wring out water in the contact zone before sliding. They show that
friction across the entire friction loop, not just at startup, is simply proportional to the amount of
water exudation in the vicinity of the indentation event. I think this is pretty compelling evidence
in favor of the Reale and Dunn model. I would like to see how all this fits with your model and
thinking somewhere in the discussion.
Why are you 'estimating' the modulus of cartilage? This is an indentation measurement from
which the modulus should be obtained directly. Again, the fact that you didn't use your own
measurement looks very suspicious. Furthermore, 33.2 MPa is awfully specific given that its
about 100x greater than all the modulus measurements I have seen for reasonably relaxed
conditions of similar tissues. I would like to see this measured or at least made realistic.
Finally, at the onset of slip, you assume a radial propagation of the crack tip toward the center.
This is clearly distinct from the Reale and Dunn thought-model, which I think is far more likely
than the thought-model you describe. I think this discrepency needs to be discussed. Do your
results provide any insight into which is more likely? How does a false assumption affect the
analysis?
In general, this is a nice study that does contribute meaningfully to the literature and I would like
to see it published after these issues have been addressed.

Han and Eriten perform a combination of adhesion and friction tests to investigate the pre-sliding
(static) friction response of cartilage. The main finding is that the work of adhesion increases with
relaxation time. In addition, some details on the mechanism are given (critical adhered area,
propagation rate of annular slip) based on a model that combines Savkoors' and the Naive
Modeling approach.
In my opinion, the experiments are well performed and the model seems reasonable. Therefore, I
can support publication after the following points have been addressed:
1. Fig. 1 would be much more helpful, if in (a) a force vs. displacement plot would be shown and
in (b) a 3-D plot with force vs. normal displacement vs. lateral displacement.
2. Some of the variables are not well chosen or not well explained. In 3.4.2 "a" is the contact radius
and in 3.4.3. "c/a" a normalized radius. Please clarify. In addition, it would be very helpful, if the
equations from chapter 3 are referenced in the results section. This would make it much easier to
understand the different introduced radii.
3. p.13: "However, as the relaxation time increased, the model significantly deviated in the
extended unloading portion." What is the cause for this deviation? I think a significant deviation
should at least be briefly discussed.
4. The discussion is very lengthy. In addition, it is very difficult to find out what really has been
shown. Many sentences are speculations, they start with "indicates", "suggest", "could mean",.... It
would be very helpful to introduce subheadings and then to clearly state in the first sentences
what has been shown and then write the interpretation / speculation.
5. Conclusion: What is "systematically captured", does this mean "fit"?

6. p.2: "Recent studies reported....", then there are three citations from 2008, 2009, 2011. I do not
consider this as "recent".

The authors would like to thank reviewers for the careful and constructive reviews. In accordance with their
comments, the following modifications were made.
Reviewer #1
1. The title and abstract are misleading in terms of the work actually done de novo by the authors in
this paper.
Reply 1:
We agree with the reviewer. The title and abstract were revised for clarification as below.
Title
“Effect of Relaxation-Dependent Adhesion on Pre-Sliding Response of Cartilage”
Abstract
“Possible links between adhesive properties and pre-sliding (static) friction response of cartilage are not
fully understood in the literature. The aims of this study are to investigate the relation between adhesion
and relaxation time in articular cartilage, and to investigate the effect of relaxation-dependent adhesion
on pre-sliding response of cartilage. Adhesion tests were performed to evaluate the work of adhesion of
cartilage at different relaxation times. Friction tests were conducted to identify the pre-sliding friction
response of cartilage at relaxation times corresponding to adhesion tests. The pre-sliding friction response
of cartilage was systematically linked to the work of adhesion and contact conditions by a slip-based failure
model. It was found that the work of adhesion increases with relaxation time. Also, the work of adhesion is
linearly correlated to the resistance to slip-based failure. In addition, as the work of adhesion increases,
the critical adhered area at the moment of failure increases, and the propagation rate of the annular slip
(crack) area toward its center increases. These findings offer mechanistic explanation of the pre-sliding
friction behavior and stick-slip response of soft hydrated interfaces such as articular cartilage and
hydrogels. Besides, the linear correlation between adhesion and threshold to slip-based failure enables
estimation of adhesive strength of such interfaces directly from pre-sliding friction response (e.g., shear
wave elastography).”
2. The experiments contained herein are extremely limited (1 cartilage sample, no hydrogels) and the
primary emphasis of the paper seems to be more on the modeling than the experiments.
Reply 2:
In response, we performed additional adhesion and pre-sliding friction tests at different relaxation times.
Three cartilage samples were harvested from three different joints, and five tests were performed on each
sample per condition. Consequently, the reported average and standard deviation were based on 15
measurement values. The additional tests did not change the previous findings. We believe that the
increased number of measurements is sufficient to explain the effect of relaxation-dependent adhesion on
pre-sliding friction response. Also, the current number is objectively comparable to other literature.
The primary goals of our paper were to confirm the dependence of cartilage’s adhesion on relaxation time
and investigate the effect of relaxation-dependent adhesion on its pre-sliding friction response based on a
1
mechanics-based model. As we mentioned in the previous manuscript, the data for hydrogels was from
other literature [1], and it was originally used to discuss applicability of the model to soft-hydrated materials
other than cartilage. However, based on the overall comments from the reviewers, we realize that including
the hydrogel portions can make the primary goals of the study vague. Therefore, we removed most of the
discussion on hydrogels from the manuscript. Also, the overall structure of the manuscript was reorganized
to efficiently deliver the mentioned aims and methods of this paper.
3. Throughout the derivation in section 2 it is impossible to tell what the authors are just rehashing
from previous literature and where they are making novel contributions or deviating from what has
been previously published.
Reply 3:
Since the model was complicated, we thought it would be better to go through the model step-by-step rather
than providing references. However, the long explanation seemed to cause more confusion. Therefore, we
only include core equations to apply the slip-based failure model to the experimentally measure results (see
section 3.4.2 – 3.4.5), and the detailed explanation of the model is given in the supplementary material. In
addition, we added a schematic diagram showing the application of the model to the experimental data as
shown below (Figure 3).

We agree with the reviewer that the origin of the model was not clear. Therefore, we clarified the origin of
the model by modifying the introduction section as shown below.
Introduction
“Pre-sliding friction response of cartilage can be systematically estimated by using a mechanics-based
model. As various studies on pre-sliding friction responses of materials have shown, model-based analysis
provides a better understanding of mechanisms [21,22]. In this study, we will employ a mechanics-based
model to link relaxation-driven adhesion to pre-sliding friction response of cartilage. The model we use is
a hybrid model previously applied to elastomers and gels. In particular, the stick to slip transitions in pre-
sliding response are modeled after Savkoor’s model, which was originally proposed and applied to
elastomers [23,24]. Unloading of the contact after slip-based failure is modeled after the “Naïve Modeling”
approach of Brochard-Wyart and de Gennes [25]. That model was originally employed to explain stick-
2
slip processes observed in soft materials. Savkoor’s model is useful to account for adhesive interactions
during pre-sliding response. The model proposed by Brochard-Wyart and de Gennes helps explain the
stable failure propagation over the contact and transitioning to fully sliding. Combination of those two
models is referred to as “slip-based failure model” in this paper.”
4. Poroelasticity is mentioned but never actually invoked via its constitutive laws in the modeling.
Comments about poroelasticity are therefore handwaving and speculative.
Reply 4:
The model introduced in this paper already takes the effect of adhesion on the slip-stick contrast into
account, and it was explained in the previous manuscript. The model is suitable to achieve the primary goal
of investigating the effect of relaxation-dependent adhesion on the pre-sliding friction response of cartilage.
As the reviewer pointed out, the model utilized cannot account for transient poroelastic effects during
presliding tests. However, poroelasticity-driven relaxation occurs at slower rates than our adhesion and
presliding tests, and thus would have negligible influence on the response measured. The discussion is
added to clarify that poroelastic relaxations are expected to influence the change in the adhesive strength
over contact dwelling times, but not during mechanical testing.
Introduction
“That model was originally employed to explain stick-slip processes observed in soft materials. Savkoor’s
model is useful to account for adhesive interactions during pre-sliding response.”
In the previous manuscript, poroelasticity was mentioned to explain the increase in work of adhesion of
cartilage with relaxation time. The effect of poroelasticity on the adhesion was provided based on a recent
study of hydrogels [1]; hydrogels and cartilage are known to show similar behaviors because they have
structural similarities in that their matrixes are surrounded by fluid. Note that the main focus of this study
was not to identify the origins of the adhesion of cartilage but to find the effect of adhesion on the pre-
sliding friction response. The investigation of the origins could be another valuable independent study, and
some suggestions for its future study were provided in the revised manuscript. Although the previous
manuscript addressed the comment, we admit that it was not efficiently delivered. In addition, the 2nd
reviewer suggested more discussion on possible causes of the adhesion. Therefore, the manuscript was
modified to address that comment. Representatives of the modifications are as follows:
Discussion
“The work of adhesion of cartilage, <U+03B3>, was found to be relaxation-dependent, and it was likely due to the
combination of poroelasticity-driven suction effect, the formation of adhesive bridges within the contact
area, and relaxation-driven geometric changes around the contact edges.”
“Since hydrogel and cartilage have structural similarities (fibrous solid matrix swollen by fluids), it is
expected that poroelasticity-driven suction contributes to the adhesion of cartilage.”
“A plausible reason for the slight difference might be the progressive formation of adhesive bridges
between the spherical indenter and cartilage constituents (e.g., collagen fibrils, hyaluronic acid, and
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)) as reported in [19], resulting in the increase in the real contact area.”
“Another possible mechanism linking adhesion and time-dependent response of cartilage is changes in the
shape of contact edges (crack) during relaxation (or creep). Maugis and Barquins…”
3
“Governing mechanisms of adhesion of cartilage are beyond the scope of our work, but a similar
dependence of adhesion of cartilage on relaxation time was successfully…”
“The origins of the adhesion could be clearly determined by carefully controlling loading/unloading rates
and using selectively modified samples (e.g., collagen digested, GAGs digested, and dehydrated cartilage)
and chemically-treated probes.”

Reply 5:
It seems to be a technical problem. We double-checked the equations, and they were readable. Also, the
editor and the 2nd reviewer did not have any problems with the readability. For the resubmission, we will
double-check the final version of the manuscript to avoid any further problems.
6. Section 4.3 is very strange, where the hydrogel data appear as if from nowhere but methods are
included as though the experiments were done for this work.
Reply 6:
The hydrogel data was from previous literature [1], and it was clearly mentioned in the previous manuscript
with a reference as shown below. The purpose of the hydrogel data was to provide more examples of the
model-based analysis.
“In this section, the predictions of the slip-based failure model are compared to recent experimental
observations on polyacrylamide hydrogels [2]. In those experiments, a borosilicate glass sphere of radius
1.7 mm...”
“The polyacrylamide hydrogels studied in [2] were made of 10% acrylamide monomer (AAm); 0.6 % N,N’-
methylenebis(acrylamide)…”
As discussed in previous comments, we admit that the hydrogel data is likely to make readers to
misunderstand the primary objectives of the study. Therefore, based on the reviewer’s comments, we
decided to remove the contents related to the hydrogel data (Note that the original findings remain
unchanged). The revised manuscript is more focused on the primary objectives: 1) To confirm the
dependence of adhesion on relaxation times, 2) To investigate the effect of relaxation-dependent adhesion
on the pre-sliding friction response, and 3) To perform a systematic estimation of the pre-sliding friction
response with the slip-based failure model.
7. Overall the paper is poorly organized, the experimental data are limited, and the original
contributions of the authors are unclear.
Reply 7:
We admit that the previous manuscript was poorly organized. Although the original contributions were
4
presented in the previous manuscript, the poor organization made them appear vague. Therefore, to reflect
the reviewer’s comment, we improved the manuscript by reorganizing sentences and paragraphs and
enhancing graphical explanations (Note that the original findings remain unchanged).
The concern on limited experimental data is addressed in Reply 2.
Reviewer #2
1. It is concluded that the resistance to slip failure increases as the poroelasticity driven adhesion
increases. However, the authors should also discuss the effect of interactions between the tip and the
loosely –dangling polymer chains in the hydrogel that occurs within the contact zone. The adhesion
hysteresis i.e. a different work of adhesion between approach and retract curves have been observed
for polyacrylamide gels and other organic systems - due to the formation of additional bonds while
the indenter stays in contact with the material during indentation. Thus, with the increase in dwell
time, one would expect the change in adhesion hysteresis and the local viscoelasticity of the material
at the contact zone which can impact the resistance to slip at the onset of sliding. This effect needs
discussion in the paper.
Reply:
We appreciate your recognition of our findings and also the valuable comment. We agree that the discussion
about the effect of additional bonds on work of adhesion should be included. We decided to remove the
discussion on the hydrogel data because it is likely to make readers to misunderstand the primary objectives
of the study (the original findings remain unchanged). Therefore, we did not include any further discussion
on the hydrogel. However, we reflected your comment on the interpretation of cartilage adhesion, which
was the primary goal. Consequently, we explained that the relaxation-dependent adhesion is likely from
the poroelasticity-driven suction effect, the adhesive bridges (bonds), and relaxation-driven geometric
changes around the contact edges. The modifications in the manuscript are as follows:
Discussion
“The work of adhesion of cartilage, <U+03B3>, was found to be relaxation-dependent, and it was likely due to the
combination of poroelasticity-driven suction effect, the formation of adhesive bridges within the contact
area, and relaxation-driven geometric changes around the contact edges. The correlation between the work
of adhesion and the relaxation time is consistent with the previous study on the interface between the
hydrogel-glass probes [20]. The study reported that the adhesion is due to the poroelasticity-driven suction
effect under the indentation probe, arising from the imbalance of osmatic pressure. Since hydrogel and
cartilage have structural similarities (fibrous solid matrix swollen by fluids), it is expected that
poroelasticity-driven suction contributes to the adhesion of cartilage. The osmatic pressure is closely
related to the degree of dehydration localized under the probe. The degree of localized dehydration can be
linked to the relaxation response. Following this, the work of adhesion was predicted by substituting the
normalized experimental relaxation curves in Eq. (2). Although the predicted adhesion showed a trend
similar to the measured adhesion (Eq. (1)), there was a slight difference between them. A plausible reason
for the slight difference might be the progressive formation of adhesive bridges between the spherical
indenter and cartilage constituents (e.g., collagen fibrils, hyaluronic acid, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs))
as reported in [19], resulting in the increase in the real contact area. Another possible mechanism linking
adhesion and time-dependent response of cartilage is changes in the shape of contact edges (crack) during
relaxation (or creep). Maugis and Barquins observed the change in the radius of an adhesive contact under
different constant unloadings, and showed that the radius changes with time and the rate of change in the
radius (crack speed) is also time-dependent [32], implying that the shape of contact edges (crack) is time-
dependent. Therefore, it is expected that the edges of cartilage contact change with a progressive relaxation.
5
The relaxation-induced geometric changes will have regularizing effect on the otherwise singular stresses
at the contact edges, and thus increase the apparent work of adhesion measurements. Using this argument,
a direct link between time-dependent constitutive response and work of adhesion can be constructed.
Governing mechanisms of adhesion of cartilage are beyond the scope of our work, but a similar dependence
of adhesion of cartilage on relaxation time was successfully found on multiple locations on multiple samples
(Nn=15). The origins of the adhesion could be clearly determined by carefully controlling
loading/unloading rates and using selectively modified samples (e.g., collagen digested, GAGs digested,
and dehydrated cartilage) and chemically-treated probes. Finally, the work of adhesion measured here was
compared with that calculated using a rigid punch solution (v=0.25 assumed) [35] and published results
[34]; they originally determined the adhesion force during shearing under zero normal load from the
intercept of a linear regression line for the friction versus normal load data [34]. The calculated value is
in the order of 0.1-1.6 J/m2, and it was consistent with our measurement results.”

1. The idea that friction increases with dwell time is already well-established, so this isn't
new. It has been known for some time and while it hadn't been studied directly for many
years (probably because the response was anticipated), the recent Reale and Dunn paper
you cite did exactly that for hydrogels. As you acknowledge, they attribute high startup
friction to suction at the backside of the contact; the conventional wisdom is that positive
pressure at the leading edge dominates the high friction. Your results appear consistent with
their model that friction is essentially related to the amount of hydrated tissue the probe
interacts with throughout the startup process. As dwell time increases the entire contact
becomes less hydrated; as the probe moves forward, it encounters more and more hydrated
tissue. This is the thrust of the paper and the agreement or disagreement with this sister
paper needs to a major part of the discussion, especially to avoid the appearance that the
omission was intentional.
Reply1: As the reviewer mentioned, the Reale and Dunn (RD) paper [1] attributed the high startup
friction of hydrogels to the suction effect. Their static friction model did not include the loading
portion and the onset of slip, and only included the unloading portion. A large deviation of the
model from the experimental result was observed (see Figure 1), which indicates a possibility that
the suction effect is not the only origin of high startup friction as we discussed in our paper (also,
another reviewer pointed out in the 1st review). They also mentioned the model underestimated
the measured limiting friction force [1]. They speculated that the underestimated limiting force
was because the periphery of contact with lower pressure regions was anticipated to slip first [1].
In addition, they did not perform the static friction tests at different relaxation times. Therefore,
their paper did not experimentally demonstrate the dependence of the high startup friction on the
relaxation time, and thus the verification of the model was limited. These motivated us to develop
the slip-based failure model, covering the loading portion, the onset of slip, and the unloading,
and perform pre-sliding (static) friction tests at different relaxation times. Our results
experimentally demonstrated that the startup friction of cartilage strongly depends on the
relaxation time. The slip-based failure model provided mechanistic explanation of the pre-sliding
friction behavior and stick-slip response of cartilage.
Although we agree that the detailed comparison between our model and the RD model is useful
discussion despite their clear differences, it would not be suitable for the objectives of the current
study (as suggested in the 1st revision): 1) to confirm the dependence of cartilage adhesion on
1
relaxation times, 2) to investigate the effect of relaxation-dependent adhesion on the pre-sliding
friction response, and 3) to perform mechanistic explanation of the pre-sliding friction response
of cartilage with the slip-based failure model. To clearly compare the two models, the
inconsistency in the sample and the coverage of the models should be resolved. Even though we
decreased the length of the manuscript compared to the previous one, another reviewer
commented that the discussion is still lengthy. In fact, the previous 1st manuscript included these
contents in addition to the current contents (see below). However, the massive contents made the
primary objectives of the study vague, and thus they were trimmed. Since the detailed comparison
between the two models must be in the unloading portion, it would fit a follow-up study which
we already suggested in the manuscript (see below). The follow-up study will be focused on
explaining the nonlinear behavior observed in the unloading portion.
Figure 1. Result of Reale and Dunn [1]. They mentioned that the intersection between the
loading and unloading curves roughly provided the limiting friction force for the onset of
slip. Their model for the unloading portion underestimated the limiting friction force by
about 20 %. They speculated the difference by mentioning “Because the sphere-on-flat
geometry in reality causes lower contact pressure near the periphery of contact, the lower
pressure regions are anticipated to slip first, consistent with this data.” [1].
In the conclusions section, we added the following sentence to motivate the future work:
“In addition, further work will include the improvement of the unstable partial slip model to
capture the nonlinear behavior observed in the late stage of the unloading portion.”
Nevertheless, as the review suggested as detailed comparison of our model with the RD
model/experiments, we would like to share a part of the results which were included in the 1st
manuscript here. The slip-based failure model used in the present study can reproduce the
common features of the experimentally observed friction response from the study of RD (Figure
2). Neither the Young’s modulus nor the Poisson’s ratio was reported in their paper. As
customarily done, near-incompressibility is assumed in hydrogels for the large water content; i.e.,
<U+0001D708>~0.5. Thus, the Poisson’s ratio is set to 0.5. In Table 1 [2], Young’s moduli of polyacrylamide
hydrogels made of similar monomer and crosslinker concentrations as in [1] are summarized. The
mean of the tabulated values is <U+0001D438> = 14.2 <U+0001D458><U+0001D443><U+0001D44E>, and thus, the shear modulus to be used in the slip-
<U+0001D438>
based failure model is taken as <U+0001D43A> = = 4.73 <U+0001D458><U+0001D443><U+0001D44E>. As a result, the slip-based failure model
2(1+<U+0001D708>)
reproduced their experimental results. With the proper selection of <U+0001D43A> = 9 <U+0001D458><U+0001D443><U+0001D44E>, the model can be
matched more accurately with the loading portion. It shows that the slip-based failure model can
2
provide an even better match to experiments than the thought model of RD. In any case, real
physics/mechanics of failure inception and softening (unloading) in shear response of cartilage
remain unresolved. We are currently working on it.

Then, the RD thought model was applied to our pre-sliding friction results at different relaxation
times. The RD model only covers the unloading regime of pre-sliding friction response, and it is
given in their paper as follows [1]:

<U+0001D439><U+0001D453> = ( )[ + (<U+0001D6FE><U+0001D451> - <U+0001D6FE>h ) (cos -1 <U+0001D44F> - v<U+0001D44F> 2 - <U+0001D44F> 4 )]
<U+0001D459> 2
where <U+0001D439><U+0001D453> is the friction force, a is the contact radius, <U+0001D459> is the characteristic length scale, <U+0001D6FE>h is the
surface energy (work of adhesion) of a hydrated interface, <U+0001D6FE><U+0001D451> is the surface energy (work of
adhesion) of a dehydrated interface, and b is x/2a (x is the lateral displacement). It can be

Since <U+0001D459> is the fitting parameter, <U+0001D707> can be simply written as follows:
<U+0001D439><U+0001D453> <U+0001D70B> <U+0001D6FE><U+0001D451> (3)
<U+0001D707>= = C [ + ( - 1) (cos -1 <U+0001D44F> - v<U+0001D44F> 2 - <U+0001D44F> 4 )]

where <U+0001D436> = is the effective fitting parameter.
<U+0001D459><U+0001D439><U+0001D45B>
The RD model (Eq. (3)) was first fitted to our experimental results given in Figure 3a by
determining C based on the steady state (kinetic) friction coefficient, as done in RD. The model
overestimated the peak friction coefficients (about 5 times) and the lateral displacement at the
steady sliding (Figure 3b). The experimental results showed that the coefficient of friction
converges after sliding about half of the contact diameter, while the model predicted that it
converges after sliding about the contact diameter (=2a).
Since the model extremely overestimated the coefficient of friction with the 1st fitting
procedure, it was fitted to the experimental data by selecting C based on the peak friction
coefficients. Although the model matched the peak friction coefficients owing to the proper
selection of C, it still overestimated the point where the coefficient of friction converges (after
sliding about the contact diameter).
In the core of this mismatch lies that the RD model does not account for the mechanics of
onset of slip or decohesion (unloading). Instead, the model assumes rigid traversing of a probe
over relaxed (dry) and unrelaxed (hydrated) parts of hydrogel, and simple areal mixing rules to
estimate average friction force. Although the slip-based failure model showed some deviations
from the experimental results of cartilage friction in the last stage of the unloading portion, it
successfully reproduced their common features: the loading portion, the onset of slip, and the
initial part of the unloading portion; possible reasons for the deviations in the late stage of the
unloading portion were discussed in the manuscript.
A brief comparison based on the application of the RD model to our experimental results
is included in the manuscript (page 20) and supplementary materials (page 10-12).

friction coefficients, respectively.
2. It is also worth pointing out that the Burris group published a recent review article on
hydration effects of cartilage friction where they demonstrate that high friction in your
experiment at startup is due to hydration (or lack of hydration) rather than classical stiction
from a startup condition. They indented to wring out water in the contact zone before sliding.
They show that friction across the entire friction loop, not just at startup, is simply
proportional to the amount of water exudation in the vicinity of the indentation event. I
think this is pretty compelling evidence in favor of the Reale and Dunn model. I would like
to see how all this fits with your model and thinking somewhere in the discussion.
Reply2:
We added the paper titled “A review of methods to study hydration effects on cartilage friction”
as a recent reference in the introduction section, which observed high startup friction response.
They observed the high friction at startup and attributed it to lack of hydration. Although the
suction effect due to lack of hydration is likely one of dominant factors for adhesion, further
investigation should be taken to determine origins of adhesion as we mentioned in the discussion
section (see below). Furthermore, the high friction of cartilage in the pre-sliding regime has been
observed for decades as we mentioned in the introduction section (see below). However, the
underlying mechanisms and mechanics of the pre-sliding response in cartilage were not addressed,
and therefore the current study was motivated.
Although the amount of water exudation explains the kinetic friction of cartilage across the entire
friction loop, the mismatch between the RD static friction model and experimental results provide
compelling evidence that the simple areal mixing rules cannot explain the pre-sliding (static)
5
friction response of cartilage (or soft materials). The comparison between the slip-based failure
model and the RD model suggested that the mechanics of onset of slip or decohesion (unloading)
needs to be considered. The detailed comparison was presented in Reply1.
In the discussion section
“The work of adhesion of cartilage, <U+0001D6FE>, was found to be relaxation-dependent, and it was likely
due to the combination of poroelasticity-driven suction effect, the formation of adhesive bridges
within the contact area, and relaxation-driven geometric changes around the contact edges.”
“Although the predicted adhesion showed a trend similar to the measured adhesion (Eq. (1)),
there was a slight difference between them. A plausible reason for the slight difference might be
the progressive formation of adhesive bridges between the spherical indenter and cartilage
constituents (e.g., collagen fibrils, hyaluronic acid, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)) as reported
in [11], resulting in the increase in the real contact area.”
In the introduction section
While tribological properties of cartilage in sliding (kinetic) friction regime have been extensively
studied, the pre-sliding (static) friction response of cartilage drew less attention. Although a few
studies reported that static friction coefficient of cartilage increases with an increase in contact
dwelling duration before sliding [13,18,19], underlying mechanisms and mechanics of pre-
sliding response were not addressed.
3. Why are you 'estimating' the modulus of cartilage? This is an indentation measurement
from which the modulus should be obtained directly. Again, the fact that you didn't use
your own measurement looks very suspicious. Furthermore, 33.2 MPa is awfully specific
given that its about 100x greater than all the modulus measurements I have seen for
reasonably relaxed conditions of similar tissues. I would like to see this measured or at least
made realistic.
Reply3:
Upon reviewer’s suggestion, we calculated the elastic modulus from the unloading portions
of the indentation curves at <U+0001D461><U+0001D45F><U+0001D452><U+0001D459><U+0001D44E><U+0001D465> = 200 <U+0001D460> (32.80 ± 6.29 MPa), and it matched the values
estimated from the pre-sliding friction tests at <U+0001D461><U+0001D45F><U+0001D452><U+0001D459><U+0001D44E><U+0001D465> = 200 <U+0001D460> (33.2 ± 11.58 MPa). We needed
to use the unloading portion of the indentation response and the Oliver-Pharr method [11] to gage
the elastic properties of dehydrated cartilage as <U+0001D461><U+0001D45F><U+0001D452><U+0001D459><U+0001D44E><U+0001D465> = 200 <U+0001D460> is sufficient long for nearly-full
relaxation of the tissue at this length scale. Poisson’s ratio, <U+03BD>, of 0.25 was assumed to be equally
compared with the previously reported value (33.2 ± 11.58 MPa), which had been converted
from the shear modulus at <U+0001D461><U+0001D45F><U+0001D452><U+0001D459><U+0001D44E><U+0001D465> = 200 <U+0001D460> by also assuming <U+03BD> = 0.25.
Furthermore, the elastic modulus (13.26 ± 1.51 MPa) was calculated from the loading
portions of the indentation curves by using the Hertz contact theory [12]; it can represent the
modulus of hydrated cartilage. <U+03BD> = 0.5 was assumed because volumetric change due to exudation
of fluid was not expected during the instantaneous loading [13]. The elastic modulus (13.26 ±
1.51 MPa) from the loading curves was similar to that (18.88 ± 10.22 MPa) from the pre-sliding
tests at <U+0001D461><U+0001D45F><U+0001D452><U+0001D459><U+0001D44E><U+0001D465> = 5 <U+0001D460>, converted from the shear modulus <U+0001D461><U+0001D45F><U+0001D452><U+0001D459><U+0001D44E><U+0001D465> = 5 <U+0001D460> by assuming <U+03BD> = 0.5. The
detail of the calculation was added in the supplementary materials (page 8-10), and the related
6
sentences were included in the manuscript (page 16 and 22).
The difference between the elastic moduli (32.80 ± 6.29 MPa versus 18.88 ± 10.22 MPa)
is due to the dehydration of the solid matrix as we explained in the manuscript with proper
references. The low modulus which the reviewer mentioned is most likely the equilibrium elastic
modulus rather than the effective elastic modulus [14].
4. Finally, at the onset of slip, you assume a radial propagation of the crack tip toward the
center. This is clearly distinct from the Reale and Dunn thought-model, which I think is far
more likely than the thought-model you describe. I think this discrepency needs to be
discussed. Do your results provide any insight into which is more likely? How does a false
assumption affect the analysis?
Reply4:
The RD thought-model does not include the transition from the loading regime to the onset of slip
(stick-slip moment) and from the onset of slip to the unloading regime (see Reply1) [1]; it was
only for the unloading regime. Their model simply related the friction force with the contact area
fraction remaining in the initial dehydrated region, and a significant difference between the model
and experiment result was observed (Figure 1).
The assumption of the radial propagation of the crack tip used in our study was made based
on previous studies [15–19]; most of them even observed the contact area with imaging
techniques. From those studies, the radial propagation of the crack tip is a reasonable
approximation, and limitations were already discussed in the current manuscript. The reviewer’s
comments encourage us to further investigate the unloading portion of the pre-sliding friction
response, and actual shape of the corresponding crack front; and their influence on the model
predictions.
Reviewer #4
1. Fig. 1 would be much more helpful, if in (a) a force vs. displacement plot would be shown
and in (b) a 3-D plot with force vs. normal displacement vs. lateral displacement.
Reply1:
The displacement profiles were plotted in Figure 1 because they were the controlled parameters.
It was explained in the method section and the caption. However, we edit the caption to clarify
further.
A force vs. displacement plot was already shown in Figure 4a. A force vs. lateral displacement is
overlapped with a coefficient of friction vs. lateral displacement as shown in Figure 5a.
2. Some of the variables are not well chosen or not well explained. In 3.4.2 "a" is the contact
radius and in 3.4.3. "c/a" a normalized radius. Please clarify. In addition, it would be very
helpful, if the equations from chapter 3 are referenced in the results section. This would
make it much easier to understand the different introduced radii.

Reply2:
We referred to Figure 1 and clarified different contact radii variables.
As suggested by the reviewer, the equations from Section 3 were referenced in the results section
by referring to Figure 3; Figure 3 shows the summary of the equations associated with the slip-
based failure model.
3. p.13: "However, as the relaxation time increased, the model significantly deviated in the
extended unloading portion." What is the cause for this deviation? I think a significant
deviation should at least be briefly discussed.
Reply3:
The significant deviation was already discussed in the discussion section (not the results section)
as follows:
In the discussion section
“…. with <U+0001D705> provided valuable insight into the extension rate of the slip area in the initial
unloading portions (<U+0001D6FF><U+0001D441> < 20), it failed to predict the extension behavior in the latter unloading
portions from relatively long relaxation times (Figure 5b). This failure suggests that higher stick-
slip contrast induces a nonlinear relationship between the relative tangential velocity of the
contacting interfaces and the extension rate of the annular slip area…..”
“…experimentally observed stick-slip transitions in PDMS-on-glass contacts [26,32]. Despite
their successful application of the linear scaling, our experiments show that more sophisticated
unloading models accounting for nonlinearities such as plowing, self-healing and collective
diffusion should be employed (see [45,46] for physical basis of those nonlinearities).”
4. The discussion is very lengthy. In addition, it is very difficult to find out what really has
been shown. Many sentences are speculations, they start with "indicates", "suggest", "could
mean",.... It would be very helpful to introduce subheadings and then to clearly state in the
first sentences what has been shown and then write the interpretation / speculation.
Reply4:
As suggested by the reviewer, subheadings were introduced in the discussion section and some
of the topic sentences were rewritten to clarify.
In the discussion section the following subheadings were added:
“5.1. Relaxation-Dependent Adhesion of Cartilage”
“5.2. Pre-Sliding Friction Response of Cartilage with Slip-Based Failure Model”
“5.3. Assumptions and Limitations of Slip-Based Failure Model”
In the discussion section, the following topic sentences were added:
“The stick-slip contrast and the normalized radius of the critical stick area at failure are relaxation-
dependent. The stable partial slip …”
8
“The decrease in the linear scaling parameter, <U+0001D705>, with relaxation time shows that the annular slip
area extends faster toward the center of the contact in the relaxed state.”
5. Conclusion: What is "systematically captured", does this mean "fit"?
Reply5:
To clarify the meaning, the sentence was modified.
6. p.2: "Recent studies reported....", then there are three citations from 2008, 2009, 2011. I
do not consider this as "recent".
Reply6: “recent” was changed into “previous”.
7. At several occasions "osmatic pressure" instead of "osmotic pressure" is written.
Reply7: Corrected.
