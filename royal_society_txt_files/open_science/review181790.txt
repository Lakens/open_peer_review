This research which is based on synthesising a composite nanoparticle including chemotherapy
agent - 5FU is interesting and worth considering for publication. However, there are some
important questions which needs to be answered before such consideration. And the paper is
poorly written it needs major re-writing especially discussion section.
The main question is about the fact that if we were to target 5FU as suggested by this paper then
its role to attack metastases will be removed. Can the authors address this point using references
please. Also I have listed some other questions and suggestions for improving the manuscript in
the attached file (Appendix A).

In this paper, the authors reported a promising novel multifunctional platform which displayed a
self-amplified effect that activated chemoradiotherapy co-enhancement. The research is
interesting. And there are some suggestions to improve this article.
1) I think the words “panting efficiency (PE)” (Page 5, line 41) should be changed to “plating
efficiency (PE)” and the words “the sensitization enhancement radio (SER)” (Page 13, line 8-9)
should be changed to “the sensitization enhancement ratio (SER). Please check carefully.
3
2) What is the meaning of the word “SF2” in the manuscript? Maybe it should be changed to “SF”
(survival fraction).
3) From the Figure 6a, we know the value of S of H1975 cells treated by MGO/FU is 28.7 and that
of S of H1975 cells treated by MGO/FU-MI NCs is 27.8. But in Figure 6b, we observe the values
represented by the graph are different which the value of S of H1975 cells treated by MGO/FU-
MI NCs is larger than that of S of H1975 cells treated by MGO/FU. Maybe the authors should
pay attention to this.

In this manuscript, the authors discussed the development of a multifunctional graphene oxide
based nanocomposites to deliver metronidazole, 5-fluorouracil, and PePt magnetic nanoparticles
for chemoradiotherapy. The integration of hypoxic drug carrier, readiosensitizer and
chemotherapeutic drugs confers hypoxia-sensitivity and chemoradiotherapy co-enhancement
functions to a single nano-platform. The detailed in vitro studies of the nanocomposites using
A549 and H1954 cells exhibit significant cell proliferation suppression, intracellular ROS burst,
and improved radiosensitivity, which could act as a potential multifunctional nano-platform for
tumor treatment to improve the synergistic effect of chemoradiotherapy. However, some
important parameters of this nano-platform that could affect the in vivo application and
translation for nano-drug delivery systems are missing. There are some major concerns
associated with the current version of submission which are listed below.
Comments:
1. The PePt MNPs and 5-FU were loaded on the MGO/FU-MI NCs via physisorption. One
concern with the physical loading systems is the cargo loading stability and release kinetics. It is
known that the cargoes may release during circulation, which leads to low drug delivery to the
tumors, poor treatment efficiency and potentially toxicity to normal tissues. It is important for the
authors to add the loading stability of the NCs and the release profile in both physiological and
4
tumor environment condition.
2. For any drug delivery system, the loading efficiency and loading capacities are critical for
effective tumor therapy. These data are missing for the MGO/MI, MGO/FU, and MGO/FU-MI
nanocomposites. Additionally, it is useful for the audience to understand the advantages of this
system by showing the data regarding the optimal cargo loading amount and ratio since these
data may affect the cell viability and ROS production results.
3. It is confusing that the cancer cells showed reduced cell viability under normoxia condition in
the presence of MGO/FU-MI NCs in Figure 4g. Typically, the hypoxia sensitivity of NCs should
facilitate cell proliferation suppression under hypoxia condition.
4. In page 12 line 4: “The composites loading 5-FU showed an S phase arresting, the fraction of
which was nearly one-times augment for H1975 cells cultured with MGO/FU NCs.” Is it a typo
that the “MGO/FU” should be “control”? As the composites loading 5-FU should also be
MGO/FU NCs. And, “one-times” should be “one-time”.
5. In figure 2f, what are the two peaks at 9 keV and 11.4 keV attributed to?

All aspects of this manuscript are cleared now. Except one point: the 5FU when used in cancer
patients it is not only to affect the cancer volume but also if any metastasises that might exist
anywhere within the body. Hence, targeting 5FU to the tumour volume will result into limitation
of its applications. This point needs to be made clear by the authors for the readers. They

The authors added more details to the resubmitted version according to the comments. However,
this version still have some issues that the authors need to address.
1) I didn’t clarify the physiological and tumor environment conditions, which are not water and
PBS. I would like the author to compare the stability and release of the NPs at different pH,
normally, 7 and 5-6. (doi: 10.1186/1475-2867-13-89). In addition, it will be more comprehensive to
use cumulative release curve in Figure 6.
2) The authors added the loading efficiency of the NPs in the present synthetic method. However,
I would prefer to know the loading capacity, which could represent the maximal loading dose of
cargos on NPs, while the loading efficiency depends on the feeding amount.
Loading capacity (%) = (the weight of loaded drug/ the weight of NPs)
3) The author gave an explanation about the cell-type dependence phenomena, please add some
reference support. However, the writing of the corresponding paragraph is quite confusing. For
example, what is the meaning of the sentence “The hypoxia sensitivity tests is vary an example of
that”? Not only this paragraph, all the discussion section needs to be carefully revised. There are
even many typos in the rebuttal letter.

1. The 5FU is meant to go around whole body and affect the DNAs of cancer cells including
metastasis. If it is i.e. the 5-FU targeted, then it will miss its effects on remote cancer cells.
2. Any results to be shown in the abstract??
3. There is no word as “Leaded’ please replace it through out the manuscript into “Lead” or
“Led”
4. The method for measuring the levels of generated ROS as briefly mentioned in section 2.6.2
is not clear and not explained to the reader to understand how are the ROSs detected and
counted??

1. Section-2.2.1 second sentence is not clear needs re-writing
2. Section 2.2.2 Replace “500” by a word such as “The” etc…
3. Section 2.3 “Dynamic light scatter” change to “Dynamic Light Scattering device”
4. Section 2.6.2 Explain what is meant by “DCF”
RESULTS:
1. Section 3.1 second sentence: remove “At the meantime” and replace it with ‘The”
2. Same sentence; Following FePt MNPs replace “was” with “were”
3. Section 3.1 line 9 : change “exhibited” to “exhibits”
4. Similarly few other words need to be changed for ending into “ed’ into “s”
5. Section 3.2 line 4: change ‘cargos loaded’ to “loaded cargos”
6. Page 10: Font sizes in some figure 4 sections are not readable.
7. Also in page 10. The third line from bottom of the page; “replace “responsive” with
“response”
8. There is no explanation for the results of Hypoxia response differences between the 2 type
of cells??
9. The second sentence on page 11 is not clear. Please re-write it. Something as “…Hypoxia-
response was cell difference” does not make sense. Do you mean that Hypoxia depends on
cell type?
10. Section 3.3: First sentence; add “for” before 24h
11. Same sentence; add “concentration of” before 20
12. Also this sentence claims that ROS is measured. But How? At least refer to the method. How
reliable it is etc..
13. The sentence in the middle of the second paragraph page 12: “As depicted in figure 5d,…”
There is no explanation for this observation????
14. The following sentence mentions “burst of ROS” How? And why?
15. This section 3.3 is very shallow it needs expansion and further explanation & discussion of
the results
16. Section 3.4 is very poorly written. It is not the matter of language only but structure and
material. Many sentences don’t make sense at all. For instance the second one which starts
with “As expected..” as expected based on what??. I tried to help organising the section but I
realised that I will end up re-writing it which is not my responsibility.
17. Figure 6-b should be marked 2Gy to compare it with a
18. Figure 6-d; how is this curve fitting done? Can it be shown what degree of polynomial is
used? As it does not look right
19. DEF values listed in figure 6 are not defined and not explained how are they obtained?
20. Two terms DEF and SER are used through out the paper it needs some explanation as to
what is the difference between the two terms if any
21. Section 4 “Discussion” is poorly written, ambiguous, and about the results but about the
idea of the project. Discussion should be about the results and what they mean and what
are their limitations etc..
22. The conclusion “section 5” also will benefit greatly from re-writing. Example; The sentence
before the last: “future investigation was needed” this sentence doesn’t make any sense. If
it is future how is it “was”??

Part 2: Authors’ Responses to Reviewers:
Reviewer: 1
The reviewer’s comments:
This research which is based on synthesising a composite nanoparticle including
chemotherapy agent - 5FU is interesting and worth considering for publication. However,
there are some important questions which needs to be answered before such
consideration. And the paper is poorly written it needs major re-writing especially
discussion section.
The main question is about the fact that if we were to target 5FU as suggested by this
paper then its role to attack metastases will be removed. Can the authors address this
point using references please. Also I have listed some other questions and suggestions for
improving the manuscript in the attached file
The authors’ responses:
First of all, we want to thank Reviewer: 1 for writing that “This research … is interesting
and worth considering for publication.” Thank you for your recognition and feedback on our
manuscript. Secondly, we would like to thank you again for your comments, corrections
and suggestions on my pervious manuscript, which guide me to revise it, making it clearer,
better organized, more correct and comprehensible for audiences. Specifically, we have
partially rewritten the abstract (LOA 4) and introduction sections (LOA 5) as you suggested,
and supplemented the principles, methods, procedures of the method we used to detect
intracellular ROS in section 2.7.2, as listed in LOA 8, and the definitions of DEF and SER
in section 2.8.3, as listed in LOA 9. In addition, we have almost revised the descriptions of
results including cytotoxicity, hypoxia sensitivity, cell cycle analysis, ROS generation and
radiotherapy enhancement effect of the NCs, as LOA 10. Also, we have rewritten the
discussion sections as you suggested, and detailly discussed the experimental results,
additive effect between the two drugs, cell-type dependence phenomena (including the
difference of hypoxia response), radiotherapy enhancement effect and the limitations of
the present study, as listed in LOA 11. We want to say thank you for your careful review,
patient correction and thoughtful comments. Thank you very much for the advices which
help me revise my manuscript. Finally, we appreciate the main question you have raised
in the e-mail that “if we were to target 5FU as suggested by this paper then its role to attack
metastases will be removed”, which has pointed out the metastatic situation that we had
lost sight of. Moreover, we address the question as follows:
Firstly, we need to clarify that 5-FU is loaded onto the nanocomposites (NCs) via
physisorption (last sentence of paragraph 3, section 3.1, page 7), it is neither the target of
the NCs nor targeting transported by NCs. We are sorry for the misunderstand.
Secondly, with regard to this issue, we should recognized that it’s our thoughtless for losing
sight of the metastatic situation, and thank you for raising that point. Nevertheless, the
physical loading of chemotherapeutics doesn’t alter the structure of the drugs so it does
not influence its antitumor effect as well. Once being released, it is no different from normal
drug, therefore, its role in attacking cancer cells doesn’t remove. Finally, in the case of
remote cancer cells, it is possible that the antitumor effect will be limited because the
distance makes the concentration of released drugs too low to inhibit the remote cancer
cells. However, this problem can be resolved through rigorous quantitative studies of NCs
releasing properties, knowledge of pharmacokinetics and a variety of in vivo experiments.
Therefore, we can’t say that the drug effect will be removed by carrier loading.
In addition, we have listed some references about other researchers’ studies on drug
delivery system loading 5-FU for cancer treatment [1, 2]. Moreover, we have also listed
other novel delivery systems which deliver RNA interference [3] for gen-silencing cancer
therapy, or insulin for diabetes treatment [4], and antigen for cancer immunotherapy [5],
which all demonstrate that the load does not affect drug efficacy.
Moreover, the answers to the questions and suggestions listed in the attached file are
moved to part 3.
That’s all. Thank you again for your serious consideration and constructive comments. We
appreciate your advices sincerely.

Reviewer: 2
The Reviewer’s comments:
In this paper, the authors reported a promising novel multifunctional platform which
displayed a self-amplified effect that activated chemoradiotherapy co-enhancement. The
research is interesting. And there are some suggestions to improve this article.
1) I think the words “panting efficiency (PE)” (Page 5, line 41) should be changed to “plating
efficiency (PE)” and the words “the sensitization enhancement radio (SER)” (Page 13,
line 8-9) should be changed to “the sensitization enhancement ratio (SER). Please check
carefully.
2) What is the meaning of the word “SF2” in the manuscript? Maybe it should be changed
to “SF” (survival fraction).
3) From the Figure 6a, we know the value of S of H1975 cells treated by MGO/FU is 28.7
and that of S of H1975 cells treated by MGO/FU-MI NCs is 27.8. But in Figure 6b, we
observe the values represented by the graph are different which the value of S of H1975
cells treated by MGO/FU-MI NCs is larger than that of S of H1975 cells treated by MGO/FU.
Maybe the authors should pay attention to this.
4) Please check the manuscript carefully.
The authors’ responses:
Firstly, we intend to thank Reviewer: 2 for saying that “The research is interesting”.
Moreover, thank you for your careful reading and patient correction of my previous
manuscript. We appreciate your suggestions about spelling and data presentation, which
help us a lot in improvement of our manuscript. In addition, we have addressed all the
points raised as summarized below.
1) We follow the recommendation to replace the spelling of “panting efficiency (PE)” with
“planting efficiency (PE)” (line 9, section 2.8.1, page 5) and “the sensitization
enhancement radio (SER)” with “the sensitization enhancement ratio (SER)” (line
5, paragraph 2, page 10), as listed in LOA 15. We are sorry for the spelling errors.
Thank you for your correction and we have checked the manuscript carefully this time.
2) The word “SF2” refers to the SF under 2 Gy, which is the common clinical dose
fractionation. Thank you for point out the unclear expression, and we have emphasized
the meaning in experimental section (last line of section 2.8.2) and added a special
footnote below the table 1, as listed in LOA 9&14.
3) Thank you for raising the inconformity of my data presentation in figure 5a&b. It is our
thoughtless for neglecting to explain the relationship of the two Figures. Specifically,
Figure 5a exhibits one of the results of cell cycle analysis on H1975, while Figure 5b
exhibits the statistical results of three independent experiments of cell cycle analysis
on H1975. Therefore, the inconformity comes from the accidental errors between
experiments. And we have emphasized the relationship of the two figures in captions
to make it clearer as listed in LOA 14. Thank you for your careful consideration.
4) We have totally rewritten the previous manuscript and checked it carefully once again,
thank you for your advices.
The above is all of our answers, thank you again for your patient correction and thoughtful
consideration, we appreciate your comments very much.
Reviewer: 3
The reviewer’s comments:
In this manuscript, the authors discussed the development of a multifunctional graphene
oxide based nanocomposites to deliver metronidazole, 5-fluorouracil, and PePt magnetic
nanoparticles for chemoradiotherapy. The integration of hypoxic drug carrier,
readiosensitizer and chemotherapeutic drugs confers hypoxia-sensitivity and
chemoradiotherapy co-enhancement functions to a single nano-platform. The detailed in
vitro studies of the nanocomposites using A549 and H1954 cells exhibit significant cell
proliferation suppression, intracellular ROS burst, and improved radiosensitivity, which
could act as a potential multifunctional nano-platform for tumor treatment to improve the
synergistic effect of chemoradiotherapy. However, some important parameters of this
nano-platform that could affect the in vivo application and translation for nano-drug delivery
systems are missing. There are some major concerns associated with the current version
of submission which are listed below.
Comments:
1. The PePt MNPs and 5-FU were loaded on the MGO/FU-MI NCs via physisorption. One
concern with the physical loading systems is the cargo loading stability and release kinetics.
It is known that the cargoes may release during circulation, which leads to low drug delivery
to the tumors, poor treatment efficiency and potentially toxicity to normal tissues. It is
important for the authors to add the loading stability of the NCs and the release profile in
both physiological and tumor environment condition.
2. For any drug delivery system, the loading efficiency and loading capacities are critical
for effective tumor therapy. These data are missing for the MGO/MI, MGO/FU, and
MGO/FU-MI nanocomposites. Additionally, it is useful for the audience to understand the
advantages of this system by showing the data regarding the optimal cargo loading amount
and ratio since these data may affect the cell viability and ROS production results.
3. It is confusing that the cancer cells showed reduced cell viability under normoxia
condition in the presence of MGO/FU-MI NCs in Figure 4g. Typically, the hypoxia
sensitivity of NCs should facilitate cell proliferation suppression under hypoxia condition.
4. In page 12 line 4: “The composites loading 5-FU showed an S phase arresting, the
fraction of which was nearly one-times augment for H1975 cells cultured with MGO/FU
NCs.” Is it a typo that the “MGO/FU” should be “control”? As the composites loading 5-FU
should also be MGO/FU NCs. And, “one-times” should be “one-time”.
5. In figure 2f, what are the two peaks at 9 keV and 11.4 keV attributed to?
The authors’ responses:
We would like to thank Reviewer: 3 firstly for the careful review and thoughtful
consideration on our previous manuscript. The suggestions about supplementing the
loading characters of the nanocomposites (NCs) are valuable and constructive. Just as
you said, an unstable loading system would cause normal tissue toxicity and low drug
efficiency. Moreover, the loading efficiency and capacities is also of great important of a
loading system for it will not only influence the degree of in vivo toxicity of the NCs but also
relate to the advantages of the carrier. They are the very assignments we plan to do for
the quantitative examination and in vivo application in the further study. However, as the
present study was preferred to qualitative examination, some raw materials in the present
synthesis are somewhat superfluous added and the consumption of which is needed to be
optimized further for the better quantitative application in vivo. Therefore, as we have
detected, with the current raw materials input ratio, the loading efficiency of MI and 5-FU
is not satisfactory. Here is our point by point response:
1) With regard to the concern of cargo loading stability and release kinetics, we have
supplemented the results and descriptions of release profiles of MI and 5-FU in Figure
3d&e and section 3.1 (paragraph 4, page 6-7), as listed in LOA 7. The deionized water
and PBS solutions containing 500ug/ml NCs were used and incubated for 24 hours to
simulate the physiological and tumor condition respectively. As shown in Figure 3d&e,
with 24hours’ incubation in H2O, the concentrations of MI varies from 0.4 ~ 2.1ug/ml,
while it is 1.9~4.2ug/ml for 5-FU. The results is similar to those in PBS solutions. The
release is little for 500ug/ml NCs, and it would be less for the experiments
concentration (20ug/ml), which means a negligible cytotoxicity is caused by drug
releasing with 24 hours’ incubation.
2) In terms of loading efficiency and loading capacities, we have examined the loading
efficiency of MI and 5-FU using UV-Vis spectrophotometer, as listed in LOA 7.
According to the data (line 2, paragraph 4, page 6), the loading efficiency of the two
drugs is low, with MI of 25.03% and 5-FU of 27.76%. However, as we have mentioned
above, there is a surplus of the raw materials and it still needed optimization for the
further quantitative application in vivo. Therefore, we cut the consumption of MI and 5-
FU in half and examine the loading efficiency again to verify whether it is redundant.
This time, the loading efficiency of MI increases to 57.24%, indicating that the
consumption of MI is indeed redundant. However, the loading efficiency of 5-FU is
reduced to 17.44%, which means that the loading capacities of 5-FU is low, and that
GO needs to be further modified to improve the loading capacity of 5-FU.
Moreover, for optimal cargo loading amount and ratio, multiple tests with different raw
materials ratio and the consequent biological effect is needed, which are too time-
consuming to confirm. We are very sorry that we can’t provide such data within a short
time. Therefore, the optimal cargo loading amount and ratio would be implemented in
our further study. Thank you for your constructive suggestions, which have greatly
helped us revise our study. Moreover, we will try our best to complete it in the following
study.
3) Thank you for pointing out the confusing results of cell viability reduced under hypoxia
condition in Figure 4g, which has prompted us to think and discuss in depth and thus
improved our manuscript in indirectly. Moreover, we have supplemented the possible
reasons and mechanisms in section 3.2 (paragraph 3, page 8) and discussion section
(line 3-12, paragraph 3, page 11), as listed in LOA 10&11. Also, we have pasted it as
follow: “The hypoxia sensitivity tests is vary an example of that (cell-type
dependence). As it exhibits (Figure 4g), the cell viability of H1975 cells
treated with MGO/FU-MI under hypoxia condition do not decrease but increase
compared to normoxia condition, while the result of A549 cells is contrary.
The difference suggests that different cells would activate diverse
regulatory mechanisms when exposed to hypoxia environment, which would
influence the cytotoxicity of NCs accordingly. In addition, comparing to the
result of H1975 cells with MGO-MI treatment, the adding of 5-FU should account
for the difference likewise. In another words, the interactions between 5-FU
and MI would stir up some intracellular signaling pathways that could
influence the hypoxia-response of MI and thus lead to the failure or reduction
of hypoxia sensitivity of the NCs upon H1975 cells. However, all speculations
are speculative and require further pharmacokinetic investigations..” We hope
that we have made the problem understandable and thank you for your comments
again.
4) We have rewritten the sentence as “Compared with the control group, MGO/FU NCs
shows an S phase arresting effect, the fraction of which is almost one-time
enhanced on H1975 cells.” (line 1, page 9), as listed in LOA 15. Thank you for your
correction.
5) Thank you for raising the point of the omission of notations in Figure 2f, which has
reminded us of that more attention should be paid to details. We have supplemented
it, as listed in LOA 14. As we have knew, each element has a cluster (not one) of
characteristic energies due to different energy level transitions, so there will be a lot of
characteristic energy peeks belonged to one element in the EDS spectrum. And the
peaks in the spectrum at 1.7 and 11.4 keV belong to Pt while the peak at 9 keV belongs
to Cu. The results have supplemented in Figure 2f. Thank you for your comments again.
That’s all of my answers. We appreciate your constructive comments which have greatly
help us revise our manuscript. Moreover, the comments also let us recognize the
limitations of our present study, and we will try our best to complete it in the further study.
Thank you for your careful review and constructive comments again.
Part 3: Answers to Questions Listed in Attachment form Reviewer 1.
General;
1. The 5FU is meant to go around whole body and affect the DNAs of cancer
cells including metastasis. If it is i.e. the 5-FU targeted, then it will miss its
effects on remote cancer cells.
Thank you for your valuable comments, and we have answered this question
in Part 2, so we will answer it briefly here.
Firstly, 5-FU is loaded onto the nanocomposites (NCs) via physisorption (last
sentence of paragraph 3, section 3.1, page 7), it is neither the target of the
NCs nor targeting transported by NCs.
Secondly, the physical loading of chemotherapeutics doesn’t alter the
structure of the drugs so it does not influence its antitumor effect as well.
Finally, in the case of remote cancer cells, it is possible that the antitumor
effect will be limited because the distance makes the concentration of
released drugs too low to inhibit the remote cancer cells. However, this
problem can be resolved through rigorous quantitative studies of NCs
releasing properties, knowledge of pharmacokinetics and a variety of in vivo
experiments. Therefore, we can’t say that the drug effect will be removed by
carrier loading.
In addition, the references related to drug delivery system loading 5-FU for
cancer treatment [1, 2].and other novel delivery systems which delivered RNA
interference [3] for gen-silencing cancer therapy, or insulin for diabetes
treatment [4], and Antigen for cancer immunotherapy [5], are listed again,
which all demonstrate that the load does not affect drug efficacy. Thank you
again for raising that problem, making us think more deeply.
2. Any results to be shown in the abstract??
Thank you for the suggestion and we appreciate your comments very much.
Through showing the key points of results in the abstract, highlighting the
advantages of our materials and making it clearer for audiences to
comprehend it. Therefore, we have partially rewritten the abstract section (line
9-14 of abstract, page 1) according to the comments, as listed in LOA 4.
3. There is no word as “Leaded’ please replace it through out the manuscript
into “Lead” or “Led”
We are sorry for the error and we have replaced the word “leaded” into “lead”
as suggested, Thank you for your correction.
4. The method for measuring the levels of generated ROS as briefly mentioned
in section 2.6.2 is not clear and not explained to the reader to understand how
are the ROSs detected and counted??
Your comment on the above issue is greatly appreciated. Through
supplementing the principles, methods and procedures of it in section 2.7.2
(page 5) as suggested and listed in LOA 8, we have found the manuscript is
more complete and clearer for the audiences to comprehend the study. Thank
you for your advice and we have pasted that part as follows: “The effects of
NCs on intracellular ROS generation were examined by ROS assay kit
(Beyotime, China), which uses dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate
(DCFH-DA) fluorescence probe to detect intracellular ROS.
Specifically, DCFH-DA itself has no fluorescence and can pass
through the cell membrane freely. After entering the cell, it can be
hydrolyzed to DCFH by intracellular esterase, which can’t penetrate
the cell membrane, making it easy for becoming the prob to be loaded
into the cell. Moreover, ROS in the cells can oxidize non-
fluorescent DCFH and produce fluorescence DCF. Therefore, the level
of intracellular ROS could be knew through measuring the
5
fluorescence intensity of DCF in cells. In the experiments, 3×10
cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured overnight. Then
cells were treated with MGO-MI, MGO/FU, MGO/FU-MI NCs solutions with
final concentrations of 20µg/ml for each well, and incubated for 24
hours. Next, cells were washed, trypsinized, centrifuged and
resuspended in 10mM DCFH-DA serum-free medium solution and incubated
for 30 mins at 37°C without light. After that the cells were washed
twice with serum-free medium and collected for fluorescence analysis
using a flow cytometer (Cytomics TM FC 500, Beckman Coulter, Inc.,
USA) and 10,000 events were counted for each sample. The data were
analysed using FlowJo and GraphPad Prism software. The results were
expressed as means ± SD”

ABSTRACT:
1. Line 4; “drug delivery system with 246nm” what does this mean? Is this
diameter? If so of what?
Thank you for your comment that reminds us to express clearer. We have
changed the expression to “with an average size of 243nm” (line 4, abstract
section) as suggested and listed in LOA 4 to make it clarity. It is the average
size of the nanocomposites (NCs) and the numerical change is consistent
with the result of DLS in Figure 2c, which is our carelessness to have made
the numerical error.
2. Line 7 “Chemo-therapeutics “ remove ‘s” at the end
We have changed “chemotherapeutics drugs” to “chemotherapeutic drugs”
(line 7, abstract section) as suggested and listed in LOA 4, and thank you for
your correction.
INTRODUCTION
1. Page 2- line 7- “attention that fabricating” replace “that” by “to”
Thank you for your grammatical correction, and we have rewritten this
sentence as “the idea of developing a hypoxic drug-delivery system
loading anticancer agent and radiosensitizers simultaneously to
improve the efficiency of tumour chemoradiotherapy is popular with
researchers” (line 5-7, page 2).
2. Second paragraph: line 6; “to delivery insulin for ..” change “delivery’ to
“Deliver”
We have changed “delivery” to “deliver” (line 6, paragraph 2, page 2)as
suggested and listed in LOA 5. Thank you for your correction.
3. Same line as above: “where”? does not make sense. Change the whole
sentence o may be replace ‘where” with “were”?
Thank you for the comment and we have rewritten the sentence as “Ji-Chang
Yu et al. developed a hypoxia-sensitive vesicle to deliver insulin
for diabetes therapy, using NI as hypoxic ingredient likewise” (line 5-
6, paragraph 2, page 2), which means “Ji-Chang Yu et al. utilized NI as raw
material to develop the hypoxia-sensitive vesicle”.
4. Third paragraph; second sentence: Change “In especial” to “Especially”
We have changed “In especial” to “Especially” (line 2, paragraph 3, page 2)
as suggested and listed in LOA 5. Thank you for your correction.
5. Figures 2-a and 2-b are not clear and the scale is unreadable
Thank you for bringing up the problem which makes us pay more attention to
the readability of the Figures. However, scale bars in Figure 2a&b are unable
to change, because they are automatically generated when taking pictures
with TEM. Therefore, we have stressed them in the captions to make it
clearer for audiences, as listed in LOA 14.
METHOS:
1. Section-2.2.1 second sentence is not clear needs re-writing
We appreciate the comment and have rewritten the sentence as “Briefly, OA
(1.5ml), OL (1.5ml) and Fe(acac)3 (0.386mmol) were dissolved in
anhydrous ethanol (100ml) and stirred for 30 mins. Then,
H2PtCl6·6H2O ethanol solution (20 ml, 19.3mmol/L, 0.386mmol) was
transferred into the mixture mentioned above and stirred for another
30 mins” (line 2, section 2.2.1 ), as listed in LOA 6.
2. Section 2.2.2 Replace “500” by a word such as “The” etc…
We have changed the expression to “The PEG (500mg, 0.25mmol) was
dissolved…” (first line, section 2.2.2).
3. Section 2.3 “Dynamic light scatter” change to “Dynamic Light Scattering
device”
We have changed “dynamic light scatter” to “dynamic light scattering device”
(line 3, section 2.3) as suggested. Thank you for your correction.
4. Section 2.6.2 Explain what is meant by “DCF”
As we have answered above, the principles of the dichloro-dihydro-
fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) fluorescence probe used in the study to
detect intracellular ROS (line 3-8, section 2.7.2, page 5) have been
supplemented. Moreover, we would like to explain again that DCF is the
fluorescence production during the detecting process, the intensity of which is
just proportional to the content of intracellular ROS. Therefore, we detected
the fluorescence intensity of DCF to represent the level of ROS.
RESULTS:
1. Section 3.1 second sentence: remove “At the meantime” and replace it with
‘The”
We have replaced “At the meantime” with “the” (line 3, section 3.1, page 7) as
suggested.
2. Same sentence; Following FePt MNPs replace “was” with “were”
We have changed “was” to “were” (line 3, section 3.1, page7) as suggested,
and thank you for your correction.
3. Section 3.1 line 9 : change “exhibited” to “exhibits”
We have changed “exhibited” to “exhibits” (line2, paragraph 2, section 3.1,
page 7) as suggested.
4. Similarly few other words need to be changed for ending into “ed’ into “s”
Your comments on checking the verb tense throughout the manuscript is
good and appreciated greatly. The problem of tense had puzzled us deeply,
and we have changed it to simple present tense when descripting the result
and conclusion. The past indefinite tense is utilized to describe the
experiment procedure as suggested and listed in LOA 16. Thank you very
much for your correction.
5. Section 3.2 line 4: change ‘cargos loaded’ to “loaded cargos”
We have changed sentence to “and some of them have degraded and
released the cargos” (line 3, section 3.2 page 8).
6. Page 10: Font sizes in some figure 4 sections are not readable.
Thank you for pointing out the problem of the readability of the Figures again,
we appreciate the suggestions and we have tried to enlarge the font size in
Figure 4 to make it clearer for audiences, as listed in LOA 14.
7. Also in page 10. The third line from bottom of the page; “replace “responsive”
with “response”
We have replaced “responsive” with “sensitivity” (line 2, paragraph 3,
section 3.2) and thank you for your correction.
8. There is no explanation for the results of Hypoxia response differences
between the 2 type of cells??
Thank you for pointing out the difference results of hypoxia response between
the two type of cells, the comment is good, which promotes us to think and
discuss carefully to address the question. Therefore, We have totally written
the part of hypoxia sensitivity tests, and carefully explained the reasons for
different results (paragraph 3, section 3.2, page 8) as suggested and listed in
LOA 10. In summary, through comparing the contrary results of H1975 and
A549 cells treated by MGO/FU-MI NCs, we believe that hypoxia condition
would stir up diverse cellular regulatory mechanism which includes the uptake
and metabolic mechanisms of cells, influencing the outcome of cytotoxicity
accordingly. Moreover, through comparing the results of H1975 cells treated
by MGO-MI and MGO/FU-MI NCs, the additive effect between MI and FU
also should account for the phenomenon. It implies that the interaction
between the two drugs would stimulate some cellular signal pathway, which
could lead to the failure or reduction of the hypoxia sensitivity of MI. We have
also supplemented that part in discussion section (line 3-13, paragraph 3,
page 11), as listed in LOA 11, in expectation of making it comprehensible for
audiences.
9. The second sentence on page 11 is not clear. Please re-write it. Something
as “…Hypoxia-response was cell difference” does not make sense. Do you
mean that Hypoxia depends on cell type?
Thank you for taking out the confusion and we have totally rewritten this part
to make it clearer (paragraph 3, section 3.2, page 8), as listed in LOA 10. In
addition, we must explain that the statement of “Hypoxia-response was cell
difference” didn’t mean that Hypoxia depends on cell type. What we wanted
to tell was that the hypoxia condition would stimulate different coping
mechanisms in different cell types, such as regulation of uptake and
metabolic mechanisms to adapt to the new environment. And the different
coping mechanisms would make a great difference on drug cytotoxicity.
Therefore, we had said that “Hypoxia-response was cell difference”. Now we
have deleted the sentence and rewritten the paragraph. Thank you very much
for your good comments on that part, which help us revise our manuscript
greatly.
10. Section 3.3: First sentence; add “for” before 24h
We have added “for” before 24h (line 1, section 3.3, page 8) as suggested.
11. Same sentence; add “concentration of” before 20
We have added “concentration of” before 20 (line 1, section 3.3, page 8) as
suggested
12. Also this sentence claims that ROS is measured. But How? At least refer to
the method. How reliable it is etc..
Thank you for mentioned the reliable of the method we used, therefore, we
have looked for references which mentioned and utilized the method[6, 7, 8],
and detailed studied and discussed the mothed totally[9, 10], as listed in LOA
13. Through this process, we have get more knowledge on the method, and
knew that it also has limitations in detecting ROS [9, 10]. We benefit a lot from
this comments, which make us realize the limitations and the rang of
application and the degree of accuracy of a experimental method. It also
reminds us of the significants of deep investigation before a study. Thank you
very much for your comments and we have supplemented the principles,
methods, and procedures of the method utilized to measure ROS in the study
in section 2.7.2 (page 5), as listed in LOA 8.
13. The sentence in the middle of the second paragraph page 12: “As depicted in
figure 5d,…” There is no explanation for this observation????
Thank you for your feedback, which promotes us to totally rewrite the
sentences and descriptions of this part (line 4-13, paragraph 2, page 9) to
make the results of ROS detection clearer and more comprehensible for the
audiences, as listed in LOA 10.
14. The following sentence mentions “burst of ROS” How? And why?
Thank you for mentioning the question again, the comments promote us to
complete this part thoroughly, and our manuscript has improved a lot through
the rewriting, as listed in LOA 8&10. In summary, the principles, methods, and
procedures of the method utilized in our study to detect intracellular ROS
have been supplemented in section 2.7.2 (page 5), in which we have knew
that the fluorescence intensity of DCF is directly proportional to the ROS
content. Moreover, the descriptions of the ROS detection results (line 4-13,
paragraph 2, page 9) have been totally rewritten, in which we have knew that
the fluorescence intensity is obviously augmented after the NCs treatment,
suggesting the ROS augment caused by NCs treatment.
15. This section 3.3 is very shallow it needs expansion and further explanation
& discussion of the results
All of the comments related to this points are good and greatly appreciated,
we benefit from it a lot. Moreover, our manuscript has improved a lot
according to these comments. Thank you very much for your careful review
and thoughtful comments, and we have summarized the actions we have
made on this part as follows: Firstly, we have supplemented the principles,
methods, and procedures of the method in section 2.7.2 (page 5) to make it
clearer (LOA 8). Then, totally rewriting of the descriptions of the results (line
4-13, paragraph 2, page 9) is made to make the results comprehensible (LOA
10). Finally, the results are discussed slightly in the discussion
section(paragraph 1-2, page 11) to stress the meaning of the results (LOA
11).
16. Section 3.4 is very poorly written. It is not the matter of language only but
structure and material. Many sentences don’t make sense at all. For instance
the second one which starts with “As expected..” as expected based on
what??. I tried to help organising the section but I realised that I will end up
re-writing it which is not my responsibility.
Thank you for your careful review and patient correction, your comment is
good and appreciated, and we have totally rewritten the 3.4 section (page 9-
10) to make it better organized (LOA 10). Specifically, the section 3.4 is
divided into three parts. The first part exhibits the effect of radiation
enhancement of the NCs under 2Gy, the common clinical dose fractionation,
which displays the great application prospects of the NCs (paragraph 1,
section 3.4, page 9) primary. Moreover, the radiotherapy enhancement effect
of the NCs is proved in the second part, in which dose enhancement factor
(DEF) is utilized to evaluate the dose efficiency enhancement in dosiology
(paragraph 2, section 3.4, page 9-10). Finally, the biological mechanisms of
the radiotherapy enhancement effect are explored in the third part. In which
cell radiation sensitization ratio (SER) is utilized to evaluate the biological
sensitivity enhancement effect of the NCs in radiobiology (paragraph 2, page
10). Therefore, with the description of the three aspects, we have displayed
that the NCs will not only improve the radiation efficiency but also improve the
cell radiosensitivity, which would be a good radiation sensitizers.
17. Figure 6-b should be marked 2Gy to compare it with a
Thank you for your suggestion which improves the readability of our figures.
Therefore, we have changed the title of the Figure 6b to 2Gy for comparison
with Figure 6a as suggested and listed in LOA 14.
18. Figure 6-d; how is this curve fitting done? Can it be shown what degree of
polynomial is used? As it does not look right
Your comment of this part is good and appreciated as well, which improves
our manuscript again. Therefore, we have totally rewritten section 2.8 in
experimental section (page 5-6) to make the experiment tools more
comprehensible for audiences (LOA 9). Specifically, we have supplemented
the equations and definitions of SF2, DEF, SER, the “multi target-single
hitting” model, and the meanings of D0 and N in radiobiology. Moreover, as
for this question, our answers are as follows:
The survival curve was fitted with the “multi target-single hitting” model, which
equation is as follow. In addition, the survival fraction is displayed on
logarithmic coordinates. The spots in figure 6d are the experimental data
obtained from clonogenic survival assays while the curves are the functions
obtained through fitting the data using GraphPad Prism software.
SF <U+F03D> 1 <U+F02D> (1 <U+F02D> exp(<U+F02D> D D0 )) N
As you have mentioned, the spots deviate too far from the curve, making it
looks incorrect. For this problem, we have to explain the fact that the cells in
the experiments with 6, 8 and 10Gy were died for the most part and the SF
were vary greatly as one or two clones count errors, so the data of small dose
was accurate and significative. additionally, the logarithmic coordinates have
magnified the difference hundreds and thousands of times between the spots
and the curve. Actually, the difference were both smaller than 0.05, 0.01 or
even.
19. DEF values listed in figure 6 are not defined and not explained how are they
obtained?
Thank you for your comments, as we have mentioned above, the definition
and equation of DEF are supplemented in 2.8.3 section (page 6), which has
improved our manuscript a lot (LOA 9). Moreover, we have pasted it below, in
which “Dc(SF90) represented the dose producing 90% SF for the control
group, while the Dd(SF90) was the dose producing 90% SF for the drug
group”. The correspondent values were obtain through the survival curve.
Dc ( SF90 )
DEF <U+F03D>
Dd ( SF90 )
20. Two terms DEF and SER are used through out the paper it needs some
explanation as to what is the difference between the two terms if any
Thank you for your comments, and the definitions and equations of the two
terms have supplemented in section 2.8.3 (page 6) as suggested and listed in
LOA 9. Moreover, we have pasted it below for comparison purposes.
Dc ( SF90 ) D0c
DEF <U+F03D> ; SER <U+F03D>
Dd ( SF90 ) D0 d
“Where Dc(SF90) represented the dose producing 90% SF for the control
group, while the Dd(SF90) was the dose producing 90% SF for the drug
group. Similarly, D0c and D0d were the parameters D0 obtained in the
control group and the drug group respectively.”
From the equation above, we can know that, DEF as the dose enhancement
factor emphasizes the enhancement of dose efficiency. In addition, SER as
cell sensitization enhancement ratio, emphasizes the enhancement of cell
radiosensitivity. The former comes from dosiology while the letters from
radiobiology. The two terms represent the radiotherapy enhancement of the
NCs from different perspectives.
21. Section 4 “Discussion” is poorly written, ambiguous, and about the results but
about the idea of the project. Discussion should be about the results and what
they mean and what are their limitations etc..
Your comment and suggestion on discussion section are constructive and
appreciated. We have almost rewritten this section (page 10-11) according to
your suggestion, which has included the discussion of cytotoxicity (paragraph
2), results of antitumor analyses (paragraph 2), additive effect between MI
and 5-FU (paragraph 3), cell-type dependence phenomenon (paragraph 4),
which includes discussions on results of hypoxia sensitivity (line 3-13,
paragraph 3,page 11), radiotherapy enhancement effect (paragraph 5)and the
limitations (paragraph 6) of the present study (LOA 11). The manuscript has
revised a lost as you suggested. Thank you for your careful review and
construction advices again.
22. The conclusion “section 5” also will benefit greatly from re-writing. Example;
The sentence before the last: “future investigation was needed” this sentence
doesn’t make any sense. If it is future how is it “was”??
Thank you for your suggestion on section 5, and we have partially rewritten
this part (page 12) as you suggested to make it clearer and better organized,
covering the main points of the study. Moreover, we have changed the tens
as you suggested to make it more formal and correct (LOA 12).
Finally, thank you for your patience correction, careful review and profound
thinking on our study. We have benefit a lot from your comments and
suggestions. Also, our manuscript has greatly improved according to your
comments, which is clearer, better organized, more complete and
comprehensible for audience. In addition, we have obtained more knowledge
and indoctrinations which is of profound significance in our further study.
Thank you very much again.

Appendix C
Dear Editor and Reviewers:
Thank you for the kind letter of decision and reviewers’ comments on our manuscript,
label_version_4
RSOS-181790 (“Development of a hypoxic nanocomposite containing high-Z element as
5-Fluorouracil carrier activated self-amplified chemoradiotherapy co-enhancement”) on
April 8th, 2019 again. The reviewers are all very insightful and able to raise the constructive
comments, pointing out the limitations of our present research. We indeed appreciate the
comments which make us more thoughtful and careful. Now we have revised the
manuscript again, hoping to have addressed the questions clearly and get the approval of
every reviewer. The Following is our description on revision, which is divided into two parts.
Among them.
Part 1: List of Actions, which is a summary statement that covering all changes we have
made in the revision.
Part 2: Authors’ Response to Reviewers, which is our response to the comments from
reviewers.
Part 1: List of Actions
LOA 1: We have changed the concentrations of 5-FU to 2mg/ml (page 3, section 2.2.4,
line 2), which is a clerical error before.
LOA 2: We have standardized units for “ug/ml” to “µg/ml” and “ul” to “µl” throughout the
manuscript.
LOA 3: We have supplemented the loading capacity calculation (page 4, section 2.4, line
9) and changed the releasing conditions of the NCs (page 4, section 2.4, line 11-
13), as suggested by Reviewer 3. Therefore, the figures of releasing curves of MI
and 5-FU in Figure 3, and the corresponding captions were changed as well.
Moreover, we have almost rewritten the description of the results of loading and
releasing characteristic (page 7-8, last paragraph)
LOA 4: We have rewritten some of the descriptions in section 3.2-3.4 to make the results
more comprehensible for the readers (page 8-10).
LOA 5: We have almost rewritten the discussion section (page 10-13), organizing the
structure to make it more comprehensible, as suggested by Reviewer 3. To be
specific, we have divided the discussion into seven parts, which are research
background (page 10-11, section 4, first paragraph), antitumor effect of the NCs
(page 11, paragraph 2), the additive effect between 5-FU and MI (page 11,
paragraph 3), the cytotype dependence phenomenon (page 11-12, last
paragraph), the discussion of hypoxia sensitivity results (page 12, paragraph 2),
the radiotherapy improvement mechanism of the NCs (page 12-13, paragraph 3)
and the limitations of the present study (page 13, paragraph 2).
LOA 6: We have supplemented some references on chemoresistance in hypoxia cells
(page 14-18, [47], [62-64]), as suggested by Reviewer 3, and reuploaded the
support data (page 14, section 6).
Part 2: Authors’ Responses to Reviewers:
Reviewer: 1
The reviewer’s comments:
All aspects of this manuscript are cleared now. Except one point: the 5FU when
used in cancer patients it is not only to affect the cancer volume but also if
any metastasises that might exist anywhere within the body. Hence, targeting
5FU to the tumour volume will result into limitation of its applications. This
point needs to be made clear by the authors for the readers. They attempted in
their revision of the text but it is still not clear enough. I think the
authors didn't understand the request and I hope now it is clear. So please
address this issue before the publication of the paper
The authors’ responses:
We want to say thank you first for your approval of our first revision, we owe it to your
patient correction and thoughtful guidance during the first review. We appreciate your
satisfaction with our manuscript. As for the situation of metastatic tumor, we must admit,
as you have pointed out, that targeting 5-FU into the tumor volume does limit its antitumor
effect on metastatic tumors that may exist anywhere within the body. Therefore, we have
supplemented it as limitations of the present study in the discussion section(page 13,
paragraph 2, line 5-18) (LOA 5) to make it clearer for the readers, and we have pasted it
below. Thank you for your patient guidance.
“Firstly and constitutionally, the present drug delivery system should be further modified by
biological target to expand the scope of its antitumor action. In conventional chemotherapy,
chemotherapeutic drugs are to go around the whole body via intravenous injection to attack
cancer cells, including metastatic tumors. The drugs themselves are not targeted, and their
enrichment in the tumor sites is mainly due to the ubiquitous enhanced permeability and
retention (EPR) effect in solid tumors [68, 69]. However, the EPR effect always applies to
macromolecular substance. Therefore, when it comes to small molecule chemotherapeutic
drugs like 5-FU, they are not targeted at all, and they will attack all cells in the body,
including cancer cells, metastatic tumors and normal tissues. As a result, the problem of
systemic toxicity arises [7]. As a consequence, the hypoxic drug delivery system was
designed and synthesized in the study to solve the problem of large dosage and low
efficiency of clinical medication. However, every coin has two sides, the present designed
is imperfect, which will limit its antitumor effect on metastatic tumors that may exist
anywhere within the body. Therefore, further modification is required to expand its action
scope of antitumor effect.”
Lastly, we would like to thank you for all your work during these two reviews. Your insightful
comments and guidance benefit a lot not only to our revision but also to our future study.
We appreciate your advices very much and we will be more careful and thoughtful in the
further study. Thank you very much.
Reviewer: 2
The Reviewer’s comments:
The authors have further improved the manuscript. I think it can be accepted
for publication now.
The authors’ responses:
Thank you for your approval. It is very encouraging for us. We appreciate your suggestions
and comments during these two reviews, and we will be more careful and diligent in the
future study. Thank you very much.
Reviewer: 3
The reviewer’s comments:
The authors added more details to the resubmitted version according to the
comments. However, this version still have some issues that the authors need to
address.
1) I didn’t clarify the physiological and tumor environment conditions, which
are not water and PBS. I would like the author to compare the stability and
release of the NPs at different pH, normally, 7 and 5-6. (doi: 10.1186/1475-
2867-13-89). In addition, it will be more comprehensive to use cumulative
release curve in Figure 6.
2) The authors added the loading efficiency of the NPs in the present synthetic
method. However, I would prefer to know the loading capacity, which could
represent the maximal loading dose of cargos on NPs, while the loading
efficiency depends on the feeding amount.
Loading capacity (%) = (the weight of loaded drug/ the weight of NPs)
3) The author gave an explanation about the cell-type dependence phenomena,
please add some reference support. However, the writing of the corresponding
paragraph is quite confusing. For example, what is the meaning of the sentence
“The hypoxia sensitivity tests is vary an example of that”? Not only this
paragraph, all the discussion section needs to be carefully revised. There are
even many typos in the rebuttal letter.
4) 5) no further comments.
The authors’ responses:
First of all, thank you for your constructive advice in these two reviews. We appreciate your
suggestions about supplementing the loading and releasing characteristics of the
nanocomposites (NCs) very much. They are indeed the most significant parameters
needed for further drug delivery system evaluation and in vivo applications. Now, we have
calculated the loading capacity of the NCs and supplemented it in manuscript (page 4,
section 2.4, line 9), and changed the releasing conditions of the NCs (page 4, section 2.4,
line 11-13) (LOA 3). Thank you for your suggestions which improve our study a lot. And
we will be more thoughtful and careful in the further study. We address the questions as
follows:
1. Thank you for pointing out the exact conditions of physiological and tumor environment.
Through investigation and survey, we have know that the acidity is also a major feature
of microenvironment in tumor tissues, which is associated with a variety of
physiological activities of tumors, such as proliferation, angiogenesis,
immunosuppression, invasion and chemotherapy resistance. Knowing the releasing
prolife of the NCs under acidic condition is of great significance for us to grasp the
release characteristics of the NCs in tumor environment. Therefore, we have changed
the releasing conditions of the NCs (page 4, section 2.4, line 11-13), and almost
rewritten the descriptions of it (page 8, first paragraph, line 1-9) (LOA 3), as pasted
below:
“Moreover, the releasing curves of MI are illustrated in Figure 3d. As shown, after 24
hours’ incubation, the MI is hardly released in neutral PBS. And even in acidic PBS, its
release is slight, which is 0.3µg/ml. The result suggests the stability of the NCs even
the acidic environment. In comparison, after 24 hours’ incubation, the release of 5-FU
is relatively high, which is 2.8µg/ml in both neutral and sub-acid environments (Figure
3e). The difference in MI and 5-FU releasing characteristics may connect with the
different loading methods of the two drugs. The former is covalently clinked to GO,
while the latter is loaded onto GO via physisorption with the support of PEG, so it is
relatively easier than MI release.”
As it can be seen that, due to the different loading methods of MI and 5-FU, the two
drugs perform different releasing curves. In addition, the release amount is slight even
in the acidic environment, suggesting the stability of the NCs.
In addition, we have recomposed the discussion of radiotherapy improvement
mechanism of the NCs in combination with the release characteristics (page 12,
paragraph 2, line 2-22) (LOA 5) to make it more comprehensible, and we have pasted
some of it below. Thank you very much for the constructive suggestions, which improve
our manuscript a lot. And we will be more thoughtful and careful in the future study.
“Therefore, in the design of the NCs, FePt MNPs will act as high-Z type radiosensitizers
[6, 45], which enhance the radiation energy deposition within tumor through its high
radiation rays absorption coefficient [13, 37] during the physical stage. Moreover, MI
can assist the action of radical anions through simulating the action of oxygen [9, 65]
in the chemical stage. Whereas the physical and chemical stage last short, the
magnitude of the enhancement effect is depended on the amount of NCs in cells. As it
has been proved by the releasing curve of the NCs that it is very stable in solutions.
Therefore, with the uptake of cells, the NCs will perform good radiation enhancement
effect during the physical and chemical lethal stage of radiotherapy. Furthermore, due
to a long incubation time in biological stage, the 5-FU will give full play to its role in
hindering the repair sublethal damage through its function of DNA synthesis
interference [35, 67].”
2. Thank you for the suggestion, the loading capacity is very useful for us to know the
loading amount of drugs in the NCs. Therefore, we have calculated the loading capacity
of the two drugs in the NCs, which is 12.3% and 9.5% for MI and 5-FU respectively,
and we have supplemented it in section 2.4 (page 4, section 2.4, line 10), and section
3.1 (page 7, last paragraph, last sentence) (LOA 3).
3. We have added the references of the cytotype dependence chemoresistance caused
by hypoxia condition (page 11, last paragraph) (LOA 6).
Moreover, we have revised the discussion section as suggested (LOA 5). As summary,
we have divided the discussion into seven parts, which are research background (page
10-11, section 4, first paragraph), antitumor effect of the NCs (page 11, paragraph 2),
the additive effect between 5-FU and MI (page 11, paragraph 3), the cytotype
dependence phenomenon (page 11-12, last paragraph), the discussion of hypoxia
sensitivity results (page 12, paragraph 2), the radiotherapy improvement mechanism
of the NCs (page 12-13, paragraph 3) and the limitations of the present study (page
13, paragraph 2) to make the discussion section more comprehensible to the readers.
Thank you for your comments which improve our revision a lot.
In addition, we are sorry for the typos in the rebuttal letter, and we have checked it
carefully to minimize this error this time. Thank you for your careful review again.
4.5. Thank you for your work in the two review processes.
Lastly, we would like to thank you again for all your work and comments in these two
reviews. Your suggestions are all valuable, constructive and instructive for us in the present
and further studies. And we will be more careful and diligent in the future studies. Thank
you very much.
