Currently biomedical researchers are generating large numbers of high-throughput datasets and,
as more and more different data types are available, questions arise of how to make inferences
from this kind of data and how to merge information from different data types. In this
manuscript the authors propose a Bayesian probit model that uses gaussian processes to model
complex relations between measured features and clinical outcome. Additionally, in order to gain
insight into the biology, the authors implement a model selection scheme in order to find the set
features that are able to predict the outcome.
The paper is clear, coherently structured and well explained. I recommend publishing the paper
once the comments and suggestions that follow have been addressed.
1. Regarding the description of the model, it would be useful to describe the sparsity prior a bit
more. Specifically, commenting on the structure i.e. a product of Bernoulli’s with a 2^-ad term to
penalise the number of Ijd’s switched on. It would also be worth clarifying that Eq 2.2 is the joint
distribution for all Ijd’s for dataset d, rather than the distribution of a single Ijd.
2. I find the truncation and selected hyper-parameters for the beta distribution to seem like quite
a strong prior, as such it would be interesting to see a plot overlaying the prior and the posterior
for a couple of the examples to see how strong the prior actually is. Such a plot would also be
useful to get a better feeling for the shape of the prior.
3. The names used to describe the covariance functions in tables 1 and 2 do not match the names
in 2c. Though which is which can easily be inferred, it would be better to use the same names.
Also, it was not clear to me what covariance function was used for the METABRIC data.
4. The number of Ijd’s seem large and therefore might give MCMC convergence problems. It
would be useful to see some comment or plot on the convergence of the Ijd’s, perhaps a plot of
the posterior probability P(Ijd = 1) between a couple of the chains.
5. Which image features are selected for the case ER- where the image dataset is most
informative?
6. A few typos:
Binomial prior => Beta prior (2b in the text and Eq2.3)
i_jd => uppercase I_jd(3rd line of section 2b)
Hu’s first moment (section 4a)
w missing d subscript (Eq 2.2)
title of 4b appears in the wrong place
A couple of suggestions follow that I consider interesting, though not essential.
7. In order to visualise whether datasets contain the same information, (for the METABRIC data)
it might be worth plotting a scatter plot of the individual inferred probabilities for pairs of
datasets (eg probability of death GE vs image) and highlighting the true cases in a different
colour.

8. If the three data sets contains the same information (e.g. ER- chemosens), can this be used to
distill the common biological feature that is surfacing in all three data sets?

The authors describe a novel method, FusionGP, for interpreting multiple types of clinical data,
including genomic information and tumor cell imaging. They clearly outline their methodology,
and test their model on both synthetic data, and a publicly available breast cancer data set with
comparisons to more simple methodologies that have been described by others. They are able to
assess which data points are most informative and the best predictors of clinical outcome. They
compare ER- and +ve breast cancers and chemosensitivity, and are able to hypothesise about
biological mechanisms from copy number and expression data.
This is an interesting and well-written article, and the model they present has interesting
implications to clinical data, especially as genomic analyses become more common place.
Edits needed:
Page 2, introduction, sentence beginning, “In particular, different types…”. Either need an “of” in
there, or say to “data types” instead.
Page 5, (e) Inference, when discussing computation time. They remark that there may be
difficulties with long computational times. More details on what types of data would make the
model too slow to run, or the number of data items that would make the method no longer
“tractable”.

Point 7 raised by Dr Morrissey seems addressable and would help readers visualise the
data/results.
Point 8 is interesting and we would be pleased if such results were included, but recognise that
this strays from the purpose of this manuscript.
In the third paragraph of the conclusions, prior to the sentence "From these analyses we draw a
number of conclusions:" I would like to see a sentence acknowledging to readers limitations of
two-fold cross classification and that caution in interpretation is warranted until independently
collected data sets are available for full validation of methods, since one cannot exclude technical
confounders contributing to classification results. Other limitations should be listed.

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-140501)
Dear Editorial Staff,
Thank you for accepting our paper for publication in Royal Society Open Science, and for sending
us the comments from both the reviewers and the associate editor.
Thank you for allowing us to remove the results on metastasis (discussion with Matt Allinson).

We apologise for the rules on data release which led to this, and are very grateful for your
flexibility in this matter.
We are happy to address the reviewers’ points as follows.
Associate Editor:
Point 7 raised by Dr Morrissey seems addressable and would help readers visualise the
data/results.
We agree, and think this is an excellent suggestion by Dr Morrissey. We have added the plots
accordingly (Figure 4).
Point 8 is interesting and we would be pleased if such results were included, but recognise that
this strays from the purpose of this manuscript.
We agree that this would be a very interesting extension to this work. We believe however that
this is a substantial amount of extra work, so would prefer to not include it in this current paper.
Savage has a PhD student who is currently working on matrix factorisation methods that would
achieve such a distillation of common biological features, and we hope to be able to submit at
least one paper on this for publication in the next 12 months.
In the third paragraph of the conclusions, prior to the sentence "From these analyses we draw a
number of conclusions:" I would like to see a sentence acknowledging to readers limitations of
two-fold cross classification and that caution in interpretation is warranted until independently
collected data sets are available for full validation of methods, since one cannot exclude technical
confounders contributing to classification results. Other limitations should be listed.
We agree with this point and have added a sentence in the conclusions to that effect.

1. Regarding the description of the model, it would be useful to describe the sparsity prior a bit

penalise the number of Ijd’s switched on. It would also be worth clarifying that Eq 2.2 is the joint
distribution for all Ijd’s for dataset d, rather than the distribution of a single Ijd.
We have added a paragraph below eqn 2.2 to clarify this.
2. I find the truncation and selected hyper-parameters for the beta distribution to seem like quite
a strong prior, as such it would be interesting to see a plot overlaying the prior and the posterior
for a couple of the examples to see how strong the prior actually is. Such a plot would also be

in 2c. Though which is which can easily be inferred, it would be better to use the same names.
Also, it was not clear to me what covariance function was used for the METABRIC data.
We have changes tables 1 and 2 to be consistent with the terminology used in section 2c. We have
also added a sentence at the start of 4b to state that the SE covariance function was used for the
METABRIC analyses.

4. The number of Ijd’s seem large and therefore might give MCMC convergence problems. It
would be useful to see some comment or plot on the convergence of the Ijd’s, perhaps a plot of
the posterior probability P(Ijd = 1) between a couple of the chains.
MCMC convergence can indeed be challenging for models such as this, which deal with high-
dimensional feature selection. We have added text to section 2f to discuss this. We have chosen
not to include posterior plots as it would be difficult to provide a useful summary over a large
number of parameters, but this is something we explicitly look at as part of our assessment of
convergence.
5. Which image features are selected for the case ER- where the image dataset is most
informative?
There was sadly not clear picture as to which image features were most important in this case. In
fact, most features were selected roughly one third of the time, which is likely to be the
redundancy we know exist in these features. We were therefore unable to comment usefully on
this in the paper.
6. A few typos: Binomial prior => Beta prior (2b in the text and Eq2.3) i_jd => uppercase I_jd(3rd
line of section 2b) Hu’s first moment (section 4a) w missing d subscript (Eq 2.2) title of 4b appears
in the wrong
We have corrected these.
7. In order to visualise whether datasets contain the same information, (for the METABRIC data)
it might be worth plotting a scatter plot of the individual inferred probabilities for pairs of
datasets (eg probability of death GE vs image) and highlighting the true cases in a different
colour.
