General:
1. The paper is well written, but the focus and tone are overly North American. Given that
this journal has an international focus, I recommend that the authors pay special attention to the
information that they included or did not include. For example, some readers will have limited
information on species that are discussed in this paper (e.g., in the Introduction, the authors
should indicate that the Brown-headed Cowbird is an obligate brood parasite that is known to
parasitize over 200 species). Use of some terms (e.g., AUM, Mountain Time, dugout) may be only
familiar to North American readers.
2. The authors occasionally write out numerals (e.g., line 277 on page 13). Be consistent,
but more importantly please follow journal format and style.
Introduction:
1. On line 60 of page 3, please provide the full common name (American Bison) and
scientific name (Bison bison) for bison.
2. On lines 54-55 of page 3, the term “host abandonment” should be “nest abandonment”.
3. On lines 63-66 on page 3, the authors indicated that the Savannah Sparrow is among the
most frequent cowbird hosts in the region. This is an exaggeration. Too often in the literature,
many publications point to the highest levels of parasitism for a species as part of their
justification for a study, when in reality, brood parasitism varies considerably among regions for
most species, including Savannah sparrow. Some might argue that this species is not among the
most frequent cowbird hosts based on the literature. There are many examples of low brood
parasitism in this region for this species (see Shaffer et al. 2003), including parasitism rates that
are comparable to those reported in this manuscript. Rather, I would point out here that brood
parasitism varies considerably for this species among regions, ranging from low (e.g. Igl and
Johnson 2007) to moderate (e.g. Davis 1994, Johnson and Temple 1990) levels of parasitism. See:
Igl, L. D., and D. H. Johnson. 2007. Brown-headed Cowbird, Molothrus ater, parasitism and
abundance in the northern Great Plains. Canadian Field-Naturalist 121(3): 239-255.
Methods:
1. On line 87 of page 4, there is no need to abbreviate Alberta, because it is only used once
on line 88.
2. On line 91 of page 5, “exotic herbaceous plant species” should be “exotic herbaceous
grasslands”.
3. On line 100 of page 5, AUM should be defined.
4. On line 105 of page 5, there should not be a comma after “48”.
5. On line 107 of page 5, a legal quarter-section typically is 64.7 ha rather than 64 ha.
6. On line 124 of page 6, define “dugouts. This term may not be familiar to many readers of
this international journal.
7. On line 129 of page 6, “etrex” should be “eTrex”.
3
8. In the methods on cowbird abundance surveys starting on line 146 of page 7, it is unclear
how the authors dealt with surveying cowbirds when they encountered two or more cowbirds
traveling or perching in a group. Even during the breeding season, cowbirds are gregarious and
often occur in groups of one or more females and multiple males. Also, did the observers count
males, females, or both male and female cowbirds?
9. The authors indicate on line 164 of page 8 that grassland songbird nests are “difficult to
locate behaviorally.” This is ambiguous, as nests do not have behaviors. I believe that the
authors were trying to indicate that grassland songbird nests were difficult to locate using the
behavior of the adult birds because of their furtive behaviors and cryptic plumages.
10. The authors use Mountain Time several times in this manuscript (e.g., lines 149, 168, and
169). Many readers of this journal outside of North America will be unfamiliar with Mountain
Time Zone. I recommend converting this to Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) zone.
11. On line 172 of page 8, it is not clear what the authors mean by “and nails”.
12. On lines 175 of page 8, the authors indicated that they used photographs to help confirm
species identity. It is not clear what identity is being confirmed. The identity of the host species
that built the nest? The identity of the eggs or nestlings?
13. On lines 196-197 on page 9, there appears to be an extra parentheses.
14. One thing that seems to be missing from this evaluation is Savannah Sparrow abundance
and how it may be influenced by oil and gas infrastructure. Are Savannah Sparrow densities
higher or lower near this infrastructure? For example, some songbirds (e.g., Vesper Sparrow)
may be attracted to oil and gas infrastructure, and thus may experience higher brood parasitism
levels where host and cowbird densities are both high.
Results:
1. On line 267 of page 12, the authors indicate that abundance nearly doubled between 2013
and 2014. Does this increase occur on both control sites and infrastructure sites?
2. In the paragraph starting on line 273 of page 12, please provide a summary of the
Savannah Sparrow nest locations (e.g., What was the average distance and range of distances of
nests from oil and gas infrastructure? What was the average distance and range of distances of
nests from roads?).
3. The readers provide no information on parasitism levels until line 278 on page 13. It
would be useful for the readers to have information on the parasitism rates for 2013 and 2014,
separately, given the nearly doubling of cowbird abundance between those two years. I
recommend adding a sentence with annual parasitism rates after the first sentence in the section
that starts on line 273 on page 13.
4. On line 310 of page 13, the authors compared their results to those of Ludlow et al. and
concluded that Ludlow et al. may not have found an increase in brood parasitism rates on
grassland songbird nests near oil infrastructure because Ludlow et al. combined nests from
multiple species, which would have lowered power to detect effects on parasitism rates. There
also may be a biological reason for the differences in the results for the two studies. Grassland
songbirds vary in their parasitism levels and their anti-parasitism strategies; combining multiple
species with different parasitism rates and behavioral responses to brood parasitism may have
masked any treatment effects.
5. On lines 366-367 on page 17, the authors indicate that drilling horizontally or
directionally will “reduce” the number of surface structures. Another method that has been
recommended recently in the literature to reduce energy infrastructure is to use multi-bore well
4
pads in combination with horizontal drilling. See: Thompson, S. J., D. H. Johnson, N. D.
Niemuth, and C. A. Ribic. 2015. Avoidance of unconventional oil wells and roads exacerbates

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This is a well-written manuscript on a topic of considerable importance in the mixed-grass and
short-grass prairie. Following are comments that I hope will help the authors improve their
manuscript, based on my interpretation of the review draft.
Lines 51-63: Most of the papers cited here apply to different locations, ecosystems, and host
species. The authors need to make it clear that patterns observed in other situations might not be
applicable in their study region and also better develop the need for understanding effects of
cowbirds in their study region.
Line 58: True, but it should be noted that effects of cowbird parasitism on many species of
grassland birds in the region are considered minor.
Line 87: “Within 50 km” suggests that sites were scattered around Brooks in many directions.
My interpretation of the manuscript is that there was one study area, and it would be preferable
instead to state something along the lines of “the center of the study area was approximately 42
km southeast (or whatever) of Brooks…”
Line 98: Study plots have not yet been introduced, so the object of inference isn’t clear to the
reader.
Line 100: It seems odd that stocking rates on plots varied by a factor of more than eleven, but
cattle density was not considered in analysis. The authors should provide an explanation of why
they chose not to consider effects of cattle.
Lines 104-107: It appears that “plots” and “sites” are used interchangeably. If there is a
difference between them, that distinction should be made clear. If there is no difference,
consistently using one term would clear up confusion.
Lines 106-109: Good elimination of potential confounding of cropland effects.
6
Lines 125-126: I am concerned that plots are not independent, as brown-headed cowbirds easily
move 400 or 800 meters (or more). I checked data sheets from some of the Breeding Bird Survey
routes I run (also in mixed-grass prairie), and definite spatial patterns (aggregations) in cowbird
presence and abundance are apparent among stops, which are located 800 m apart. I am not
familiar with the authors’ study area (a figure would be very helpful), but I highly doubt that
cowbirds were uniformly distributed, even without energy infrastructure.
Line 128: Please provide the maximum distance, rather than “> 1 km.”
Lines 143-144: The study and data analysis were certainly much cleaner as a result of selecting
sites that eliminated potentially confounding variables. The tradeoff, of course, is that inferences
that can be made from the data and ability to generalize results across the landscape are much
reduced.
Lines 146-147 and throughout manuscript: I never got a good understanding of what the authors
mean by “relative” abundance. I suspect they are acknowledging the absence of an adjustment
for detection, but they provide excellent justification for use of apparent (or naïve, or unadjusted)
abundance in lines 194-204. It might be more clear to simply use “apparent” or “unadjusted” (I
don’t like “naïve,” as it implies lack of awareness, which is certainly not the case in this
document).
Line 152: If plots are 200 m wide and transects were placed down the center or the plot, it
appears that some transects were within 250 m of each other, given that line 128 states that some
plots were only 50 m apart. These transects clearly are not independent.
Lines 193-202: I really like the clear and well-supported justification for using unadjusted counts.
I see far too many publications where accounting for detection is unnecessary and the subsequent
statistical gyrations overwhelm the purpose and content of the study.
Line 206: Many treatises have been written on the “correct” choice of a statistical alpha value. A
value of 0.05 is fairly traditional, and 0.10 is perfectly acceptable. However, the rationale behind
a choice other than the traditional 0.05 should be presented. I have noted in my comments that
the study area appears to be fairly localized and that many plots are relatively close to each other,
which reduces the independence of plots (i.e., cowbird abundances among plots are likely
influenced by plot proximity and show spatial autocorrelation). Because lack of independence
essentially reduces sample size, one might suggest that alpha be tightened up, rather than
relaxed, but it would be better to reduce degrees of freedom, then provide actual p-values based
on those degrees of freedom, which provides more information to readers.
Lines 211-214: It’s not really clear to me what was done. Perhaps the sentence would be better
phrased as “To determine if sites….had higher cowbird relative abundances, we first assessed
effects of infrastructure at the site scale BY including site type….”? I assume that site type was
included as a fixed effect and unique sites were included as random effects, but that too could be
clarified.
Lines 216-219: The use of bins is great as it allows examination of patterns at a finer resolution,
and the inclusion of bins and sites as random effects is clear.
Lines 220-224: It’s interesting that log(distance) was a better fit. GLMs were developed largely to
obviate the use of transformations. In line 224, rather than stating that delta AIC was greater than
0.7, it would be preferable to give the actual value. I assume it was between 0.7 and 0.8, but that
is not clear. If it is < 0.8, I don’t think much is gained by using the log rather than actual distance.
Lines 269-271: Both in terms of sentence structure and logic, it would be more clear to state
“…”abundance increase significantly WITH proximity to both nearest perch…” and remove the
word “increased” at the end of the sentence.
7
Line 279: This is exactly the sentence structure I’m looking for in the previous comment.
Lines 284-286 and elsewhere: Mixing information-theoretic and frequentist approaches is
generally frowned upon for a variety of reasons. Given the lack of independence among plots
and resultant loss of degrees of freedom, I suggest abandoning the p-values, reporting weight of
evidence for models with and without the fixed effect under consideration, and clarifying that the
sample plots are not independent. The authors might disagree with my assessment of lack of
independence; if so, they can easily demonstrate what level of spatial autocorrelation exists (or
not) in their data using correlograms or a similar technique.
Lines 301-310: Good discussion. I also would reinforce the important finding noted in lines 278
and 279 that overall brood parasitism was low.
Lines 330-332: It’s unfortunate that the study area didn’t include a wide range of landscape
characteristics to gain more insight into how these factors influenced cowbird abundance in the
study region.
Lines 568-568: This reference is incomplete.
Figure 1: The authors should explain how the distance shown in the figure was derived from the
log-transformed estimates.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
This is a well-written manuscript on a topic of considerable importance in the mixed-grass and
short-grass prairie. Following are comments that I hope will help the authors improve their
manuscript, based on my interpretation of the review draft.
Lines 51-63: Most of the papers cited here apply to different locations, ecosystems, and host
species. The authors need to make it clear that patterns observed in other situations might not be
applicable in their study region and also better develop the need for understanding effects of
cowbirds in their study region.
Line 58: True, but it should be noted that effects of cowbird parasitism on many species of
grassland birds in the region are considered minor.
Line 87: “Within 50 km” suggests that sites were scattered around Brooks in many directions.
My interpretation of the manuscript is that there was one study area, and it would be preferable
instead to state something along the lines of “the center of the study area was approximately 42
km southeast (or whatever) of Brooks…”
Line 98: Study plots have not yet been introduced, so the object of inference isn’t clear to the
reader.
Line 100: It seems odd that stocking rates on plots varied by a factor of more than eleven, but
cattle density was not considered in analysis. The authors should provide an explanation of why
they chose not to consider effects of cattle.
Lines 104-107: It appears that “plots” and “sites” are used interchangeably. If there is a
difference between them, that distinction should be made clear. If there is no difference,
consistently using one term would clear up confusion.
Lines 106-109: Good elimination of potential confounding of cropland effects.
Lines 125-126: I am concerned that plots are not independent, as brown-headed cowbirds easily
move 400 or 800 meters (or more). I checked data sheets from some of the Breeding Bird Survey
routes I run (also in mixed-grass prairie), and definite spatial patterns (aggregations) in cowbird
presence and abundance are apparent among stops, which are located 800 m apart. I am not
familiar with the authors’ study area (a figure would be very helpful), but I highly doubt that
cowbirds were uniformly distributed, even without energy infrastructure.
Line 128: Please provide the maximum distance, rather than “> 1 km.”
Lines 143-144: The study and data analysis were certainly much cleaner as a result of selecting
sites that eliminated potentially confounding variables. The tradeoff, of course, is that inferences
that can be made from the data and ability to generalize results across the landscape are much
reduced.
13
Lines 146-147 and throughout manuscript: I never got a good understanding of what the authors
mean by “relative” abundance. I suspect they are acknowledging the absence of an adjustment
for detection, but they provide excellent justification for use of apparent (or naïve, or unadjusted)
abundance in lines 194-204. It might be more clear to simply use “apparent” or “unadjusted” (I
don’t like “naïve,” as it implies lack of awareness, which is certainly not the case in this
document).
Line 152: If plots are 200 m wide and transects were placed down the center or the plot, it
appears that some transects were within 250 m of each other, given that line 128 states that some
plots were only 50 m apart. These transects clearly are not independent.
Lines 193-202: I really like the clear and well-supported justification for using unadjusted counts.
I see far too many publications where accounting for detection is unnecessary and the subsequent
statistical gyrations overwhelm the purpose and content of the study.
Line 206: Many treatises have been written on the “correct” choice of a statistical alpha value. A
value of 0.05 is fairly traditional, and 0.10 is perfectly acceptable. However, the rationale behind
a choice other than the traditional 0.05 should be presented. I have noted in my comments that
the study area appears to be fairly localized and that many plots are relatively close to each other,
which reduces the independence of plots (i.e., cowbird abundances among plots are likely
influenced by plot proximity and show spatial autocorrelation). Because lack of independence
essentially reduces sample size, one might suggest that alpha be tightened up, rather than
relaxed, but it would be better to reduce degrees of freedom, then provide actual p-values based
on those degrees of freedom, which provides more information to readers.
Lines 211-214: It’s not really clear to me what was done. Perhaps the sentence would be better
phrased as “To determine if sites….had higher cowbird relative abundances, we first assessed
effects of infrastructure at the site scale BY including site type….”? I assume that site type was
included as a fixed effect and unique sites were included as random effects, but that too could be
clarified.
Lines 216-219: The use of bins is great as it allows examination of patterns at a finer resolution,
and the inclusion of bins and sites as random effects is clear.
Lines 220-224: It’s interesting that log(distance) was a better fit. GLMs were developed largely to
obviate the use of transformations. In line 224, rather than stating that delta AIC was greater than
0.7, it would be preferable to give the actual value. I assume it was between 0.7 and 0.8, but that
is not clear. If it is < 0.8, I don’t think much is gained by using the log rather than actual distance.
Lines 269-271: Both in terms of sentence structure and logic, it would be more clear to state
“…”abundance increase significantly WITH proximity to both nearest perch…” and remove the
word “increased” at the end of the sentence.
Line 279: This is exactly the sentence structure I’m looking for in the previous comment.
Lines 284-286 and elsewhere: Mixing information-theoretic and frequentist approaches is
generally frowned upon for a variety of reasons. Given the lack of independence among plots
and resultant loss of degrees of freedom, I suggest abandoning the p-values, reporting weight of
evidence for models with and without the fixed effect under consideration, and clarifying that the
sample plots are not independent. The authors might disagree with my assessment of lack of
independence; if so, they can easily demonstrate what level of spatial autocorrelation exists (or
not) in their data using correlograms or a similar technique.
Lines 301-310: Good discussion. I also would reinforce the important finding noted in lines 278
and 279 that overall brood parasitism was low.
14
Lines 330-332: It’s unfortunate that the study area didn’t include a wide range of landscape
characteristics to gain more insight into how these factors influenced cowbird abundance in the
study region.
Lines 568-568: This reference is incomplete.
Figure 1: The authors should explain how the distance shown in the figure was derived from the
log-transformed estimates.

The authors have adequately addressed the concerns I identified, with two related exceptions.
For lines 125-126, I expressed concern that plots were not independent, i.e., positive spatial
autocorrelation was present. The authors pointed out that plots were more widely distributed
than I first perceived, which is good. The authors also noted that timing of surveys and the small
breeding home range of female brown-headed cowbirds would greatly reduce the possibility of
counting individual cowbirds at multiple sites. Spatial autocorrelation can be caused by many
factors. Endogenous factors such as sampling methodology and bird behavior, which the authors
15
mentioned, can certainly create patterns of spatial autocorrelation, but the authors ignored
exogenous factors such as land cover, topography, soils and stocking rates that influence where
cowbirds occur, creating patterns of spatial autocorrelation.
I wouldn’t be as concerned about this except that the authors also chose an alpha of 0.10, which,
as I mentioned previously, might be problematic if sites are not truly independent. Royal Society
statistical guidelines state that how temporal or spatial autocorrelations (if any) were dealt with
(pseudoreplication); issues associated with autocorrelation are further developed in publications
such as Lennon, J. T. 2000. Red-shifts and red herrings in geographical ecology. Ecography
23:101-113. It would be fairly simple and straightforward for the authors to actually assess
autocorrelation, such as through a correlogram.

General:
1. The paper is well written, but the focus and tone are overly North American. Given
that this journal has an international focus, I recommend that the authors pay special
attention to the information that they included or did not include. For example, some
readers will have limited information on species that are discussed in this paper (e.g., in
the Introduction, the authors should indicate that the Brown-headed Cowbird is an
obligate brood parasite that is known to parasitize over 200 species). Use of some terms
(e.g., AUM, Mountain Time, dugout) may be only familiar to North American readers.
<U+F0B7> We appreciate the reviewer bringing this to our attention and have added
additional background on brown-headed cowbird natural history (18, 66-
67).
<U+F0B7> AUM is now defined (116-117).
<U+F0B7> Time zones have been converted to Universal Time (UT) throughout.
<U+F0B7> Word dugout described further as: “dirt berms and construction dugouts
providing water for livestock” (148-149).
2. The authors occasionally write out numerals (e.g., line 277 on page 13). Be consistent,
but more importantly please follow journal format and style.
<U+F0B7> Written numbers changed to numerals throughout.
Introduction:
1. On line 60 of page 3, please provide the full common name (American Bison) and
scientific name (Bison bison) for bison.
<U+F0B7> Full common name and scientific name given (68).
2. On lines 54-55 of page 3, the term “host abandonment” should be “nest abandonment”.
<U+F0B7> Changed to “nest abandonment” (59).
3. On lines 63-66 on page 3, the authors indicated that the Savannah Sparrow is among
the most frequent cowbird hosts in the region. This is an exaggeration. Too often in the
literature, many publications point to the highest levels of parasitism for a species as part
of their justification for a study, when in reality, brood parasitism varies considerably
among regions for most species, including Savannah sparrow. Some might argue that
this species is not among the most frequent cowbird hosts based on the literature. There
are many examples of low brood parasitism in this region for this species (see Shaffer et
al. 2003), including parasitism rates that are comparable to those reported in this
manuscript. Rather, I would point out here that brood parasitism varies considerably for
this species among regions, ranging from low (e.g. Igl and Johnson 2007) to moderate
(e.g. Davis 1994, Johnson and Temple 1990) levels of parasitism. See: Igl, L. D., and D.
H. Johnson. 2007. Brown-headed Cowbird, Molothrus ater, parasitism and abundance in
the northern Great Plains. Canadian Field-Naturalist 121(3): 239-255.
<U+F0B7> We acknowledge the reviewer’s point, and have clarified: “Relative to
other ground-nesting songbird species breeding in the northern mixed-
grass prairie ecosystem, Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) is
among the most frequent cowbird hosts [28-30] with brood parasitism
rates approaching 30% of nests in some regions [28, 31]. However, it
should be noted that brood parasitism rates for this species vary greatly
across its wide distribution [25, 32]” (73-77).
Methods:
1. On line 87 of page 4, there is no need to abbreviate Alberta, because it is only used
once on line 88.
<U+F0B7> Changed to “Alberta” (103).
2. On line 91 of page 5, “exotic herbaceous plant species” should be “exotic herbaceous
grasslands”.
<U+F0B7> Changed to “grasslands” (106) and “exotic herbaceous grasslands” (108).
3. On line 100 of page 5, AUM should be defined.
<U+F0B7> Defined as “one mature cow and her suckling calf weighing a cumulative
1,000 pounds (a 920-pound cow with an 80-pound calf) requiring 26
pounds of dry matter (DM) forage per day” (116-117).
4. On line 105 of page 5, there should not be a comma after “48”.
<U+F0B7> Sentence has been re-worded (116-117).
5. On line 107 of page 5, a legal quarter-section typically is 64.7 ha rather than 64 ha.
<U+F0B7> Changed to 64.7 ha (129).
6. On line 124 of page 6, define “dugouts. This term may not be familiar to many readers
of this international journal.
<U+F0B7> Sentence now reads “obstacles such as dirt berms and construction
dugouts providing water for livestock” (149).
7. On line 129 of page 6, “etrex” should be “eTrex”.
<U+F0B7> Corrected (166).
8. In the methods on cowbird abundance surveys starting on line 146 of page 7, it is
unclear how the authors dealt with surveying cowbirds when they encountered two or
more cowbirds traveling or perching in a group. Even during the breeding season,
cowbirds are gregarious and often occur in groups of one or more females and multiple
males. Also, did the observers count males, females, or both male and female cowbirds?
<U+F0B7> To clarify, changed to, “...recording brown-headed cowbird abundance,
regardless of sex, heard or seen within 50 m of the observer” (190) and,
“we recorded observer location on the transect line, the bird(s)’s distance
from observer, and the bird(s)’s bearing, to allow us to calculate the
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates for each bird or group
of birds observed” (189-195).
9. The authors indicate on line 164 of page 8 that grassland songbird nests are “difficult
to locate behaviorally.” This is ambiguous, as nests do not have behaviors. I believe that
the authors were trying to indicate that grassland songbird nests were difficult to locate
using the behavior of the adult birds because of their furtive behaviors and cryptic
plumages.
<U+F0B7> Clarified as: “Because grassland songbird nests are difficult to locate using
behavior of adult birds, which are cryptic and secretive” (202-203).
10. The authors use Mountain Time several times in this manuscript (e.g., lines 149, 168,
and 169). Many readers of this journal outside of North America will be unfamiliar with
Mountain Time Zone. I recommend converting this to Universal Coordinated Time
(UTC) zone.
<U+F0B7> Converted to UTC throughout.
11. On line 172 of page 8, it is not clear what the authors mean by “and nails”.
<U+F0B7> Clarified as: “high-visibility pink chasers secured in the ground with nails”
(210-211).
12. On lines 175 of page 8, the authors indicated that they used photographs to help
confirm species identity. It is not clear what identity is being confirmed. The identity of
the host species that built the nest? The identity of the eggs or nestlings?
<U+F0B7> Clarified as: “Photographs were used to help confirm host species identity
in cases when the adult was not observed” (211-214).
13. On lines 196-197 on page 9, there appears to be an extra parentheses.
<U+F0B7> Removed.
14. One thing that seems to be missing from this evaluation is Savannah Sparrow
abundance and how it may be influenced by oil and gas infrastructure. Are Savannah
Sparrow densities higher or lower near this infrastructure? For example, some songbirds
(e.g., Vesper Sparrow) may be attracted to oil and gas infrastructure, and thus may
experience higher brood parasitism levels where host and cowbird densities are both
high.
<U+F0B7> In the introduction we added, “Because we have demonstrated elsewhere that
Savannah sparrow abundance is independent of distance to oil wells in this region
[33], Savannah sparrows were also useful as a focal species for our study as nests
were present at a range of distances from wells, allowing us to evaluate effects of
distance to wells on brood parasitism rates” (78-82).
Results:
1. On line 267 of page 12, the authors indicate that abundance nearly doubled between
2013 and 2014. Does this increase occur on both control sites and infrastructure sites?
<U+F0B7> Changed to read, “From 2013 to 2014, cowbird relative abundance nearly
doubled across both infrastructure and control sites...” (312-313).
2. In the paragraph starting on line 273 of page 12, please provide a summary of the
Savannah Sparrow nest locations (e.g., What was the average distance and range of
distances of nests from oil and gas infrastructure? What was the average distance and
range of distances of nests from roads?).
<U+F0B7> Added average distance and range from infrastructure, road, and perch
(321-323).
3. The readers provide no information on parasitism levels until line 278 on page 13. It
would be useful for the readers to have information on the parasitism rates for 2013 and
2014, separately, given the nearly doubling of cowbird abundance between those two
years. I recommend adding a sentence with annual parasitism rates after the first
sentence in the section that starts on line 273 on page 13.
<U+F0B7> Section 3.2 has been re-structured to discuss parasitism rates earlier, by
year, and in more detail (321-334).
4. On line 310 of page 13, the authors compared their results to those of Ludlow et al. and
concluded that Ludlow et al. may not have found an increase in brood parasitism rates on
grassland songbird nests near oil infrastructure because Ludlow et al. combined nests
from multiple species, which would have lowered power to detect effects on parasitism
rates. There also may be a biological reason for the differences in the results for the two
studies. Grassland songbirds vary in their parasitism levels and their anti-parasitism
strategies; combining multiple species with different parasitism rates and behavioral
responses to brood parasitism may have masked any treatment effects.
<U+F0B7> Excellent point, we have incorporated this comment into discussion (365-
367)
5. On lines 366-367 on page 17, the authors indicate that drilling horizontally or
directionally will “reduce” the number of surface structures. Another method that has

Comments to the Author(s)

This is a well-written manuscript on a topic of considerable importance in the mixed-
grass and short-grass prairie. Following are comments that I hope will help the authors
improve their manuscript, based on my interpretation of the review draft.
<U+F0B7> Thank you for your kind words. We found your comments to be very
helpful and insightful, and we appreciate your help in improving our
manuscript.
1. Lines 51-63: Most of the papers cited here apply to different locations, ecosystems,
and host species. The authors need to make it clear that patterns observed in other
situations might not be applicable in their study region and also better develop the need
for understanding effects of cowbirds in their study region.
<U+F0B7> Added: “However, these patterns are less well understood across mixed-
grass prairie ecosystems exposed to industrial development, or as a
consequence of energy development. If energy development in the Great
Plains does indeed facilitate cowbird brood parasitism, it may place an
additional stressor on grassland nesting songbird species in this region. ”
(53-57).
2. Line 58: True, but it should be noted that effects of cowbird parasitism on many
species of grassland birds in the region are considered minor.
<U+F0B7> Changed to read: “Cowbird brood parasitism is well documented in
grassland songbirds, though often at relatively low frequencies compared
with brood parasitism rates in forested ecosystems [e.g. 20, 25-26].
However, abundances of cowbirds in grasslands influenced by industrial
development might be elevated.” (63-66).
3. Line 87: “Within 50 km” suggests that sites were scattered around Brooks in many
directions. My interpretation of the manuscript is that there was one study area, and it
would be preferable instead to state something along the lines of “the center of the study
area was approximately 42 km southeast (or whatever) of Brooks…”
<U+F0B7> Our sites were, in fact, scattered around Brooks in many directions, as our
original wording implies. Our sites were up to 100 km apart, although
some were as close as 50 m apart. We realize this was not clear in our
earlier draft. We clarified this by editing the text as follows: “The
approximate center of our study area was located in Brooks, Alberta (50
33' 51"N 111 53' 56" W), with all study sites located within a 50 km
radius of Brooks” (103-104), and “The distance from the edge of a site to
the nearest edge of another site ranged from a minimum of 50 m (nest
plots – entire site) or 280 m (abundance transects – 100 x 800 m at site
center), to a maximum of 15 km.” (153-155)
4. Line 98: Study plots have not yet been introduced, so the object of inference isn’t
clear to the reader.
<U+F0B7> We now refer only to sites.
5. Line 100: It seems odd that stocking rates on plots varied by a factor of more than
eleven, but cattle density was not considered in analysis. The authors should provide an
explanation of why they chose not to consider effects of cattle.
<U+F0B7> We made this decision based on studies we have conducted elsewhere in
Canadian mixed-grass prairies. We clarified this by adding this statement:
“We did not include cattle stocking rates in our analyses here because
elsewhere we have demonstrated that brown-headed cowbird densities are
independent of cattle stocking rates in Canadian mixed-grass prairies at
the field scale [41-42], probably because cowbird home-ranges are very
large and extend beyond the borders of individual fields” (119-123).
6. Lines 104-107: It appears that “plots” and “sites” are used interchangeably. If there is
a difference between them, that distinction should be made clear. If there is no
difference, consistently using one term would clear up confusion.
<U+F0B7> We now refer only to sites.
7. Lines 106-109: Good elimination of potential confounding of cropland effects.
<U+F0B7> Thank you.
8. Lines 125-126: I am concerned that plots are not independent, as brown-headed
cowbirds easily move 400 or 800 meters (or more). I checked data sheets from some of
the Breeding Bird Survey routes I run (also in mixed-grass prairie), and definite spatial
patterns (aggregations) in cowbird presence and abundance are apparent among stops,
which are located 800 m apart. I am not familiar with the authors’ study area (a figure
would be very helpful), but I highly doubt that cowbirds were uniformly distributed, even
without energy infrastructure.
<U+F0B7> We agree with the reviewer that we could not eliminate this problem.
However, we took many steps to minimize it.
<U+F0B7> Some of this confusion arises because the distribution of our sites was not
clear in our original draft (Reviewer 2, comment 3, above, and comment 9,
below); this is clarified now. As explained above, our sites were widely
distributed and up to 100 km apart (50m-15km to nearest site). We also
clarified that, “Each site was located in a different 64-ha quarter-section
(800 m x 800 m land planning unit), which is approximately the average
size of a cowbird breeding home range (Rothstein et al. 1984),” (129-131).
We further minimized the likelihood that we detected the same individuals
in multiple plots by doing abundance surveys at plots that were never
closer than 280 m to another abundance sample plot (154), and by doing
abundance surveys at nearby sites in the same mornings or concurrently.
Because cowbirds move across the landscape extensively over the course
of the day, but in mornings (when perching to search for nests, and when
our surveys took place) are much less mobile (Rothstein et al. 1984), this
made it less likely that the individual cowbirds were recorded in multiple
sites during surveys. We also surveyed nests but not abundance at the
most nearby sites.
<U+F0B7> To clarify this, we added the following sentences: “We minimized the
likelihood that individual cowbirds were recorded at more than one site
during abundance surveys by selecting sites that were distant from other
sites when possible (this included not doing abundance surveys at 2 nest-
searching sites that were close to other sites); by surveying prior to 10am,
when egg laying occurs and movement of cowbirds is relatively local [43];
by conducting surveys at adjacent sites concurrently or during the same
morning, during this period of lower translocation; and by sampling
relative abundance within only the 50 m closest to each transect center, so
that abundance transects were narrower. Nonetheless, we recognize that
we could not eliminate the possibility of cowbirds occasionally moving
among a few of our sites.” (155-165)
<U+F0B7> We had hoped that we could make similar statements about BHCO eggs in
host nests (i.e., that it was unlikely that one female laid eggs in nests in
more than one of our sites). However, we have been unable to find
appropriate published literature. To try to fill in this knowledge gap we
talked to Dr. Spencer Sealy, the foremost expert in cowbird parasitism in
Canada, and also to Dr. Stephen Davis, who has published work on BHCO
parasitism rates in Canadian grasslands. Dr. Davis says he knows of no
data on how close together nests are that contain eggs from individual
BHCO. Dr. Sealy said that the work he’s supervised in a forested
ecosystem showed that the range in which an individual female BHCO
lays her eggs was “very small”, but he is uncertain whether that would
also be the case in grasslands. He says he knows of no equivalent research
from grasslands. We have found one indirect reference in the literature
that gives us a sense of how far brown-headed cowbirds travel among
parasitized nests: Thompson 1984 (Auk, 111: page 985) shows a graph
with home ranges for 6 “representative” brown-headed cowbirds that they
radio-tracked, and of these 6 birds, the maximum east-west and north-
south ranges during the breeding period of the day (i.e. in the mornings)
averaged 233 m per individual (based on our calculations using raw data
from their graphs). We did not add this to the manuscript text because it is
based only on these 6 “representative” birds. Nonetheless, given that most
of our sites were distant from one another, this suggests that it is
reasonable to assume that in most cases, individual cowbird females in our
study did not lay eggs in nests in more than one of our sites.
<U+F0B7> In summary, we believe that the best information available at this time
suggests that individual cowbird breeding home ranges are probably small,
and are unlikely to extend among our sites in most cases. Thus, it is
unlikely that individual BHCO females laid their eggs in more than one of
our sites, or that individuals were detected in more than one site. We
believe that we can confidently say that, if that ever happened, it was a
very rare occurrence. Thus, we believe that it is reasonable to treat our
study sites as independent in the analyses.
9. Line 128: Please provide the maximum distance, rather than “> 1 km.”
<U+F0B7> Changed to: “approximately 15 km” (155).
10. Lines 143-144: The study and data analysis were certainly much cleaner as a result
of selecting sites that eliminated potentially confounding variables. The tradeoff, of
course, is that inferences that can be made from the data and ability to generalize results
across the landscape are much reduced.
<U+F0B7> Yes. We wanted to focus on effects of energy development disturbance on
relatively intact mixed-grass prairie. We clarified this by explaining: “On
average, sites contained 7% exotic vegetation, and 42% of sites contained
some exotic vegetation. Our inferences are thus primarily restricted to
effects of wells in native prairies” (115-116).
11. Lines 146-147 and throughout manuscript: I never got a good understanding of what
the authors mean by “relative” abundance. I suspect they are acknowledging the absence
of an adjustment for detection, but they provide excellent justification for use of apparent
(or naïve, or unadjusted) abundance in lines 194-204. It might be more clear to simply
use “apparent” or “unadjusted” (I don’t like “naïve,” as it implies lack of awareness,
which is certainly not the case in this document).
<U+F0B7> Good point. We defined relative abundance as “an unadjusted index of
density” the first time we used the term in the introduction” (84).
12. Line 152: If plots are 200 m wide and transects were placed down the center or the
plot, it appears that some transects were within 250 m of each other, given that line 128
states that some plots were only 50 m apart. These transects clearly are not independent.
<U+F0B7> Our explanation regarding the plots was unclear in the first draft; we
realize that, as per the above comment, our original wording implied that
some transects might overlap. This is incorrect, and we apologize for our
lack of clarity. We corrected the wording to read as follows: “The distance
from the edge of a site to the nearest edge of another site ranged from a
minimum of 50 m (nest plots – entire site) or 280 m (abundance transects
– 100 x 800 m at site center), to a maximum of 15 km” (153-155).
13. Lines 193-202: I really like the clear and well-supported justification for using
unadjusted counts. I see far too many publications where accounting for detection is
unnecessary and the subsequent statistical gyrations overwhelm the purpose and content
of the study.
<U+F0B7> Thank you
14. Line 206: Many treatises have been written on the “correct” choice of a statistical
alpha value. A value of 0.05 is fairly traditional, and 0.10 is perfectly acceptable.
However, the rationale behind a choice other than the traditional 0.05 should be
presented.
<U+F0B7> We agree. We clarified this as follows: “All statistical analyses were conducted in
Program R [51]. Significance was evaluated using an alpha value of 0.10 because
we wanted to reduce the risk of making a Type II error, which results in
significant problems in conservation biology [56]” (246-248).
I have noted in my comments that the study area appears to be fairly localized and that
many plots are relatively close to each other, which reduces the independence of plots
(i.e., cowbird abundances among plots are likely influenced by plot proximity and show
spatial autocorrelation). Because lack of independence essentially reduces sample size,
one might suggest that alpha be tightened up, rather than relaxed, but it would be better to
reduce degrees of freedom, then provide actual p-values based on those degrees of
freedom, which provides more information to readers.
<U+F0B7> As above, our study area was actually very large, but we had not explained
that clearly. We believe that our revisions as per comments 3 and 9 have
resolved the problem mentioned here, as well. We note that the random
variable in the mixed model also helps to account for some of the
otherwise unexplained geographical variability in our data, although we
agree with the reviewer that the primary way to accomplish this should be
(and was) through the original experimental design.
15. Lines 211-214: It’s not really clear to me what was done. Perhaps the sentence
would be better phrased as “To determine if sites….had higher cowbird relative
abundances, we first assessed effects of infrastructure at the site scale BY including site
type….”? I assume that site type was included as a fixed effect and unique sites were
included as random effects, but that too could be clarified.
<U+F0B7> We clarified our methods as follows: “To determine if sites with oil and
gas infrastructure had higher cowbird relative abundances, we first
assessed effects of infrastructure at the site scale by including site type
(infrastructure or control) and year as fixed effects, and by including
unique site ID as a random effect site in this model” (254-257).
16. Lines 216-219: The use of bins is great as it allows examination of patterns at a finer
resolution, and the inclusion of bins and sites as random effects is clear.
<U+F0B7> Thank you.
17. Lines 220-224: It’s interesting that log(distance) was a better fit. GLMs were
developed largely to obviate the use of transformations. In line 224, rather than stating
that delta AIC was greater than 0.7, it would be preferable to give the actual value. I
assume it was between 0.7 and 0.8, but that is not clear. If it is < 0.8, I don’t think much
is gained by using the log rather than actual distance.
<U+F0B7> We added the range (0.7-2.3 AIC units) instead of simply saying > 0.7.
<U+F0B7> We agree with the reviewer that an improvement in fit of 0.7 AIC units is
very small, and suggests that the fit of both models is similar – however,
because the model with “log(distance)” had the same number of variables
as the model with “distance”, this comparison is not subject to the
problems often faced with AIC-based analyses (which arise because AIC
tends to be biased towards more complex models; e.g., Arnold 2010;
Mundry 2011). Therefore, we concluded that even though the
improvement in model fit with log(distance) was small, it reflected a true
improvement in the model, and thus we believe that it was appropriate to
use the index of distance that fit better. Ultimately we agree with the
reviewer that not much is gained by using log(distance); however, a little
bit is gained by improved model fit, and nothing is lost by using this index
of distance, so we still believe that log(distance) was a logical choice for
this model.
<U+F0B7> Clarified by adding exact values, “<U+2206>AICarithmetic = 0.7 and 2.3 for distance
to road and perch, respectively” (266-267).
18. Lines 269-271: Both in terms of sentence structure and logic, it would be more clear
to state “…”abundance increase significantly WITH proximity to both nearest perch…”
and remove the word “increased” at the end of the sentence.
<U+F0B7> Sentence changed as suggested (313-314).
19. Line 279: This is exactly the sentence structure I’m looking for in the previous
comment.
<U+F0B7> Previous sentenced changed to structure used here.
20. Lines 284-286 and elsewhere: Mixing information-theoretic and frequentist
approaches is generally frowned upon for a variety of reasons. Given the lack of
independence among plots and resultant loss of degrees of freedom, I suggest abandoning
the p-values, reporting weight of evidence for models with and without the fixed effect
under consideration, and clarifying that the sample plots are not independent. The
authors might disagree with my assessment of lack of independence; if so, they can easily
demonstrate what level of spatial autocorrelation exists (or not) in their data using
correlograms or a similar technique.
<U+F0B7> As above, this concern arises primarily because we did not explain our
methods clearly in the original draft. We believe we have resolved these
problems through our improved descriptions of our methods.
<U+F0B7> We also agree with the reviewer that mixing information-theoretic and
frequentist approaches is generally frowned upon in ecological research.
However, we agree with the statistical paradigm recommended by Roger
Mundry (2011), who states, “In my opinion, some scenarios do exist in
which both [null-hypothesis significance testing {NHST} and information
theoretic] approaches can coexist. … [for example] when one wants to use
NHST to test the effect of some variables but there are some additional
potentially confounding variables to be controlled for. Since including
many variables into a model might create overfitting and lead to inflated
variance (e.g. Burnham and Anderson 2002), a potential strategy to choose
a parsimonious combination of the control variables could be an IT-based
approach, also when the final inference about the test variables … is based
on NHST.” This is precisely the case for our study, where we chose to use
IT to select which nuisance fixed and random variables to include but
NHST to test for effects of the fixed variables around which our quasi-
experiment was designed around. Therefore, we believe that the paradigm
under which we have chosen to use both a frequentist approach and IT
approach is supported by the published literature.
<U+F0B7> However, we agree this was not clear in our first draft. We clarified the
rationale for our approach as follows: “We used information-theoretic and
frequentist approaches to our analyses, each for different reasons. We used
Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) [59] for two purposes: first, to
determine whether a random variable (site) and nuisance variables
improved model fit and should be included in the above models, and
second, to describe relative model fit (see below). For all other aspects of
statistical analyses, in which we tested the effects of the fixed variables
around which we designed our study, we adhered to a frequentist approach
[60]”, where citation 60 is Mundry 2011 (269-275)
21. Lines 301-310: Good discussion. I also would reinforce the important finding noted
in lines 278 and 279 that overall brood parasitism was low.
<U+F0B7> Thank you. Changed to read: “Although overall parasitism across our
study area was relatively low, the magnitude of the effect of wells and
associated infrastructure on increasing brood parasitism rates was very
large.” (353-355).
22. Lines 330-332: It’s unfortunate that the study area didn’t include a wide range of
landscape characteristics to gain more insight into how these factors influenced cowbird
abundance in the study region.
<U+F0B7> We understand the reviewer’s perspective here. However, this study was
intended to assess the effect of energy development on cowbird abundance
and brood parasitism in native prairies, because this is the most important
habitat for the declining species we studied. This represents about 60% of
the habitat in southern Alberta east of the Rocky Mountains, so it reflects a
very extensive ecosystem. In contrast, the habitats we excluded from our
study (paved roads, wetlands, trees, or steep topography) were much less
extensive in our study region. Overall, we made a conscious decision to
restrict our inferences to native prairie in order to get a clear understanding
of the impacts of brown-headed cowbirds in this ecosystem (e.g.,
discussions in Quinn and Keough 2012 about study design trade-offs).
23. Lines 568-568: This reference is incomplete.
<U+F0B7> Corrected.
24. Figure 1: The authors should explain how the distance shown in the figure was
derived from the log-transformed estimates.
<U+F0B7> Clarified by adding, “Distances were derived from calculating the inverse
log of the model output” to the figure caption.
Appendix B
ear Dr. Dunn and Dr. Padian,
We very much appreciate that you have given us the opportunity to address the final concern of the reviewer.
eviewer: “Endogenous factors such as sampling methodology and bird behavior, which the authors mentioned,
an certainly create patterns of spatial autocorrelation, but the authors ignored exogenous factors such as land
over, topography, soils and stocking rates that influence where cowbirds occur, creating patterns of spatial
utocorrelation.”
- To avoid this problem, we selected a study region in which the landscape is very similar throughout our
study area, including in terms of soil composition, topography, and land cover. Nonetheless, we recognize
the importance of ruling out the potential correlations that the reviewer is concerned about, and address
it below.
eviewer: “I wouldn’t be as concerned about this except that the authors also chose an alpha of 0.10, which, as I
mentioned previously, might be problematic if sites are not truly independent. Royal Society statistical guidelines
tate that how temporal or spatial autocorrelations (if any) were dealt with (pseudoreplication); issues associated
with autocorrelation are further developed in publications such as Lennon, J. T. 2000. Red-shifts and red herrings
n geographical ecology. Ecography 23:101-113. It would be fairly simple and straightforward for the authors to
ctually assess autocorrelation, such as through a correlogram.
- To address this concern, we calculated Moran’s I relative to distance classes among sites for the model
residuals of cowbird abundance relative to infrastructure (we used abundance, rather than probability of
nests being parasitized, because continuous (or ordinal) data provides a more sensitive index of spatial
clustering than does binary data. Further, abundance is correlated with probability of parasitism; as a
result, it should indicate whether clustering occurs in both abundance data, and in probability of
parasitism). As can be seen from the example of the graph included below, which illustrates distance
classes relative to Moran’s I, there is no trend for nearby sites to be correlated with one another; further,
all Moran’s I values are far from +1 (which would indicate clustering), and indeed are also far from -1
(which would indicate negatively autocorrelated data). Note that the sites closest to one another have
Moran’s I statistics that are very close to zero, indicating no evidence of spatial clustering. Thus, we
conclude that it is reasonable to consider the sites independent for the analyses.
- We added the following sentence to the text, to clarify this (lines 259-262): “We used Moran’s I to test
whether trends were spatially correlated among sites. As we found no evidence of spatial autocorrelation
(-0.17 < Moran’s I < 0.15; no pattern with distance class), we concluded that we could treat sites as
independent in our analyses.”
