There is probably good work here, but it is hard to assess in the current form, because of lack of
clarity in the text in many places.
Abstract: it is not clear what "our" refers to in the first sentence. Is this to be a UK-only study?
And what does "network dimensions" mean? Did the authors mean something like "network
structure"?
Introduction: needs expansion to properly explain what the aim of the work is. The phrase "in
order to faithfully replicate behaviour" is unclear - behaviour of what?
3
Figure 1: this is completely cryptic to me. What do the graphs mean? The caption "The rail
network in morning peak-hours are analysed" should read "... is analysed".
Figure 2: Chiltern Railways and Southeastern are drawn in the wrong places, and there is a typo
"Chiltren".
Figure 9: two variables are labelled "%", but the scale only goes to 1.
Footnote superscripts should come after fullstops, not before.
Eqn (4.1) - textual superscripts to mathematical symbols should be in text mode - thus
$k_i^\text{in}$.
"80 Km" should be "80 km". "Km" would mean Kelvin-metre!
Page 19 line 38 should not be indented. Line 54 should have a fullstop.
"percentage of train either cancelled ..." should be "percentage of trains either cancelled ...".
The heading "(iv) Random Node Removal Comparison" has too many adjectival nouns. Better
would be "(iv) Comparison of removal of random nodes".
The use of the slash symbol should be avoided because of its ambiguity - "removal/attack" (not
"removal / attack") should be "removal or attack", if that is what is meant. "and / or" should be
"and/or".
All graphs are of poor graphic quality, with thin lines and weak fonts. These should be redone
with publication-quality software, e.g. matplotlib.
Bibliography: This is all very sloppy, with character encoding errors like "CaÃ´sizares", and
initials wrongly formatted, as in "Rodrigue JP" which should be "Rodrigue, J. P.".

Appendix A
Review for “Resilience or Robustness: Identifying Topological Vulnerabilities in Rail Networks”
(RSOS-181301)
Reviewer: Dr. Christos Ellinas; Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol (UK)
Overall
The authors present an interesting study of the London Urban Rail Network, with a particular focus
on linking its performance to certain topological features, which themselves are associated with
robustness and/or resilience. Overall, the analysis is sound, and the paper adequately written.
However, there are numerous aspects which need to be reworked and polished before this paper
can be published. Therefore, I suggest Accept with Major Revisions on this instance. My comments
are included below:
Structure
Lack of a Literature Review. As it stands, the paper contains no explicit ‘Background’ section – nor
any associated Lit Rev – which challenges the ability of the Reader to embrace the context and
appreciate this paper’s contribution.
Writing
Paper needs tighter writing. Writing needs to be improved, particularly focusing on: (i) inconsistent
sentences, and (ii) inappropriate sentencing. As an example of point (i), the sentence in p.1, line 8-10
makes two related but distinct points which are not well aligned: “Transportation networks are
challenging to model” refers to a general modelling challenge related to the system of interest;
“large-scale agent based simulation models need to include passenger behaviour [….]” refers to the
specific challenges of using agent based modelling for this situation. Despite both being correct
points, they are not linked in any consistent matter within this sentence, leaving the Reader unsure
on what its purpose is. A second example can be found in p.3, line 26-28, which states that “The
challenge with defining trophic coherence in real data driven networks is that it requires some pre-
processing: unlike the already studied networks in other works (e.g., food webs) the London Urban
Rail Network in peak-hours does not have predefined basal nodes”. What the Authors seem to want
to convey is that this specific dataset requires pre-processing because there is no single root or leaf
node(s) (i.e., nodes with in-degree or out-degree of 0, respectively). However, this sentence is rather
inconsistent, insinuating that the challenge lies in the fact that this network requires pre-processing,
which is false, as all networks require some pre-processing to make them usable/useful. Also note
that food webs are indeed, real data-derived [not driven] networks. Another example can be found
in p.8, line 44-46. As an example of point (ii), several sentences begin with “On the other hand” (e.g.,
p.1, line 44) without a prior point being made using the sentence “On one hand”. This sentencing is
imprecise and is good practice to be avoided.
Sentences need to be correctly supported. Several points are made without appropriate referencing
which undermine the confidence of the Reader on their validity. For example, sentence in p.1, line
35-37 makes a grand statement (e.g., “Vulnerability is a major problem in the study of complex
networks”) without proper support i.e., no evidence or references. In conjunction with the lack of a
dedicated ‘Background’ section, this sort of statements offer no value to the paper and can
undermine the confidence of the Reader to the Authors. A somewhat related example is the
sentence in p.1, line 54-55: “However, such approaches depend strongly on assumptions about the
details of the dynamics or the number of neighbours required for a node to function”. In this case,
the Authors use a classical paper to justify this point [May 1972]. However, it is increasingly hard to
convince the Reader that the use of a +40 year old reference can justify a knowledge gap for a 2018
study. Another relevant example can be found in p.3, line 44-45 which argues that since robustness
“is not rigorously defined, proxy measures may yield a more holistic insight”. In this instance the
Reader is led into an inconsistent line of argument: Are the authors arguing that because robustness
is not rigorously defined, measures that are also not rigorously defined are a better fit? Why would
that be the case?
Certain sentences which are central to the thesis of the paper are not appropriately supported. For
example, p.3., line 15-16 states that “The rationale is that hierarchical systems have fewer feedback
loops and are less likely to suffer from cascade effect”; this sentence is central as it makes the key
association of feedback loops being important to cascades. The Authors need to expand further, and
provide further support, on the validity of this sentence and why this is true as currently, is not
sufficiently convincing. This is important as certain topological features may promote or suppress
cascading effects, depending on the precise context (e.g., hubs can promote simple contagion, yet
can suppress complex contagions).
Footnotes need to be removed. I have not come across other Open Science papers which utilise
footnotes, and seeing that footnotes are not explicitly allowed in the Guidelines, I would suggest
their removal.
Analysis framework
Analysis is not truly multiplex. I am not convinced that the network examined here is truly multiplex.
Seeing that all links correspond to the same function (i.e., people flow), it seems that the network is
simply London's Urban rail network (as stated in Fig 2). This does not undermine the value of the
analysis offered by the Authors, and by being clearer on this point can actually strengthen the
contribution of the paper. On a related point, the paper is not clear whether the results focus on the
entire Urban Network (which seems to be the case) or on the subset networks that correspond to
each operator
Data & Results
PPM and CaSL appear to be strongly correlated. Authors should provide a Figure plotting the two
quantities (incl. some form of correlation measure) in order to identify possible correlations, which
appear to be present.
On a related point, I have a question on the nature of the data: are trains that initially experience
minor delays (and therefore accounted for in PPM) and eventually delayed more than 30 min (and
therefore accounted for in CaSL) included in both measures? If so, then It would be expected that
the PPM and CaSL would be strongly related. If so, then the Authors could potentially just use one of
them as a measure of performance, simplifying the analysis and sharpening the take away message.
Plotting approach. I wonder if there is any particular reason of why the Authors have not used box
plots when presenting the results, as they could provide a cleaner way of conveying the results,
without insinuating that the y-axis quantity is a function of the x-axis quantity (which current plots
do).
Define measures before use. Authors need to minimally define the measures before they use them
in Figures. For example, q/q^ ratio is use in Figure 3 before introduced or defined. This approach
forces the Reader to go back and forth in the paper to identify the meaning of the quantity, which is
not good practice.
Methods
Define symbols before their use. Define each symbol before being used. For example, eq. 4.1 uses
k_i^in, a_ij and s_j without defining them. Similarly, certain symbols are not use as they should be in
the text e.g., in p.11, line 15, the Authors states “out_degree/in_degree” whilst they have previously
introduced the k_i^in formulation, which they could easily amend and introduce here.
Sensitivity of flows filtering. It would be very useful for both this work, but also for future work, that
build on this approach, to illustrate the sensitivity of the approach as a function of T
Null model. The authors should elaborate with a few sentences on the nature of the null model (i.e.,
basal ensemble) in Section 4c (i).
Minor
Switch Figure order. I would suggest switching the order of Figure 2 with Figure 1, as the latter is a
more appropriate introduction to the dataset, whilst Figure 2 is more methodological.
Figure numbering error. Figure 10-12 and caption for Figure 13 should all be replaced by Figure 10a-
10c.
Please proof read the paper to eliminate the few typos present

1. Reviewer 1
..............................................................
(a) Literature Review
Specific Comment: Lack of a Literature Review. As it stands, the paper contains no explicit "Background"
section - nor any associated Lit Rev - which challenges the ability of the Reader to embrace the context and
appreciate this paper’s contribution.
Response: We have re-written the Literature Review and Background sections by adding more
examples of thematically similar work and better explained our choice for measures of network
resilience and robustness. Please see below:
(i) Related Work
UK rail network The UK rail network transport more than 1.7 billion passengers per year, of
which 1.1 billion passengers commute in the London area [1]. According to the Office of Rail
and Road [2], in the last year in the London area, only 86.9% passenger trains arrived on time
and 4.8% of the journeys experienced cancellations or significantly lateness. Often these delays
are interrelated and the relationship between cascade effects and network dynamics is not well
understood.
In current literature, most of the proposed studies consider natural or man-made disasters,
but they do not consider the stress of the network during the peak-hours and how the structure
of the network created by the massive flows of people can influence their ability to maintain
a good service. For example, several graph based approaches have been proposed to improve
the performances by revising the design and maintenance of the rail networks [4,7], but do not
consider dynamic passenger flows. Other studies focus on specific extreme scenarios [5,6] or
unfavorable conditions [3] that cause disruptions.
As our data shows, under the same external conditions, the major rail companies in and
around London reach dramatically different performance levels. In this work we hypothesize that
this difference can in part be attributed to the peak passenger demand. A coupling relationship
between flow and network structure can tease out the indicative measures that correlate strongly
with overall performance.
Vulnerability of Transport Networks The concept of vulnerability of transportation network,
introduced in the literature by Berdica [8], is generally defined as the susceptibility to
disruptions that could cause considerable reductions in network service or the ability to use a
particular network link or route at a given time. Many have applied general network science
disruption analysis. For example, several studies [11–13] have been conducted for modelling
railway vulnerability with promising predictive results. Bababeik et al. [10] recently proposed
a mathematical programming model that is able to identify critical links with consideration of
supply and demand interactions under different disruption scenarios. Recent work has also used
graph properties to infer interaction strengths and use an epidemic spreading model to predict
delays in railway networks [22].
(b) Paper needs tighter writing 2
Response: We have improved the rigour and logic of our proposed method. Please see both the
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
revised Introduction and Methods sections.
(c) Sentences need to be correctly supported.
Specific Comment: Several points are made without appropriate referencing which undermine the
confidence of the reader on their validity. For example, sentence in p.1, line 35-37 makes a grand statement
(e.g., "Vulnerability is a major problem in the study of complex networks") without proper support i.e., no
evidence or references.
..............................................................
Response: We have supported this in the Related Work section.
Specific Comment: "However, such approaches depend strongly on assumptions about the details of
the dynamics or the number of neighbours required for a node to function". In this case, the Authors use
a classical paper to justify this point [May 1972]. However, it is increasingly hard to convince the Reader
that the use of a +40 year old reference can justify a knowledge gap for a 2018 study
Response: We have updated our methodological review for resilience and robustness, please
see below:
The concepts of resilience and robustness on networks admit various interpretations and
definitions [23,26]. A generally accepted definition of stability is for when the system performance
returns to a desirable state. For homogeneous linear stability, one might equate resilience with
equilibrium points and look at the leading eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix [24]. When linear
stability is not suitable due to complex dynamics, many authors [15–19] have studied system
resilience from different perspectives. Some consider the dynamic response (e.g. time to recovery)
of the whole system after a specific disruption [19], whilst others use random perturbations to
numerically quantify system response [20].
In terms of robustness, a common definition is the number of nodes that must be removed
in order for the network to break down is a popular measure of its robustness [25]. Whilst such
approaches depend strongly on assumptions about the system, it generally maps well to railway
systems [14].
Specific Comment: Another relevant example can be found in p.3, line 44-45 which argues that since
robustness "is not rigorously defined, proxy measures may yield a more holistic insight". In this instance
the reader is led into an inconsistent line of argument: Are the authors arguing that because robustness is
not rigorously defined, measures that are also not rigorously defined are a better fit? Why would that be the
case?
Response: Our logic is as follows. As there exist no singular mathematically grounded logic
for robustness, a variety of robustness measures are used to compare against real railway
performance. As such, we are not arguing that alternative robustness measures are better, but
that we are using a variety to establish a wider evidence base.
Specific Comment: Certain sentences which are central to the thesis of the paper are not appropriately
supported. For example, p.3., line 15-16 states that "The rationale is that hierarchical systems have fewer
feedback loops and are less likely to suffer from cascade effect"; this sentence is central as it makes the
key association of feedback loops being important to cascades. The Authors need to expand further, and
provide further support, on the validity of this sentence and why this is true as currently, is not sufficiently
convincing. This is important as certain topological features may promote or suppress cascading effects,
depending on the precise context (e.g., hubs can promote simple contagion, yet can suppress complex
contagions).
Response: We substantiate our proposed method more rigorously here. When networks are
modeled as a discrete linear time invariant (LTI) system with a defined input and output [21],
the dynamic response stability is defined by the location of roots of its transfer function (negative
domain). In such a case, absence of feedback loops ensures stability. Presence of feedback loops 3
will cause non-zero roots and risk instability. When we consider a complex network with ~ N 2
input output combinations, the transfer function cannot be defined. As such, we measure the
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
overall network incoherence, which is a compressed figure of merit for how many feedback loops
exist.
(d) Footnotes need to be removed
Response: We moved the footnotes to the main text.
..............................................................
(e) Analysis is not truly multiplex.
Specific Comment: I am not convinced that the network examined here is truly multiplex. Seeing that all
links correspond to the same function (i.e., people flow), it seems that the network is simply London’s Urban
rail network (as stated in Fig 2). This does not undermine the value of the analysis offered by the Authors,
and by being clearer on this point can actually strengthen the contribution of the paper. paper. On a related
point, the paper is not clear whether the results focus on the entire Urban Network (which seems to be the
case) or on the subset networks that correspond to each operator
Response: We consider it a multiplex network because it is the composition of different railway
networks with some overlapping nodes (multiplex stations). Multiplex stations of different
companies cannot be collapsed together because they reach different points (stations) depending
on the network they belong to. One one hand the passenger flows can be merged by adding up the
flow volumes in the links shared between companies, this general network is then used to perform
further analysis on the overall resilience and robustness and to define some common parameters
(e.g., filter flows threshold). On the other hand, the rail networks are studied separately to
measure their robustness and resilience and to compare these values with their performances
(i.e., PPM and CaSL).
(f) PPM and CaSL appear to be strongly correlated
Specific Comment: Authors should provide a Figure plotting the two quantities (incl. some form of
correlation measure) in order to identify possible correlations, which appear to be present. On a related
point, I have a question on the nature of the data: are trains that initially experience minor delays (and
therefore accounted for in PPM) and eventually delayed more than 30 min (and therefore accounted for
in CaSL) included in both measures? If so, then It would be expected that the PPM and CaSL would be
strongly related. If so, then the Authors could potentially just use one of them as a measure of performance,
simplifying the analysis and sharpening the take away message.
Response: PPM provides the percentage of trains that reach their destination station within 5
minutes. CaSL measures the percentage of trains that are cancelled or significantly in delay (more
30 minutes). In our paper we define oPPM as the opposite of PPM (oPPM = 100% - PPM) to
evidence this possible correlation between PPM and CaSL. Generally speaking, we expect some
correlation but we want to discriminate companies that struggle to reach their destination in
time but never have major disruptions (high oPPM and low CaSL) from companies that usually
perform well but suffer several delays in case of failure (oPPM = CaSL).
4 out of 5 analysed rail companies (see Figure 1) show a strong correlation between these 2
measures while in one case (Great Western Railway) these values are not correlated, possibly
meaning that this company often has little delays (low resilience) but generally does not have
major disruptions (high robustness).
We used both measures to analyse the performances of the rail networks in order to consider
all the possible scenarios and to provide more detailed results for those who want to compare the
rail companies performances in other cities.

(g) Plotting approach
As recommended by the reviewer, we have re-plotted some results as box-plots, which are in
Section 3.
(h) Define measures before use.
Specific Comment: Authors need to minimally define the measures before they use them in Figures. For
example, q/q~ ratio is use in Figure 3 before introduced or defined. This approach forces the Reader to go
back and forth in the paper to identify the meaning of the quantity, which is not good practice.
Response: We added this paragraph at the beginning of Section 2.a to introduce the measures:
The degree to which empirical networks are coherent (or incoherent) can be investigated by
comparison with a null model. We use the basal ensemble expectation q~ as a null model to
compare the incoherence parameter of our rail networks (more details and the computation
of the basal ensemble expectation are provided in Section Methods, ). The trophic incoherence
measure q/q~ has a value close to one when a network has a trophic coherence similar to a random
expectation, it has a value lower than 1 when the network is coherent while it has a value greater
than 1 when the network is incoherent.
We replaced this sentence in section 2.a:
The comparison between the trophic incoherence measure q/q~ and the performance measures oPPM and
CaSL is shown in Figure 6.
with:
The trophic incoherence measure q/q~ compared with oPPM and CasL is shown in details in
Figure 6: more coherent networks (lowq/q~) are generally associated with lower delays (oPPM)
and cancellations (CaSL).
(i) Define symbols before their use
Specific Comment: Define each symbol before being used. For example, eq. 4.1 uses kiin , ai j and sj
without defining them. Similarly, certain symbols are not use as they should be in the text e.g., in p.11, line
15, the Authors states out_degree/in_degree whilst they have previously introduced the kiin formulation,
which they could easily amend and introduce here.
Response: Below eq 4.1 we clarified the meaning of the symbols used:
1st line trophic level of a node i, called si , is defined as...
Equation 4.1
where aij is the adjacency matrix of the graph and kiin =
P
j aij is the number of in-neighbours 5
(in degree) of the node i. Basal nodes kiin = 0 have trophic level si = 1 by convention.
A partial rewriting of the entire section has been performed as well.
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
In section 4.4.iii, the definition:
The largest strongly connected component in the network is identified and, given a number of basal nodes,
the nodes with the lower out_degree/in_degree ratio are enforced to be basal nodes (thus with trophic
level 1).
is replaced with the more precise and coherent:
This technique enforces a predefined number EN of nodes to be basal nodes (their trophic level is
imposed 1). The nodes to be enforced are selected according to their similarity to real basal nodes,
namely the nodes with the lowest ratio between incoming and outgoing edges. More formally,
..............................................................
the kout /kin ratio is computed for all the nodes, then the trophic level of the EN nodes with the
lower ratio is enforced to 1 (si = 1). If parts of the network are not connected to basal nodes, only
the largest strongly connected component considered.
(j) Sensitivity of flows filtering
Specific Comment: It would be very useful for both this work, but also for future work, that build on this
approach, to illustrate the sensitivity of the approach as a function of T
Response: In Figure 2 we show the behavior of the three measures used in this work for
different values of the threshold T (flows filtering approach) and of enforced nodes EN (basal
nodes enforcement approach).
(a) Incoherence of the (b) Trophic core - periphery (c) Degree core - periphery
network. ratio. ratio.
Figure 2. Behaviour of the three major resilience and robustness measures used in this work. The
basal nodes are selected with several parameter values of the two techniques proposed: the Basal
nodes enforcement parameter is the number of nodes (red) and the Flows filtering parameter is the
filter threshold.
It is crucial for a reliable analysis to select filter values that are reasonably representative of
some underlying data structure. Here, we look for the minimum filter value (so we do not remove
too much data), such that the measure of interest (e.g. coherence or core size) is invariant to
further filter value changes. Referring to Figure 2. For incoherence, we can see that Passenger
flow filter method is reasonably stable compared to enforced basal node method. Whereas, for
trophic core size, we can see that a relatively larger value of passenger flow filtering is required.
For degree core, we can see that any reasonable filtering or basal node enforcement produces a
reliable answer.
(k) Null model 6
Specific Comment: The authors should elaborate with a few sentences on the nature of the null model (i.e.,
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
basal ensemble) in Section 4c (i).
Response: In our work we compared the trophic incoherence of the rail networks with a
null model, the basal ensemble. The basal ensemble expectation q~ can be considered a good
approximation for finite random networks [27].
The basal ensemble expectation for the incoherence parameter is [27]:
r
L
q~ = -1 (1.1)
LB
where:
..............................................................
L = number of edges in the network
Lb = number of edges connected to basal nodes
The ratio q/q~ is used to analyse the coherence of the network: a value close to one shows a
network with a trophic coherence similar to a random expectation. Values lower than 1 reveal
coherent networks, while values greater than 1 incoherent ones.
For example, Johnson and Jones [27] found that food webs are significantly coherent
(q/q~ = 0.44 ± 0.17), metabolic networks are significantly incoherent (q/q~ = 1.81 ± 0.11) and gene
regulatory networks are close to the random expectation (q/q~ = 0.99 ± 0.05).
We provide this details in Section 4.a.i.
(l) Switch figure order
Specific Comment: I would suggest switching the order of Figure 2 with Figure 1, as the latter is a more
appropriate introduction to the dataset, whilst Figure 2 is more methodological.
Response: We redrew figure 1 to provide a more general explanation of our work and to
provide a synthetic description of the approach used in the paper.
(m) Figure numbering error
Response: Fixed. There was am incompatibility with a latex package.
2. Reviewer 2
Response: We have to correct some typos, and revise some phrases:
Specific Comment: Abstract - it is not clear what "our" refers to in the first sentence. Is this to be a UK-
only study? And what does "network dimensions" mean? Did the authors mean something like "network
structure"?
Response: We corrected the sentence.
Specific Comment: Introduction - needs expansion to properly explain what the aim of the work is. The
phrase "in order to faithfully replicate behaviour" is unclear - behaviour of what?
Response: We improved the introduction and provided a more detailed description of the aim
of the work:
Cascade delays and cancellations on rail transport can cause devastating economic damage and
dent consumer satisfaction. Existing knowledge focus either on improving operational practices
or consider pure topological analysis. We advance this, by considering both real passenger travel
flows and the network topology together. This creates a stronger understanding of its dynamic
vulnerability and resilience.
Specific Comment: Figure 1 - this is completely cryptic to me. What do the graphs mean? The caption
"The rail network in morning peak-hours are analysed" should read "... is analysed".
Response: We redrew Figure 1 in order to provide a better explanation of the proposed work, 7
please see Figure 3 in this document.
Specific Comment: Figure 2 - Chiltern Railways and Southeastern are drawn in the wrong places, and
rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. 0000000
there is a typo "Chiltren".
Response: The figure has been corrected, please see Figure 4 in this document.
Specific Comment: Figure 9: two variables are labelled "%", but the scale only goes to 1.
Response: it is the percentage of nodes that belongs to the core, while the scale refers to the
correlation index. We redrew the figure to better clarify this point.
Specific Comment: Footnote superscripts should come after fullstops, not before.
Response: We removed the footnotes in order to accomplish the Royal Society Open Science
publication standards.
..............................................................
Specific Comment: Eqn (4.1) - textual superscripts to mathematical symbols should be in text mode -
thus kiin .
Response: Thanks, we corrected this.
Specific Comment: "80 Km" should be "80 km". "Km" would mean Kelvin-metre!
Response: Thanks, we corrected this.
Specific Comment: Page 19 line 38 should not be indented. Line 54 should have a fullstop.
Response: Thanks, we corrected this (page 10).
Specific Comment: "percentage of train either cancelled ..." should be "percentage of trains either
cancelled ...".
Response: Thanks, we corrected this.
Specific Comment: The heading "(iv) Random Node Removal Comparison" has too many adjectival
nouns. Better would be "(iv) Comparison of removal of random nodes".
Response: Thanks, we corrected this.
Specific Comment: The use of the slash symbol should be avoided because of its ambiguity -
"removal/attack" (not "removal / attack") should be "removal or attack", if that is what is meant. "and
/ or" should be "and/or".
Response: Thanks, we corrected this.
Specific Comment: All graphs are of poor graphic quality, with thin lines and weak fonts. These should
be redone with publication-quality software, e.g. matplotlib.
Response: The graphs have been redone, please see Section 3 of this document.
Specific Comment: Finally, review the bibliography style.
Response: It has been reviewed according to the Royal Society Open Science format.
