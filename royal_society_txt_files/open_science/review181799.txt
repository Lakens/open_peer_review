Comments on RSOS-181799
The present study reported a superior thermoelectric property of ZnO thin films by the assistance
of Au nanoparticles and Al-doping. The topic is of general interest to the community, and the
conclusions were supported by the experimental results. However, the manuscript still suffers
from some problems before its publication. Detailed comments are listed below for further
improvement:
1. The introduction section should be significantly enhanced. I can see the necessity of the study,
but the novelty of the study was not well illustrated because a brief introduction of the state of art
peer researches, especially mesoporous thermoelectric materials, was missing.
2. Though I can manage to follow the message in the introduction section, the logic in some
places is rather confusing, e.g., line 46, page 1 “Hence, to control these factors…”. Please check
the entire section.
3. Please provide the fundamental data such as the porosity, or size of the SiO2/Si substrates.
4. I believe there was a mistake about the sentence of “mesoporous ZAO incorporated with Au
NPs (hereafter, Au NPs-AZO) thin films)”.
5. Detailed measurement process about the thermoelectric properties should be provided.
6. TEM images for both the pristine mesoporous ZnO and mesoporous ZnO incorporated with
Au NPs should be provided for comparison.
7. I believe EDX mapping results of the samples may also provide more valuable information
about the modification quality.
8. Please provide the Scherrer equation and size calculation process. Also only one Au NPs was
indicated in Fig. 1, which cannot provide a solid support for the Scherrer calculation results.
9. Error bars should be provided in Fig. 4~6 to indicate the statistical significance, otherwise it is
hard to determine the observed differences.

Comments on RSOS-181799
The present study reported a superior thermoelectric property of ZnO thin films by the assistance
of Au nanoparticles and Al-doping. The topic is of general interest to the community, and the
conclusions were supported by the experimental results. However, the manuscript still suffers
from some problems before its publication. Detailed comments are listed below for further
improvement:
Comment #1. The introduction section should be significantly enhanced. I can see the necessity of
the study, but the novelty of the study was not well illustrated because a brief introduction of the
state of art peer researches, especially mesoporous thermoelectric materials, was missing.
<U+25B6> The authors revised the Introduction part according to the comment of the reviewer.
Before revision (Results and discussion):
However, these factors have an interdependent relationship, for example in that the Seebeck coefficient
value decreases and thermal conductivity increases as the electrical conductivity increases [1-3]. Hence,
to control these factors independently, a mesoporous structure was adopted as a thermoelectric material
in this work because it has low thermal conductivity.
A mesoporous structure has pores within the range 2 to 50 nm [4], and since one was first reported
in 1992 [5], the analysis of these structures has markedly increased because of their low density, low
thermal conductivity, high specific surface area, etc. [6,7]. Moreover, these properties can be changed
depending on the pore size and pore arrangement of the mesoporous structure [8].
After revision (Results and discussion):
However, there is a limit to increasing the ZT value because the Seebeck coefficient, electrical
conductivity, and thermal conductivity have an organic correlation. Seebeck coefficient and
electrical conductivity in inversely relationship, and electrical conductivity and thermal
conductivity are in a proportional relationship [1-3]. Therefore, in this study, the mesoporous
structure was introduced to maximize the drop in the thermal conductivity while minimizing
the decrease in the electrical conductivity, and to increase the thermoelectric properties. The
mesoporous structure is a structure in which pores in the range of 2-50 nm are distributed
inside the material [4], and it was first reported by Mobil in 1992 [5]. The pores structure acts
as a phonon scattering center due to smaller size of pores and shorter distance between pores
than phonon mean free path, and drastically decrease the thermal conductivity term by phonon
(<U+03BA>ph). In addition, the open-pore structure has very large specific surface area and can be
applied to various devices [6, 7]. Their properties could be controlled by pore structure such
as pore size, porosity, and pore distribution in mesoporous structure [8]. Electrical conductivity
is a term related to electron transport, which is influenced by carrier concentration and
mobility. However, thermal conductivity is divided into term by electron (<U+03BA>el) and phonon (<U+03BA>ph).
When a mesoporous structure is introduced, <U+03BA>ph could be selectively decreased by an
introduction of mesoporous structure, and the thermoelectric properties could be enhanced.
Comment #2. Though I can manage to follow the message in the introduction section, the logic in
some places is rather confusing, e.g., line 46, page 1 “Hence, to control these factors…”. Please
check the entire section.
<U+25B6> As mentioned in comment # 1, authors modified the Introduction part.
Comment #3. Please provide the fundamental data such as the porosity, or size of the SiO2/Si
substrates.
<U+25B6> According to the comments of the reviewer, authors referred to the size of the SiO2 / Si substrate
in the “Experimental procedure” part and added the porosity estimation basis in the “Results and
Discussion” part. The porosity values had been already given in the previously submitted
manuscript.
After revision (Experimental Procedure):
In this paper, SiO2 / Si substrate was prepared by setting the size to 2 cm x 2 cm.
After revision (Results and discussion):
Porosity could be calculated from the difference between the refractive index of the original material
and the refractive index measured after the structure was synthesized. In this paper, the refractive index
of ZnO is estimated to be 2.1[26], and for ZnO with Au NPs was estimated to be 2.081. The ratio of
ZnO to Au was calculated and estimated. [18]. The measured refractive indices were 1.629 for pristine
ZnO, 1.695 for Au NPs ZnO, and 1.652 for Au NPs-AZO. Porosity was calculated based on refractive
index value. The porosity of the mesoporous ZnO decreased with Au NP incorporation from 33.2% to
26.1% due to the invasion of the pores by the Au NPs, causing the pore structure to collapse.

(2004) 1869-1872.
Comment #4. I believe there was a mistake about the sentence of “mesoporous ZAO incorporated
with Au NPs (hereafter, Au NPs-AZO) thin films)”.
<U+25B6> According to the comment of the reviewer, typo was revised.
After revision (Experimental Procedure):
mesoporous AZO incorporated with Au NPs (hereafter, Au NPs-AZO).
Comment #5. Detailed measurement process about the thermoelectric properties should be
provided.
<U+25B6> According to the comments of the reviewer, authors added detailed measurement process
about thermoelectric properties in “Experimental procedure” part.
After revision (Experimental Procedure):
The instrument allows measurement of film samples. The Seebeck coefficient is defined as the ratio of
the voltage difference to the temperature difference between two sides of the materials (S=<U+0394>V/<U+2206>T). The
temperature range could be set by using software system [19]. In this paper, the temperature difference
from 323 to 478 K at intervals of 50 K under a helium gas flow atmosphere.
Comment #6. TEM images for both the pristine mesoporous ZnO and mesoporous ZnO
incorporated with Au NPs should be provided for comparison.
<U+25B6> According to the comments of the reviewer, authors added TEM image and EDS data.
After revision (Fig. 1):
Fig. 1. TEM images and EDS results of (a) pristine ZnO and (b) Au NPs-AZO samples.
Before revision (Results and discussion):
Fig. 1 shows the TEM and EDS results of the Au NPs-AZO thin film. In the TEM image, although the
presence of the Au NPs at a size of almost 20 nm was confirmed, the pores were not clearly
distinguishable because of planar overlapping in the two dimensional TEM image. The TEM and EDS
results also clearly confirmed the existence of the Au NPs in the mesoporous AZO thin film.
Fig. 1. A TEM image and EDS results of the Au NPs-AZO thin film.
After revision (Results and discussion):
Fig. 1 shows the TEM and EDS results of the pristine ZnO and Au NPs-AZO samples. The
pores were not clearly distinguishable because of planar overlapping in the two dimensional
TEM image but in both images, several tens nanometer sized pores were well observed,
especially with pristine ZnO sample (Fig. 1(a)). In the TEM image of Au NPs-AZO sample (Fig.
1(b)), the presence of the Au NPs at a size of almost 20 nm was clearly confirmed. The
comparison data of EDS results of both samples also showed the existence of the Au NPs in the
mesoporous Au NPs-AZO sample.
Fig. 1. TEM images and EDS results of (a) pristine ZnO and (b) Au NPs-AZO samples.
Comment #7. I believe EDX mapping results of the samples may also provide more valuable
information about the modification quality.
<U+25B6> Authors agreed with the reviewer’s opinion. However, at this time, the EDS analysis by using
TEM was only possible with the point technique, there is a limit to the overall composition analysis.
The object of TEM and EDS analyses was limited on the confirmation of Au PNs in mesoporous
ZnO matrix, and darker Au NP image and EDS result including Au NPs can be sufficient for this
purpose. Authors request a generous understanding of reviewer.
Comment #8. Please provide the Scherrer equation and size calculation process. Also only one Au
NPs was indicated in Fig. 1, which cannot provide a solid support for the Scherrer calculation
results.
<U+25B6> According to the comments of the reviewer, the authors added Scherrer calculation as follows.
After revision (Results and discussion):
Using the Scherrer equation [23], the size of the Au NPs was calculated with the full-width at
half-maximum value of the Au (111) peak. The Scherrer equation is shown below.
<U+0001D43E><U+0001D706>
<U+0001D437>=
<U+0001D6FD>cos <U+03B8>
Here, ß is the width of the observed diffraction line at its half intensity maximum, K is the shape
factor set to 0.9, and <U+03BB> is the wavelength of Cu Ka. The size of Au NPs in AZO and ZnO was
calculated to be 20.7 nm and 21.2 nm, respectively which matched well with the TEM
observations in Fig. 1.
Comment #9. Error bars should be provided in Fig. 4~6 to indicate the statistical significance,
otherwise it is hard to determine the observed differences.
<U+25B6> According to the comments of the reviewer, authors added the error bar in Figs. 4~6.

Comments to the Author(s)
Comment #1. Figure 1 depicts the TEM image and EDS results of the Au NPs-AZO thin film,
which reveals formation of Au nanoparticles only. How sample was prepared for TEM analysis?
By ion milling or scratching-ff the material from Si/SiO2 substrate, dispersing it in some solvent
and drop casting it on Cu grid? TEM images of pristine mesoporous ZnO and Au-NPs-ZnO
should be provided for better understanding. In addition, the EDAX spectrum shows presence of
Zn, Au, O, and Cu atomic species. There is no peak due to Al. Why? It is better to provide the
atomic percentage of these elements in tabular form.
<U+25B6> According to the comments of the reviewer, authors added sampling method in Experimental
Procedure part as “TEM sampling was achieved by carbon coated Cu grid by dispersing the
powder in ethanol instead of ion milling or scratching. The powder was formed by heat treatment
of sol solution.”
Concerning with the TEM and EDS data of mesoporous ZnO for comparison with ZnO containing
Au NPs (Au NPs-AZO), the additional TEM and EDS analyses of mesoporous ZnO were carried out
and the results were given as Fig. 1(a). Please refer to the responses of the Comments #6 and #7
of Reviewer 1.
The composition of Al, Au and Zn in starting precursors were given in Experimental procedure
part as “the molar ratios of the Al and Au precursors to Zn precursor were fixed at 0.02 (i.e. the
atomic ratio of both Al to Zn and Au to Zn was 2 at%)”. This is not the final composition ratio in
the mesoporous Au NPs-AZO thin film but all the precursors were preserved in the film formation
process without a loss and then the starting composition can be used for the overall composition.
Concerning with the emission peak of Al, the emission peak from Al (around 1.5 KeV) should have
been observed in the EDS data of Fig. 1(b). However as shown in the TEM and EDX data, Au NPs
was focused during the observation and the emission intensity of Au would have been greatly
exaggerated. Then as shown in Fig. 1(b), Au emission peak near 1.5 KeV probably cover the Al
emission peak. In order to observe the emission peak of Al, authors should have done an extra
EDS analysis on AZO. However, due to the time limit (revision in 3 weeks), author could not obtain
EDS result for the AZO. Author request a generous understanding of reviewer. However, authors
believe that the effect of Al-doping in mesoporous ZnO thin film such as changes in crystallinity
of ZnO, pore structure of mesoporous ZnO, Seebeck coefficient, and electrical conductivity clearly
demonstrated the presence of Al-dopant in mesoporous ZnO thin film.
After revision (Experimental Procedure):
TEM sampling was achieved by carbon coated Cu grid by dispersing the powder in ethanol
instead of ion milling or scratching. The powder was formed by heat treatment of sol solution.
Comment #2. The authors have recently published similar work in Materials Chemistry and
Physics 212 (2018) 499 (Ref 17). What is the novelty in the present work? Whether the earlier
results (Ref 17) are superior (or inferior) to the present ones?
<U+25B6> The authors’ previous study (Materials Chemistry and Physics, 212 (2018) 499 (Ref 18)) was
about Au NPs incorporation in mesoporous ZnO thin film to enhance the thermoelectric property
by an increase of electrical conductivity from the high electrical conductivity and surface plasmon
effect of Au NPs. However, the incorporation of Au NPs had a deleterious effect because of pore
structural collapse. By the way, an incorporation of Al-dopant in ZnO matrix induces a stress in
thin film, which distorts the crystalline structure of ZnO and as a result, grain growth of ZnO is
inhibited and the pore structure can be maintained. The grain growth of ZnO hexagonal wurtzite
structure is inhibited because of the difference in the radius of Al3+ (0.054 nm) and Zn2+ (0.074
nm). That is to say, the pore structural collapse due to the incorporation of Au NPs can be
depressed by doping with Al, while still maintaining the increase in electrical conductivity. When
the ZnO structure is doped with Al, the electrical conductivity of Al-doped ZnO (AZO) was
increased because of an increase in carrier concentration.
In this study, this complementary effect of Al doping and incorporating Au NPs in mesoporous
ZnO thin film was investigated for the first time, for example, crystallization, pore structure,
porosity, and thermoelectric property of mesoporous ZnO thin film.
The Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity of Au NPs ZnO thin films in previous and
present experiments showed similar values. But the complementary effect of Al doping and
incorporating Au NPs in mesoporous ZnO thin film was found with XRD, GISXAS, Seebeck
coefficient, and electrical conductivity measurements data in this study as superior
thermoelectric properties of Au NPs-AZO than those of Au NPs-ZnO.
Comment #3. What is effect of size of Au NPs on ZT? As the surface plasmon resonance depends
on size and shape of the NPs, will it influence the ZT?
<U+25B6> In nanocomposite, the size of the nanoparticle is a factor that could significantly change the ZT.
Generally, as the size of the nanoparticle decreases, the grain boundary increases, and this
boundary could scatter the electron and phonon, affecting the electrical conductivity / thermal
conductivity. In this study, free electrons are generated by surface plasmon resonance to improve
the electrical conductivity.
However, as reviewer commented, as the surface plasmon resonance depends on size and shape
of the NPs, it influences the ZT. That is because the electrical conductivity and thermal
conductivity decrease as the size of the nanoparticle decreases [Ref#1]. In the previous paper,
electrical conductivity changes with the addition of Au nanoparticles was analyzed [17].

1487.
Comment #4. The manuscript contains a lot many typos and grammatical mistakes. The
manuscript should be re-written carefully, avoiding vague statements. (For example, the
statement"…. the pore structural distortion due to the Au NP incorporation in mesoporous ZnO
to enhance electrical conductivity was minimized by Al doping" seems unclear.)
<U+25B6> The sentence was corrected and the entire manuscript was English corrected by English edition
service. Authors hope no more typos and grammatical mistakes in the revised manuscript.
