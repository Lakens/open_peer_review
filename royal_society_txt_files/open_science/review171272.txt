The authors present the comparison of two surface preparation techniques for adhesion bonding
of composite parts, laser ablation and abrasion. Overall, the types of characterization performed
and described in this manuscript are appropriate for the work presented and the conclusions that
are drawn. Certainly there is opportunity to present more results regarding variation of laser
ablation parameters as there is only a single set of conditions discussed in this work. Addition of
more research results would lead to a more robust manuscript, but this I will leave to the
discretion of the editor. As it is, there is enough information to draw the conclusions that the
authors did that the laser ablation approach is advantageous relative to manual abrasion.
That being said, there are several places where important details are missing; namely the actual
description of the composite materials the research was conducted on and the abrasion
conditions that were evaluated. These things would need to be included in order to enable
another researcher to complete the work described here. Likewise, there are extensive issues
with language throughout this manuscript that must be addressed. I highlighted several of them
throughout the reviewed manuscript attached to this review, but was not exhaustive. This
manuscript needs to be thoroughly revised to address these language issues.
In the attached manuscript, I have raised a few other smaller questions or brought up
opportunities to provide a bit more detail. I would be happy to review the revised manuscript
should the editor decide to move forward for publication and the authors agree to the requested
revisions. (Appendix A)

The manuscript presents an investigation pertaining to the laser surface treatment in bonded
repair of composite aircraft structures. The work is important from industrial point of view and
has direct application. The language is normal and organization of the paper is good. But it
suffers from certain lacunae. The details are as follows:
1. Certain work needs replacement, like- Page -1, Section- Introduction, line no. 4, "Corruption"
needs to be replaced with "corrosion".. Section 3.4, line no. 2, "KV" needs to be replaced with
"kV"Please read whole manuscript carefully and correct such issues.
2. Authors have used modified form of ASTM D5573-99 (2005) for single lap shear strength test.
The modification to ASTM should be mentioned explicitly, wherever it is called in the
manuscript with the word "modified ASTM standard".
3. Elaborate the modification in test standard (ASTM D5573-99 (2005)) in section 3.7.
4. In results and discussion section 4.4, it is written, " the experimental results showed that the
laser surface procedure can provide uniform and consistent surface properties...". Please explain
the cause of the observation and include the data in its support.

The authors have done a good job at addressing grammatical issues. There are still several places
where the manuscript could be further improved but I will leave that decision to the editor's
discretion. Likewise, the authors have included additional information and clarified some of the
content already in the manuscript to further improve their results. I would still be curious if they
laser patterned a surface to have a roughness similar to what they had for the sanded surface if
7
they would still see an improvement in bond performance or if more adhesion failure would be
observed. If the authors have this information, inclusion of it would be very beneficial to make
this work more robust.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
Dear authors,
Thank you you very much for the work. The article is very interesting and a fruitful contribution
to this field of science. However, we have several comments as listed below:
-Chapter 1, Page 1, Row 25; Chapter 2, Page 1, Row, 47 and 56:
The authors are using extravagant words i.e. greater, dramatic, extremely. We recommend to use
other words.
-Chapter 3.2, Page 2, Row 50-52:
Same information about advantages of laser surface preparation, see chapter 2, page 2, row 14-16.
-Chapter 3.2, Page 2, Row 54-56:
Missing information about laser pretreatment patch/pattern. A sketch in relation of the fiber top
layer would increase the understanding of preparation proceeding (laser and polishing).
-Chapter 3.2, Page 2, Row 56:
The authors mention, that a pulse energy of 15 mJ/cm² were applied to remove the epoxy layer.
This is a relatively low pulse energy. We recommend to review this allegation.
-Chapter 3.2, Page 2, Row 56:
We would appreciate, if the authors would mention more information about the measurement
technique to detect the pulse energy.
-Chapter 3.2, Page 3, Row 1-3:
Missing information about the applied load, process time, type of machine (manufacturer, city,
country) of the polishing process.
-Chapter 3.3, Page 3, Row 5-10:
The detection of roughness and topography with optical measurement techniques is strongly
8
influenced by the chosen threshold wavelength. Could the authors provide more information
about chosen filters and thresholds? Could the authors tell more information about numbers of
measurements and the direction of measurement path according to the top surface layer/carbon
fiber rovings?
-Chapter 3.7, Page 3, Row 43:
Missing information about manufacturer, city and country.
-Chapter 3.7, Page 3, Row 48:
Missing information about the adhesive thickness.
-Chapter 4.1, Page 4, Row 1:
Could the authors provide more information about the measurement deviation of pretreated
surfaces. Did the authors achieve a homogenous surface roughness?
-Chapter 4.1, Page 4, Row 22:
Could the authors provide more information about the mentioned ablation threshold of the fiber
reinforcement?
-Chapter 4.3, Page 5, Row 6:
How many measurements were performed to detect the surface free energy of the pretreated
surfaces? Did the authors evaluate the deviation of the measurements?
-Chapter 4.4, Page 5, Row 18:
Could the authors provide more information about the evaluation process of the mechanical
tested samples? Did the authors involve the real fractured surface for the shear tensile strength?
-Appendix, Page 7, Figure 2 and Page 8, Figure 3 a):
The shown LSCM figure have a measuring surface of approx. 500 x 705 µm. It depicts the laser
treated surface. Unfortunately, any interweaving are not visible. In figure 3 a), a SEM image of
the pretreated CFRP surface is given. The single interweaving have a dimension of approximately
400 - 450 µm. Could the authors explain these differences?
-Appendix, Page 8, Figure 3 a) & b):
The depicted SEM images have the same magnification. The visual fibers apparently have a
different diameter. Could the authors explain these differences?
Thank you very much

In this work, laser surface treatment in bonded repair of CFRP aircraft structures was studied
systematically. The manuscript proved that laser treatment was an effective way in bonded
repair. The language is normal and the conclusions are developed logically and sufficiently. It is
my pleasure to recommend its publication on Journal of Royal Society Open Science with minor
revisions.

Thank you very much for the detailed answers.
Please find below further questions:
Comment 4 & 5:
The authors mentioned, that they measured the pulse energy. It was given an answer by a
calculation of the pulse energy. Did you calculate or measure it?
Comment 11:
In the mentioned reference an excimer laser system with a wavelength of 355 nm is used. The
mentioned values of 400 mJ/cm² are not comparable by applying an infrared laser source (1064
nm). An IR-beam is less absorbed by the Matrix than an UV-beam
Comment 13:
Thank you for your answer.
By using a pretreatment area of 12.5 mm x 25.4. mm ( according to ASTM D3165), the real overlap
of the surfaces could be less, more or the same. Did the authors consider the overlap of the
samples? The overlap has significant influence on the shear strength. However, the Information is
missing.
Comment 14:
In image 3b), the fibers have a bigger diameter in comparison to figure 3a.

Comment 4 & 5:
The authors mentioned, that they measured the pulse energy. It was given an answer by a
calculation of the pulse energy. Did you calculate or measure it?
Comment 11:
In the mentioned reference an excimer laser system with a wavelength of 355 nm is used. The
mentioned values of 400 mJ/cm² are not comparable by applying an infrared laser source (1064
nm). An IR-beam is less absorbed by the Matrix than an UV-beam
Comment 13:
Thank you for your answer.
By using a pretreatment area of 12.5 mm x 25.4. mm ( according to ASTM D3165), the real overlap
of the surfaces could be less, more or the same. Did the authors consider the overlap of the
samples? The overlap has significant influence on the shear strength. However, the Information is
missing.

20
21 Surface pre-treatment is one of the key processes in bonded repair of aircraft carbon fiber reinforced polymer
22 (CFRP) composites. This paper investigates the surface modification of physical and chemical properties by
23 laser ablation and conventional polish treatment techniques. Surface morphology analyzed by laser-scanning
24 confocal microscopy (LSCM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shown that laser-treated surface
25 displayed increased roughness than that of polish-treated specimen. The laser-treated laminate exhibited more
26 functional groups in the form of O 1s /C 1s atomic rate of 30.89% for laser-treated and 20.14% for polish-
27
treated as evidenced by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) observation. The contact angle goniometry
28
demonstrated that laser-treated technique can provide increased surface free energy and wettability. In the
29
30 light of mechanical interlock, molecular bonding and thermodynamics theories on adhesion, laser etching
31 process displayed enhanced bonding performance than that of polishing surface treatment. And these
32 properties resulted in an increased single lap shear strength and a cohesive failure mode for laser etching
33 while an adhesive failure mode occurred in polish-treated specimen.

37 2. Introduction
38 In the last decade, carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) has been successfully used in civil aircraft primary
39 structural applications (e.g. nearly 53 wt% composite materials of Airbus 350 and 50 wt% of Boeing 787) [1,2].
40 Compared with metals, advanced composite materials can provide superior properties such as light-weight
41 and high rigidity, corruption and fatigue resistance, low fuel consumption and emission reduction. On the
42 other hand, Composite fuselage can provide comfortable humidity and cabin pressure for passengers.
43 Excellent tailored properties and improved maintenance check period make the composite aircraft gaining
44
popularity [3,4]. However, the dramatic differences of anisotropic and heterogeneous behaviors make it much
45
more complex on the aspect of non-destructive test for damage assessment, maintenance theories, process and
46
47 methods, repair verification and evaluation, continued airworthiness and safety test than traditional metal
48 construction [5]. The national aeronautics and space administration (NASA) clearly emphasised that the major
49 challenges for the composites aircraft industry are CFRP structural maintenance and repair technologies [6,7].
50 Metal structural repair often use riveting and screws connect techniques while composite repair can make use
51 of bonded repair (sided lap or scarf based) to provide an aerodynamically smooth surface [8-10].
52 The initial CFRP material surface is inappropriate for bonded repairs due to some disadvantages such as
53 surface contamination, irregular appearance, bad wettability, low surface free energy and chemical inertness.
54 Therefore, surface pre-treatment is an extremely important processing step before adhesive bonding of the
55 substrate materials to improve the adhesion behavior and enhance the maintenance quality and reliability [11-
56 21]. Manual polishing and mechanical abrasion are the common surface treatment of bonded composite

repair. What else pre-treatment process like grit blasting, corona discharge, plasma modify, peel-ply and
1 chemical etching techniques have also gained extensive attention of academia and industry [22-36]. However,
2 these methods exist various shortcomings. Mechanical abrasion is an inefficient long-period process and
3 unable to avoid the human errors and inconsistencies. Corona discharge and plasma treatment could activate
4 the surface molecule to modify the chemical property and wettability while the equipment is expensive and
5 the depth of processing is only a very thin layer. Peel-ply is short-term storage and needs cryopreservation.
6 With regard to chemical etching method, solutions like strong acid/alkali/oxidant will pollute the environment
7 and are harmful to the operators. Besides, it can also damage the matrix or reinforced fibers.
8 Recently, laser surface treatment of composite materials is focused, as a kind of new and high-functionality
9
technique. Conventional surface preparation usually damages the substrate leads to reinforced fiber breaking
10
or peeling. Furthermore, it is easy to produce secondary pollution for these processing methods. On the
11
12 contrary, laser surface preparation is a non-contact and green progress which can be easily controlled and
13 automated. In addition, the strong and accurate laser beam energy can both change the chemical and physical
14 behavior of the surface through laser etching process by adjusting the laser parameters (e.g. working nominal
15 power, wavelength, pulse width). Laser-treated process can provide uniform surface behaviors to ensure high
16 reliability and repeatability for the aircraft structural repairs to avoid human errors and inconsistencies. Reitz
17 demonstrated that wavelength and energy input are the critical parameters for laser pre-treatment, and UV-
18 laser system can avoid near surface laminate damage while IR-laser break the fiber-matrix [37]. Henrik used a
19 Nd:YAG laser to study the influence of adhesive properties in a standard SCARF repair process and shown
20 that oxidised fibers can improve the adhesive strength [38]. Palmieri found that a 355 nm Nd:YAG laser could
21 ablate about 10-20 µm depth of the laminate surface without breaking fibers and will improve the
22
reproducibility and robustness in a production environment [39]. Belcher proved that higher surface energies
23
could result in enhanced shear bond strengths while laser etching and peel ply treatment displayed equal
24
25 adhesion values, better than grit blasting process [40]. Frank presented a ns IR-laser ablation with increased
26 wettability and surface energy in relation to surface grinding specimens [41].
27 Although the fundamental mechanisms for adhesion are not yet to be completely determined. Some theories
28 such as mechanical interlock, chemical bonding and thermodynamics theories on adhesion have been
29 proposed [42-46]. Parameters like surface morphology, roughness, active functional group, surface free energy
30 and wettability can greatly influence the adhesion properties. In this paper, a systematic investigation based
31 on laser-treated and polish-treated samples will assist in determining the various factors in different theories.
32 Furthermore, single lap shear strength tests and failure mode definitions according to ASTM D5573-99 (2005)
33 examined to verify these theories.

36 3. Materials and Methods
37
38 3.1 Materials and Methods
39 The investigated composite panel was 2 mm thick Boeing carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminate with
40 16 plies of a [0°, ±45°, 0°]2 satin weave prepreg. The parent laminate was fabricated in an autoclave with a
41 heating rate of 3 <U+2103>/min to 180 <U+2103> and then stayed for 2 h. Subsequently, cooled to the room temperature with
42 the same rate. The obtained laminate was cut to small square plates (5 cm×5 cm) for further preparation.
43
44 3.2 Laser and Polish Activation of the Bonding Surfaces
45 We choose polish-based theatment of the panel to compared with laser-based treatment of the bonding
46 surface due to the dramatic differences of the preparation process and the interface behaviors after activation.
47 Laser surface preparation is a non-contact and green progress which is easily controlled and automated. In
48 addition, the strong and accurate laser beam energy can both change the chemical and physical behavior of
49 the surface through laser etching process by adjusting the laser parameters. Laser ablation of CFRP parent
50 laminates was accomplished through Nd: YAG laser equipment of Inno Laser Corp. The working nominal
51 power of the system was equal to 14 kW output at 1064 nm and a 30 ns pulse width. The other parameters
52 were 90% current laser power, 100 kHz frequency, 1000 mm/s scan speed, 50 µm beam spacing and 25 µm
53 beam width with 2 passes. We chose these main laser parameters were based on the damage threshold of the
54 polymer matrix and the fiber (i.e. beyond the polymer’s ablation threshold and below the fiber’s ablation
55 threshold), which means to remove the epoxy resin without breaking the carbon fiber.
56 Another surface preparation was mechanical polishing abrasion. The abrasive process was a multilevel
57 polishing treatment to achieve exceptional smooth effect, and then use acetone solvent to clean the
58 contaminants and debris, finally drying the surface of laminates.

60 3.3 Laser-Scanning Confocal Microscopy (LSCM)
R. Soc. open sci. https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 3 of 18 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
Surface structures and roughness of the target laminates were observed using a laser scanning confocal
microscope (LSCM; VK-9710, Keyence, Japan). The classical parameter Ra [Eq.1, where Z is the altitude
1 difference of a given point having x coordinate] is based on the linear contour method, while the characteristic
2 parameter Sa [Eq.2, where Z is the altitude difference of a given point having x,y coordinates] is based on the
3 region contour method. Sa is more suitable for surface representation of micro-profile and anisotropic
4 composite materials.

3.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
12
13 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM; SU3500, Hitachi, Japan) was performed with an accelerating voltage of 5
14 KV to observe the modified morphology of the surface treatment samples. The specimens were no need to
15 sputtered with a gold-coating prior to measurement of the good electrical conductivity of CFRP and the new
16 technologies used in this instrument, thereby avoiding the disturbance of the gold layer.
17
3.5 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
18
19 The XPS analysis was used to investigate the chemical composition of the surface through Axis Ultra DLD
20 apparatus (Kratos Analytical, Manchester, UK). The monochromated AlKa radiation (hv=1486.6 eV) was used
21 to bombardment of the surface for excitation the emission of photoelectrons with element-specific binding
22 energy (BE). Each sample was observed at the energy range of 0-1350 eV. The measured BE peak position and
23 areas determined the elements and groups according to Shirley background subtraction.
24 3.6 Contact Angle Goniometry
25
26 The contact angles for the surfaces of laser-based treatment and polish-based treatment were tested with a
27 contact angle analyzer (First Ten Angstroms 1000B system, UK). The laminates were flat on the sample
28 platform, then about 3 µL probe purified water and glycerin were introduced on the surface of the panels
respectively with the sessile drop technique. The software will automatically photogragh and figure out the
29
contact angles after 30s until the drops on the panel unchanged. At least 5 measurements were collected for
30
each sample to obtain the average result.
31
32 3.7 Single Lap Shear Tests
33
Single lap shear tests were chosen to characterize the adhesive property after different surface activation. The
34
fabrication method of specimen was according to ASTM D3165-00 standard with a slight modification. Two
35
panels were stepped bonded with an epoxy adhesive (BMS5-154, usually used in the composite repair) only in
36
a 12.5 mm×25.4 mm area were pretreated by laser or polishing. The processing region was smaller and
37
adhesive we used to be less than the standard products. The curing process used vacuum bagging instead of
38 autoclave to simulate the normal aircraft composite bonded repair, and the experimental temperature did not
39 change. For mechanical tests, GFRP tabs were placed on the bonded samples to assure enough clamp force.
40 Shear strength of samples were carried out on an Instron Testing Machine (Model 8801, Instron Engineering
41 Corporation, Canton, MA) at a displacement rate of 1 mm/min at ambient temperature. A minimum of five
42 measurements of each sample were gathered to achieve average values of shear stress. The specimen
43 dimensions can be seen in figure 1.

46 4. Results and discussion
47
48 4.1 Surface Morphology
49 The surface geometric construction of adherend is one of the key parameters on bonded repair according to the
50 mechanical adhesion theory raised by Bcbain. Modest increase in surface roughness would enhance the
51 “mechanical interlock” among the adherend and adhesive. The target panels (5 cm×5 cm) were prepared via
52 laser-treated and polish-treated respectively to achieve various geometrical morphology of activated bond
53 surface where the detail manufacturing processes can be seen in Section 3.2.
54 LSCM images of CFRP laminates with two different methods were shown in figure 2 which indicate that the
55 laser etching process producing deeper trenches while the polish preparation resulting in a smooth surface. The
56 roughness Sa calculated by surface profilometry was 18.1 µm for laser-treated sample, 1.3 µm for polish-treated
57 sample, respectively. Moreover, the surface roughness of the untreated sample was nearly 0.6-1.7 µm (based on
58 the dust and any other contaminant above it, not shown here) which means laser treatment greatly improved the
59 surface roughness.

For further study the surface feature of the activated area, laminates were measured by SEM. Figure 3 shows
SEM micrograph of each activated panel. The polish-treated sample presented polymer matrix partly removed
1
whereas no fiber damaged in figure 3b, and this is because the velvety polishing cloth can only wipe off soft
2
epoxy resin except for hard carbon fibers under the polymer layer. On contrary, the laser can be employed to
3
accurately remove the surface materials (e.g. part of resin, the whole resin or both resin and fibers) via transform
4
the laser parameters. During the ablation period, the physical and chemical properties of CFRP surface can be
5 both modified. Figure 3a shows the activated surface of laser-treated, most of the resin was removed and the fiber
6 bundles were appeared without degradation. The contaminant and debris generated from the laser etching was
7 also blast off due to thermal energy, and this work would not need additional operations (e.g. polish/solvent
8 wiping). It should be noted that the laser parameters we chosen were according to below the ablation threshold of
9 the fiber reinforcement to avoid damage of the fibers. The influence of various laser parameters (e.g. laser type,
10 laser wavelength, pulse width, scan speed, laser power) were not considered and would be researched in our
11 future study.
12
13 4.2 Surface Chemical Composition
14 Based on the chemical adhesion theory, increase the chemical bonding activity between the adherend and the
15 adhesive layer can obviously enhance the joint strength. One approach is to make use of innovative active
16 adhesive to alter the raw coupling agents. However, the development of new product is expensive and long-
17 period. Interfacial modification of the parent laminate maybe is an effective solution for the composite repair. In
18 general, several surface treatments such as plasma, corona, irradiation, laser can be used to promote adherend-
19 adhesive interface properties and enhance maintenance effect. In the present work, we focus on UV laser which
20 brings significant attention in both industrial and academic for its reliability and automation.
21 Laser treatment was utilized to selectively remove the laminate surface by laser ablation. Physicochemical
22 reaction occurred simultaneously which revealed an increase of surface roughness and oxidation degree
23 respectively. XPS analysis is an effective approach to study the modification of surface elements and chemical
24 bonds, and the results were presented in figure 4 and table 1. Each activated surface shows O 1s peak and C 1s
25 peak which indicate the both sample containing oxygen group. The O 1s /C 1s atomic rate of polish-treated
26 sample was 20.14%, and that the laser-treated sample was 30.89%. It means the surface of laser-treated panel
27 presents more functional groups in favour of composite bonded repair. Figure 4b and figure 4d were the
28 deconvolution bands of the XPS C 1s peak. The spectra show four characteristic peaks for each sample and the BE
29 peaks located at 284.8, 286.0, 287.8 and 289.0 eV were corresponding to C-C, C-OH, C-COOH and C=O groups
30 accordingly. The content of low active C-C group of laser-treated sample was less than polish-treated one, on the
31 contrary, laser-treated sample exhibited more functional groups (i.e. the other three groups). Chemical analysis
32 identified that laser etching performed higher activity compared to polish preparation.
33
4.3 Surface Free Energy
34
35 Another theory described thermodynamic mechanism was carried out using wettability (a general parameter) to
36 further research the surface features of various treatment methods on CFRP. It is believed that the interface bond
37 strength was major derived from the molecular adsorption interactions between the adhesive and adherend. This
38 theory is based on the surface free energy which combined of polar and dispersive components. High surface
energy shows good wettability and strong interface adhesion in bonded repair of composites. The surface energy
39
could be calculated by modification of Laplace–Young’s method and Owens–Wendt–Rabel–Kaelble geometric
40
mean theory (Eq. 3).
41

44 Where <U+03B8> is the measured contact angle of each liquid; <U+03B3> LG , <U+03B3> LG and <U+03B3> LG are the liquid’s surface tension, surface
p d
45 energy of polar component and dispersive component, respectively (Table 2). <U+03B3> SG and <U+03B3> SG are the solid’ surface
46 energy of polar component and dispersive component, respectively. And the total surface energy ( <U+03B3> SG ) of
47 activated materials are the sum of the polar and dispersive components.
48 Four average contact angles of various liquids and surface preparation conditions are shown in figure 5. Laser-
49 treated sample displayed a lower contact angle for each liquid which means the surface exhibit better wetting
50 behavior. In addition, we calculated the surface free energy of different pre-treated panels due to OWRK. Table 2
51 displayed that both praparation techniques yield comparable disperse part of surface energy while laser-treated
52 one own dramatic higher polar part of surface energy. It was resulted that the total surface energy of laser and
53 polish pre-treated is 62.5 and 48.8 mJ/m2, respectively. Laser activated technique resulted in significant increasing
54 of the surface energy indicating the adhesive could completely infiltrate the adherend to provide a considerable
55 bond strength and improve the joint efficiency.
56
4.4 Mechanical Testing and Failure Mode
57
58 Apparent shear strength tests have been operated on CFRP samples depending on Section 3.7. In order to
59 illuminate the influence of different treatments on the laminate surfaces, initial material named untreated sample
60 was used for comparison. As can be seen from figure 6, the lap shear strength of untreated adherend is just

Page 5 of 18 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
8.1±1.1 MPa, while the shear bonding strength averaged 11.9±0.9 MPa for polish-treated sample and 16.5±0.4 MPa
for laser-treated one. The untreated specimen showed a poor adhesion due to the dust and any other surface
1 contaminants. Laser-treated specimen provided sharply enhanced mechanical properties compared to polish-
2 treated one for its increased roughness, chemical modification and wettability. Moreover, the value of standard
3 deviation of laser etched laminate is minimal of the three samples. The experimental results showed that laser
4 surface procedure can provide uniform and consistent surface properties in comparison to conventional
5 mechanical abrasion surface preparation.
6 The failure mode definitions of the three chosen specimens were according to ASTM D5573-99 (2005). The
7 untreated samples had an adhesive failure mode while laser ablated samples had a cohesive failure mode. The
8 polish-treated samples resulted in major adhesive and slightly cohesive failure mode which were assigned to
9 adhesive failure mode (figure 7). The fracture patterns revealed that the laser treatment technique produced high
10 performance adhesion which is observed as completely cohesive failure indicating a sharply increased adhesive
11 bonding strength than the conventional techniques.
12

14 5. Conclusion
15 In this research, two different activated composite laminates were manufactured through polish and laser
16 treatment to study the surface behaviors and adhesion properties in bonded repair of CFRP aircraft structures.
17 Three different adhesion theories (i.e. mechanical interlock, chemical bonding and thermodynamics) were
18 employed to reveal the surface bonding mechanism. The results demonstrate that laser-treated sample displays
19 enhanced roughness, active functional group and wettability than polish-treated specimen. Finally, single lap
shear strength was tested according to ASTM D3165-00. Laser etching shown good adhesive strength and
20
cohesive failure mode. On the contrary, polish treatment technique possessed bad bonding force and adhesive
21
failure mode. Laser surface treatment is a green and non-touch procedures without using solutions or bring in
22
secondary contaminations. Compared with conventional mechanical abrasion, laser-treated process can provide
23
uniform surface behaviors to ensure high reliability and repeatability for the aircraft structural repairs to avoid
24
human errors and inconsistencies.
25 Further investigations will be focused on the influence of laser parameters (e.g. working nominal power,
26 wavelength, pulse width) on the modification of CFRP physical and chemical properties of the surface. And then,
27 optimized laser process will be compared with distinct mechanical grinding (e.g. grid 60,120,240,360 and polish)
28 to study the industrial application of laser surface treatment techniques.

Appendix B
Dear Editor, dear reviewers,
Thank you very much for your comments on my manuscript (RSOS-171272) entitled
“A study of laser surface treatment in bonded repair of composite aircraft
structures”. I appreciate your very good assignment of the reviewers who are high-
academic-level experts in my research area. Both the reviewers’ and editorial office’s
comments are very valuable and constructive for us to improve the level of my paper.
We have taken advantage of the English editing services offered by MDPI and revised
the manuscript accordingly. I am now submitting the revised manuscript to you via
online submission system. The revised manuscript without editing trace was submitted
as the revised manuscript file and a version with highlighted editing traces was also
submitted as supporting information for review only. We believe that the manuscript
has been improved and hope it will be accepted for publication in Royal Society Open
Science.
The followings are our point-by-point responses to reviewers’ comments.
Responses to Reviewers
Reviewer #1
Comment 1: The authors present the comparison of two surface preparation techniques
for adhesion bonding of composite parts, laser ablation and abrasion. Overall, the
types of characterization performed and described in this manuscript are appropriate
for the work presented and the conclusions that are drawn. Certainly there is
opportunity to present more results regarding variation of laser ablation parameters as
there is only a single set of conditions discussed in this work. Addition of more
research results would lead to a more robust manuscript, but this I will leave to the
discretion of the editor. As it is, there is enough information to draw the conclusions
that the authors did that the laser ablation approach is advantageous relative to manual
abrasion.
Response: Thank you for your comment. The property of laser-treated surface was
dependent on the ablation parameters. In this paper we did not discuss the surface
behavior resulting from various parameters for two reasons. First, we focused on the
comparison of laser ablation technique and traditional manual abrasion to prove that
laser treatment was an effective way in bonded repair. The second reason was that there
are many important parameters (e.g. working nominal power, wavelength, pulse width,
pulse power) can deeply influence the ablation effect. It’s a a systematic study and we
have been working on it.
Comment 2: That being said, there are several places where important details are
missing; namely the actual description of the composite materials the research was
conducted on and the abrasion conditions that were evaluated. These things would
need to be included in order to enable another researcher to complete the work
described here. Likewise, there are extensive issues with language throughout this
manuscript that must be addressed. I highlighted several of them throughout the
reviewed manuscript attached to this review, but was not exhaustive. This manuscript
needs to be thoroughly revised to address these language issues.
Response: Thank you for the comment and suggestion. According to reviewer’s
recommendation, we rewrote the composite materials and laser treatment conditions.
Then, we have tried our best to find and correct the typos and grammatical errors. The
revisions are highlighted with red fonts in the revised manuscript. We think that after
careful revision, the manuscript could meet the requirement for publication.
Comment 3: In the attached manuscript, I have raised a few other smaller questions
or brought up opportunities to provide a bit more detail. I would be happy to review
the revised manuscript should the editor decide to move forward for publication and
the authors agree to the requested revisions.
Response: Thank you very much for your kindly comment and suggestion. According
to reviewer’s recommendation, we have changed and improved the quality of our paper.
The point-by-point responses were in the corresponding sections.
Reviewer #2
General comments: The manuscript presents an investigation pertaining to the laser
surface treatment in bonded repair of composite aircraft structures. The work is
important from industrial point of view and has direct application. The language is
normal and organization of the paper is good. But it suffers from certain lacunae. The
details are as follows:
Response: Thanks very much for the positive comments.
Comment 1: Certain word needs replacement, like- Page -1, Section- Introduction, line
no. 4, "Corruption" needs to be replaced with "corrosion". Section 3.4, line no. 2, "KV"
needs to be replaced with "kV"Please read whole manuscript carefully and correct such
issues.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. we have carefully revised the whole
manuscript. And the errors were corrected accordingly and highlighted with red fonts
in the revised manuscript.
Comment 2: Authors have used modified form of ASTM D5573-99 (2005) for single
lap shear strength test. The modification to ASTM should be mentioned explicitly,
wherever it is called in the manuscript with the word "modified ASTM standard".
Response: Thank you very much for the suggestion. Actually, two ASTM standards
have been used in this research. One of them was ASTM D5573-99 (2005) standing for
“Standard Practice for Classifying Failure Modes in Fiber-Reinforced-Plastic (FRP)
Joints”. This standard was used to judge the failure modes like adhesive failure,
cohesive failure, fiber-tear failure and so on. Another one was ASTM D3165-07 (2014)
which means Standard Test Method for Strength Properties of Adhesives in Shear by
Tension Loading of Sing-Lap-Joint Laminated Assemblies. The form and dimensions
of test specimen was the left image. In the paper, we have used modified form of ASTM
D3165-07 (2014). The diagram was in the right image. The only different was that
GFRP tabs (25.4 mm×25.4 mm area, 2 mm thick) were placed on the bonded samples
to assure enough clamp force and avoid specimen slippage. According to reviewer’s
recommendation, we have rewritten the section 3.7 to explain the"modified ASTM
standard". The revisions are highlighted with red fonts in the revised manuscript.
Comment 3: Elaborate the modification in test standard (ASTM D5573-99 (2005)) in
section 3.7.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. According to reviewer’s recommendation,
we have rewritten the section 3.7 to explain the"modified ASTM standard". The
revisions are highlighted with red fonts in the revised manuscript.
Comment 4: In results and discussion section 4.4, it is written, " the experimental
results showed that the laser surface procedure can provide uniform and consistent
surface properties...". Please explain the cause of the observation and include the data
in its support.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. The value of standard deviation of untreated
sample, polish-treated sample and laser-treated were ±1.1 MPa, ±0.9 MPa and ±
0.4 MPa, accordingly. The laser etched laminate is minimal of the three samples. It
means that laser treatment can provide uniform and consistent surface properties. The
essential reason was that manual repair can not make every abrasion keep the same
conditons (e.g. time, force direction and pressure, friction cycle times). However, the
laser treatment was an automation process which could achieve robust, reliable and
repeatable bonded repairs. According to reviewer’s recommendation, we have rewritten
the section 4.4 to explain the conment. The revisions are highlighted with red fonts in
the revised manuscript.
Once again, thank editor and reviewers for the comments.
Sincerely,
Li Shaolong

Appendix C
Dear reviewers,
Thank you very much for your comments on my manuscript (RSOS-171272.R1)
entitled “A study of laser surface treatment in bonded repair of composite aircraft
structures”. I appreciate your very good assignment of the reviewers who are high-
academic-level experts in my research area. All of the reviewers’ comments are very
valuable and constructive for us to improve the level of my paper. I am now submitting
the revised manuscript to you via online submission system. The revised manuscript
without editing trace was submitted as main document file and a version with
highlighted editing traces was also submitted as the revised information for review only.
We believe that the manuscript has been improved and hope it will be accepted for
publication in Royal Society Open Science.
The followings are our point-by-point responses to reviewers’ comments.
Responses to Reviewers
Reviewer #1
Comment 1: The authors have done a good job at addressing grammatical issues.
There are still several places where the manuscript could be further improved but I will
leave that decision to the editor's discretion. Likewise, the authors have included
additional information and clarified some of the content already in the manuscript to
further improve their results. I would still be curious if they laser patterned a surface
to have a roughness similar to what they had for the sanded surface if they would still
see an improvement in bond performance or if more adhesion failure would be observed.
If the authors have this information, inclusion of it would be very beneficial to make
this work more robust.
Response: Thank you for the positive comments and suggestion. Actually, the
roughness Sa calculated by different sanding surface treatments were aroud 1.3-6.0 µm
which was far below those of laser-treated surface (Sa=18.1 µm). The lap shear strength
of laser-treated adherend was determined to be 16.5±0.4 MPa, while the shear bonding
strength averaged 14.9±1.0 MPa, 15.5±0.8Mpa and 14.3±0.7 MPa for sanded sample
with grit number of 60, 100 and 240, accordingly. Their adhesion failures were
transition from adhesive failure to cohesive failure modes. It’s a systematic study and
we have been working on it.
Reviewer #3
General comments: Thank you very much for the work. The article is very interesting
and a fruitful contribution to this field of science. However, we have several comments
as listed below:
Response: Thanks very much for the positive comments.
Comment 1: Chapter 1, Page 1, Row 25; Chapter 2, Page 1, Row, 47 and 56:
The authors are using extravagant words i.e. greater, dramatic, extremely. We
recommend to use other words.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have carefully revised the whole
manuscript. And the words were corrected accordingly and highlighted with red fonts
in the revised manuscript.
Comment 2: Chapter 3.2, Page 2, Row 50-52: Same information about advantages
of laser surface preparation, see chapter 2, page 2, row 14-16.
Response: Thank you very much for the suggestion. We have deleted the repeated
sentence of Chapter 3.2, Page 2, Row 50-52.
Comment 3: Chapter 3.2, Page 2, Row 54-56: Missing information about laser
pretreatment patch/pattern. A sketch in relation of the fiber top layer would increase the
understanding of preparation proceeding (laser and polishing).
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. According to reviewer’s recommendation,
we have supplemented laser pretreatment patch of Chapter 3.2 “The laser pretreatment
patch was an automated process. We just teared off the peel ply from the laminate to
show up the top layer-epoxy resin, then put the samples on the operations area to
activated the surface by adjusting the laser parameters.” The top layer of CFRP was
epoxy resin which is the pretreatment target. The revisions are highlighted with red
fonts in the revised manuscript.
Comment 4: Chapter 3.2, Page 2, Row 56: The authors mention, that a pulse energy
of 15 mJ/cm² were applied to remove the epoxy layer. This is a relatively low pulse
energy. We recommend to review this allegation.
Response: Thanks for your comment. It’s our mistake. The working nominal power
was “1.4 W (10% laser power)” not “14 kW”. And the measured pulse energy was
about 700 mJ/cm². The revisions are highlighted with red fonts in the revised
manuscript.
Pulse energy= (1.4W/100KHz)÷(3.1415×0.0025cm×0.0025cm)=700 mJ/cm²
Comment 5: Chapter 3.2, Page 2, Row 56: We would appreciate, if the authors would
mention more information about the measurement technique to detect the pulse energy.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. According to reviewer’s recommendation,
we have measured the pulse energy. The revisions are highlighted with red fonts in the
revised manuscript.
Pulse energy= (1.4W/100KHz)÷(3.1415×0.0025cm×0.0025cm)=700 mJ/cm²
Comment 6: Chapter 3.2, Page 3, Row 1-3: Missing information about the applied load,
process time, type of machine (manufacturer, city, country) of the polishing process.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. According to reviewer’s recommendation,
we have supplemented the Chapter 3.2, Page 3, Row 1-3. “[Wet sanding on an
automated polishing machine (MP-1B, Wanheng, Shanghai, China) with 500 up to
1500 grain size sanding paper and polishing cloth] to achieve exceptional smooth effect,
the rotating speed and process time we chosen was 1,000 r/min and 2 min per period.”
There is no standard for applied load and the applied load we chosen was according to
experience. That’s why mechanical polishing process often lead to human errors and
inconsistencies, and laser-treated process can provide uniform surface behaviors to
ensure high reliability and repeatability for the aircraft structural repairs. The revisions
are highlighted with red fonts in the revised manuscript.
Comment 7: Chapter 3.3, Page 3, Row 5-10: The detection of roughness and
topography with optical measurement techniques is strongly influenced by the chosen
threshold wavelength. Could the authors provide more information about chosen filters
and thresholds? Could the authors tell more information about numbers of
measurements and the direction of measurement path according to the top surface
layer/carbon fiber rovings?
Response: Thank you for your comments. The laser scanning confocal microscope
(LSCM) has no filters. And the laser scanning wavelength we chosen was 408 nm. Five
measurements of each sample were gathered to achieve average values of 18.1±1.1 µm
for laser-treated and 1.3±0.3 µm for polish-treated sample. The photos we chosen in
Figure 2 were typical examples. The direction of measurement path was perpendicular
to the CFRP surface. The revisions are highlighted with red fonts in the revised
manuscript.
Comment 8: Chapter 3.7, Page 3, Row 43: Missing information about manufacturer,
city and country.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have supplemented the missing
information of the adhesive "BMS5-154, 3M, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA". The revisions
are highlighted with red fonts in the revised manuscript.
Comment 9: Chapter 3.7, Page 3, Row 48: Missing information about the adhesive
thickness.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We have supplemented the missing
information of the adhesive " a thickness of 0.125 mm". The revisions are highlighted
with red fonts in the revised manuscript.
Comment 10: Chapter 4.1, Page 4, Row 1: Could the authors provide more information
about the measurement deviation of pretreated surfaces. Did the authors achieve a
homogenous surface roughness?
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. Five measurements of each sample were
gathered to achieve average values of 18.1±1.1 µm for laser-treated and 1.3±0.3 µm for
polish-treated sample which shown that both the pretreatments can achieve
homogenous surface roughness. The revisions are highlighted with red fonts in the
revised manuscript.
Comment 11: Chapter 4.1, Page 4, Row 22: Could the authors provide more
information about the mentioned ablation threshold of the fiber reinforcement?
Response: Thank you for your comment. We have added the Reference [48] to explain
the ablation threshold of the fiber reinforcement. Fischer et al. mentioned "in addition
to this the ablation threshold of the matrix is exceeded with both pulse energies contrary
to the ablation threshold of the fiber. The ablation threshold of the fiber is up to two
orders of a magnitude higher than the ablation threshold of the matrix, thus the lower
pulse energy with 400 mJ/cm2 is not sufficient and the obtainable ablation depth stops
after removing the top resin layer". The revisions are highlighted with red fonts in the
revised manuscript.
[48] Fischer F, Kreling S, Dilger K. Surface Structuring of CFRP by using Modern Excimer Laser
Sources[J]. Physics Procedia, 2012, 39(9):154-160.
Comment 12: Chapter 4.3, Page 5, Row 6: How many measurements were performed
to detect the surface free energy of the pretreated surfaces? Did the authors evaluate the
deviation of the measurements?
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. The surface free energy was measured by
the contact angles with different testing solutions. Chapter 3.6, Page 3, Row 36 showed
that “At least 5 measurements were collected for each sample to obtain the average
result.”. Besides, Appendix, Page 9, Figure 5 presented the error bar of the different
contact angles by 5 measurements. Based on it, the surface free energy we measured
was valid and reliable.
Comment 13: Chapter 4.4, Page 5, Row 18: Could the authors provide more
information about the evaluation process of the mechanical tested samples? Did the
authors involve the real fractured surface for the shear tensile strength?
Response: Thank you for your comment. The mechanical test can be seen in Chapter
3.7, Page 3, Row 42-49. The scheme of single lap shear test samples can be seen in
Appendix, Page 7, Figure 1. According to reviewer’s recommendation, we have added
evaluation process " According to the analysis of mechanical adhesion theory, chemical
bonding activity and thermodynamic mechanism. Laminates with rough surface,
activated chemical composition and surface free energy could meet satisfactory
maintenance effect which shown higher mechanical strength.". And the shear tensile
strength matched the fractured surface. The revisions are highlighted with red fonts in
the revised manuscript.
Comment 14: Appendix, Page 7, Figure 2 and Page 8, Figure 3 a): The shown LSCM
figure have a measuring surface of approx. 500 x 705 µm. It depicts the laser treated
surface. Unfortunately, any interweaving is not visible. In figure 3 a), a SEM image of
the pretreated CFRP surface is given. The single interweaving has a dimension of
approximately 400 - 450 µm. Could the authors explain these differences?
Response: Thank you for your comments. According to reviewer’s recommendation,
we have researched the diameter of carbon fibre bundle which was approximate to 1.2-
1.5 mm. Therefore, any single interweaving cannot be seen in Figure 2 which shown
LSCM in an area approx. 500 x 705 µm. However, why Figure 3 a) shown a dimension
of approximately 400 - 450 µm? After careful inspection the experiment procedures
and photograph. We found the key point. We have used metallographic microscope to
observe the morphology of CFRP composite surfaces with laser-treated (Figure<U+2160>.
below). Carbon fibre bundle approx. 1.5 mm can be seen at the left side of the frame,
while some interweavings with a dimension of approximately 400 - 450 µm were
observed at the right side of the image. Meanwhile we found that the right edge was the
untreated regions which indicates that the area did not been ablated by laser. It’s a raw
surface just tearred off the peel ply and the interweaving with dimension of
approximately 400 - 450 µm was the interweaving of peel ply which imprinted on the
surface of the epoxy resin top layer.
Finally, we understood that Figure 3 a) was the morphology of peel ply area not
the focus area. Then we retested the SEM image of CFRP composite surface with laser-
treated and presented the new image in Figure 3 a). Thanks again for your valuable and
constructive comments.

Comment 15: Appendix, Page 8, Figure 3 a) & b): The depicted SEM images have the
same magnification. The visual fibers apparently have a different diameter. Could the
authors explain these differences?
Response: Thank you for your comment. We have explained it in the“Comment 14”
and corrected Figure 3 a). We think that after careful revision, the manuscript could
meet the requirement for publication.
Reviewer #4
Comment 1: In this work, laser surface treatment in bonded repair of CFRP aircraft
structures was studied systematically. The manuscript proved that laser treatment was
an effective way in bonded repair. The language is normal and the conclusions are
developed logically and sufficiently. It is my pleasure to recommend its publication on
Journal of Royal Society Open Science with minor revisions.
1. Minor amendment: Section 2. Introduction line 1 “successfully used in civil
aircraft”, it should be “successfully applied in civil aircraft” or “successfully used on
civil aircraft”.
Response: Thanks very much for the positive comments and suggestion. The error was
corrected accordingly and highlighted with red fonts in the revised manuscript. We
think that after careful revision, the manuscript could meet the requirement for
publication.
We tried our best to improve the manuscript and made some changes in the manuscript.
These changes will not influence the content and framework of the paper. And here we
did not list the changes but marked in red in revised paper.
We appreciate for Editors/Reviewers’ warm work earnestly, and hope that the
correction will meet with approval.
Once again, thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.

The followings are our point-by-point responses to reviewers’ comments.
Responses to Reviewers
Reviewer #3
Comment 4 & 5: The authors mentioned, that they measured the pulse energy. It
was given an answer by a calculation of the pulse energy. Did you calculate or
measure it?
Response: Thanks for your comment. It’s not the “measured pulse energy”, 700 mJ/cm²
was the calculated pulse energy which we mentioned in the manuscript.
Comment 11: In the mentioned reference an excimer laser system with a
wavelength of 355 nm is used. The mentioned values of 400 mJ/cm² are not
comparable by applying an infrared laser source (1064 nm). An IR-beam is less
absorbed by the Matrix than an UV-beam.
Response: Thanks for your comment. We appreciate for reviewer’s professional and
earnest work. After carefully check the laser processing parameters, we insist on the
original laser beam parameter. The reviewer’s comment is right, an IR-beam is less
absorbed by the matrix than an UV-beam. However, in our manuscript, the used pulse
energy was 700 mJ/cm² (1064 nm), which was higher than 400 mJ/cm² (355 nm)
mentioned in the reference. So, the actual pulse energy we mentioned in our paper was
able to process the CFRP.
Comment 13: Thank you for your answer.
By using a pretreatment area of 12.5 mm x 25.4. mm (according to ASTM D3165),
the real overlap of the surfaces could be less, more or the same. Did the authors
consider the overlap of the samples? The overlap has significant influence on the
shear strength. However, the Information is missing.
Response: Thanks for your comment. Yes, we agreed that the overlap area significantly
influence the shear strength and we have considered the real pretreatment area. In the
lap shear test, we have measured the real overlap dimension (width×length) and used
it to calculate the shear strength to make the results more convincing. We have
supplemented the missing information in Chapter 3.7. The revisions are highlighted
with red fonts in the revised manuscript. Thanks again for your valuable and
constructive comment.
Comment 14: In image 3b), the fibers have a bigger diameter in comparison to
figure 3a.
Response: Thanks for your comment. We have checked the parameters and didn't find
any problems. The only thing we can think of is that Figure 3a was taken in 2016.
During the 2 years, we have repaired and replaced some components of the SEM
instrument. So, we retested the SEM image of polish-treated substrate immediately to
compared with the laser-treated figure 3a which was taken in ten days ago.
Figure 3 b) presented the morphology of polish-treated surface. This change will
not influence the content and framework of the paper. Besides, at the bottom of the
image, we can see some bright part between the interweaving area. The light object of
the original subject was represented by the matrix resin which has not been removed.
The reason was that during the interweaving area, fiber bundles were not smooth,
mechanical abrasion process can not totally remove the polymers without fibrous
fracture. The experimental results showed that laser surface procedure can provide
uniform and consistent surface properties in comparison to conventional mechanical
abrasion surface preparation.
