I was happy to review such an interesting paper about the use of chromaticity and lightness for
object segregation in Triggerfish. The story is very clear and the experiments have been very well
conducted. I really enjoyed to read such a very good paper and very nice story. This paper is of a
great of interest for the Royal Society Open Science. I have no major comments, only very few
minor suggestions before publication.
Page 1 lines 42-43: This sentence needs a reference. Please add one.
Page 3 lines 63-65: Maybe I did not understand properly the Fig 1ii, but for me, the quantum
catch is not equal between bright yellow and bright blue, as for example for the qs. Can you
please explain it better, because it appears that qs of Dark blue (rather than bright blue) is closer
to qs of Bright yellow.
Page 4 lines 92-93: While it has been done properly, it is always good to explain why it is
important to prevent to present a same stimulus more than 3 times in the same side. Please add a
sentence.
Page 4 line 94: What was the size of the pieces of squid? Was it always similar between
trials/individuals?
Page 4 line 90: Please explain why you do not have the same “n”?
Page 4 line 103: Please explain why did you perform unrewarded trials?
Page 5 lines 113-114: Please explain why two fish have only performed 26 and 20 trials? Could
this have an impact on the statistics?
Page 5 line 117: I think there is a mistake here. I think you should have say fig 2 instead of fig 3?
Page 5 line 123: I do not understand how did you prepare your models. Here, you said that you
include group as fixed effect. However, in the result section, you have different output for
Group1 and Group2. I do not understand how is this possible? I would have think that including
group as a fixed effect, you should have find whether groups are different or not, but you should
not have different output… Maybe I did not understand properly.
Page 5 lines 132-133: You have written: “This indicated that fish could group dots into a shape on
the basis of common colour”. You should add: “… common colour or brightness”. Indeed, the
cross stimuli you presented differed in colours but also in Brightness (as you used Dark blue and
Bright Yellow for a specific stimulus).
Page 5 lines 133-135: You said that there was no difference in the ability to learn… Please explain
in terms of what? Time to learn?
Page 5 lines 140-141: I would put this sentence in the discussion

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
It is great that the authors succeeded to train wild triggerfish on a detection task using
geometrical and random dot patterns. The hypothesis was that in the shallow water of a coral reef
color could provide more reliable information than lightness for object detection, an idea brought
into discussion by Maximov (2000). The carefully designed and performed experiments support
this idea, but they also show that using high contrast stimuli the fish recognized the cross shape
even in reversed colors of object and background. This means that they detect “cross” on the
basis of both modalities, color and lightness.
The problem in reading the manuscript was that in the paper version the crosses were not visible
in Fig. 2 (ii) and (iv), and in SFig. 3. Hopefully this will not be the case in the final print version.
It seems that the Supplement is overloaded by figures and tables; important material should be in
the text.
Introduction:
Page 2, 12-15 and Discussion: a reference to this paper is missing: “Wavelength dependence of
visual acuity in goldfish” (Neumeyer, 2003). In goldfish parallel processing of color and lightness
is well established. However, we had the impression that color and high visual acuity are using
the same channel. See also: Mora-Ferrer & Neumeyer (2008) for pharmacological evidence.

Materials and methods:
Page 3:
50: It would be nice to have Fig. S1 in the text as Fig. 1.
To understand the stimulus design it is necessary to know the photoreceptor types and the
reflectance spectra of the colored dots. Therefore, I suggest to show the three figures of Fig. S2
together with the color triangle and the quantum catches for each color in Fig. 2.
Here, some changes are necessary: In Fig. S2 (a) it should be “relative sensitivity” on the ordinate.
Normally, sensitivity does not drop to zero between 300 and 400 nm. Influence of the optic
media?
In (b) “relative intensity” should be “relative reflectance”, and what is shown in (c) is not told.
In Fig. 1(ii) “luminance signal” should be “relative quantum catch”.
Tab. 1 could go into Supplementary Material.
The stimuli shown in Fig. S3 are mentioned so often and are essential for the understanding (at
least in the not perfect print version) that it should go into the main text as Fig. 3. When this
figure is mentioned it should be clear which part of the figure is meant, for example in line 73:
(Fig. 2i, Fig. S3 a and b).
Page 3-5:
The terms are highly confusing:
73-75: A cross stimulus had “consistent chromaticity, but inconsistent lightness (achromatic
noise)” does this mean: “same color, different lightness”?
Or: “consistent lightness, inconsistent chromaticity (chromatic noise)”: means “same lightness
and different color”? Why not call it this way?
Confusion is at top on page 5, 136-140: ….”a chromatically camouflaged cross (achromatic cross)
and an achromatically camouflaged cross (chromatic cross)”… Help!!!!!
Same lightness: is it known whether light blue and light yellow are of the same lightness??
Better: “similar lightness”?
Results:
In Fig. 2: “group 1” and “group 2”, but in the text: “group A” and “group B”. Should be the same
in text and figure.
The supplementary figures and the supplementary tables do not have captions, and, therefore,
the reader does not know to which experiments they belong. The only references in the text are to
Figs. S5, and S7. According to page 5, line 140, Fig. S5a belongs to Fig. 2ii. Here it is surprising
that 5 subjects only seem to be significantly above chance level, but in Fig. 2 the result for all fish
together looks highly significant. How can this be explained?
A reference to Fig. S6 was not found. Fig. S7 indicates that almost all fish with four exceptions
showed high choice frequencies in experiment 3.
What are the diagrams showing “proportion of right-hand choices”? In the supplementary tables
there are “left” and “right” “choices” (?) Obviously it was not taken care to test each stimulus
equally often on the right and left-hand side? What shall we do now with this information?
Supplementary figures 5-7 and supplementary tables 1-3: The figures are confusing and can be
skipped, the tables contain all information, but some explanation is required. Fig. S4 is not
necessary either. The fish seem to have known the task already from the beginning (session 1).
Beginning of training or testing??

segregation in Triggerfish. The story is very clear and the experiments have been very well conducted. I
really enjoyed to read such a very good paper and very nice story. This paper is of a great of interest for
the Royal Society Open Science. I have no major comments, only very few minor suggestions before

Page 1 lines 42-43: This sentence needs a reference. Please add one.
The reference is added.
Page 3 lines 63-65: Maybe I did not understand properly the Fig 1ii, but for me, the quantum catch is
not equal between bright yellow and bright blue, as for example for the qs. Can you please explain it
better, because it appears that qs of Dark blue (rather than bright blue) is closer to qs of Bright yellow.
To clarify this point we added the following phrase: Because S cones do not contribute to R. aculeatus
lightness vision [17] the bright yellow and blue are similar in their lightness, as are the dark yellow and
blue colours.
Page 4 lines 92-93: While it has been done properly, it is always good to explain why it is important to
prevent to present a same stimulus more than 3 times in the same side. Please add a sentence.
We have added in “To prevent any side-biases from developing…”
Page 4 line 94: What was the size of the pieces of squid? Was it always similar between
trials/individuals?
For the experiment and the training, all fish were rewarded with very small pieces of squid (roughly 1-
1.5 mm). The pieces were all kept reasonably equal in size between trials. We have now included “…a
small (1-1.5 mm) piece of squid”.
Page 4 line 90: Please explain why you do not have the same “n”?
We have added:
“Depending on the motivation of a fish, between 3 and 6 trials were recorded per session.”
Page 4 line 103: Please explain why did you perform unrewarded trials?
We have now included “These trials were unrewarded to prevent fish from forming a preference for one
of the crosses, as this may not be indicative of its saliency.”
The test that was unrewarded was when two cross stimuli (with achromatic and chromatic noise) were
presented. These trials had to go unrewarded, otherwise fish would unavoidably develop a preference for
a cross, that may have no bearing on its saliency. The intention of this method was to get fish to make a
choice for the most salient option, while not being demotivated with the lack of reward (by being
interspersed with 5 rewarded trials).
Page 5 lines 113-114: Please explain why two fish have only performed 26 and 20 trials? Could this
have an impact on the statistics?
Thorough reinspection of the data has revealed that fish I1 that was mistakenly entered in a summary
table doing only 26 choices, and actually completed n=30 (19 correct, 11 incorrect). Statistical tests
were verified to have used the correct data.
The supplementary data has been updated with the correct values.
Fish H1 only completed 20 trials during the achromatic noise experiment, because of a fin-rot (fungal)
infection and had to be treated. This is also why the fish was removed from the following generalization
experiment.
Running the GLMM with or without H1 was found to have no influence over the model output.
Page 5 line 117: I think there is a mistake here. I think you should have say fig 2 instead of fig 3?
We have changed the figure references accordingly.
Page 5 line 123: I do not understand how did you prepare your models. Here, you said that you include
group as fixed effect. However, in the result section, you have different output for Group1 and Group2. I
do not understand how is this possible? I would have think that including group as a fixed effect, you
should have find whether groups are different or not, but you should not have different output… Maybe I
did not understand properly.
Originally a group was held as a fixed factor when doing an overall analysis to see if there were any
differences between the two groups (for which none was found). A previous reviewer commented
requesting the two groups be plotted separately, and so we carried out further statistical analysis for the
individual groups (where “group” was no longer a relevant factor).
We have now updated or methods section mentioning that . “Analysis was performed separately for fish
trained to yellow cross (Group 1) and for fish trained to blue cross (Group 2).”
Page 5 lines 132-133: You have written: “This indicated that fish could group dots into a shape on the
basis of common colour”. You should add: “… common colour or brightness”. Indeed, the cross stimuli
you presented differed in colours but also in Brightness (as you used Dark blue and Bright Yellow for a
specific stimulus).
We have modified this sentence to include both chromaticity and lightness.
Page 5 lines 133-135: You said that there was no difference in the ability to learn… Please explain in
terms of what? Time to learn?
By that statement we meant there was no difference between the two groups in their final training
performance (final 5 sessions). This simply shows that for the purposes of our study, fish were equally
capable of learning the blue cross and yellow cross. Whether the learning rate differs (during pre-
training) for associating cross colour with a reward is an interesting question, but not the focus of this
experiment.
To clarify this point we modified the text:
“There was no difference between Group 1 (yellow cross; n = 9) and Group 2 (blue cross; n = 10) in the
overall performance during the last 5 session of training, i.e. in their ability to learn the task (GLMM;
binomial: z = -0.47, n trials = 753, n fish = 19, p = 0.635; Fig. 2).

Supp. Materials: Maybe it was a mistake, but I did not have the figure captions.
We have rearranged the supplementary material and include tables together with captions in one file.
Again, I would sincerely thank the authors for this very interesting paper.

Comments to the Author(s)
It is great that the authors succeeded to train wild triggerfish on a detection task using geometrical and
random dot patterns. The hypothesis was that in the shallow water of a coral reef color could provide
more reliable information than lightness for object detection, an idea brought into discussion by
Maximov (2000). The carefully designed and performed experiments support this idea, but they also
show that using high contrast stimuli the fish recognized the cross shape even in reversed colors of
object and background. This means that they detect “cross” on the basis of both modalities, color and
lightness.
The problem in reading the manuscript was that in the paper version the crosses were not he visible in
Fig. 2 (ii) and (iv), and in SFig. 3. Hopefully this will not be the case in the final print version.
It seems that the Supplement is overloaded by figures and tables; important material should be in the
text.
We have moved figure 3 from supplementary material to manuscript (now Fig 2 in the manuscript) and
moved table 1 to the supplementary materials. Bar plots showing the same information as the tables
have now been removed from the supplementary materials. We also included the spectra from
supplementary materials (Fig S2) in the Fig 1 of the manuscript and removed Fig S2 from the
supplementary materials.
Introduction:
Page 2, 12-15 and Discussion: a reference to this paper is missing: “Wavelength dependence of visual
acuity in goldfish” (Neumeyer, 2003). In goldfish parallel processing of color and lightness is well
established. However, we had the impression that color and high visual acuity are using the same
channel. See also: Mora-Ferrer & Neumeyer (2008) for pharmacological evidence.
We have included the reference to Neumeyer 2003 and stated that goldfish uses all receptors for high
spatial resolution vision.
Materials and methods:
Page 3:
50: It would be nice to have Fig. S1 in the text as Fig. 1.
To understand the stimulus design it is necessary to know the photoreceptor types and the reflectance
spectra of the colored dots. Therefore, I suggest to show the three figures of Fig. S2 together with the
color triangle and the quantum catches for each color in Fig. 2.
Fig. S2 has now been moved to Fig. 1 in the text.
Here, some changes are necessary: In Fig. S2 (a) it should be “relative sensitivity” on the ordinate.
Normally, sensitivity does not drop to zero between 300 and 400 nm. Influence of the optic media?
The axes labels have been changed.
Yes, trigger fish has ocular media that cuts all light below 400nm (measured by Uli Siebeck).
In (b) “relative intensity” should be “relative reflectance”, and what is shown in (c) is not told.
The axes label has been changed. Shown in (c) is the within-tank illumination. Extra care has been
taken to include reference to (c) in the text, as well as including figure captions.
In Fig. 1(ii) “luminance signal” should be “relative quantum catch”.
The axes label has been changed to read “relative quantum catch”.
Tab. 1 could go into Supplementary Material.
The stimuli shown in Fig. S3 are mentioned so often and are essential for the understanding (at least in
the not perfect print version) that it should go into the main text as Fig. 3. When this figure is
mentioned it should be clear which part of the figure is meant, for example in line 73: (Fig. 2i, Fig. S3 a
and b).
Tab. 1 has been moved to the supplementary materials. We moved Fig S3 is to the main text and refer
to each panel of the figure in the text when the stimuli are described.
Page 3-5:
The terms are highly confusing:
73-75: A cross stimulus had “consistent chromaticity, but inconsistent lightness (achromatic noise)”
does this mean: “same color, different lightness”?
Or: “consistent lightness, inconsistent chromaticity (chromatic noise)”: means “same lightness and
different color”? Why not call it this way?
Confusion is at top on page 5, 136-140: ….”a chromatically camouflaged cross (achromatic cross) and
an achromatically camouflaged cross (chromatic cross)”… Help!!!!!
Same lightness: is it known whether light blue and light yellow are of the same lightness??
Better: “similar lightness”?
This has been a continuous issue with labelling the stimuli types, and numerous naming schemes have
been implemented in failed attempts to clarify the meaning. We have made the suggested changes in
using, similar chromaticity/lightness and different lightness/chroamticity, when explaining our stimuli
design.
Results:
In Fig. 2: “group 1” and “group 2”, but in the text: “group A” and “group B”. Should be the same in text
and figure.
All mention of group A or B has been changed to group 1 or 2.
The supplementary figures and the supplementary tables do not have captions, and, therefore, the
reader does not know to which experiments they belong.
We include supplementary tables and captions in one file.
The only references in the text are to Figs. S5, and S7. According to page 5, line 140, Fig. S5a belongs
to Fig. 2ii.
We removed of all supplementary bar plots. Changes made to page 5, line 40 to add a “,” in replace of
“;”.
Here it is surprising that 5 subjects only seem to be significantly above chance level, but in Fig. 2 the
result for all fish together looks highly significant. How can this be explained?
Despite most fish not reaching individual significance, the majority of fish (15 out 19) chose the
achromatically camouflaged stimulus in >50% of the trials. This is reflected by what is shown in Fig. 2
with the overall mean proportion of choices.
A reference to Fig. S6 was not found. Fig. S7 indicates that almost all fish with four exceptions showed
high choice frequencies in experiment 3.
Supplementary bar plot figures have been removed. We changed the comment on individual
performance in the results section for the generalization experiment to say, “The level of performance
during this generalisation test was also similar to the initial training for at least 14 out of the 18 fish (five
failed to discriminate, see supplementary tables, Tab. S4).”
What are the diagrams showing “proportion of right-hand choices”? In the supplementary tables there
are “left” and “right” “choices” (?) Obviously it was not taken care to test each stimulus equally often on
the right and left-hand side? What shall we do now with this information?
There has been a misunderstanding on the reviewer’s part, as a fault of ours for not uploading figure
captions. The stimuli were presented equally often on each side. The “proportion of right-hand choices”
shows how many choices fish made for stimuli (regardless of cross or distracter) on the left- or right-
hand presenting tank-end.
The purpose of this information is to provide an indication of whether individuals had a side-bias in the
tests, and do not indicate how many trials positive stimuli were placed on the left- or right-side.
Supplementary figures 5-7 and supplementary tables 1-3: The figures are confusing and can be skipped,
the tables contain all information, but some explanation is required. Fig. S4 is not necessary either. The
fish seem to have known the task already from the beginning (session 1). Beginning of training or
testing??
Supplementary bar plots are removed.
All supplementary figures now have accompanying captions that provide adequate explanation.
We disagree that “Fig. S4 is not necessary…” (now it is Fig. S2) and believe it is necessary to provide an
overview of how all fish (except for one) were able to learn the task and meet our pre-selected learning
criteria. This figure only shows the five training sessions that determined whether fish had learnt the
task. Unfortunately, the majority of pre-training data is missing, and in hind-sight it would have been
good to include for the construction of a learning threshold curve.
