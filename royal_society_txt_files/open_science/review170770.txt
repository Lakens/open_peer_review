Review of Sherman et al.
This manuscript addresses how intraspecific variation in the stoichiometry of Daphnia might
explain variation in growth and competitive ability among genotypes. Interestingly the authors
moves beyond measuring solely whole body P-content, but also quantify P-kinetics (acquisition,
assimilation, incorporation, retention), and focus on how these 5 traits vary among 10 genotypes
reared under low and high P-diets for 5 days. For all traits they find significant GxE interactions,
which are particularly strong for the four P-kinetics traits. Finally, they find that these P-kinetics
are more likely to explain variation in competitive ability and growth rate then P-content alone.
In general, I think all of these conclusion are interesting, important, and potentially justified by
the dataset.
While I found the design and execution of the experiments interesting, the presentation of the
results was poorly organised and difficult to follow, and there are several statistical issues that
need resolving. The writing could also be improved to focus on the main points, as I believe I
have outlined in the summary above.
Major points:
First, why are there more than 20 points in each panel of figure 2 and 3? You have 10 genotypes
measured in two conditions (HP and LP). Anything more is pseudoreplication.
Second, why are the predictor variables in Figure 2 (a and b) and figure 3 reversed? I find figure 2
more intuitive - given a genotypes with variation in %P, is the variation in %P correlated with P-
kinetics traits. In this case, one has a few predictions for LP and HP environments. If there are
strong tradeoffs at LP, then you would see negative relationships in LP but not in HP. I think all
of the results could be better organised around a set of predictions. Right now it seems like you
are just asking if they are all correlated or not.
Third, in Figure 4, your multivariate analysis includes 5 P-traits, but also density, growth rate,
and competitive ability. Including growth rate seems ok, but competitive ability is on a frequency
scale and total density seems a bit meaningless to include in a PCA with traits. Can you explain
this justification, or redo the analysis with just 5 traits and growth. Part of the reason for
excluding density, is that you add assumption that these 5 P-traits are related to fecundity and
population level parameters. But the P-kinetics traits are more likely only explaining variation in
growth of individuals and have a weaker relationship to individual fecundity (which you didn’t
measure?).
Fourth, I think the introduction could set out a clearer set of predictions that are tested. Right
now the paper is written more as a descriptive summary of all the things you did, rather than
being integrated around a series of hypotheses. This is what makes it hard to follow.
Minor points:
Abstract - I don’t think the abstract highlights the main themes of the paper very well. I think the
main point is that you are comparing to what extent %P and P-kinetics can explain variation in
growth and competitive ability.
3
L46: “success of a given species” - how about just growth and competitive ability?
L52: is congenerics correct in this context?
L55 - “similarly”? plants have different homeostasis… I not sure this is a similar comparison to
Daphnia as the initial expectations would be very different.
L68 - “of [Daphnia] genotypes”
L73 - this substantial genetic variation in expression is for plants. But is this a fair comparison for
animal studies?
L79 - 80: Leal et al. 2017 addresses allocation differences among fish populations with similar %P
of whole body.
L84: Without any change in whole body stoichiometry. Other stoichiometric traits could change.
L217: Here you say there are 30 trials, but you did this in each environment no? So 60 trials in
total (see line 234)
L235-239: I am confused here. You don’t mean total number of genotypes, but rather: the number
of individuals of the target genotype divided by the total number of individuals. L238: here as
well you mean fraction of individuals of the target genotype, not the “number of experimental
genotypes”… which would have always been 2 (or 1 if exclusion happened?) in these pairwise
competition trials, no?
L282: Why do you undermine your results with this statement? If there is a significant interaction
term, then you would not necessarily expect the main effect that you are describing (i.e. a
consistence difference between LP and HP). That the whole point of the interaction term.
L286: I don’t understand what supports this statement.
L287-288: This analysis should be redone to account for fact that response variable is a frequency
and unlikely normally distributed. You could either use an arcsine transformation, or use glms
(e.g. logit link function). The “betareg” R package might be helpful for response variables that
continuous and bounded between 0 and 1.
L326: I don’t understand how this is supported?
L343: Why start with the results from Table 2 and 3? This seems backwards from how you
organise the paper.
L352: By P-use, you mean P-kinetics? It’s confusing to switch back and forth between this
terminology.
L356: Again, the support for canalised growth is unclear, and may a minor point.
L356-358: I don’t find this to be an important conclusion, but rather a method. Plus, I would be
more interested in a multivariate analysis that did not mix traits too much (see above).
In general, the discussion is well written, but it starts off in a confusing way.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors describe an impressive study of phosphorus kinetics and growth-related traits,
including competitive ability, in 10 genotypes of Daphnia pulicaria. This kind of intraspecific
comparison of traits related to ecological stoichiometry is a novel and worthwhile extension of
previous interspecific analyses. That the results do not always conform to the predictions of
ecological stoichiometry makes this study all the more important.
I only have one modest concern about the ms, and a handful of smaller concerns, which I describe
below.
My modest concern relates to the 10 genotypes used in the study. On L127 the authors state that
“Ten genotypes from this resurrected population were used.” I would typically ask whether these
genotypes can be distinguished from each other using genetic markers, so that the authors can be
certain that each genotype is independent (no risk that two “genotypes” are actually identical
clones - this can happen with Daphnia). I would ask for verification here that the 10 genotypes
are independent, but I know from later in the paper that, for the markers used, there was some
redundancy in GPI electromorph profiles (L313-314). It’s not clear whether this redundancy exists
among the 10 genotypes studied, or only between some of these 10 genotypes and the reference
genotypes. If there is redundancy among the 10 focal genotypes, I would recommend that the
authors revise the presentation of the data to include only genotypes known to be genetically
distinct. This would likely simplify the presentation of the results anyway. In contrast, if each of
the 10 focal genotypes can be distinguished from the other 9 by a genetic marker, the authors
should make a statement to that effect here in the methods section at L127.
Other concerns:
L282-284. For acquisition, 5 of 10 genotypes look to have HP/LP effects (from the figure). For
assimilation, it is 8 of 10 genotypes. Particularly for the assimilation result, the statement that the
pattern is “driven primarily by a few genotypes” seems inaccurate. The statement describing
these results could be more nuanced.
5
L305-6: Perhaps it is worth pointing out that the (potential) correlation under HP is stronger than
under LP? Or maybe the authors would rather not address that, since in neither case is the
correlation significant.
L312-317: I feel that this issue about some genotypes being indistinguishable with markers should
be addressed sooner. For example, at L286 there is no mention of this issue even though it is
relevant to the result presented there. Also the introduction of Fig. 1f in line 287 does not clarify
why only 8 genotypes are included here rather than the full 10. The explanation for why this is
the case does not appear until L312, in a different section of the results.
Fig. 4: Why show the graph in Fig. 4b (PC3 results) if these data are not discussed in the narrative
at all? It would be more straightforward to only include Fig. 4a. Fig 4b could be included as
supplemental material if the authors desire.
(Very) Minor edits:
L28: “we are yet to understand” should be “we have yet to understand”
L177-179: Two sentences in a row beginning with “It is important to note…”
L267: The authors state that they used Akaike information criterion (note that it should be the
singular criteriON), but then use the acronym AICc, which represented AIC corrected for small
sample sizes. Please clarify whether the correction for small sample size was applied - this is what
AICc represents.
L273: The correct term is “Generalized linear models,” not General linear models.
L290, L348, L383: Replace “between” with “among,” because in each case you are talking about
genotypes, which are not distinguished as individual entities in the grammar of the sentences.
L345: Change “Genotypes showed varied plastic…” to “Genotypes varied in plastic…”
L347: remove comma after “nature”
L355-6: The authors state “while some exhibited canalized growth,” but actually only one
genotype exhibited this (36x). Change “some” to “one genotype” or “a single genotype”
L356: The sentence that ends with “P- use physiology” should probably have a parenthetical
citation to Fig. 4
L361: “slower growth” would work just as well as “slower growth rate”
L365-6: I would suggest changing “Under replete P conditions there exists little variation in P
acquisition as compared to conditions of limited P supply” to something like, “There was less
variation in P acquisition under replete P conditions than under P-limited conditions.’
L368: “… differences in P content is…” should be “differences in P content are”
L370: comma after “noting” should be removed
L374: “represents” should be “represent” (the subject “Differences” is plural)
L379: misspelling, “consistant” should be “consistent”
6
L397: “… better at predicting growth rates and competitive abilities, as compared to P content
alone” could be replaced with “ “… better at predicting growth rates and competitive abilities
than P content alone”

asured in two conditions (HP and LP). Anything more is pseudoreplication.
ponse: All of the points on Fig. 2 & 3 are all individual data points, rather than the averages
ach genotype under the two phosphorus treatments. We did this to examine overall patterns,
just at the genotype level. The symbols in each figure have been color coded to show which
otype each point represents.
ond, why are the predictor variables in Figure 2 (a and b) and figure 3 reversed? I find figure
ore intuitive - given a genotypes with variation in %P, is the variation in %P correlated with
inetics traits. In this case, one has a few predictions for LP and HP environments. If there are
ng tradeoffs at LP, then you would see negative relationships in LP but not in HP. I think all
he results could be better organised around a set of predictions. Right now it seems like you
just asking if they are all correlated or not.
ponse: We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion and have switched the axes on Fig. 3 to
ke this more intuitive. All x-axes on Fig. 3 are now P content, with P-kinetics on the y-axis.
assumptions of stoichiometry are as phosphorus (P) assimilation increases, P content should
increase, this of course depends on P retention. The last paragraph of the introduction,
ting L120 includes clear sets of predictions including predictions regarding the relationship
ween P content and P kinetics traits.
rd, in Figure 4, your multivariate analysis includes 5 P-traits, but also density, growth rate,
competitive ability. Including growth rate seems ok, but competitive ability is on a frequency
le and total density seems a bit meaningless to include in a PCA with traits. Can you explain
justification, or redo the analysis with just 5 traits and growth. Part of the reason for
luding density, is that you add assumption that these 5 P-traits are related to fecundity and
ulation level parameters. But the P-kinetics traits are more likely only explaining variation in
wth of individuals and have a weaker relationship to individual fecundity (which you didn’t
asure?).
ponse: Our reasoning for including both competitive ability and density in the PCA analysis
hat individual growth should affect both density and competitive ability. The reason for
uding both density and competitive ability is that two genotypes can have the same frequency
ompetition with a reference genotype, however this does not mean that they have the same
l density. We feel that both of these measures are important to include in this multivariate
lysis. The reviewer’s point about P-kinetics being more likely to explain variation in growth
er than fecundity could be true, but have yet to be tested (hence this effort). In is worth
ing that population models in stoichiometry often use individual growth (i.e. the GRH) to
ke mechanistic inferences about population growth.
rth, I think the introduction could set out a clearer set of predictions that are tested. Right
the paper is written more as a descriptive summary of all the things you did, rather than
ng integrated around a series of hypotheses. This is what makes it hard to follow.
ponse: We are confused. The last paragraph of the introduction clearly laid out our
dictions. L115: “Based on stoichiometric models built to describe performance of species
ering in somatic stoichiometry [1], we predicted that genotypes with lower P content will
ibit slower growth rate and be competitively superior in conditions of lower P supply.
reover, based on the growth rate hypothesis [6], we predicted that P content should be
related with growth, which is strongly related to competitive ability in Daphnia [38]. Further,
ng physiological models [39], we predicted that all genotypes will increase rates of P
uisition, assimilation, and retention under lower P supply conditions. In addition, we
dicted that genotypes with lower P content will acquire, assimilate, and retain P at a slower
compared to genotypes with higher P content. Finally, we tested the impact of using multi-
xy measures of P kinetics in forecasting genotypic success (growth and competition) using
ltivariate approaches coupled with model reduction criterion.” We have strived to make this
re apparent, and better organized the entire ms around these predictions.
nor points:
stract - I don’t think the abstract highlights the main themes of the paper very well. I think the
n point is that you are comparing to what extent %P and P-kinetics can explain variation in
wth and competitive ability.
ponse: We have edited part of the abstract to address the reviewer’s comment. L30 “We
ized variation in phosphorus (P) content within a Daphnia species to test the extent to which
predicted growth and competition” has been changed to “We utilized variation in phosphorus
content within a Daphnia species to test the extent to which %P can explain variation in
wth and competition.”
: “success of a given species” - how about just growth and competitive ability?
ponse: Success has been changed to growth and competitive ability.
: is congenerics correct in this context?
ponse: The line has been changed to make the study cited clearer in regards to species
parison. L52 (now L54) now reads, “For example, Iwabuchi & Urabe [7] conducted
rocosm experiments on three Daphnia species and found that those with low phosphorus (P)-
and species of the freshwater cladoceran genus Daphnia, outcompeted others with a high P-
and, under P-limiting conditions.”
- “similarly”? plants have different homeostasis… I not sure this is a similar comparison to
phnia as the initial expectations would be very different.
ponse: Has been changed to “Within plants,…”
- “of [Daphnia] genotypes”
ponse: This line has been corrected as the reviewer suggested to be more specific.
- this substantial genetic variation in expression is for plants. But is this a fair comparison
animal studies?
ponse: We have kept these examples of genetic variation in plants, and noted that there is
e known about such variation in animals. We have also included examples of differential
ression under varied P supply conditions in Daphnia. See L73: “P supply has been shown to
nificantly alter the expression of ~20% of the genes in the Daphnia genome (e.g., Jeyasingh et
2011). Genotypic comparisions of transcriptomes revealed that genotypes differed in the
ression of as much as 30% of the genes in common gardens (Roy Chowdhury et al. 2014;
y Chowdhury et al. 2015).”
- 80: Leal et al. 2017 addresses allocation differences among fish populations with similar
of whole body.
ponse: We appreciate the reviewer’s suggested citation and have included it to our list of
mples of genetic variation in P allocation (now L83).
: Without any change in whole body stoichiometry. Other stoichiometric traits could change.
ponse: L84, now L95, has been edited to specifically discuss whole body stoichiometry. L95
ds, “Thus, it is possible that fitness-relevant classical traits (e.g. intrinsic rate of natural
rease) can be expressed and maintained in a genotype by altering elemental kinetics without
change in individual body stoichiometry, and yet this results in distinctive competitive or
ess outcomes under the same supply stoichiometry.”
7: Here you say there are 30 trials, but you did this in each environment no? So 60 trials in
l (see line 234)
ponse: L217(now L223) has been changed to “30 trials per treatment.”
5-239: I am confused here. You don’t mean total number of genotypes, but rather: the
mber of individuals of the target genotype divided by the total number of individuals. L238:
e as well you mean fraction of individuals of the target genotype, not the “number of
erimental genotypes” which would have always been 2 (or 1 if exclusion happened?) in these
rwise competition trials, no?
ponse: L235 (now L247) has been changed to “the number of individuals of the target
otype divided by the total number of individuals.”
8 (now L249) has been changed to “fraction of individuals of the target genotype.”
2: Why do you undermine your results with this statement? If there is a significant
raction term, then you would not necessarily expect the main effect that you are describing
. a consistence difference between LP and HP). That the whole point of the interaction term.
ponse: We agree with the reviewer’s critique. This statement, “In general, the patterns
gest that D. pulicaria acquire and assimilate more P under LP conditions than under HP
ditions, however, this is driven primarily by a few genotypes, and is not true for all genotypes
mined” has been removed as it did not reflect the results accurately. As we had previously
ressed in the discussion, L368, P acquisition and assimilation increased under LP conditions
exhibited more variation among genotypes as compared to HP conditions.
6: I don’t understand what supports this statement.
ponse: We agree, and have removed “, however this was primarily driven by one genotype
), Fig. while the other genotypes did not behave this way.”
7-288: This analysis should be redone to account for fact that response variable is a
uency and unlikely normally distributed. You could either use an arcsine transformation, or
glms (e.g. logit link function). The “betareg” R package might be helpful for response
iables that continuous and bounded between 0 and 1.
ponse: The frequency response variable was previously transformed to meet normality
umptions as stated in L251 (now 257) “All non-normal data were log-transformed for
lyses to fit assumptions for GLMMs.”
6: I don’t understand how this is supported?
ponse: Now L334, this genotype (36x) did not differ in growth rate response between
tments. We have removed the term “canalized.”
3: Why start with the results from Table 2 and 3? This seems backwards from how you
anise the paper.
ponse: We are not sure why the reviewer thinks the discussion starts with results from Table
nd 3. The discussion begins discussing results in the same order as they have previously been
sented, as we have cited Fig. 1 early in the discussion.
2: By P-use, you mean P-kinetics? It’s confusing to switch back and forth between this
minology.
ponse: All discussion of 33P kinetics are now referred to as P kinetics as compared to P-use
rring to PUE (Phosphorus use efficiency).
6: Again, the support for canalised growth is unclear, and may a minor point.
ponse: L356 (now L362) has been changed to “Genotypes varied in multivariate space, with
st genotypes altering growth between high and low P conditions, while one genotype
ibited no difference in growth that was achieved by altering P kinetics (Fig. 4).”
6-358: I don’t find this to be an important conclusion, but rather a method. Plus, I would be
re interested in a multivariate analysis that did not mix traits too much (see above).
ponse: We don’t understand the rationale for this comment. We disagree that this is a
hod. It is a result of the PCA, clearly indicating which traits explain the most variation along
h PC axes. A central motivation for this work was to call attention to precisely this type of
traction. Nutrient processing traits (e.g., acquisition, assimilation, allocation) are expressed
temporaneously which all can affect fitness parameters (e.g., growth, fecundity) distinctly.
dying traits discretely often tells us little about the evolutionary scope of a trait, as post-
omic evolutionary biology has made quite apparent.
iewer: 2
modest concern relates to the 10 genotypes used in the study. On L127 the authors state that
n genotypes from this resurrected population were used.” I would typically ask whether these
otypes can be distinguished from each other using genetic markers, so that the authors can be
ain that each genotype is independent (no risk that two “genotypes” are actually identical
nes - this can happen with Daphnia). I would ask for verification here that the 10 genotypes
independent, but I know from later in the paper that, for the markers used, there was some
undancy in GPI electromorph profiles (L313-314). It’s not clear whether this redundancy
sts among the 10 genotypes studied, or only between some of these 10 genotypes and the
rence genotypes. If there is redundancy among the 10 focal genotypes, I would recommend
the authors revise the presentation of the data to include only genotypes known to be
etically distinct. This would likely simplify the presentation of the results anyway. In
trast, if each of the 10 focal genotypes can be distinguished from the other 9 by a genetic
rker, the authors should make a statement to that effect here in the methods section at L127.
ponse: Each genotype used in this study is independent. L244 (now L236) previously
lained that, “Each genotype possessed a unique allozyme (i.e., electromorph) marker at the
cose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI; Enzyme Commission (EC) 5.3.1.9) locus and/or
sphoglucomutase (PGM; EC 5.4.2.2) locus.” We have also added this explanation earlier in
manuscript in L130.
er concerns:
2-284. For acquisition, 5 of 10 genotypes look to have HP/LP effects (from the figure). For
milation, it is 8 of 10 genotypes. Particularly for the assimilation result, the statement that the
ern is “driven primarily by a few genotypes” seems inaccurate. The statement describing
se results could be more nuanced.
ponse: This is a similar critique brought up by Reviewer 1. We agree that this statement is
an accurate reflection of the interaction term and have removed it. As we had previously
ressed in the discussion, L368, P acquisition and assimilation increased under LP conditions
exhibited more variation among genotypes as compared to HP conditions.
5-6: Perhaps it is worth pointing out that the (potential) correlation under HP is stronger than
er LP? Or maybe the authors would rather not address that, since in neither case is the
relation significant.
ponse: We agree it could be potentially important as the reviewer states but since it was not
nificant we think it not necessary to discuss. We did however, include the p-values for each.
2-317: I feel that this issue about some genotypes being indistinguishable with markers
uld be addressed sooner. For example, at L286 there is no mention of this issue even though
relevant to the result presented there. Also the introduction of Fig. 1f in line 287 does not
ify why only 8 genotypes are included here rather than the full 10. The explanation for why
is the case does not appear until L312, in a different section of the results.
ponse: We have now addressed this issue earlier in the manuscript. L238 now states “Two
erimental genotypes (from 20-24 cm sediment layer) share the same GPI electromorph
files with two of the reference genotypes (from the 4-8 cm sediment layer). Distinguishing
se three experimental genotypes from the reference genotypes under competition proved
ivocal using the Phosphoglucomutase (PGM; EC 5.4.2.2) locus. Therefore, these two
otypes were excluded from analysis involving competitive ability.”
. 4: Why show the graph in Fig. 4b (PC3 results) if these data are not discussed in the
rative at all? It would be more straightforward to only include Fig. 4a. Fig 4b could be
uded as supplemental material if the authors desire.
ponse: We have now cited Fig. 4b and think it important to remain in the main part of the
er because it shows the relationships among all 3 significant axes.
ry) Minor edits:
: “we are yet to understand” should be “we have yet to understand”
ponse: L28, now L29 has been changed to “we have yet to understand”
7-179: Two sentences in a row beginning with “It is important to note…”
ponse: The repetition has been remedied.
7: The authors state that they used Akaike information criterion (note that it should be the
gular criteriON), but then use the acronym AICc, which represented AIC corrected for small
ple sizes. Please clarify whether the correction for small sample size was applied - this is
at AICc represents.
ponse: L267 (now L278) now indicates that the AIC corrected for small sample sizes was
eed applied
3: The correct term is “Generalized linear models,” not General linear models.
ponse: L273 (now L284) General linear models has been changed to generalized linear
dels
0, L348, L383: Replace “between” with “among,” because in each case you are talking about
otypes, which are not distinguished as individual entities in the grammar of the sentences.
ponse: For all lines, “between” has been replaced with “among.”
5: Change “Genotypes showed varied plastic…” to “Genotypes varied in plastic…”
ponse: This change has been made.
7: remove comma after “nature”
ponse: Comma removed.
5-6: The authors state “while some exhibited canalized growth,” but actually only one
otype exhibited this (36x). Change “some” to “one genotype” or “a single genotype”
ponse: L356 (now L362) has been changed to “Genotypes varied in multivariate space, with
st genotypes altering growth between high and low P conditions, while one genotype
ibited no difference in growth that was achieved by altering P kinetics (Fig. 4).”
6: The sentence that ends with “P- use physiology” should probably have a parenthetical
tion to Fig. 4
ponse: This line now has a parenthetical citation to Fig. 4
1: “slower growth” would work just as well as “slower growth rate”
ponse: This line has been changed to “slower growth”
5-6: I would suggest changing “Under replete P conditions there exists little variation in P
uisition as compared to conditions of limited P supply” to something like, “There was less
iation in P acquisition under replete P conditions than under P-limited conditions.’
ponse: This line has been changed to “There was less variation in P acquisition under replete
onditions than under P-limited conditions.”
8: “… differences in P content is…” should be “differences in P content are”
ponse: Sentence reads “… variation in P content is…”
0: comma after “noting” should be removed
ponse: Comma has been removed.
4: “represents” should be “represent” (the subject “Differences” is plural)
ponse: “represents” has been changed to “represent”
9: misspelling, “consistant” should be “consistent”
ponse: The misspelling has been corrected.
7: “… better at predicting growth rates and competitive abilities, as compared to P content
ne” could be replaced with “ “… better at predicting growth rates and competitive abilities
n P content alone”
ponse: The line has been changed to “… better at predicting growth rates and competitive
ities than P content alone”
