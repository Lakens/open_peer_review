Peng et al. describe a polymorphic transition of “cyclic dimers” using a range of analytical
methods. I cannot recommend publication of the manuscript because I don’t feel that it brings
anything new to the table, besides a lot of data. This data has not been used to learn anything
new about polymorphism, nor it is explained how the data will affect polyamide-6 research and
development. This aside, the manuscript is also not well written. In addition, the title is
absolutely inappropriate because of the use of the word “miraculous”. I do not see anything
miraculous about the described polymorphs and their transition. Not elucidating the mechanism
does not make it miraculous. The authors are also encouraged to use appropriate chemical
language. For example, the “cyclic dimer” should be described using IUPAC nomenclature.
The manuscript may be suitable for publication after significant revisions. But at the moment I
recommend a rejection. The required changes are too significant to justify a major revision.

This paper seems very interesting in investigating the characteristics of PA6, particularly, it is the
first time to show the whole transition process between a and ß forms of cyclic dimer by using
beautiful PLM pictures. Moreover, the influence of temperature on the change of a and ß forms
cyclic dimer is very important for readers to know and further study them. This paper presented
enough experiment data and figures and has been well written. Hence I recommend it to be
published in Royal Society Open Science after a minor revision.

Peng et al. describe a polymorphic transition of “cyclic dimers” using a range of
analytical methods. I cannot recommend publication of the manuscript because I
don’t feel that it brings anything new to the table, besides a lot of data. This data
has not been used to learn anything new about polymorphism, nor it is explained
how the data will affect polyamide-6 research and development.
Thanks for the kind comments, although there are some papers also studied
some of our contents, including the morphologies of ß-form and a-form of PA6
cyclic dimer. While in fact, before our work, nobody investigated the whole
transition process and morphology change between ß-form and a-form by using
PLM. This is very important for the researchers to know why there is only
ß-form existed in the concentrate (also named water-soluble extractable with
higher concentration) and PA6 chips being extracted, which always cause serious
problems to PA6 plants and quality of products, and why a-form appears again
during spinning process at temperature over 250 oC, which like to adhere to the
surface of spinneret and break the yarn. In the manuscript we actually have
explained how the data and morphology transition affect polyamide-6
research and development:
“It is generally known that cyclic dimmer is insoluble in water, Hermans has
proved that the solubility of cyclic dimmer in water is about 0.1%. However, by
adding 10 times of water on the a-form cyclic dimmer, the needle-like crystals
transfer to regular square ß-form very quickly although they are not soluble in
water, as Fig.5(c) shows. These crystals show bigger size than those formed in
methanol and easily aggregate precipitate in water (Fig.5(d)). More detail
analysis executed by SEM discover that these aggregates mainly are existed in
states of multi-slice structure (Fig.5(e)) and compact structure (Fig.5(f)). As
reported as Giuseppe, each cyclic dimer molecule is connected by four hydrogen
bonds to four other moleculars, we believe the exposed molecular of cyclic
dimer slices could also link the other slices, caprolactam, other oligomers
and even water through hydrogen bonding at relative low temperature, thus
reconstructed the larger and thicker plates. The facts can reasonably
explain that in PA6 plants, the concentrates with high quantity of cyclic
dimer are of great harmfulness as plugging up pipeline and equipment.”
In order to explain more clearly, we added the description “Moreover, in
industrial PA6 plants, especially in monomer recovery unit, the ß-form cyclic
dimer in concentrate (also named water-soluble extractable with higher
concentration) can be easily aroused great aggregation in equipment and pipes.”
In introduction and “Moreover, the larger and thicker ß-form cyclic dimer plates
are difficult to be removed completely from PA6 in extracting process due to its
poor solubility in water, as a result, the remained ß-form cyclic dimer in PA6
would and bring quality and safety problems of food packages, medical glue,
baby clothes, and so on medical and life-care products, because they can migrate
slowly from the inner to the surface of polymer. Hence, detailed technology of
the transition of cyclic dimer can greatly help us to take the appropriate solutions,
and implement controls to ensure the security of PA6 product” in 4.3, page 5.
And we also added another description “These studies clearly disclose a series of
phenomenon happened in PA6 spinning process: firstly, the remained ß-form
cyclic dimer in PA6 transited to a-form during melt-extrusion at temperature
higher than 250 oC, and then volatilized when they released from the small holes
of spinneret, later, they were quickly cooled to needle-shape a-form cyclic dimer
when exposed to the air. These needles were unavoidably stuck to the cool
surface of spinneret and thus broke the continuous spinning when they
accumulated to a certain extent. Besides, we noticed that very little of needles
melt and left some liquid dots on the glass substrate, it would be investigated
more carefully by DSC and schlenk tube test in following paragraphs.” In 4.4,
page 6.
And we also added new conclusion in the end of the conclusion: “Hence, it can
be further concluded that during the whole manufacturing process of PA6
polymer, cyclic dimer exists only ß-form crystals in water-soluble extractables,
concentrate and extracted PA6 chips, and brings serious problems to the process
and quality of products. While in the spinning process, through melt-extruding at
high temperature, the ß-form transforms into needle-shape a-form again and
might influence the continuous spinning process. Thus, many valuable works on
the process optimization and quality improvement could be expected in the
future.”
This aside, the manuscript is also not well written. In addition, the title is
absolutely inappropriate because of the use of the word “miraculous”. I do not
see anything miraculous about the described polymorphs and their transition.
Not elucidating the mechanism does not make it miraculous.
Many thanks for this suggestion, we have sent the manuscript to the language
edition company to improve the writing English and changed the unsuitable title
to “The Crystal-form Transition Behaviours and Morphology Changes in a
Polyamide 6 Cyclic Dimer”.
The authors are also encouraged to use appropriate chemical language. For
example, the “cyclic dimer” should be described using IUPAC nomenclature.
Thanks for your kind comment. In PA6 field, people habitually use “cyclic dimer”
instead of its IUPAC nomenclature(1,8-Diazacyclotetradecane-2,9-dione) since it
is a professional term, in particular, many process engineer in PA6 plants know
what is “cyclic dimer” but dot understand its IUPAC nomenclature. Hence,
almost all authors used “cyclic dimer” in their published papers so that the
readers can understand it easily. In the revised manuscript, we have given its
IUPAC nomenclature (1,8-Diazacyclotetradecane-2,9-dione) in the abstract but
kept using “cyclic dimer” in other places.

This paper seems very interesting in investigating the characteristics of PA6,
particularly, it is the first time to show the whole transition process between a
and ß forms of cyclic dimer by using beautiful PLM pictures. Moreover, the
influence of temperature on the change of a and ß forms cyclic dimer is very
important for readers to know and further study them. This paper presented
enough experiment data and figures and has been well written. Hence I
recommend it to be published in Royal Society Open Science after a minor
revision.
Many thanks for the kind suggestions, we have checked the manuscript very
carefully and corrected the mistakes one by one.
1. Heading of Fig. 4 (Morphologies of cyclic dimer in different solutions: a:
in methanol(×80); b: in caprolactam(×80);c: in water(×80); d: aggregates in
water(×80); e: slice layers of aggregates (SEM×500); f: compact structure of
aggregates (SEM×500)). The magnification should be shown on images by using
scale, so that readers can understand the size of crystals more clear.
Thanks for the valuable suggestion. We have added the scale in Fig.5 (actually
Fig.4 should be Fig.5) in the revision edition and rewrote the heading, please see
the revised manuscript.
2. There is Chinese typing appeared in Figure 6 “Transition of cyclic dimer
at heating program”, authors should use new image to replace it.
We have used a clearer image to replace it, thank you very much
3. Figure 10. Sublimating, transition and melting of ß-form cyclic dimer: (d)
magnification of d circle zone. Here (d) should be (d’).
Yes, this is a typing mistake and we have corrected it.
All other modifications were marked in red in the revised manuscript. We hope
our modification can make you and the reviewers satisfied. Thanks again.
