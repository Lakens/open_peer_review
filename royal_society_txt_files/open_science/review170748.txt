This paper reports highly efficient a method for 1,1-diaryl alkanes via Friedel-Crafts alkylation
reaction of electron rich arenes with cinnamic acid ester derivatives or chalcones. They found iron
triflate as the best catalyst for this reaction. Also they used cinnamic acid ester derivatives or
chalcones for this type Friedel-Crafts alkylation for the first time. Many examples, all well
characterised and reaction reasonably well optimised.
I think that this work can be published in Royal Society Open Science after some corrections have
been made.
The following corrections need make.
1. In introduction it must be given more the information about iron triflate and its the role of in
the reactions as Lewis acid catalyst.
2. Can the authors explain why iron triflate is better than bismuth triflate?
3. I just wonder that why the authors didn’t try another metals (Like Cu, Mn, Zn, Co) as Lewis
acid catalyst for this reaction.
4. In the conclusion section, the prominence of the method developed by the authors should be
emphasized better.
5. In page 4, line 20; 3m and 3n must be corrected with 3l and 3m.

Maji reports the synthesis of 1,1,-diaryl alkanes by Friedel-Crafts-type arylation of alkenes. After
the following corrections, the manuscript will be suitable for publication.
Fe(II)(OTf)2 should be tested.
3
A control reaction using TfOH should be conducted at both catalyst loading and significantly
lower loading (to rule our complex acid formation and catalysis).
The reaction is described as a hydroarylation - to show that the H originates in the arene a
deuterated arene should be used and deuterium incorporation into the product alkane quantified.
This could also be achieved in reverse by using a deuterated alkene.
What happens with alkyl substituted a,b-unsaturated esters/ketones?
What is observed with arenes bearing electron-withdrawing substituents? What is observed with
arenes not bearing MeO substituents?
Can any of the substrates/substrate precursors in figure 1 be prepared using this method?
The abbreviation F-C is very confusing and should be replaced with Friedel-Crafts.
SI - it is difficult to differentiate known and novel compounds in the SI. Novel compounds
should be highlighted.
SI "white solids" and melting points - melting points should be reported of crystalline materials
with the solvent of recrystallisation. White solids are either amorphous or crystalline and
colourless. Crystalline solids should be defined e.g. cuboids, needles etc.

The manuscript began with a summary, which was uncommon in scientific paper. Thus it was
not organized well to meet the requirement of publication. Besides, the authors are suggested to
provide a reaction mechanism to rationalize the formation of the final product.

ink that this work can be published in Royal Society Open Science after some corrections
e been made.
e following corrections need make.
1. In introduction it must be given more the information about iron triflate and its the role of
in the reactions as Lewis acid catalyst.
Answer: A variety of organic transformations catalyzed by iron salts as Lewis acid are
described in the introduction part. In reference section, a few references are also added.
2. Can the authors explain why iron triflate is better than bismuth triflate?
Answer: It reveals that a certain concentration of water is necessary to obtain the desired
product in good yields (Please see in mechanism Investigation part in manuscript).
Bismuth triflate also effective to afford the desired compounds (61%), but Iron triflate is
superior in this catalytic method (78%).
3. I just wonder that why the authors didn’t try another metals (Like Cu, Mn, Zn, Co) as
Lewis acid catalyst for this reaction.
Answer: Friedel-Crafts type alkylation reaction of 1,2-dimethoxybenzene with 3,4-
dimethoxy methylcinnamate was screened in the presence of metals such as Cu(OTf)2,
Zn(OTf)2, Co(NO3)2.6H2O and Co(ClO4)2.6H2O as Lewis acid. Only Cu(OTf)2 is able to
afford the desired compound 3a in moderate yield (51%), whereas others metals as Lewis
acid are completely inactive for this catalytic reaction.
4. In the conclusion section, the prominence of the method developed by the authors should
be emphasized better.
Answer: In the conclusion section, the prominence of this catalytic method is
emphasized with substrates scope including the insight of the mechanism of this catalytic
reaction by isotopic labeling experiments.
5. In page 4, line 20; 3m and 3n must be corrected with 3l and 3m.
Answer: 3m and 3n is corrected with 3l and 3m in the “Result and Discussion” section.

ji reports the synthesis of 1,1,-diaryl alkanes by Friedel-Crafts-type arylation of alkenes. After
following corrections, the manuscript will be suitable for publication.
1. Fe(II)(OTf)2 should be tested.
Answer: Fe(OTf)2 as Lewis acid is tested in this catalytic method, but no reaction was
observed. All the starting materials are remained unchanged even after longer reaction
time (32 h).
2. A control reaction using TfOH should be conducted at both catalyst loading and
significantly lower loading (to rule out complex acid formation and catalysis).
Answer: A control experiment between 1,2,3-trimethoxybenzene as arene and 4-
methoxy methylcinnamate using triflic acid (TfOH) was conducted at both catalyst
loading (10 mol%) and significantly lower loading (2 mol%). A trace amount (<5%) of
desired compound 3e is observed (Please see Scheme 4; eq 1 in mechanism investigation
part)
3. The reaction is described as a hydroarylation - to show that the H originates in the arene a
deuterated arene should be used and deuterium incorporation into the product alkane
quantified. This could also be achieved in reverse by using a deuterated alkene.
Answer: To gain insight into the reaction mechanism, a series of control reactions
including isotopic labeling experiments were performed. Although the mechanism of the
present reaction has not been fully established, on the basis of control experiments and
isotopic labeling experiments a Friedel-Crafts type of alkylation reaction is proposed. We
believe that this catalytic reaction does not undergo through arene C-H activation.
4. What happens with alkyl substituted a,ß-unsaturated esters/ketones?
Answer: Alkyl substituted a,ß-unsaturated esters/ketones are not responded to this
catalytic method. As a reference, methyl crotonate and pent-3-en-2-one were examined
with 1,2-dimethoxybenzene as arene under the optimized reaction condition.
5. What is observed with arenes bearing electron-withdrawing substituents? What is
observed with arenes not bearing MeO substituents?
Answer: Arenes with bearing electron-withdrawing substituent does not participate in
this catalytic method. The arene not bearing –OMe substitutent such as PhOH well
responded to this method, whereas toluene, xylene even mesitylene are not suitable for
this reaction.
6. Can any of the substrates/substrate precursors in figure 1 be prepared using this method?
Answer: The racemic synthesis of nafenopin, latifolin and tollerodine using this catalytic
method is underway. The abbreviation F-C is very confusing and should be replaced with
Friedel-Crafts.
Answer: All abbreviation F-C is changed with Friedel-Crafts in the revised manuscript.
7. SI - it is difficult to differentiate known and novel compounds in the SI. Novel
compounds should be highlighted.
Answer: All the products except 5d are new compounds, first time reported. The
compound 5d is reported, although no spectral data is available to that journal (Indian
Journal of Chemistry, Volume 54B, 2015, 240-244).
8. SI "white solids" and melting points - melting points should be reported of crystalline
materials with the solvent of recrystallisation. White solids are either amorphous or
crystalline and colorless. Crystalline solids should be defined e.g. cuboids, needles etc.
Answer: Most of the cases white solids are amorphous. The compounds 3e, 3f, 3j and
3m, 5a-5d are recrystallised and their melting points are reported in SI.
