Dear authors,
The co-precipitation route to obtain small sized Fe3O4 nanoparticles and their capability
to degrade naphthalene under visible light is investigated. The influence of various reaction
parameters on the degradation efficiency and byproducts formed during the course is clearly
presented with reasonable experimental support. However, preparative method itself is partially
dealt and discussions related to the GC-MS analysis may be further deepened for broader
visibility of the work.
Major comments
(1) As visible light photocatalytic activity is evaluated, it would be more useful if UV-visible
absorption spectra of the sample is provided.
(2) The degradation reaction at different solution pH and formation of intermediate products
therein must also be performed for better understanding.

Abstract

Introduction
(1) The starting phrase ‘Glycol ethers…..from the aqueous systems’ is too general and average in
its content which may be either deleted or ignored.
(2) Add recent review ‘Applied Surface Science 391 (2017) 124-148’ along with [3-5].
(3) The introduction must be made concrete enough to highlight the significance of the work. It
may be rewritten with the following points: (i) semiconductor photocatalysts and various
nanomaterials used; (ii) emergence of iron oxides must be discussed followed by Fe3O4; (iii)
various methods (if any) to obtain Fe3O4, followed by emphasizing the co-precipitation method;
(iv) lacunae in previous literature and scope of the present work.
Experimental
(1) The preparation method must be detailed out to ensure reproducibility: (i) exact weight of
precursors in the specified volume should be indicated; (ii) solution pH before and after the
addition of FeCl3 and subsequent changes observed after heating should be indicated; (iii)
change in solution temperature after the addition of FeSO4 solution.
(2) Was the temperature maintained at 353 K throughout the reaction? If any variation during the
course, it must be indicated.
(3) The formation of Fe3O4 requires more information: (i) does the fate of product changes if both
the precursors are added at the same time or FeCl3 added after the FeSO4?; (ii) does the reaction
kinetics alter if NH3 is replaced with NaOH?; (iii) choice of 353 K towards heating the solution

These aspects may be carefully dealt with reasonable experimental evidence.

The manuscript reports on the synthesis of Fe3O4 nanoparticles of ~15nm through co-
precipitation method using FeCl3 and Fe2SO4 aqueous solution. The synthesized material was
characterized using XRD, TEM and magnetic property was determined to be 607.9 emu/g.
Further, Fe3O4 was used as a photo catalyst to effectively degrade naphthalene with and without
H2O2 under visible light irradiation. After careful reading of the article, I couldn’t find any point
of novelty and scientific exploration of new ideas. Moreover, the manuscript is not well presented
and authors have not provided detailed discussions on the photodegradation analysis. There is

report on the objective and advancements of this work compared to the previous reports in
introduction section. Considering the above factor, I would not recommend the manuscript for its
publication in this journal. Besides, I recommend authors to address some of the critical
comments prior to the submission in other suitable journals.
1. What is the scale of TEM image? Discuss on the diffraction plane of Fe3O4. As observed, the
Fe3O4 is not uniform size and moreover the structure is also no stabilized. It is evident that there
is been formation of rod like structures along with particles. Clarify.
2. How the oxidation state of Fe is confirmed?
3. What is the stability of the catalyst? Did authors perform cyclic test to confirm the degradation
efficiency? Provide the FESEM and XRD analysis after degradation process to ensure its stability.
4. Is the catalyst reusable? How can it be proved?
5. Provide the optical images of the degradation specimen.
6. What is the wavelength and intensity of visible light used to carry out photodegradation
process? What is the distance maintained between the source and the light?

Response to Reviews
Dear Editor
Thank you very much for your and referee’s suggestion on revision of my manuscript
( Ms. ID: RSOS-180637). I have revised my manuscript according to your and reviewer
comments. However, some questions have been needed to specify as follows in details.
Reviewer: 1
The co-precipitation route to obtain small sized Fe3O4 nanoparticles and their
capability to degrade naphthalene under visible light is investigated. The influence of
various reaction parameters on the degradation efficiency and byproducts formed during
the course is clearly presented with reasonable experimental support. However,
preparative method itself is partially dealt and discussions related to the GC-MS analysis
may be further deepened for broader visibility of the work.
Reply: the preparative method has been detailed dealt in Experiment section and the
discussions related to the GC-MS analysis have been further deepened for broader
visibility of the work.
Major comments
(1) As visible light photocatalytic activity is evaluated, it would be more useful if
UV-visible absorption spectra of the sample is provided.
Reply: UV-vis spectrum of the sample Fe3O4 has been provided in Fig. 4.
(2) The degradation reaction at different solution pH and formation of intermediate
products therein must also be performed for better understanding.
Reply: The effect of pH on degradation reaction has been performed as shown in Fig. 10.
The intermediate products at different solution pH is the same as the reported ones in this
case.
Minor comments
Abstract
(1) It may be made impressive by highlighting the results of materials characterization
and degradation pathways.
Reply: it has been made impressive by highlighting the characterization of Fe3O4 such as
UV-vis, XPS spectrum and discussing degradation pathways as shown in reaction
mechanism section.
Introduction
(1) The starting phrase ‘Glycol ethers…..from the aqueous systems’ is too general and
average in its content which may be either deleted or ignored.
Reply: it has been deleted.
(2) Add recent review ‘Applied Surface Science 391 (2017) 124-148’ along with [3-5].
Reply: it has been added in references [3-6]
(3) The introduction must be made concrete enough to highlight the significance of the
work. It may be rewritten with the following points: (i) semiconductor photocatalysts and
various nanomaterials used; (ii) emergence of iron oxides must be discussed followed by
Fe3O4; (iii) various methods (if any) to obtain Fe3O4, followed by emphasizing the
co-precipitation method; (iv) lacunae in previous literature and scope of the present work.
Reply: the introduction section has been rewritten with the above points.
Experimental
(1) The preparation method must be detailed out to ensure reproducibility: (i) exact
weight of precursors in the specified volume should be indicated; (ii) solution pH before
and after the addition of FeCl3 and subsequent changes observed after heating should be
indicated; (iii) change in solution temperature after the addition of FeSO4 solution.
Reply: the preparation method has been detailed revised in order to ensure reproducibility
with the above points (i), (ii) and (iii).
(2) Was the temperature maintained at 353 K throughout the reaction? If any variation
during the course, it must be indicated.
Reply: when FeSO4 solution was added, the temperature changed to be about 78 oC and
then continuously heated to 80 oC.
(3) The formation of Fe3O4 requires more information: (i) does the fate of product
changes if both the precursors are added at the same time or FeCl3 added after the
FeSO4?; (ii) does the reaction kinetics alter if NH3 is replaced with NaOH?; (iii) choice
of 353 K towards heating the solution should also be justified.
These aspects may be carefully dealt with reasonable experimental evidence.
Reply: when both the precursors are added at the same time or FeCl3 added after the
FeSO4, NH3 replaced with NaOH or choice of lower temperature 343 K to prepare
Fe3O4(co), Fe3O4(N) and Fe3O4(70), their activities for degradation have been evaluated
as shown in Table 1. since FeSO4 added in basic solution before FeCl3 easily caused the
oxidation of Fe(OH)2 by air, it is very difficult to control the ratio of Fe(III) to Fe(II) in
this case.
Catalytic test and analytical procedure
(1) The solution pH at which degradation reaction is monitored should be indicated.
Reply: it has been indicated in Experiment section.
Results and discussion
(1) The discussions related to Figures 1-7 must be supported by suitable literatures.
Reply: the suitable literatures have been added in the discussions.
(2) The symbole ‘=’ may be replaced with an arrow mark in all the chemical reactions.
Reply: it has been revised.
(3) Add review ‘RSC Advances 5 (2015) 3306-3351’ along with ref. [22].
Reply: the reference has been added as [31]
(4) The GC-MS analysis may be tabulated: intermediate product; m/z peak; Retention
time from GC for more understanding. Also, formation of each intermediates (Schemes 1
& 2) must be accounted with proper reasoning.
Reply: the GC-MS analysis has been tabulated as Fig. IS1 in supporting information.
formation of each intermediates (Schemes 1 and 2) has been accounted with proper
reasoning.
(5) Comment on the recycling ability of Fe3O4 for the probe reaction and also compare
the efficiency with Fe2O3.
Reply: the recycling ability of Fe3O4 for the probe reaction has been explored in Fig. 13
and 14. Photocatalytic activity of <U+0251>-Fe2O3 has been also performed as compared with
Fe3O4 in Table 1.
Conclusions
(1) The phrase ‘solved in water’ could not be followed.
Reply: the phrase has been omitted.
(2) It may be rewritten elegantly to emphasize the highlight of the work.
Reply: it has been revised to emphasize the highlight of the work.

publication in this journal. Besides, I recommend authors to address some of the critical
comments prior to the submission in other suitable journals.
Reply: the introduction section has been rewritten with the above points.
1. What is the scale of TEM image? Discuss on the diffraction plane of Fe3O4. As
observed, the Fe3O4 is not uniform size and moreover the structure is also no stabilized. It
is evident that . Clarify.
Reply: the scale of TEM image has been added in Fig. 2. Indeed, there has been
formation of rod like structures along with nanoparticles, but the experiment results
showed that the Fe3O4 is stable.
2. How the oxidation state of Fe is confirmed?
Reply: the oxidation state of Fe has been confirmed by XPS in Fig. 3.
3. What is the stability of the catalyst? Did authors perform cyclic test to confirm the
degradation efficiency? Provide the FESEM and XRD analysis after degradation process
to ensure its stability.
Reply: reusability of Fe3O4 has been provided in Fig. 13, XRD pattern of used catalyst
has also been provided in Fig. 14 and SEM can not be performed due to its superpara-
magnetic.
4. Is the catalyst reusable? How can it be proved?
Reply: reusability of Fe3O4 has been provided in Fig. 13, it proved that Fe3O4 can easily
be recovered and effectively reused.
5. Provide the optical images of the degradation specimen.
Reply: the degradation specimen has been provided in supporting information.
6. What is the wavelength and intensity of visible light used to carry out
photodegradation process? What is the distance maintained between the source and the
light?
Reply: the wavelength and intensity of visible light are 400-780 nm and 2.7 × 105 LX,
respectively. The light source is close to the wall of the reactor.
Hereinbefore, it is the explanation for your and reviewer comments. Please do not
hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
I hope that you will find the revised manuscript suitable for publication in this journal.

Photodegradation of naphthalene over Fe3O4 under visible
lightIrradiation
Manuscript ID:RSOS-181779
The work describes the study of Fe3O4 nanoparticles synthesized by co-
precipitation method as a catalyst for photodegradation of naphthalene under
visible light with or without the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The paper is
written in a concise and clear manner. It is pleasing to note that the authors have
addressed the concerns of the previous reviewers. However, the following
minor comments need to be addressed for the acceptance of this manuscript.
1. The author mentions the adverse effects of PAHs on the environment
and inability of conventional methods to deal with their removal. A few
references here would be welcome.
2. All the figures presented needs to be improved with properly indexed
units.
3. What is the mechanism contributing to dual morphology of synthesized
Fe3O4 material i.e., nanoparticles and nanorods? Is it corresponding to
insufficient reactant sources or incomplete reaction? Is there any merit
of using catalyst with two structures? What is the ratio of particles to
rods structure in formed product? Authors need to justify in detail.
4. What is the bandgap of Fe3O4? Also, the exact visible light wavelength
used for photo degradation need to be provided. Although for reviewer:
2 - comment: 6, authors have mentioned the visible range as 400-780
nm which is irrelevant.
5. Authors need to provide a comparative analysis on performance of
photo degradation reported in this work with other available catalyst.
6. There is no information on pseudo rate kinetics of photo degradation of
naphthalene using Fe3O4. What order does the degradation reaction
follow? Authors should discuss in detail.
7. How about the morphology of catalyst reused? Is there any deterioration
of structure after the degradation reaction and repeated washing?
8. The manuscript finds with many typographical errors which must be
carefully examined by the authors.

Response to Reviews
Dear Editor
Thank you very much for your and referee’s suggestion on revision of my
manuscript ( Ms. ID: RSOS-180637). I have revised my manuscript according to your
and reviewer comments. However, some questions have been needed to specify as
follows in details.
Reviewer: 1
Experimental
Preparation of the catalysts
(1) The concentration of NaOH and iron precursors may be expressed in terms of
molarity/normality rather than in weights/volume for clarity.
Reply: the concentration of NaOH and iron precursors had been revised as mol/L
Results and discussion
(1) Caption in Figure 8: Typo – naph!
Reply: "naph" has been revised as "naphthalene".
The reusability of the catalyst
(1) The particle size of Fe3O4 after the recycling should also be provided for more
understanding.
Reply: the TEM image of reused catalyst for fourth time has been provided in Fig. 15
(down). The particle size of used Fe3O4 is almost unchangeable.
Reviewer: 2
1. The author mentions the adverse effects of PAHs on the environment and inability
of conventional methods to deal with their removal. A few references here would be
welcome.
Reply: the references [3-5] have been added in "Introduction".
2. All the figures presented needs to be improved with properly indexed units.
Reply: they have been improved and revised.
3. What is the mechanism contributing to dual morphology of synthesized Fe3O4
material i.e., nanoparticles and nanorods? Is it corresponding to insufficient reactant
sources or incomplete reaction? Is there any merit of using catalyst with two
structures? What is the ratio of particles to rods structure in formed product? Authors
need to justify in detail.
Reply: there is very difficult for separating nanoparticles and nanorods of Fe3O4 with
15 nm size or diameter, and for controlling preparation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles with 15
nm size and Fe3O4 nanorods with diameter of 15 nm. Therefore, we can not explore
the mechanism contributing to dual morphology of synthesized Fe3O4 material i.e.,
nanoparticles and nanorods.
4. What is the bandgap of Fe3O4? Also, the exact visible light wavelength used for
photo degradation need to be provided. Although for reviewer: 2 - comment: 6,
authors have mentioned the visible range as 400-780 nm which is irrelevant.
Reply: due to very wide absorbance peak for visible lisht, the threshold of absorption
wavelength in UV-vis spectrum is uncertain (see Fig. 4), so that, it is impossible to be
sure about the value of the bandgap of Fe3O4. Moreover, the used light source (HSX-F
/UV300) was purchased from Beijing NBet science & technology Ltd Co in China. It
only irradiates visible light with wavelength 400-780 nm via using VISREF780 filter.
5. Authors need to provide a comparative analysis on performance of photo
degradation reported in this work with other available catalyst.
Reply: we have provided the comparative analysis on performance of
photodegradation reported in this case with TiO2 supported and doped TiO2 catalysts,
as seen in page 5.
6. There is no information on pseudo rate kinetics of photo degradation of
naphthalene using Fe3O4. What order does the degradation reaction follow? Authors
should discuss in detail.
Reply: pseudo rate kinetics of photodegradation of naphthalene using Fe3O4 has been
provided in page 5.
7. How about the morphology of catalyst reused? Is there any deterioration of
structure after the degradation reaction and repeated washing?
Reply: the TEM image of reused catalyst for fourth time has been provided in Fig. 15
(down). The morphology of used Fe3O4 is almost unchangeable.
8. The manuscript finds with many typographical errors which must be carefully
examined by the authors.
Reply: typographical errors all over the manuscript have been examined and revised.
Hereinbefore, it is the explanation for your and reviewer comments. Please do not
hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
I hope that you will find the revised manuscript suitable for publication in this journal.
