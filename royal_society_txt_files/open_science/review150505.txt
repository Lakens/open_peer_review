The present manuscript of Palagi et al. provides an account of emotional contagion in the
domesticated dog via ethological observations in a natural setting. Specifically, they show that
the play bow and an open mouth gesture are more likely to co-occur in dyads during free social
interaction relative to what they term ‘incongruent’ responses. They also demonstrate congruent
responses are moderated by the level of social bonding between individuals. I think this is a solid
experiment approach as well as a set of interesting findings, and in principle I think that this
manuscript is publishable in RSOS. However, I have some significant concerns with the
manuscript in its current state. My major questions involve the authors’ use of specific terms and
I question whether their control measures should be more thorough. I provide my thoughts
chronologically below.
Title: Using the term “first evidence in a non-primate mammal” is too strong and not supported
by the evidence in rodents. See below.
Ln. 15: The authors need to provide citations of empirical studies showing rapid facial mimicry is
related to emotion contagion. This notion is largely speculative I believe but rampant in the
primate literature.
Ln. 21: I’m not convinced that ‘experimental’ and ‘control’ stimuli are appropriate terms for
describing the 4 different behaviors that were quantified (see below).
Ln. 22: How do the authors know this is unconscious mimicry? Just because it occurs within 1 sec
doesn’t mean that it is unconscious vs. conscious.
There are a number of value-laden terms used in the Abstract and Introduction: Rapid mimicry,
emotional contagion, reciprocal mirror response….They all are essentially used to describe the
same behavioral phenomenon. The authors should choose one or sufficiently describe how each
concept is different (and perhaps how they relate). In other words, contagion does not necessarily
imply mimicry nor does mimicry imply emotional contagion.
Ln. 76: Should the authors consider exclusively using the term ‘breed’ (mixed or pure) and not
use ‘race’? Race seems to have too many sociological connotations.
Ln 81: The authors should describe what is meant by one partner inviting another to play.
Ln 97: I don’t understand what “4csec accuracy one-frame accuracy (25 clicks/second)” means?
Ln 102: I’m not convinced that focusing on the congruence of 2 behaviors (PBOW and ROW)
without looking at the other 2 (JUMP and BITE) is appropriate.
Ln 114: In other words, the authors need to evaluate congruent responses for JUMP and BITE as
well and then contrast these to congruent responses for PBOW and ROW. What if JUMP and
BITE also show congruence?
Likewise, the authors need to present the frequencies that they observed each behavior and
whether they were expressed (or not) within 1 second of each other. If certain behaviors occur
more often than others do then there is higher chance of congruence too, and this should be
corrected for.
Ln 131: The authors report how many dogs they observed (n=49), but based on the n=21 reported
in the Results how many dogs actually contributed to the data set?

I don’t understand why the figures are presented with ±2 SEM? Also, Figures 1 and 2 aren’t really
publication quality.

Palagi, Nicotra and Cordoni asserted the following predictions in their study: 1) Domestic dogs
are capable of rapidly reproducing behaviours of emotions of conspecifics during play; 2) Rapid
behavioural mimicry in play is more frequent among dogs with higher levels of affiliation. Their
data revealed a significant difference in the occurrences of congruent behaviours of a matching
affective valence relative to incongruent matches, demonstrating that dogs are at least capable of
reproducing affectively valenced behaviours. This outcome represents the first empirical
evidence of such rapid mimicry in nonprimate species and, consequently, an important
contribution to emotion research. In addition, the authors found that the rapid mimicry occurred
more among familiar dogs than among less familiar dogs.
Two main concerns as well as a few minor comments are addressed below.
Main Comments
For the second part of the study, the authors extracted data from the same behavioural context
(social play) to determine both the level of ‘friendship’ and the occurrence of mimicry in order to
evaluate the relationship between the two. Since potentially dependent sets of data were here
assessed, it is important that the authors discuss much more carefully these results. Alternative
explanations need to be addressed. For instance, the frequent practice of play itself (instead of the
social closeness among the dogs) could have affected their play responses/mimicry.
How do the results of this study exactly link to emotional contagion? The studied dogs were
playing with one another, so they are already a sharing of positive emotion states. How does
mimicry contribute more here? Please also include the recent work by Dezecache, Jacob, & Grezes
(2015) as it addresses a number of relevant issues on emotional contagion. In addition, there is no
direct metric that would serve as an index as to whether the rapid mimicry was indeed
4
automatic. How can we be certain that the rapid responses were automatic? Research by Ulf
Dimberg might be useful to address this issue.
Minor Comments
Line 34: ‘through’ (not ‘trough’)
The list on rapid mimicry papers is incomplete (line 35). It was also found in chimpanzees
(Davila-Ross, Allcock, Thomas & Bard, 2011).
The provided definition of emotional contagion (line 40) could be more specific for example by
referring to ‘emotional behavioural change’ rather than simply ‘behavioural change’. Also,
yawning is not an emotional behaviour (line 44).
Due to rough play activities it should be expected that the dogs were also showing open-mouth
panting expressions during play. How were such expressions treated in this study?
The future research suggestion in line 174 identifies an important comparison group (wolves)
that would be useful to assess whether Body-Facial mimicry has been shaped by domestication or
social living as social carnivores. This would be very interesting in order to better understand the
selection pressures of the domestication process selected for inter-specific communicative
capacities (human-dog interactions) rather than intra-specific (dog-dog interactions).
No data detailing the nature of the following interaction between dogs after a
congruent/incongruent response was provided, which would provide a stronger indication as to
whether a positive affective state had been shared. For example, one might expect play bouts to
last a longer period of time where a positive affective state had been shared through congruent
rapid mimicry. Since you probably still have access to such data, it would be great to read about
such a potential impact in your manuscript.

Comments to the Author:
Thank you for your submission. We will not be able to publish the manuscript in its current form,
and we agree with your reviewers that more work needs to be done. In particular, your reviewers
are questioning the use of the term “emotional contagion”, and the extent to which this
demonstration, even if achieved by this data, is as novel as stated for non-primates. More
generally, they call to question the unqualified use of high order terms such as emotional
contagion, mimicry, reciprocity. In this regard, there are two paths for the manuscript: either
qualify the use of these terms (although I am uncertain the reviewers are convinced this can be
achieved by the data in its current form), or shift the framework within which the data is
described. The reviewers further ask for more detail in the second half of the study in particular. I
hope the review proves helpful in taking the work forward.

label_comment_3
As I mentioned in the first review I think that this contribution could be publishable in RSOS. I
still think that there are some major conceptual (and some technical) issues that need to be dealt
with however.
I still think that the authors are using the terms ‘emotional contagion’ and ‘rapid mimicry’
uncritically. As an example they state that…
“This process involves two steps. Firstly, the perception of others' expressive behaviour
automatically induces the observer to mimic such behaviour. Secondly, the mimicry of the others'
behaviour automatically induces the observer to share the emotional state underpinning such
behaviour.”
… suggesting mimicry leads to contagion.
They then state that “…we expect that mimicry, if it is an expression of an emotional contagion
phenomenon…”
… suggesting contagion leads to mimicry.
Personally, I feel that authors should select one of the terms and stick with it. No doubt contagion
and mimicry are distinct concepts that may interact with each other. But each can also occur
without the other. I refer the authors to Nakahashi, W., & Ohtsuki, H. (2015). When is emotional
contagion adaptive? Journal of Theoretical Biology, 380, 480-488 .For instance, “infectious crying
among babies” likely does not involve mimicry and there are other instances in the animal
literature (some of which are cited) where emotional contagion takes place without mimicry. In
this respect, the first part of the title is very confusing and frankly inappropriate.
The relationship between contagion and mimicry would be better considered in a review-type
article and certainly is not confirmed here. That being said, I still think the authors provide some
quite interesting findings. The remaining comments are focused on the results:
The authors assessed 26 females and 23 males. Shouldn’t the overall N be an even number as all
encounters were dyadic? I don’t understand what is meant by “ties” in the statistical outcomes.
Also, many of the N’s reported equal 21. Is this for the number of dogs included in the analysis
after exclusions? Shouldn’t the N’s pertain to the number of behavioral exchanges, which would
presumably be much higher?
The authors state “Play sessions always began and ended spontaneously because the owners
never interfered or tried to interrupt the session.” The authors should describe where their
observations were taken. I assumed it was some sort of dog-park. If so, I find it highly unlikely
that an owner never intervened.
“The kind of social relationships shared by dogs within each dyad was determined by
interviewing each owner separately. We divided the quality of the social bond in three classes:
“friends” (the dogs which lived together or regularly exchanged playful, affiliative, aggressive
interactions - also exploring together the environment - at least three times per week)…”.
9
Aggression is mentioned here with respect to how the authors categorized social bonds. It is also
hard to believe that instances of aggression were not observed during the dyadic interactions.
Would the authors please illustrate the data for Jump/Jump, Bite/Bite, Jump/PBow, and
Bite/ROM in a figure, as they do in Figure 1 for the other combinations.
Figure 2. How are Bite and ROM significantly different with such a larger degree of overlap
between the respective standard error bars?
The authors state “In humans the observation of facial expressions activates, similarly to
monkeys, not only shared motor representations in premotor and parietal areas but also in
insular and cingulate cortices, being these latter directly involved in processing visceromotor
sensations: a sort of same face-same emotion process [7-9].” The authors should also be careful
with their citations. For instance, citation 8, a classic study by Tania Singer, does not involve facial
mimicry at all.

Abstract: Emotional contagion is a basic form of empathy that makes individuals able to
experience others' emotions. In human and non-human primates emotional contagion is closely
linked to facial mimicry, an automatic and fast response (< 1 sec) in which individuals
involuntary mimic others’ expressions. Here, we tested whether body (play bow, PBOW) and
facial (relaxed open-mouth, ROM) rapid mimicry is present in domestic dogs (Canis lupus
familiaris) during dyadic intra-specific play. During their free playful interactions, dogs showed a
stronger and rapid mimicry response (< 1 sec) after perceiving PBOW and ROM (two signals
typical of play in dogs) than after perceiving JUMP and BITE (two play patterns resembling
PBOW and ROM in motor performance). Playful sessions punctuated by rapid mimicry lasted
longer that those sessions punctuated only by signals. Moreover, the distribution of rapid
13
mimicry was strongly affected by the familiarity linking the subjects involved: the stronger the
social bonding, the higher the level of rapid mimicry. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the
presence of rapid mimicry in dogs, the involvement of mimicry in sharing playful motivation,
and the social modulation of the phenomenon. All these findings concur in supporting the idea
that a possible linkage between rapid mimicry and emotional contagion (a building-block of
empathy) exists also in dogs.

ANSWER: We added the information in the text.
• Authors’ contributions
All submissions, other than those with a single author, must include an Authors’
Contributions section which individually lists the specific contribution of each author. The
list of Authors should meet all of the following criteria; 1) substantial contributions to
conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2)
drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final
approval of the version to be published.
All contributors who do not meet all of these criteria should be included in the
acknowledgements.
We suggest the following format: AB carried out the molecular lab work, participated in
data analysis, carried out sequence alignments, participated in the design of the study and
drafted the manuscript; CD carried out the statistical analyses; EF collected field data; GH

Comments to the Author(s)
As I mentioned in the first review I think that this contribution could be publishable in
label_version_3
RSOS. I still think that there are some major conceptual (and some technical) issues that
need to be dealt with however.
16
I still think that the authors are using the terms ‘emotional contagion’ and ‘rapid mimicry’
uncritically. As an example they state that…“This process involves two steps. Firstly, the
perception of others' expressive behaviour automatically induces the observer to mimic
such behaviour. Secondly, the mimicry of the others' behaviour automatically induces the
observer to share the emotional state underpinning such behaviour.” … suggesting mimicry
leads to contagion. They then state that “…we expect that mimicry, if it is an expression of
an emotional contagion phenomenon…” … suggesting contagion leads to mimicry.
Personally, I feel that authors should select one of the terms and stick with it. No doubt
contagion and mimicry are distinct concepts that may interact with each other. But each
can also occur without the other. I refer the authors to Nakahashi, W., & Ohtsuki, H. (2015).
When is emotional contagion adaptive? Journal of Theoretical Biology, 380, 480-488. For
instance, “infectious crying among babies” likely does not involve mimicry and there are
other instances in the animal literature (some of which are cited) where emotional
contagion takes place without mimicry.
ANSWER: Thank you for your comments. We understood your concern and re-thought
the conceptual framework. We used and cited the reference suggested and explained
that the two phenomena "emotional contagion" and "mimicry" can occur independently
but that they can also interact each other.
In this respect, the first part of the title is very confusing and frankly inappropriate.
ANSWER: We changed the title.
The relationship between contagion and mimicry would be better considered in a review-
type article and certainly is not confirmed here. That being said, I still think the authors
provide some quite interesting findings. The remaining comments are focused on the
results:
The authors assessed 26 females and 23 males. Shouldn’t the overall N be an even number
as all encounters were dyadic?
ANSWER: No, it is not important. Because we considered all possible playing dyads
independently of the sex of the playmates (the variable SEX was included in the model,
GLMM). For example, if we have 5 dogs who play (A,B,C,D,E) we consider a-b; a-c; a-d; a-
e; b-c; b-d; b-e; c-d; c-e; d-e. So 5 N dogs but 10 dyads.
I don’t understand what is meant by “ties” in the statistical outcomes.
ANSWER: If you have two identical values in your dataset, these are called ties. Wilcoxon
test takes ties into account when calculating the sum of ranks for statistical differences.
We know that many authors omit to give the value of ties, but we think it is useful to
better understand the statistical results.
Also, many of the N’s reported equal 21. Is this for the number of dogs included in the
analysis after exclusions?
17
ANSWER: Yes, as we reported in the text, due to the high individual variability in
performance of signals and in order to be conservative as much as possible, we restricted
the analyses only to the subjects (n=21) who perceived at least two stimulus events per
each condition.
Shouldn’t the N’s pertain to the number of behavioral exchanges, which would presumably
be much higher?
ANSWER: We do prefer to analyse data at individual level because it is extremely
important to take into account the strong individual variability, not emerging when
performing analyses focussing on the events. Via an individual analysis we can have a
clear and valuable overview on the real distribution of the phenomenon at group level.
The authors state “Play sessions always began and ended spontaneously because the
owners never interfered or tried to interrupt the session.” The authors should describe
where their observations were taken. I assumed it was some sort of dog-park.
ANSWER: "We collected data in a dog-park located in a public green area in Palermo"
If so, I find it highly unlikely that an owner never intervened.
ANSWER: We explained better in the text that we asked the owners not to intervene
when animals were engaging in play. "Play sessions always began and ended
spontaneously because the owners were asked to never interfere or try to interrupt the
playful session. If an aggression occurred outside playful context, obviously the owner
could freely interrupt the conflict. However, it is worth to note that we never observed
any playful sessions escalating into serious aggression." On the other hand, aggression
could occur outside playful context. When animals were engaging in other activities such
as social assessment, sniffing each other, exploring the environment, ect.
“The kind of social relationships shared by dogs within each dyad was determined by
interviewing each owner separately. We divided the quality of the social bond in three
classes: “friends” (the dogs which lived together or regularly exchanged playful, affiliative,
aggressive interactions - also exploring together the environment - at least three times per
week)…”. Aggression is mentioned here with respect to how the authors categorized social
bonds. It is also hard to believe that instances of aggression were not observed during the
dyadic interactions.
ANSWER: Obviously aggression occurred but what we want to say is that we never
observed conflicts during dyadic playful sessions. We never observed an escalation from
play to aggression.
Would the authors please illustrate the data for Jump/Jump, Bite/Bite, Jump/PBow, and
Bite/ROM in a figure, as they do in Figure 1 for the other combinations.
ANSWER: We added the figure as requested and the relative legend.
18
Figure 2. How are Bite and ROM significantly different with such a larger degree of overlap
between the respective standard error bars?
ANSWER: The nonparametric statistical test, the only one we can apply due to the non
normality of data, clearly gives this result. Anyway, you can check the original dataset
submitted.
The authors state “In humans the observation of facial expressions activates, similarly to
monkeys, not only shared motor representations in premotor and parietal areas but also in
insular and cingulate cortices, being these latter directly involved in processing
visceromotor sensations: a sort of same face-same emotion process [7-9].” The authors
should also be careful with their citations. For instance, citation 8, a classic study by Tania
Singer, does not involve facial mimicry at all.
ANSWER: We removed the citation.
