In this work, authors have reported synthesis of UO-66 supported Fe catalyst and also their
application to oxidation of pollutants like methyl orange and aniline. Oxidation of organic
pollutants with Fe-H2O2 combination is very well known. The Fe/UiO-66 material is poorly
characterized. It is not clear, what is the state of Fe in the catalyst. Also some data interpretations
are not logical. For example, BJH pore-size distribution analysis the authors conclude in table 2
that average pore diameter is 2.0. This does not make sense as the materials are clearly micro
porous as evident from type-1 isotherm(Figure 5a). Moreover, UiO-66 can only have 0.75 nm and
1.2 nm pores from the single-crystal structure data reported in the literature. Further it is
surprising to note just around 8 wt% Fe has brought down the porosity to 0.08 cm3/g. It was
attributed to presence of Fe in the pores, which is also not logical. As simple maths will tell it is
not possible. Also, close analysis of Fe/UiO-66 TGA data shows that the material decomposes
starting from around 280 C, but materials were calcined at 300 C for BET measurements. This
shows poorly conducted experiments. Also, most of the responses given to previous reviewers
are also not scientifically sound. There are several other scientific drawbacks in this paper.
Therefore I recommend rejection of this paper.

In this work, the authors reported a facile vapor deposition method to deposit catalytic Fe species
on metal organic framework of UiO-66. The obtained materials showed good thermal stability
above 200 degree C in air. More importantly, they showed that Fe/UiO-66 was effective to
catalyze the oxidation of benzene derivatives like aniline in water in terms of chemical oxygen
demand (COD) removal efficiency. The paper is well written and recommended for publication
in Royal Society Open Science after addressing the following one important issue:
1. What is the reaction for the considerably higher activity of Fe/UiO-66 than conventional
Fe/Al2O3 catalyst? More discussion might be needed.

Response: Thanks for your time and effort in the whole review
process, and thanks a lot for the recommendation.

Comments to the Author(s)
In this work, authors have reported synthesis of UO-66 supported Fe
catalyst and also their application to oxidation of pollutants like
methyl orange and aniline. Oxidation of organic pollutants with
Fe-H2O2 combination is very well known.
The Fe/UiO-66 material is poorly characterized. It is not clear, what is
the state of Fe in the catalyst.
Response: Thanks for comment. Actually and obviously we have
employed most of the common used catalyst characterization
techniques for our Fe/UiO-66 catalyst, such as XRD, N2-adsorption ,
SEM, EDAX mapping, TG, etc. All the characterization results help
people to better understand the catalyst structure and the related
preparation process. It should be noted that since this paper
emphasis the novelty of preparation for MOF supported Fe catalyst,
only essential and necessary characterization techniques were
employed presently. Generally speaking there are always a lot of
techniques that can provide helpful information for a catalyst. The
scientific story never ends, but a paper has an end. The key point is
what the main purpose of this paper is. For the instance of the issue of
“state of Fe”, in principle, it may may encompass the following
aspects such as, (i) oxidation state (ii) aggregation state, (iii)
coordination state, (iv) distribution of surrounding atoms (v)
exposure state to reactant, etc. Each of the above information is
important to understand a catalytic process. We believe the story of
state of Fe itself is definitely enough to write a long paper even several
paper. We admit that it is an interesting story, however, it is obviously
beyond the scope of this paper.
Further explanation can be seen in a paragraph added in the revised
manuscript. See words from the third line to the end of this paragraph
in Page 22 in the revised manuscript.
End of reply.
Also some data interpretations are not logical. For example, BJH
pore-size distribution analysis the authors conclude in table 2 that
average pore diameter is 2.0. This does not make sense as the
materials are clearly micro porous as evident from type-1
isotherm(Figure 5a). Moreover, UiO-66 can only have 0.75 nm and
1.2 nm pores from the single-crystal structure data reported in the
literature.
Response: Thanks for the comment. Actually there was a sharp peak
around 0.75 nm (Fig. 5c) and a rather small hump around 1.2 nm. The
purchased UiO-66 was powder so as it may not perfectly
single-crystal, and there can have some contribution of mesopores
like inner cracked spaces. The XRD results showed the original UiO-66
was OK. A material having average pore diameter of 2.0 nm may not
necessarily mesoporous. It is reasonable to present a type-I
isotherm.
End of reply.
Further it is surprising to note just around 8 wt% Fe has brought down
the porosity to 0.08 cm3/g. It was attributed to presence of Fe in the
pores, which is also not logical. As simple maths will tell it is not
possible.
Response: Thanks for comment. We agree simple maths really helps
clarify this issue. However, the conclusion is actually reverse to the
one given by the reviewer. The deduction of the above comment is not
logical! Recall the exclusive method.
The pure UiO-66 had large surface area and pore volume before and
after calcination. Suppose the Fe component resided on the outer
surface of UiO-66, or just physically mixed with UiO-66, the 8 wt%
contribution of Fe was not possible to have a great impact on the
overall BET surface or porosity.
So actually it is the only logical conclusion to deduce that the Fe
component was in the pores instead of in other places through simple
maths. It should be noticed that the BET surface area and the porosity
were not the ideal geometrical value, but calculated from the number
of adsorbates (N2). Considering the pores in UiO-66 (e.g.~0.75 nm)
were rather small, the occupation of the micropores by the Fe
components resulted in a sharply decreased space for N2, leading to a
sharp decreased in the measured porosity. The EDX mapping (Fig. 4)
results showed that the Fe distribution of Fe/UiO-66 was well
consistent with the Zr distribution at a same region. Since the Zr
distribution was determined by the UiO-66 framework, the EDX
mapping results further support the above hypothesis.
End of reply.
Also, close analysis of Fe/UiO-66 TGA data shows that the material
decomposes starting from around 280 C, but materials were calcined
at 300 C for BET measurements. This shows poorly conducted
experiments.
Response: Thanks for comment. Actually the pure UiO-66 instead of
Fe/UiO-66 was calcined at 300 oC before the vapor deposition. Before
further characterization, the catalyst was calcined at 200 oC instead of
o
300 C (see the Catalyst Preparation section in Page 6 in the
manuscript). So there is no problem for our experiment.
End of reply.
Also, most of the responses given to previous reviewers are also not
scientifically sound. There are several other scientific drawbacks in
this paper.
Therefore I recommend rejection of this paper.

important issue:
1. What is the reaction for the considerably higher activity of
Fe/UiO-66 than conventional Fe/Al2O3 catalyst? More discussion
might be needed.
Response: Thanks for your time and effort in the whole review
process. Thanks for the suggestion. We guess the above-mentioned
word of “reaction” can be “reason”. We have added a paragraph for
further discussion on the reason for higher activity of Fe/UiO-66 than
conventional Fe/Al2O3 catalyst.
We added the following words of discussion.
In the mean time the reason for the considerably higher catalytic
activity of Fe/UiO-66 than conventional Fe/Al2O3 for the tested
reactions became an interesting issue. Although MOF in general and
UiO-66 in particular has large surface area, Fe/UiO-66 did not present
rather high BET surface area in this work (see Table 2). The BET
surface area of Fe/UiO-66 was even lower than that of Fe/Al2O3,
indicating that surface area was not a beneficial factor for the catalytic
superiority of Fe/UiO-66. It is well known that Fe3+ ion is the catalytic
active species for homogenous Fenton reactions. Although the Fe
components are also believed to be catalytic active for the oxidation of
organic compounds by H2O2 through heterogeneous Fenton reactions,
the active Fe structure in the molecular level really responsible for the
catalytic process is still poor understood. Fe/UiO-66 showing higher
catalytic activity than Fe/Al2O3 implicated that the former had much
larger amount of the “active Fe structure”. In this sense, further
systematic characterization of the chemical state of Fe on Fe/UiO-66
can help better understanding the chemical nature of “active Fe
structure” for heterogeneous Fenton reactions.
These words can be seen in the paragraph before “Conclusion” section
in Page 22 in the revised manuscript.
End of reply.
