Comments to the authors:
Previous studies have indicated that Icariin, a component extracted from epimedium, enhances
synthesis of cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) in vivo. However, it remains largely unclear
about possible effect of Icariin on pathological conditions of osteoarthritis (OA). In this paper, the
authors found that Icariin was released steadily from PLGA/Icariin scaffold. Next, proliferation
of chondrocytes on PLGA/Icariin scaffold, but not PLGA scaffold only, was enhanced. Further,
implantation of the material into OA model rabbits resulted in increased amount of cartilage
ECM. I think that this manuscript contains potentially interesting observation. However, I’m
afraid that the results seem to be low impact (see below). Thus, I cannot recommend the
acceptance of this manuscript in Royal Society Open Science.
Major concerns:
1. It has been already reported that Icariin promotes synthesis of cartilage ECM as well as
osteogenesis. I cannot find a novelty of result of this study.
2. They found that PLGA/Icariin, but not PLGA only, enhances proliferation of chondrocytes on
PLGA scaffold (Fig 5). However, Icariin suppresses chondrocyte differentiation via inhibition of
TGF-b signaling (Li YC et al., Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol 2013: 40; 635-43). Thus, it might be
inappropriate to use Icariin as therapy of OA. Further, the result didn’t show chondrocyte
proliferation in an Icariin-dose dependent manner. Unfortunately, the result won’t show role of
Icariin in chondrocyte proliferation. I suggest you will try this study in lower concentration.
Minor concerns:
1. It would be desirable to study Icariin release in the different concentrations (Fig4). The study
would enhance quality of data.
2. They must show pictures of affected tissues stained with HE or Toluidin blue before the
material implantation (Fig 8). It would be an important point to study effect of the implantation
on phenotypes by comparing between pre- and post-implantation.
3. There’re many typos through the whole manuscript. ‘Inhibited’ should be ‘inhibit’ (lane 2 in
page 2). ‘The express’ should be ‘the expression’ (line 43 in page 5). ‘In previous study show’
should be ‘A previous study showed’ (line 5 in page 7). As you know, a word described at first
time in the manuscript should be formal name. In this case, OPN should be Osteopontin (line 18,
page 7). Transcripts should be as italic (line 21 in page 7). ‘diseases affects’ should be ‘disease that
affects’ (line 35 in page 7). ‘the progress’ should be ‘the progression’ (line 42 in page 7). ‘the data
of’ should be ‘the data by’ (line 43 in page 7). The fonts are different (ref no 28 and 36). Pages are
imcomplete (ref no 7, 8, 15, 36, 40). Title should be indicated as upright type (ref no 29).

In this manuscript, icariin was released by the poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)
electrospun delivery system for prevention of osteoarthritis. Icariin was released slowly and
steadily from the scaffold in addition to enhanced chondrocyte proliferation and adhesion.
Authors showed sufficient evidence that the icariin has improved the osteogenesis in addition to
the previous work shown by using similar electrospun polymer networks.

The manuscript from Wang et al. entitled “PLGA scaffold loaded with icariin for inhibiting the
progression of osteoarthritis in rabbits” presents the effect of Icariin from PLGA scaffolds on
inhibiting the progression of osteoarthritis. The article mainly demonstrated the feasibility of
4
PLGA/Icariin scaffolds for tissue engineering, which was tested by investigating cell
biocompatibility in vitro, and the therapeutic effects on osteoarthritis in vivo. The article was
concise and well written. The article could be published after addressing these comments.
The introduction should be improved with sufficient comparisons relevant to other technologies
such as supercritical fluid technology and 3D printing, which have been utilized for the
generation of scaffolds and delivery of active substances for cell growth. I suggest citing these
articles relevant to these technologies. Adv. Healthcare Mater. 2017, 1700433, International

Better input the respective wavenumber in the graph (Fig. 3) rather than in the figure legend.
Loading amount of Icariin?, please represent the release amount in the form of percentage in
Figure 4.
I do not think chondrocyte proliferation concerning that showing the effect of Icariin is necessary,
as the aim is towards inhibiting the progression of arthritis. Better change the “effect of icariin” in
the methods section to biocompatibility as represented in the results. Furthermore,
biocompatibility study of these scaffolds on rabbit bone cells would have been appropriate.
Please rewrite some of the discussions regarding FTIR and ALP as they are repeated with the
results.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
In this manuscript, the author investigated the preparation of PLGA/icariin scaffold by
electrospinning and evaluation of it in vitro and in vivo. This is interesting manuscript. However
the authors should address the following issues:
1. In page 4 line 41, what is the state of the word “rough”. I could not observe the difference
between PLGA and PLGA/icariin samples in Fig. 1.
5
2. In page 4 line 46, is the sentence “the hydrophilic materials …” correct? You should list
references in order to insist on this phenomenon. In general, the contact angle of the surface
where protein is most adsorbed is about 70-90°.
3. In Fig. 2 caption, (D) is missing.
4. Fig. 4 shows only absorbance. You should evaluate the amount of released icariin from
scaffold. By determining the correlation between the concentration of icariin and the absorbance,
the correlation between the amount of elution in PBS and time can be clarified. In addition, these
date is needed for your suggestion. (page 6 line 43)
5. Fig. 6 shows the adhesion of chondrocyte 4 days after seeding. As you mentioned in Fig. 3, the
cells generally proliferate in 3 days. I could not understand why you chose 4 days after seeding. If
you want to refer to cell adhesion, initial adhesion of cells should be observed. And the result of
initial adhesion would relate the result of proliferation assay in Fig. 5.
6. Fig. 7 shows the ALP activity. There is no information for the cell cumber of MC3T3-E1.
Usually ALP activity is obtained by dividing by DNA or the number of cells. This is because if the
number of cells is large, total ALP activity also increase. You should investigate the relation
between cell number and ALP activity.
7. In Fig. 8, 9,10, I could not find the information which scaffold (0.01, 0.1 1%) were used for in
vivo assay.
8. In Fig. 8B, white balance should be done.
9. Fig. 9 shows the results of PCR. In Fig. 9, PLGA/icariin, PLGA are arranged in this order.
However other figures are in reverse order. It leads to confusion.
10. In gene expression analysis, the expression increases exponentially. Therefore, when making a
relative comparison, it is usual to compare the difference between the expression of samples in
the scale of 100 and 1000 times. The result of Fig. 9 compared very small differences. You should
check whether the analysis method is correct.
11. In my opinion, if you want to mention the effect of sustained release of icariin from scaffold,
you should use the PLGA scaffold adding icariin containing medium in vitro, or injecting icariin
solution in vivo as a control.

Comments to the Author:
Dear Dr Wang,
Thank you for sending us your manuscript. Four reviewers have seen your manuscript and they
have a number of major suggestions that you will need to address before we can consider a
resubmission. I am curious about the interpretations around increased chondrocyte proliferation.
In the context of osteoarthritis, chondrone formation (an OA hallmark) appears to be due to too
much chondrocyte proliferation. So an OA treatment might not necessarily benefit from
stimulating chondrocyte proliferation. Please also pay attention to the English used in your
manuscript, which would benefit from being seen by a scientific English editor.
Kind regards,
Michael Doube

Authors responded well to reviewer’s comment. Although the manuscript was improved, the
authors should address the following comments:
The authors insisted that the hydrophilic materials are better for protein adsorption and cell
adhesion and can retain bioactivity for the long-term. In general, it is known that the protein
adsorption and cell adhesion are highest when the contact angle is around 80 °. Your results
showed that adding icariin lowered the contact angle to 67 °, but you cannot insist that these
results leaded to improve protein adsorption and cell adhesion. If there is a prior research that
PLGA is different from general materials on contact angle and cell adhesion, please show the
references.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Michael Doube):
Thank you for attending to the reviewers' comments. One reviewer commented that:
" Your results showed that adding icariin lowered the contact angle to 67 °, but you cannot insist
that these results leaded to improve protein adsorption and cell adhesion. If there is a prior
research that PLGA is different from general materials on contact angle and cell adhesion, please
show the references. "
Please take care to correct your manuscript in line with this advice.
In addition, I have some comments that will aid the clarity of the text:
'better'. In general it's preferred to avoid this word because it is non-specific and value-loaded. In
all places where you have used the word 'better' in your manuscript, please replace it with
something more specific: higher, faster, more complete, etc.
P1L33 needs a preposition, e.g. _by_ electrospinning, _during_ electrospinning, etc.
P1L44 absorption -> resorption
P1L54 relieve pain -> pain relief
P1L56 Traditional ... kidney. Rephrase into correct English.
P1L57 Herbs ... kidney ... Korea. This is a problematic sentence. In what manner do herbs
'nourish' the kidney? Bear in mind that RSOS is a science journal not an alternative medicine
publication. Please give the Latin binomial name for the plant or plants from which epimedium is
derived. By all means introduce some cultural context about traditional practice but any
statements of cause and effect must be backed up by solid empirical evidence. You could write
something like, "Chinese medicine practitioners believe that there is a strong link between bones
and the kidneys, and that herbs such as epimedium (<insert the Latin Binomial name>) improve
bone health by nourishing the kidneys. Icariin is the main pharmacologically active molecule
present in epimedium (EP)."
P2L5 believed -> found (a belief by itself is not enough, we need to indicate that there was
empirical evidence)
P2L16 four centuries. I find it unlikely that people have been electrospinning nanofibre scaffolds
since the 1500s. The reference you cite suggests in the abstract (unfortunately I don't have the
whole article) that the technology underlying electrospinning goes back 4 centuries. But not
electrospinning itself. Rephrase this sentence.
P3L22 quality -> do you mean quantity?
P4L5 medicine -> Medicine (proper noun)
P4L10 anaesthetization -> anaesthetic induction
P4L29 (and elsewhere) micro-CT -> X-ray microtomography (XMT)
P5L5 smooth -> reduce in roughness
15
P5L13 Hydrophilic ... long term -> Provide evidence for this statement or remove it.
Results: remove references to methods in your results. You restate your method in the first
sentence of each results section - delete these restatements after making sure that they are
included in the methods section. Also, rather than "As shown in Fig 8A ... scaffolds", write the
sentence directly: "The expression ... scaffolds (Fig 8A)." Please do that for every results section.
P6L46 hyperplastic bones -> do you mean osteophytosis? Please clarify.
P6L54 absorption -> resorption
Figures - scale bars are too small and low contrast. Please make them visible. XMT images and
dissection images lack scale bars - put some in.

Dear editors,
Thank the editors and reviewers for these precious comments concerning my
manuscript entitled “PLGA scaffold carrying icariin to inhibit the progression of
osteoarthritis in rabbits”. These comments are all valuable and very helpful for
revising and improving my paper, as well as the important guiding significance
to my researches. We have studied comments carefully and have made
corrections which we hope meet with approval. The responds to the reviewer`s
comments are as follow:
Associate Editor: 1
Thank you for sending us your manuscript. Four reviewers have seen your
manuscript and they have a number of major suggestions that you will need
to address before we can consider a resubmission. I am curious about the
interpretations around increased chondrocyte proliferation. In the context
of osteoarthritis, chondrone formation (an OA hallmark) appears to be due
to too much chondrocyte proliferation. So an OA treatment might not
necessarily benefit from stimulating chondrocyte proliferation. Please also
pay attention to the English used in your manuscript, which would benefit
from being seen by a scientific English editor.
We are appreciative of the editor`s suggestion. The gathering and increase of
chondrocytes is the characteristics of OA. In my opinion, like cough and
vomiting, it is the response of self-healing or self-protecting in our body, not the
cause of OA.
We are very sorry for the mistakes in this manuscript and inconvenience they
caused in your reading. The manuscript has been thoroughly revised and edited
by the highly qualified native English speaking editors at American Journal
Experts (Certificate Verification Key: 1F3A-576F-4B36-D454-8166), so we
hope it can meet the journal`s standard. Thanks so much for your useful
comments.
Reviewer #1:
Previous studies have indicated that Icariin, a component extracted from
epimedium, enhances synthesis of cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) in
vivo. However, it remains largely unclear about possible effect of Icariin on
pathological conditions of osteoarthritis (OA). In this paper, the authors
found that Icariin was released steadily from PLGA/Icariin scaffold. Next,
proliferation of chondrocytes on PLGA/Icariin scaffold, but not PLGA
scaffold only, was enhanced. Further, implantation of the material into OA
model rabbits resulted in increased amount of cartilage ECM. I think that
this manuscript contains potentially interesting observation. However, I’m
afraid that the results seem to be low impact (see below). Thus, I cannot
recommend the acceptance of this manuscript in Royal Society Open
Science.
Major concerns:
1. It has been already reported that Icariin promotes synthesis of cartilage
ECM as well as osteogenesis. I cannot find a novelty of result of this study.
As for the referee`s concern, we have indicated the novelty of result of this study.
First of all, Icariin is a small molecular weight (only 676.65) component. When
it was added into the hydrogel directly, Icariin will release fast
into the surrounding tissue <U+FB02>uid. The fast release leads to high
carrying dose requirement and short duration of validity, and even
more risk of side effects because of the high initial released
concentration. (T. Yuan, et al. Conjugated icariin promotes tissue-engineered
cartilage formation in hyaluronic acid/collagen hydrogel. DOI:
10.1016/j.procbio.2015.09.006). In this study, icariin was loading in the PLGA
scaffolds which could maintain a lasting release of icariin. Secondly, this study
found that the therapeutic effect of icariin on osteoarthritis depends not only on
promoting synthesis of cartilage ECM, but also on inhibiting the absorption of
subchondral bone. Thirdly, although Icariin can`t induce the chondrogenic
differentiate of MC3T3-E1 in vitro, it can promote the synthesis of ECM in vivo.
Therefore, we predicted that there is a different mechanism of icariin in vitro and
in vivo.
2. They found that PLGA/Icariin, but not PLGA only, enhances
proliferation of chondrocytes on PLGA scaffold (Fig 5). However, Icariin
suppresses chondrocyte differentiation via inhibition of TGF-b signaling (Li
YC et al., Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol 2013: 40; 635-43). Thus, it might be
inappropriate to use Icariin as therapy of OA. Further, the result didn’t
show chondrocyte proliferation in an Icariin-dose dependent manner.
Unfortunately, the result won’t show role of Icariin in chondrocyte
proliferation. I suggest you will try this study in lower concentration.
We are appreciative of the reviewer`s suggestion. Li YC et al. verified that
Icariin suppresses chondrocyte differentiation via inhibition of TGF-b signaling.
The result is consistent with our data (Real-time polymerase chain reaction assay
of articular cartilage). As shown in Fig. 10D, at the concentration of 0.01% and
0.1%, icariin leaded to the down-regulation the expression of OPN.OPN was
synthesized by bone-forming cells and hypertrophic chondrocytes, and previous
study suggested that OPN mRNA was found in cartilage from patients with
osteoarthritis, while no OPN mRNA expression was observed in chondrocytes of
adult healthy cartilage (C. M. Giachelli, Steitz, S. 2000 Osteopontin: a versatile
regulator of inflammation and biomineralization. Matrix. Biol. . 19, 615-622.// O.
Pullig, G. Weseloh, S. Gauer, Swoboda, B. 2000 Osteopontin is expressed by
adult human osteoarthritic chondrocytes: protein and mRNA analysis of normal
and osteoarthritic cartilage. Matrix. Biol. 19, 245-255). The gathering and
increase of chondrocytes is the characteristics of OA. In my opinion, like cough
and vomiting, it is the response of self-healing or self-protecting in our body, not
the cause of OA.
We added a MTT assay using a pure icariin solution. Our data showed that the
cells cultured with icariin solution showed chondrocyte proliferation in an
Icariin-dose dependent manner. At icariin concentrations of about 0.3%, the
absorbance decreased, which may due to the cytotoxicity of icariin. However, the
result didn’t show chondrocyte proliferation in PLGA/Icariin group. The result
indicates that the slow release of icariin from scaffolds.
Minor concerns:
1. It would be desirable to study Icariin release in the different
concentrations (Fig4). The study would enhance quality of data.
As for the referee`s concern, an release experiment in the different
concentrations (0.01%, 0.1%, and 1%) has been supplemented.
2. They must show pictures of affected tissues stained with HE or Toluidin
blue before the material implantation (Fig 8). It would be an important
point to study effect of the implantation on phenotypes by comparing
between pre- and post-implantation.
As for the referee`s concern, we have added pre-implantation and
post-implantation pictures in Fig 8.
3. There’re many typos through the whole manuscript. ‘Inhibited’ should be
‘inhibit’ (lane 2 in page 2). ‘The express’ should be ‘the expression’ (line 43
in page 5). ‘In previous study show’ should be ‘A previous study showed’
(line 5 in page 7). As you know, a word described at first time in the
manuscript should be formal name. In this case, OPN should be
Osteopontin (line 18, page 7). Transcripts should be as italic (line 21 in page
7). ‘diseases affects’ should be ‘disease that affects’ (line 35 in page 7). ‘the
progress’ should be ‘the progression’ (line 42 in page 7). ‘the data of’ should
be ‘the data by’ (line 43 in page 7). The fonts are different (ref no 28 and 36).
Pages are imcomplete (ref no 7, 8, 15, 36, 40). Title should be indicated as
upright type (ref no 29).
We are very sorry for the mistakes in this manuscript and inconvenience they
caused in your reading. The manuscript has been thoroughly revised and edited
by the highly qualified native English speaking editors at American Journal
Experts (Certificate Verification Key: 1F3A-576F-4B36-D454-8166), so we
hope it can meet the journal`s standard. Thanks so much for your useful
comments.
Reviewer #2:
In this manuscript, icariin was released by the poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid
(PLGA) electrospun delivery system for prevention of osteoarthritis. Icariin
was released slowly and steadily from the scaffold in addition to enhanced
chondrocyte proliferation and adhesion. Authors showed sufficient evidence
that the icariin has improved the osteogenesis in addition to the previous
work shown by using similar electrospun polymer networks.
Thank you for your comments.
Reviewer #3:
The manuscript from Wang et al. entitled “PLGA scaffold loaded with
icariin for inhibiting the progression of osteoarthritis in rabbits” presents
the effect of Icariin from PLGA scaffolds on inhibiting the progression of
osteoarthritis. The article mainly demonstrated the feasibility of
PLGA/Icariin scaffolds for tissue engineering, which was tested by
investigating cell biocompatibility in vitro, and the therapeutic effects on
osteoarthritis in vivo. The article was concise and well written. The article
could be published after addressing these comments.
1. The introduction should be improved with sufficient comparisons
relevant to other technologies such as supercritical fluid technology and 3D
printing, which have been utilized for the generation of scaffolds and
delivery of active substances for cell growth. I suggest citing these articles
relevant to these technologies. Adv. Healthcare Mater. 2017, 1700433,
International Journal of Nanomedicine 2018:13 4227–4245, J. of
Supercritical Fluids 120 (2017) 43–51, International Journal of
Nanomedicine 2017:12 1877–1890, Biofabrication 9 (2017) 032002, ACS

2018, 10, 807, Nanomaterials 2018, 8, 360.
We are appreciative of the reviewer`s suggestion. Indeed, it will be more
profound if we add comparisons relevant to other technologies. We mention in
the limitations of the study that we will improve the scaffold to facilitate
implantation, and load the cytokines that promote differentiation into
chondrocytes. However, the limitation of technical condition leads to the use of
electrospinning.
2. Better input the respective wavenumber in the graph (Fig. 3) rather than
in the figure legend. Loading amount of Icariin?,
As for the referee`s concern, we have added the respective wavenumbers to the
Figure.
3. Please represent the release amount in the form of percentage in Figure 4.
As for the referee`s concern, we have made change in Figure 4.
4. I do not think chondrocyte proliferation concerning that showing the
effect of Icariin is necessary, as the aim is towards inhibiting the progression
of arthritis. Better change the “effect of icariin” in the methods section to
biocompatibility as represented in the results. Furthermore,
biocompatibility study of these scaffolds on rabbit bone cells would have
been appropriate. Please rewrite some of the discussions regarding FTIR
and ALP as they are repeated with the results.
Considering the reviewer`s suggestion, we have made change in the manuscript.
And we have rewritten the discussions regarding FTIR and ALP.
Reviewer #4:
In this manuscript, the author investigated the preparation of PLGA/icariin
scaffold by electrospinning and evaluation of it in vitro and in vivo. This is
interesting manuscript.
However the authors should address the following issues:
1. In page 4 line 41, what is the state of the word “rough”. I could not
observe the difference between PLGA and PLGA/icariin samples in Fig. 1.
As for the referee`s concern, scanning electron microscope has been
supplemented. And we have made change in the manuscript.
2. In page 4 line 46, is the sentence “the hydrophilic materials …” correct?
You should list references in order to insist on this phenomenon. In general,
the contact angle of the surface where protein is most adsorbed is about
70-90°.
We are very sorry for the mistakes in this manuscript and inconvenience they
caused in your reading. The manuscript has been thoroughly revised and edited
by the highly qualified native English speaking editors at American Journal
Experts (Certificate Verification Key: 1F3A-576F-4B36-D454-8166), so we
hope it can meet the journal`s standard. Thanks so much for your useful
comments.
The contact angle of the material can be affected by surface free energy, the
surface smoothness, chemical inhomogeneity, etc. A previous study shows that
neat PLGA film shows a contact angle of 75°. With the increase of Ag content,
the contact angle increases from 75° for PLGA pristine polymer, to 76° for
PLGA/1Ag, to 87° for PLGA/3Ag, and to 91° for PLGA/7Ag (Mariangela S.
et al. Antimicrobial Properties and Cytocompatibility of PLGA/Ag
Nanocomposites. DOI: 10.3390/ma9010037). Another study shows that water
contact angles of PLGA porous scaffold is 95.6 ±6.2°, and that of PLGA/
Hydroxyapatite porous scaffold is 84.6 ±7.5°(Jun Z. et al. Improving
osteogenesis of PLGA/HA porous sca<U+FB00>olds based on dual delivery of BMP-2
and IGF-1 via a polydopamine coating. DOI: 10.1039/c7ra12062a).
3. In Fig. 2 caption, (D) is missing.
As for the referee`s concern, we have added the caption to the Figure.
4. Fig. 4 shows only absorbance. You should evaluate the amount of released
icariin from scaffold. By determining the correlation between the
concentration of icariin and the absorbance, the correlation between the
amount of elution in PBS and time can be clarified. In addition, these date is
needed for your suggestion. (page 6 line 43)
As for the referee`s concern, an release experiment in the different
concentrations (0.01%, 0.1%, and 1%) has been supplemented. And the amount
of released icariin from scaffold is evaluated. Based on our data the release
profile of icariin showed that there were burst releases from the PLGA/Icariin
composite scaffolds within 12 hours in three groups, and the release
subsequently slowed down and maintained icariin release until 192 hours. In the
PLGA/0.01% icariin group, 67.5% of the loaded drug had been released after 12
hours, while 7.2% of the loaded drug had been released in the PLGA/0.1%
icariin group. The PLGA/0.1% icariin group showed a sustained and slow
release.
5. Fig. 6 shows the adhesion of chondrocyte 4 days after seeding. As you
mentioned in Fig. 3, the cells generally proliferate in 3 days. I could not
understand why you chose 4 days after seeding. If you want to refer to cell
adhesion, initial adhesion of cells should be observed. And the result of
initial adhesion would relate the result of proliferation assay in Fig. 5.
We are very sorry for our mistaken. It should be 24 hours after seeding. We have
made correction according to the Reviewer`s comments.
6. Fig. 7 shows the ALP activity. There is no information for the cell cumber
of MC3T3-E1. Usually ALP activity is obtained by dividing by DNA or the
number of cells. This is because if the number of cells is large, total ALP
activity also increase. You should investigate the relation between cell
number and ALP activity.
It is really true as Reviewer suggested that we should investigate the relation
between cell number and ALP activity. Measurements were normalized by the
number of cells from BCA protein assay. And we have made change in the
manuscript.
7. In Fig. 8, 9,10, I could not find the information which scaffold (0.01, 0.1
1%) were used for in vivo assay.
It is really true as reviewer suggested that there is not information of the scaffold.
We used the PLGA scaffold loading 0.1% Icariin. We have made changes in the
manuscript.
8. In Fig. 8B, white balance should be done.
As for the referee`s concern, we have adjusted the white balance of the picture.
9. Fig. 9 shows the results of PCR. In Fig. 9, PLGA/icariin, PLGA are
arranged in this order. However other figures are in reverse order. It leads
to confusion.
As for the referee`s concern, we have adjusted the order of PLGA/Icariin and
PLGA.
10. In gene expression analysis, the expression increases exponentially.
Therefore, when making a relative comparison, it is usual to compare the
difference between the expression of samples in the scale of 100 and 1000
times. The result of Fig. 9 compared very small differences. You should
check whether the analysis method is correct.
According to previous study, the relative gene expression levels were normalized
to GAPDH (Jun Z. et al. Improving osteogenesis of PLGA/HA porous sca<U+FB00>olds
based on dual delivery of BMP-2 and IGF-1 via a polydopamine coating. DOI:
10.1039/c7ra12062a). In the present study, the relative gene expressions were
normalized by the expression of (GAPDH).
11. In my opinion, if you want to mention the effect of sustained release of
icariin from scaffold, you should use the PLGA scaffold adding icariin
containing medium in vitro, or injecting icariin solution in vivo as a control.
It is really true as Reviewer suggested that we should use the PLGA scaffold
adding icariin containing medium in vitro, or injecting icariin solution in vivo as
a control. However, Icariin is a small molecular weight (only 676.65) component.
When it was added into the hydrogel directly, Icariin will release
fast into the surrounding tissue <U+FB02>uid. The fast release leads to
high carrying dose requirement and short duration of validity, and
even more risk of side effects because of the high initial
released concentration (T. Yuan, et al. Conjugated icariin promotes
tissue-engineered cartilage formation in hyaluronic acid/collagen hydrogel. DOI:
10.1016/j.procbio.2015.09.006). That is the reason we design the PLGA/Icariin
scaffold. Considering the Reviewer`s suggestion, we added a MTT assay using a
pure icariin solution in vitro. Our data showed that the cells cultured with icariin
solution showed chondrocyte proliferation in an Icariin-dose dependent manner.
At icariin concentrations of about 0.3%, the absorbance decreased, which may
due to the cytotoxicity of icariin. However, the result didn’t show chondrocyte
proliferation in PLGA/Icariin group. The result indicates that the slow release of
icariin from scaffolds.

We are very sorry for the mistakes in this manuscript. Our data can`t prove that

proved that the hydrophilic surface property and the RGD peptides can
specifically facilitate cellular behaviors, including cell adhesion and proliferation
