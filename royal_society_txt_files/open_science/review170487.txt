This manuscript studied the some physical properties of the cellulose/TBAH aqueous solution at
different cellulose concentrations as well as in two TBAH concentrations. The method used in this
manuscript is quiet interesting and gave some different approach to look into the basic aspects of
cellulose dissolving in aqueous TBAH solution. However, in addition to give the complex
modeling of the cellulose/TBAH, a more clear and detailed discussion should be addressed
regarding how the S(eff) parameter represented the repulsive and attractive interactions, and
how it related to the dissolution of cellulose? Also, did the repulsive and attractive interactions
referring to the interaction between dissolved cellulose molecules?

This paper is well written and easy to read. The goals are clear, well illustrated and these new
results will be useful to develop cellulosic material by controlling the supramolecular structure. I
recommend to publish this paper without modification.

Thank you for submitting the above manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. On behalf of the
Editors and the Royal Society of Chemistry, I am pleased to inform you that your manuscript will
be accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science subject to minor revision in accordance
with the referee suggestions. Please find the reviewers' comments at the end of this email.
The reviewers and handling editors have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, I invite you to respond to the comments and revise your
manuscript. Please also add the following statements. Please note that we cannot publish your
manuscript without these end statements included. We have included a screenshot example of
the end statements for reference. If you feel that a given heading is not relevant to your paper,
please nevertheless include the heading and explicitly state that it is not relevant to your work.
• Ethics statement
Please clarify whether you received ethical approval from a local ethics committee to carry out
your study. If so please include details of this, including the name of the committee that gave
consent in a Research Ethics section after your main text. Please also clarify whether you received
informed consent for the participants to participate in the study and state this in your Research
Ethics section.
*OR*
Please clarify whether you obtained the necessary licences and approvals from your institutional
animal ethics committee before conducting your research. Please provide details of these licences
and approvals in an Animal Ethics section after your main text.
*OR*
Please clarify whether you obtained the appropriate permissions and licences to conduct the
fieldwork detailed in your study. Please provide details of these in your methods section.
• Data accessibility
It is a condition of publication that you make available the data and research materials
supporting the results in the article. Datasets should be deposited in an appropriate publicly
available repository and details of the associated accession number, link or DOI to the datasets
must be included in the Data Accessibility section of the article
(http://royalsocietypublishing.org/instructions-authors#question17). Reference(s) to datasets
should also be included in the reference list of the article with DOIs (where available).
Please include a Data Availability section after your main text stating where supporting data are
available from, or where they will be made available should your article be accepted for
publication.
If you wish to submit your supporting data or code to Dryad (http://datadryad.org/), or modify
your current submission to dryad, please use the following link:

• Acknowledgements
Please acknowledge anyone who contributed to the study but did not meet the authorship
criteria and are not included in the funding statement.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript within 7 days (i.e. by the 20-Jul-2017). If you do not think
you will be able to meet this date please let me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.

When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.

s manuscript studied the some physical properties of the cellulose/TBAH aqueous solution at
erent cellulose concentrations as well as in two TBAH concentrations. The method used in this
nuscript is quiet interesting and gave some different approach to look into the basic aspects of
ulose dissolving in aqueous TBAH solution. However, in addition to give the complex modeling
he cellulose/TBAH, a more clear and detailed discussion should be addressed regarding how the
ff) parameter represented the repulsive and attractive interactions, and how it related to the
olution of cellulose? Also, did the repulsive and attractive interactions referring to the
raction between dissolved cellulose molecules?
swer:
authors thank the Reviewer for pointing out that no accurate enough discussion about the
cture factor was addressed. The following sentence has been added to the text at page 10:
the thermodynamic limit at q = 0, the structure factor is proportional to the osmotic
pressibility and is a measure of the effective interchain interactions.”
reover, for clarity, the following sentence at page 11 has been rephrased:
om the modelling of the Seff(0) trend as a function of concentration using the RGT, we estimated
of ca. 0.17 and B2 of 1.2 × 10-3 cm3/g2, with B2 > 0 being an indication of repulsive cellulose-
ulose interactions in solution.”
