This is a very intriguing, most engaging, wide ranging and thoroughly enjoyable manuscript.
My main concern is that journalists, and others, will see the illustrations of the ant towers and the
human pyramid towers and imagine that they are the same. They are not. The ant towers are
built around a central scaffolding rod. This should be made very clear in the captions to certain of
the illustrations.
The manuscript is very clear re the point above – but it will be vital to do everything to avoid
misconceptions by lazy readers (aka those that won’t read the text but simply look at the
beautiful illustrations).
The authors need to be aware how horrible the maths layout is in section 3.3, and the phrase "By
calculus" does not inspire. One is also not keen on the maths in section 3.
They have aXn+1 = SUM(Xi) = something else = something else = Xn(a+1) (2)
Then
Xn+1 = (SUM(Xi))/a (3)
...which is just the first equality of equation (2), ignoring the other three.
But if we look at the beginning and end of (2), it's:
aXn+1 = Xn(1+a)
or in other words, each term is a factor (1+1/a) bigger than the last, or a simple geometric
sequence, giving
Xn = b(1+1/a)^n-1
If there is a problem with this, they should explain it before eqn (4), which has n-1 replaced by 0
or n-a. This change applies to the top layers, though their explanation only mentions the range
where the slope approaches the horizontal, which I think must be near the bottom.

Line 12 put “30 ants high”
Line 15 – good to see clear mention of central support here.
[Actually the use of such a central support violates self-organization in the sense that a kind of
organizing template is utilized – this is fine – evolution is probably oblivious to the strict rules of
self-organization – but this might be a point worth making. Furthermore the use of such a central
pole reminds me of the argument for the stability of pagodas to earthquakes – each floor can slide
from side to side dissipating the energy of the quake. There is a very accessible though informal
account of the ability of pagodas to with stand earthquakes in “The Economist” (go to
http://www.economist.com/node/456070 or simply search on the terms “pagodas and
earthquakes). It would be wonderful if these ants have been selected to build preferentially
around vertical twigs or branches on unstable ground – a shinbashira of sorts - for similar
reasons. Nigel R. Franks]

label_comment_2
This paper intends to analyze the self-assembling processes involved in the formation of
temporary shelters in the fire ants Solenopsis invicta. The authors combine nice X-ray video
techniques to analyze the movements of ants within these self-assembled structures and show
that they is constantly remodeled. Then the authors build a model based on adhesion and
attachment strength at the individual scale to analyze the growth rate of these self-assembled
structures.
These are interesting results but the main problem I find is that I do not find any connection
between the main finding of the paper which is about the dynamical remodeling of the self-
assembled structure and the model which only describes one single mechanism, the attachment
of ants to the preexisting structure and not the disconnection and the slowly downward
movement of ants within the structure. I agree that the model correctly fitted can reproduce the
rate of growth of the self-assembled structure but it does not bring further insight about the
4
remodeling process that might play also a key role in the reshaping of the structure as a function
of environmental conditions.
I think the connection between the description of remodeling process and the results of the model
should be thoroughly discussed. Moreover I found the discussion about human towers a bit out
of context precisely because of the remodeling process.

This study, conducted by an eclectic team of industrial an systems engineers, mechanical
engineers and physics experts, was a delight to read. I am always amazed at the work on the
mechanics and physics of fire ant structures coming out of Georgia Tech. I applaud this multi-
faceted study of "tower" building. I offer only a few minor edits and a couple of comments and
some thoughts about interpreting your findings as follows:
1. lines 295-6: for clarity, reword "three times too fast" as you are referring to growth rate with a
time element.
2. line 301: 2 ant body weights (plural)
3. line 415: the bottleneck "limiting the" tower growth rate
4. line 362-3: I liked the term "yield stress." You might mention this term again in the conclusion
to remind the reader of the cause of the sinking and rebuilding of the tower.
I am not sure that comparing raft building and tower building isn't apples to oranges. Rafts are
supported by the buoyancy of large workers and their air-filled sexualized brood, which function
as floats. Holding onto others with their muscular jaws in addition to their six clawed feet is
common. In this study, with the fluon-coated rods, the ants were likely not able to anchor
themselves with the muscular jaws or their feet tendons as they do during rafting? So pulling
ants out of a raft or apart at the feet might be different than the yield stresses of a vertical climber.
In 2015, I published a paper in J Bioeconomics on rafting. Of interest is the finding that small fire
ants drown readily as solitary swimmers or as rafters with other small ants. They were unable to
break the surface tension of the water. In contrast, large workers and the queen floated like ping-
pong balls. During raft formation, larger workers acted as the spokes of a bike tire, migrating
from the core of the raft to the edge. Smaller workers filled in the gaps between the spokes by
immediately going into a "spread eagle" posture when their feet touched water. This spread eagle
posture maximized the probability of touching and hooking onto other ants. Perhaps these
authors could complete a follow-up study on the role of larger workers within in the tower. Were
larger workers stabilizing or not?
9
Additionally, I'd like to see a study in which a twig that can be grasped more readily replaces the
slippery rods. Is twig height a limiting factor, as it appears to be in the field photo, rather than
yield stresses? Does the tower take on a cone shape or a sky-scraper shape rather than a bell-
shape? Does a twig provide backbone for a more stable shelter than that observed in this study?
In nature, a shelter that is this unstable would not protect the queen, which is the proximate and
ultimate goal of her disposable daughters. I think a sentence or two that the instability of the
tower might be an emergent property of the lab experiment rather than yield stresses of the
workers. A twig experiment might answer this.
Also, I would like to see a sentence or two about differences in the carrying a weight versus
hanging stresses on ant legs. Ant legs are designed to carry weights with leg muscles when they
are walking horizontally; in contrast, I think ants use foot tendons when hanging vertically.
Imagine holding up your weight standing on two legs. Now imagine hanging your body with
your fingers hooked over a pole. I can not hold up my weight; but I can hold my weight for
several minutes while hanging by my fingers.
These comments can be easily addressed with a couple of caveats. Or, if irrelevant, totally
ignored.

ar Editor,
ase find first revision of our manuscript, “Fire ants perpetually rebuild sinking towers,” to be
sidered for publication in Royal Society Open Science. We thank the Editor for soliciting
se reviews, whose comments have helped us to increase the clarity of our manuscript.
iewer 1 was positive about the manuscript, but suggested clarification of a few of our math
tions. The reviewer also mention possibility of confusion between the ant towers and human
amids so we decided to take out those sections.
iewer 2 suggests that we clarify our modeling and explanation of the models. The reviewer
suggested taking out the section about human pyramids. We have made additional
rections to the modeling section for better clarity per suggestion.
look forward to continuing this review process.

anks, we are glad that you enjoyed it.
main concern is that journalists, and others, will see the illustrations of the ant towers
the human pyramid towers and imagine that they are the same. They are not. The ant
ers are built around a central scaffolding rod. This should be made very clear in the
tions to certain of the illustrations.
manuscript is very clear re the point above – but it will be vital to do everything to
id misconceptions by lazy readers (aka those that won’t read the text but simply look at
beautiful illustrations).
e decided to remove the material about human towers, since multiple reviewers
stioned its fit with the rest of the paper.
e authors need to be aware how horrible the maths layout is in section 3.3
ank you for pointing this up. We may not have made it pretty, but we have made it less
y.
d the phrase "By calculus" does not inspire. One is also not keen on the maths in section
y have aXn+1 = SUM(Xi) = something else = something else = Xn(a+1) (2)
n
Xn+1 = (SUM(Xi))/a (3)
hich is just the first equality of equation (2), ignoring the other three.
if we look at the beginning and end of (2), it's:
aXn+1 = Xn(1+a)
n other words, each term is a factor (1+1/a) bigger than the last, or a simple geometric
uence, giving
Xn = b(1+1/a)^n-1
here is a problem with this, they should explain it before eqn (4), which has n-1 replaced
0 or n-a. This change applies to the top layers, though their explanation only mentions
range where the slope approaches the horizontal, which I think must be near the
tom.
e removed equation (3), which clearly was not clear. It had ceiling brackets around the
t-hand-side to indicate to round up to the nearest integer. Since the formula is used as
approximation, the rounding was not important.
also explained why equation (4) -- equation (3) in the new version – is different for
all values of n. It is because if the ants in the second layer were at full load, there would
fewer there than in the top layer. We observe instead that the 2nd and 3rd layers are the
e size as the 1st .

e 15 – good to see clear mention of central support here.
tually the use of such a central support violates self-organization in the sense that a kind
rganizing template is utilized – this is fine – evolution is probably oblivious to the strict
s of self-organization – but this might be a point worth making. Furthermore the use of
h a central pole reminds me of the argument for the stability of pagodas to earthquakes

essible though informal account of the ability of pagodas to with stand earthquakes in

ms “pagodas and earthquakes). It would be wonderful if these ants have been selected
build preferentially around vertical twigs or branches on unstable ground – a shinbashira
orts - for similar reasons.]
e read several papers about the pagodas. They are very cool! It turns out that, unlike
ant support, the shinbashira does not have to touch the ground. It can damp motion
virtue of having a lot of mass, like a heavy pendulum, and by preventing levels from
ing sideways too much. We think that the similarity to the ant tower is not close enough
ustify discussion. We are curious to see how well the ant tower holds up under a shock
vibration.

mments to the Author(s)
s paper intends to analyze the self-assembling processes involved in the formation of
porary shelters in the fire ants Solenopsis invicta. The authors combine nice X-ray video
hniques to analyze the movements of ants within these self-assembled structures and
w that they is constantly remodeled. Then the authors build a model based on adhesion
attachment strength at the individual scale to analyze the growth rate of these self-
embled structures.
se are interesting results but the main problem I find is that I do not find any connection
ween the main finding of the paper which is about the dynamical remodeling of the self-
embled structure and the model which only describes one single mechanism, the
achment of ants to the preexisting structure and not the disconnection and the slowly
nward movement of ants within the structure. I agree that the model correctly fitted can
roduce the rate of growth of the self-assembled structure but it does not bring further
ght about the remodeling process that might play also a key role in the reshaping of the
ucture as a function of environmental conditions.
e connection is the perpetual growth at the tower top, which continues unchanged after
s begin to depart from the tower base and after the tower reaches its maximum height.
tower is not remodeled into a different shape.
ink the connection between the description of remodeling process and the results of the
del should be thoroughly discussed.
e have clarified this connection at the end of section 4, and in the first paragraph of
tion 5.
reover I found the discussion about human towers a bit out of context precisely because
he remodeling process.
e agree that the human tower building process differs enough from the ant tower process
t it is better to have removed the discussion about the former.

1. On line 30, the word which accidentally appears twice in a row
*Done
2. On line 65, strike the word “to” after “build”
*Done
3. O*n line 76, strike the work “it” after the word “lowered”
*Done
4. On line 165, insert “of” after the word “discretization”
*Done
5. In the expression S ˜ pD/w on line 172, what is w? This seems to be an undefined
variable or parameter.
*Corrected – it is the width of an ant.
6. After line 192 it could be helpful to the reader to clarify that the Taylor expansion is in
the variable r.
*Done
7. When I compute the derivative df(n) dn based on the approximation after line 192, I
obtain df(n) dn ˜ log(<U+03B6>)<U+03B6> n 2 1 2 v p - r 2v p 4<U+03B6> n . I do not believe that this is
equivalent to what is obtained in the manuscript. I think that there is either a typo in
your expression or there needs to be greater explanation of how your current
expression is obtained.
*Thank you! Indeed, we had two typos.
8. On line 200, strike word “be” appearing before “bell-shaped”
*Done
Other changes: we corrected “is is” and a few other typos.

is study, conducted by an eclectic team of industrial an systems engineers,
chanical engineers and physics experts, was a delight to read. I am always
azed at the work on the mechanics and physics of fire ant structures
ming out of Georgia Tech. I applaud this multifaceted study of "tower"
ilding. I offer only a few minor edits and a couple of comments and some
ughts about interpreting your findings as follows:
lines 295-6: for clarity, reword "three times too fast" as you are referring to
wth rate with a time element. (Done)
line 301: 2 ant body weights (plural). (Done)
line 415: the bottleneck "limiting the" tower growth rate. (Done)
line 362-3: I liked the term "yield stress." You might mention this term again
he conclusion to remind the reader of the cause of the sinking and
uilding of the tower. (Added, in Line 451)
m not sure that comparing raft building and tower building isn't apples to
nges. Rafts are supported by the buoyancy of large workers and their air-
ed sexualized brood, which function as floats. Holding onto others with their
scular jaws in addition to their six clawed feet is common. In this study,
h the fluon coated rods, the ants were likely not able to anchor themselves
h the muscular jaws or their feet tendons as they do during rafting? So
lling ants out of a raft or apart at the feet might be different than the yield
esses of a vertical climber.
e would put it differently: we observe that the same local movement
haviors generate both apples (rafts) and oranges (towers), depending on
environment. That ants in rafts but not in towers grip each other with their
ong jaws does not impinge on this observation. Indeed, if ants in towers
ld on to each other as strongly as they do in rafts, the mini-avalanches that
it the rate of tower growth would probably not occur. And if the ants
chored themselves so strongly to the rods, they would not need to complete
ing to achieve stability.
2015, I published a paper in J Bioeconomics on rafting. Of interest is the
ding that small fire ants drown readily as solitary swimmers or as rafters
h other small ants. They were unable to break the surface tension of the
ter. In contrast, large workers and the queen floated like pingpong balls.
ring raft formation, larger workers acted as the spokes of a bike tire,
grating from the core of the raft to the edge. Smaller workers filled in the
ps between the spokes by immediately going into a "spread eagle" posture
en their feet touched water. This spread eagle posture maximized the
bability of touching and hooking onto other ants. Perhaps these authors
uld complete a followup study on the role of larger workers within in the
er. Were larger workers stabilizing or not?
r this experiment, we did not differentiate between the ant sizes but this
uld be a good follow-up study to do. We’ve added this to the paper in lines
2-395.
ditionally, I'd like to see a study in which a twig that can be grasped more
dily replaces the slippery rods. Is twig height a limiting factor, as it appears
be in the field photo, rather than yield stresses? Does the tower take on a
ne shape or a skyscraper shape rather than a bellshape? Does a twig
vide backbone for a more stable shelter than that observed in this study?
nature, a shelter that is this unstable would not protect the queen, which is
proximate and ultimate goal of her disposable daughters. I think a
ntence or two that the instability of the tower might be an emergent property
the lab experiment rather than yield stresses of the workers. A twig
periment might answer this.
e guess that the towers might be less bell-shaped due the ants being able
hold on to the main support if a twig was used instead of having to rely on
er ants for support. We tried it using a twig (line 77) but could not get a
er to form. Maybe an experiment that is designed differently could answer
s question.
o, I would like to see a sentence or two about differences in the carrying a
ight versus hanging stresses on ant legs. Ant legs are designed to carry
ights with leg muscles when they are walking horizontally; in contrast, I
nk ants use foot tendons when hanging vertically. Imagine holding up your
ight standing on two legs. Now imagine hanging your body with your
gers hooked over a pole. I can not hold up my weight; but I can hold my
ight for several minutes while hanging by my fingers.
e critical comparison we make is between the adhesive strength of a single
t to the pole and the adhesive strength of a complete ring of ants. The
er is a function of the leg-to-leg strength, and it is more than an order of
gnitude greater than the former. In line 257, we showed that our ants are
ong in both compression, holding a weight of ~80 ant weights before they
unable to move, and in tension, having a leg-leg strength to hold ~190 ant
ights (reference number 25). This comparison is the basis for our
planation of the tower growth rate and its decrease as the rod radius
reases.
s suggestive that the ants don’t seem to be using their best muscles and
ppers in their towers, unlike the rafts. We feel that this may support our
eculation that the tower may be an epi-phenomenon, from an evolutionary
int of view. However, we decided not to include this speculation about a
eculation in the paper.
ese comments can be easily addressed with a couple of caveats. Or, if
levant, totally ignored.
