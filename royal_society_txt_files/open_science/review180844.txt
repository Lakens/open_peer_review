The large-scale landslides distributed at the Northeast Margin of Baryan Har Block were studied
in this paper, based on field investigation and remote sensing interpretation. There are 129 large-
giant landslides distributed in the study area, and the correlation between the landslides and the
influencing factors were also analyzed, such as the topography, stratum lithology and terrain
slope, et al. It is interested to study the landslides on the east margin of the Tibetan Plateau,
especially about the ancient giant landslides triggered by earthquakes. However, there are some
insufficient in this paper, such as the following:
1. The active faults distribution characteristics and activity since late Pleistocene, and it is far-
3
fetched that the Wudu earthquake mentioned in this paper and was taken as an important
influence factor to the ancient landslides distributed in the study area, for it is too far between
Wudu Earthquake and the 129 landslides.
2. The authors should retell, describe or cite other’s work to distribute the landslides, especially
the large-scale or giant landslides triggered by Jiuzhaigou earthquake, occurred in 2017.
3. This paper took the Taojiawan landslide as a typical ancient landslide, and described the
developmental distribution characteristics and formation mechanism. However, it is impossible
to make correlation between it and the earthquake, that is, the authors haven’t provide any proof
to certificate that the Taojiawan landslide was triggered by ancient earthquake, or when was the
Taojiawan landslide occurred.
4. In fact, the earthquake is one of the most important factors for the large or giant landslides
developed in the eastern part of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but, tit cannot be ignored that the glacier

landslide mentioned at line 81 was not triggered by earthquake.
5. The paper should be compared with the findings or conclusions with other researcher’s work

R# Thank you for this comment. Actually, two reviewers both raise this

service, AJE (American Journal Experts), to polish the manuscript
systematically.
Reviewer#2
General comment
The large-scale landslides distributed at the Northeast Margin of Baryan Har Block
were studied in this paper, based on field investigation and remote sensing
interpretation. There are 129 large-giant landslides distributed in the study area,
and the correlation between the landslides and the influencing factors were also
analyzed, such as the topography, stratum lithology and terrain slope, et al. It is
interested to study the landslides on the east margin of the Tibetan Plateau,
especially about the ancient giant landslides triggered by earthquakes.
Detailed comments
C#1 The active faults distribution characteristics and activity since late
Pleistocene, and it is far-fetched that the Wudu earthquake mentioned
in this paper and was taken as an important influence factor to the
ancient landslides distributed in the study area, for it is too far between
Wudu Earthquake and the 129 landslides.
R#1 Thank you for this comment. The comments of the reviewer are
reasonable, and we consider these comments in our revised manuscript.
We also agree that it is impossible for the Wudu earthquake to trigger
129 landslides in the study region. Our descriptions, especially in the
Discussion section, on this topic may be confusing. Actually, the main
aim of mentioning the Wudu earthquake was to highlight that
earthquakes are an important trigger factor in the study region. Because
at least 4 large landslides were induced by the Wudu earthquake in the
study region, which is located in a high seismic intensity area, other
very large earthquakes may have occurred outside of the historical
recordings. Therefore, we highlight the Wudu earthquake.
In addition, regarding the other comments (comment #3 and
comment #4), the trigger factors may be difficult to determine because
these landslides are ancient landslides. However, earthquakes are an
important trigger factor and can be discussed in the context of the
regional setting and the consequence of the Wudu earthquake (see the
Discussion section).
Based on this comment, we revised our description of the Wudu
earthquake and the Discussion section.
First, because trigger factors are difficult to determine, we
introduced a simple discussion on this topic instead of a detailed
discussion by highlight Wudu earthquake. We shortened the description
of the Wudu earthquake and trigger factors in the Discussion section
and mentioned the other possible trigger factors such as glacial activity,
rainfall and climate change.
Second, to highlight our findings, we mention the findings from
our study region in the context of the findings of other studies
(comment #5).
C#2 The authors should retell, describe or cite other’s work to distribute the
landslides, especially the large-scale or giant landslides triggered by
Jiuzhaigou earthquake, occurred in 2017.
R#2 Thank you for this comment. Based on this comment, we added content
regarding previous work on regional landslides. The detailed
descriptions can be found in the Introduction section.
In terms of the landslides triggered by the Jiuzhaigou earthquake,
we have detailed data on this topic because we joined the emergency
investigations, and the results have been published in this Journal (Zhao
et al. 2018). Based on our investigations, no large or giant landslides
were triggered by the Jiuzhaigou earthquake; however, we also
introduce information on the geohazards triggered by the Jiuzhaigou
earthquake. The detailed information can be found in the section on the
regional setting.

Tong. (2018). Landslides and dam damage resulting from the
Jiuzhaigou earthquake (8 August 2017), Sichuan, China. Royal Society
Open Science 5: 171418
C#3 This paper took the Taojiawan landslide as a typical ancient landslide,
and described the developmental distribution characteristics and
formation mechanism. However, it is impossible to make correlation
between it and the earthquake, that is, the authors haven’t provided any
proof to certificate that the Taojiawan landslide was triggered by
ancient earthquake, or when was the Taojiawan landslide occurred.
R#3 Thank you for this comment. We agree with this comment; because the
Taojiawan landslide is an ancient landslide, it is indeed difficult to
confirm its trigger factor. Initially, due to the regional setting of the
study region, we considered that this landslide was likely triggered by
an earthquake. However, considering this comment we revised the
discussion on the trigger factor of the Taojiawan landslide.
The detailed core descriptions are “Finally, some trigger factors,
such as earthquakes and rainfall, triggered the landslide.”
The detailed descriptions can be found in section 3.4: Analysis of
a typical landslide.
C#4 In fact, the earthquake is one of the most important factors for the large
or giant landslides developed in the eastern part of Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, but, it cannot be ignored that the glacier activities, rainfall and
climate change can also induce some large and giant landslides, the
Xinmo landslide mentioned at line 81 was not triggered by earthquake.
R#4 Thank you for this comment, which is similar to comment #3.
Earthquakes are one of most important factors, but the trigger factors
are not always earthquakes. It is correct to suggest that there may be
other trigger factors such as rainfalls and etc.
Because most of the landslides in the study region are ancient
landslides, it is difficult to determine their trigger factors; therefore,
based on the regional setting, we consider their trigger factors to be
earthquakes. For Xinmo landslide, based on our studies, although the
rainfalls triggered the Xinmo landslide, the earthquakes (1933 Diexi
Ms 7.0 earthquake, 1976 Songpan Ms 7.2 earthquake and 2008
Wenchuan Ms 8.0 earthquake) are an important contributor to the
landslide occurrence (Wang et al 2017).
As indicated by this comment, our descriptions regarding trigger
factors may not have been comprehensive enough; therefore, we
revised them.
First, we consider that “earthquakes may be an important trigger
factor or contributor to landslide occurrence”, then we explain why.
Then, we point out that rainfalls, glacial activity, and climate change
are also contributors and possible trigger factors.
All these can be found in “Discussion” Section

June 2017 landslide at Xinmo village, Songping river, Sichuan Province,
China. Landslides, 15(4), 1-13.
C#5 The paper should be compared with the findings or conclusions with
other researcher’s work published results at the east margin of Qinghai-
Tibet Plateau, which would lead to better conclusions and
understanding. This is also the main shortcoming of this paper.
R#5 Thank you for this comment, which is very useful and can be
implemented to highlight the characteristics of large landslides in this
study region. Based on this comment, we have added the comparisons
in the Discussion section.
We list 4 typical features in the study region and compare them
with those of the other regions at the eastern margin of the Qinghai-
Tibet Plateau; the detailed descriptions can be found in the
“Discussion” section.
C#6 The English expression of this manuscript is really poor, with many
wrong vocabularies, such as the Tibet Plateau should be Tibetan
Plateau; and the “As times go” at line 238;
R#6 Thank you for this comment. Two reviewers raised this issue, and we
used an English editing service, AJE (American Journal Experts), to
