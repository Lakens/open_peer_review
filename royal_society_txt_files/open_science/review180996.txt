The authors talk about the ‘stability of the coordination pattern’. However, the analysis pertains
to individual joints in isolation. How, exactly, does this approach relate to the coordination of the
joint movements? In contrast, Kelso studied the movement of two fingers using relative phase, a
metric that couples the movement of two effectors, and therefore, addresses coordination.
Signal-dependent noise (Harris and Wolpert) could also be invoked to explain the higher
variability in the joint movements during stair climbing. The authors may want to elaborate on
this point.
“…between PSF and movement dynamics during stairmill climbing, a potential 1 link between
movement dynamics and energy expenditure is questionable.”
The authors may want to mention the possibility of a shallow energy landscape for stairmill
climbing.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
• It is a bit challenging for the naïve reader to follow the logic presented in the introduction so as
to appreciate the justification of the study. In part this is because the ideas are not well
developed.
o Are movement consistency and dynamics related? Are they separate concepts? I struggled
with this throughout the introduction.
o How does a quadratic relationship between speed and variability demonstrate stable
coordination? Moreover what is meant by “stable” or by “stable coordination pattern originating
from an optimized self-organization”? The language used here and throughout the discussion is
often very specific and technical to the point that its’ meaning is lost to anyone who is not an
expert in the field. When possible, simplifying language and sentence structure will improve
overall readability of the work.
o There is continuous discussion of a theoretical framework - e.g., “However it is unknown if the
same theoretical framework could be generalized…”. Is the framework to which you are
referencing the relationship between speed and variability? As written no theoretical framework
is presented, only an observation regarding a quadratic relationship, which importantly was not
cited. Moreover this quadratic relationship appears to relate to measures of consistency
(variability) and not dynamics. Does this theoretical also relate to dynamics? If so must
consistency AND dynamics both relate to speed/frequency of movement for this theoretical
framework to be upheld or is it sufficient that only one (consistency OR dynamics) relate?
o Similarly, the authors argue that even though in their previous work they saw no change in
stride interval characteristics with frequency that the framework may still apply to coordination
patterns? How exactly is it that the framework could exist for one of these measures and not the
other? The framework should be grounded in some theory that would justify which of these
measures would be appropriate to consider. In general, it comes across as if the authors are
searching for any variable (whether a measure of consistency or dynamics, whether related to
coordination or interstride dynamics) in stairclimbing that can support generalization of this
“framework”.
o The authors need to better justify the rationale for looking at both CoD and LyE.
• It is my understanding that for the LyE analysis, the state space chosen should in theory
capture the dynamics of the entire system. If so then why would the LyE differ for different
choices of state space (joint angles)? In general, why are multiple joints being considered in the
analysis particularly when there are no hypotheses relating to the effects of joints? Similarly, in
absence of hypotheses, there is no clear reason to present statistical findings for joint differences.
• In light of the many comparisons being made (3 joints, 5 frequencies, 3 measures) it is
challenging to follow the flow of the results section. Can the authors use headers and break up
results – e.g., Effects of stepping frequency on LyE , Effect of Joint on LyE. I can also see how this
may limit readability since there would be too many breaks byt I think there is a compromise to
be made .
• Is 50 steps a sufficient number for calculating LyE? In addition the authors did not seem to
account for intrinsic time scales differences for each subject (i.e. different walking speeds and
stepping frequencies). In order to compare conditions, isn’t it necessary to scale the time axes by
multiplying by the average cycle frequency for each subject. This seem non trivial given that step
frequency was nearly twice as much during walking than at PSF on the stairclimber (first
sentence in Results). Also was this difference significant?
• Page 9 under Statistical Analysis: “A linear regression was preformed..” It sounds as though
this was simply a correlation as there are only 2 variables (PWS and PSF)
4
• Second sentence of Discussion: “The present study challenged the notion that the framework
could be generalized to stairmill …” First , it was not clear that others argues or showed that the
framework could in fact be generalized such that it is challengeable. Regardless, I thought that
the hypotheses were consistent with the framework and attempting to demonstrate, rather than
challenge, generalizability.
• This is a theoretical question for the authors rather than something requiring direct addressing
in the manuscript, but would high stepped marching on a treadmill be more similar to stair
walking? Would leg dynamics in this task on the treadmill show the generalized behavior you
expect?
• In addition to ref [33] the authors may consider additional citations to support the effects of
narrow base of support walking on gait dynamics , ones in which the base of support was
directly manipulated and metrics of stability were measured for example:
Arvin, Mina, Jaap H. van Dieën, and Sjoerd M. Bruijn. "Effects of constrained trunk movement on
frontal plane gait kinematics." Journal of biomechanics 49.13 (2016): 3085-3089.
Rosenblatt, N. J., et al. "Challenging gait leads to stronger lower-limb kinematic synergies: The
effects of walking within a more narrow pathway." Neuroscience letters 600 (2015): 110-114
• What is the difference between a biological, biomechanical, environomental and task
constraints (pg 14 line 9). Doesn’t the task constraint of having to maintain a straighter narrower
step also constrain biomechanics?
• The authors compared standard deviations in joint angles between the tasks yet present no
evidence that the ranges of motion are similar. If they are different than coefficient of variation
would be more appropriate
• Page 16 line 16 reword. “While the aforementioned studies suggest…. At the self-selected
frequency”. The sentence is too long and confusing. I would actually recommend removing this
entire paragraph as any discussion of energy optimization is beyond the scope of the work and
purely speculative. In general, the discussion was long. Along these lines, the second paragraph
in the discussion should be broken or shortened.
• PWS was not first defined before the abbreviation was presented

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Manoj Srinivasan):
The reviewers have provided suggestions for improvement of the article, specifically requesting
clarification on a number of technical points. Please revise to address or rebut the reviewer
comments. I would also suggest further clarification of the sense in which the term 'stability' is
used. There are multiple notions of stability commonplace in these fields, but the mathematical
notion of stability is unique: it simply refers to a tendency for small deviations from periodic
motion remain small and not grow.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The authors have made some changes to address concerns. Although they have made a good
effort to answer the queries, most changes in the manuscript are cosmetic. The central issues
raised have not been addressed.
1. The authors equate ‘stable behavior state’ with ‘optimal movement solutions’ (‘The above data
can also provide support for dynamical systems theory which suggests that stable behavioral
states or optimal movement solutions arise from…’). First, simply replacing ‘stability of the
coordination pattern’ with ‘stable behavioral state’ is not particularly useful or illuminating.
Second, optimality of individual joints is conflated with stability of the entire behavior. I am not
convinced that looking at the dynamics and variability of individual joints as independent
entities allows for conclusions regarding ‘a stable behavioral state’ or ‘Synergistic organization of
the neuromuscular system’.
2. Motor commands become more variable as the strength of the command increases. This is a
rather general formulation of the signal-dependent-noise idea (Osu et al, 2003). The distinction
between discrete vs cyclic tasks is not relevant. Furthermore, the view that optimization
principles are incompatible with the dynamic system theory approach to movement is not
necessarily true (Schaal et al. 2007). The authors have chosen a rather narrow reading of one
paper.
3. These problems make the discussion section quite weak.
Please note that the references provided are not exhaustive. They simply illustrate a point.
Authors may want to dig deeper to compose a well informed opinion.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Manoj Srinivasan):
Associate Editor: 1
Comments to the Author:
The reviewer has suggested that the article may not be acceptable in its current form and that a
more substantial and in-depth revision may be required, specifically toning down the generality
of the conclusions.
We have some further comments and suggestions below on the article. The page numbers below
are from the article proper starting from the article's title page.
(1) page 6. lines 2-5: "The present study included analysis of data collected during the
experimental part of a previous study [16]. Thus, the included subjects and parts of the protocol
are identical between the two studies. However, the present study has an extended experimental
protocol and includes analyses of unpublished data."
where [16] is: Raffalt, P. C., Vallabhajosula, S., Renz, J. J., Mukherjee, M., Stergiou, N. 2017
Dynamics of Stride Interval Characteristics during Continuous Stairmill Climbing. Frontiers in
Physiology. 8, (10.3389/fphys.2017.00609).
The authors should more clearly state in the methods section what the difference in the protocol
was and what the difference in the analysis was, rather than later in the paper.
(2) The current title of the paper is: "Joint angle dynamics during oscillatory lower limb gaits is
task-dependent".
The authors make this claim based on differences in variability and other quantities computed
(LyE, CoD). It seems to me that tens of other papers have computed such quantities under many
different walking and running conditions and usually these quantities have been found to be
different in different situations. So, I feel that the authors cannot lay claim to this result and this
general-sounding title, given that many other papers have already obtained results implicitly
establishing this result. In fact, the authors' previous article [16] also implicitly has the result
subsumed by this title.
(3) A more acceptable title for the article could be something more specific, like:
"Joint variability, trajectory divergence, and dimensionality are different in stair-mill climbing
and treadmill walking."
The central result that may still remain (if not covered in [16]) is that PSF for stairmill climbing
does not minimize joint angle or other variability.
(4) The authors make the hypothesis that "the joint angle dynamics will be task-independent".
Why? Given all the studies that have come before? Case in point: In page-4, lines 7-13, the authors
say that their own earlier paper [16] doing similar analysis on stride times and stride lengths
found that stair mill climbing was different in most metrics they considered.
Specifically, in [16] the authors showed that the variability in stride lengths are different between
walking and stairmill climbing.
The joint angle excursions are quite related to the stride or step lengths. Bigger the step lengths,
13
bigger the joint angle excursions (at least some of them). So I would expect, logically, that
variability results for step lengths would extend, qualitatively, to joint angles.
(5) page 4. line 10-11. "While these observations do not support the existence of a stable
behavioral state at PSF for continuous stairmill climbing, they were limited to stride-to-stride
characteristics and stepping frequencies above PSF."
It seems to me again that the authors are using the term 'stable' incorrectly -- at least inconsistent
with its typical mathematical definition from Dynamical Systems theory.
Very roughly, an 'unstable' behavior (equilibrium or periodic motion) generally means that small
deviations from the nominal behavior would take the movement further away from the nominal
motion. [there is an epsilon-delta definition but let's ignore that for now. but see here:
http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Stability ]
Thus, it seems to me that PSF (preferred step frequency) cannot be unstable by its very definition.
Because, it is "preferred" over neighboring stride frequencies (presumably). So given a choice
between a range of stride frequencies, the subjects would converge to, or prefer, the PSF. Thus the
PSF must be stable, by definition. If not, in what sense is it "preferred"?
In other words, if you plot a hypothetical "preference rating" (as expressed by subjects) as a
function of step frequency, presumably, this preference rating will have a maximum at PSF, and
be lower at neighboring frequencies. The authors not finding such a maximum or minimum in
the quantities they considered just means that the quantities they considered are not good
predictors of "preference".
(6) How was preferred step frequency and preferred walking speed computed?
(7) page 4. line 12-13. "joint angle dynamics and joint angle consistency".
I feel the words 'dynamics' and 'consistency' may be overly broad and not precise enough to
describe what the authors are specifically doing.
The authors say clearly and early on that consistency is quantified by standard deviations. So
why not just use the precise and well-known terms 'standard deviation' or 'variance' throughout
the paper instead of using the vague non-technical term 'consistency'?
(8) In a response to an earlier review, that authors responded that LyE has previously been
computed with much lower than 50 strides (but it is unclear if that previous study did any error
analysis to show that their computations had low enough error variance). I wonder similarly if
fractal dimension CoD can be reasonably inferred from *just* 50 strides, especially in a high
dimensional dynamical system as this. Have the authors done any validation of their methods for
computing CoD by explicitly computing error estimates?

relationship between stride frequency during treadmill walking at PWS and stairmill climbing at
PSF."
(10) page 9. line 18-19. "Level of significance was set at 0.05 and statistical power at p=0.05 was
calculated."
Were the p-value corrected for multiple comparisons, either via a Bonferroni correction or other
less conservative corrections for multiple comparison? Note that any such correction needs to
14
take in to account the various p-values and comparisons considered in the previously published
study as well [16].
(11) Very minor. page 9. 7-9. "P-value and the overall percentage of variance accounted ..." The
sentence should probably begin with "The p-value ..." rather than "P-value ...". The "p" in p-value
is usually lower-case.
(12) page 10. lines 18-20. "There was a significant interaction effect (F(2,16) = 5.1, p = 0.019, power
= 64%) indicating that differences in LyE between tasks depended on the joint in question."
If the different body segments are dynamically coupled, according to the dynamical systems
theory, it seems to me that the largest Lyapunov exponent should not depend on the variable
used, but should be an invariant of the system. I know people compute these quantities in the gait
literature, but I'm not sure if they conform to the properties suggested by mathematicians
studying nonlinear dynamics.
(13) page 13: "According to a Dynamical Systems Theory approach, the existence of quadratic
relationships between stepping frequency and walking speed on one hand and the gait variability
on the other hand, suggests that the optimal movement solution during walking at 100% PSF and
PWS constitutes a stable behavioral state."
See comment (5).
(14) "According to Dynamical Systems Theory, stable behavioral states emerge from the
synergistic organization of the neuromuscular system based on the inherent interaction among
environmental, biomechanical, biological and task-related constraints [14, 15, 32, 33]."
This seems a somewhat vague statement. Are not all behaviors of a system arise from the
interactions between various dynamically coupled components of the system and the relevant
constraints?
(15) page 16, line 11. "A linear relationship between the PSF during walking and the PSF during
running in healthy individuals has been suggested to indicate that the two gait modalities share a
common neural drive from the CPG [45]."

frequencies during walking and running are not correlated with freely chosen pedalling
frequency and are insensitive to strength training. Gait & posture. 42, 60-64.
(10.1016/j.gaitpost.2015.04.003).
I would suggest that Sardroodian et al's remarks are only speculation. They have provided no
direct evidence for their suggestion of common neural drive. The correlation between walking
and running stride frequencies could be due to any number of other reasons: for instance, just the
fact that they are both locomotion tasks and require similar overall mechanics albeit at different
speeds. Just because walking and running frequencies tend to be correlated is no reason to
conclude that they are produced by the same CPG circuit. One can buy a $5 signal generator that
can produce frequencies from 1 Hz to 1 MHz. So it is unclear why a complex neural system such
as a human's, with perhaps hundreds or thousands or millions of neurons (and such obviously
amazing movement capabilities), should be so restricted in its behavioral repertoire and
frequency-producing capabilities (unless someone shows that it indeed is).
(16) Minor: page 14. lines 12-14. "In contrast to these observations, joint angle movements were
less consistent during stairmill climbing suggesting that a higher number of different movement
solutions were used to solve the task of stairmill climbing."

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have made some changes to address concerns. Although they have made a good
effort to answer the queries, most changes in the manuscript are cosmetic. The central issues
raised have not been addressed.
1. The authors equate ‘stable behavior state’ with ‘optimal movement solutions’ (‘The above data
can also provide support for dynamical systems theory which suggests that stable behavioral
states or optimal movement solutions arise from…’). First, simply replacing ‘stability of the
coordination pattern’ with ‘stable behavioral state’ is not particularly useful or illuminating.
Second, optimality of individual joints is conflated with stability of the entire behavior. I am not
convinced that looking at the dynamics and variability of individual joints as independent
entities allows for conclusions regarding ‘a stable behavioral state’ or ‘Synergistic organization of
the neuromuscular system’.
2. Motor commands become more variable as the strength of the command increases. This is a
rather general formulation of the signal-dependent-noise idea (Osu et al, 2003). The distinction
between discrete vs cyclic tasks is not relevant. Furthermore, the view that optimization
principles are incompatible with the dynamic system theory approach to movement is not
necessarily true (Schaal et al. 2007). The authors have chosen a rather narrow reading of one
paper.
3. These problems make the discussion section quite weak.
Please note that the references provided are not exhaustive. They simply illustrate a point.
Authors may want to dig deeper to compose a well informed opinion.

We thank the reviewers for their careful and thorough review of our manuscript.
We have addressed all raised points and made adjustments in the manuscript
accordingly. We believe that the manuscript has improved significantly from this
revision.
Associate Editor's comments (Dr Manoj Srinivasan):
The reviewers have provided suggestions for improvement of the article, specifically
requesting clarification on a number of technical points. Please revise to address or
rebut the reviewer comments. I would also suggest further clarification of the sense
in which the term 'stability' is used. There are multiple notions of stability
commonplace in these fields, but the mathematical notion of stability is unique: it
simply refers to a tendency for small deviations from periodic motion remain small
and not grow.
We thank the editor for raising this point. We have carefully revised the manuscript
and removed references to stability of the coordination pattern.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors talk about the ‘stability of the coordination pattern’. However, the
analysis pertains to individual joints in isolation. How, exactly, does this approach
relate to the coordination of the joint movements? In contrast, Kelso studied the
movement of two fingers using relative phase, a metric that couples the movement
of two effectors, and therefore, addresses coordination.
The present study does not attempt to quantify the stability of the coordination
pattern by a single variable. Instead we assessed the degree of stability by
quantifying three different characteristics of the movements (consistency, rate of
trajectory divergence and dimensionality). Previous studies on normal walking have
observed that these measures exhibits a local minimum at both PWS and PSF which
suggests that the movement solution at this speed and stepping frequency
constitutes a more stable coordination pattern compared to speeds and stepping
frequencies above and below. We observed that no such local minimum was
present in these movement characteristics during continuous stairmill climbing
which suggests that the stability of the coordination did not change as a function of
stepping frequency for this task.
Signal-dependent noise (Harris and Wolpert) could also be invoked to explain the
higher variability in the joint movements during stair climbing. The authors may
want to elaborate on this point.
We thank the reviewer for bringing this topic to our attention. The minimum-
variance theory proposed by Harris and Wolpert provides an interesting principal for
understanding the central nervous system’s control of movements. However, after
carefully reading the original paper we believe that their principal seems limited to
goal-directed movements of eyes and arms. To the best of knowledge this principal
has not been proven applicable to oscillatory movements such that of the lower
limbs during walking. Furthermore, we find the theory somewhat limited in that
only variance originated from the nervous system is included. In contrast, Dynamical
System Theory embraces that variability can originating from interaction of various
elements throughout the movement system (e.g. nervous system, muscles, tendons,
joints, ligaments). Thus, we do not believe that the proposed theory offers a better
alternative to explain our observations than Dynamical System Theory.
“…between PSF and movement dynamics during stairmill climbing, a potential 1 link
between movement dynamics and energy expenditure is questionable.”
The authors may want to mention the possibility of a shallow energy landscape for
stairmill climbing.
This paragraph was primarily speculative and we have removed this paragraph.
Figure numbering is incorrect, and one figure seems to be missing from the
manuscript. Captions for Figures 3 and 4 are identical.
We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. We apologize for this
confusion. We have now corrected the legends and added the missing figure.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
• It is a bit challenging for the naïve reader to follow the logic presented in the
introduction so as to appreciate the justification of the study. In part this is because
the ideas are not well developed.
We have revised parts of the introduction to strengthen the logic behind the study.
o Are movement consistency and dynamics related? Are they separate
concepts? I struggled with this throughout the introduction.
Movement consistency and dynamics are two separate concepts. Movement
consistency is measured by the amount of variation. In the present study, it is
calculated across multiple strides and averaged across the time normalized stride
phase. Dynamics refers to the time dependent structure of the signal in question.
Thus, the use of LyE and CoD quantifies two different characteristics (rate of
trajectory divergence and dimensionality) of the joint angle structures. This has
been clarified in the introduction.
o How does a quadratic relationship between speed and variability demonstrate
stable coordination? Moreover what is meant by “stable” or by “stable
coordination pattern originating from an optimized self-organization”? The
language used here and throughout the discussion is often very specific and
technical to the point that its’ meaning is lost to anyone who is not an expert in the
field. When possible, simplifying language and sentence structure will improve
overall readability of the work.
We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We have modified the language in the
introduction and discussion to address this comment.
The present study does not attempt to quantify the stability of the coordination
pattern by a single variable. Instead we assessed the degree of stability by
quantifying three different characteristics of the movements (consistency, rate of
trajectory divergence and dimensionality). Previous studies on normal walking have
observed that these measures exhibits a local minimum at both PWS and PSF which
suggests that the movement solution at this speed and stepping frequency
constitutes a more stable coordination pattern compared to speeds and stepping
frequencies above and below. We observed that no such local minimum was
present in these movement characteristics during continuous stairmill climbing
which suggests that the stability of the coordination did not change as a function of
stepping frequency for this task. For clarification, we have also removed the term
‘stability’ from the title and purpose of the present manuscript and use it now solely
to interpreted the results.
o There is continuous discussion of a theoretical framework - e.g., “However it is
unknown if the same theoretical framework could be generalized…”. Is the
framework to which you are referencing the relationship between speed and
variability? As written no theoretical framework is presented, only an observation
regarding a quadratic relationship, which importantly was not cited. Moreover this
quadratic relationship appears to relate to measures of consistency (variability) and
not dynamics. Does this theoretical also relate to dynamics? If so must consistency
AND dynamics both relate to speed/frequency of movement for this theoretical
framework to be upheld or is it sufficient that only one (consistency OR dynamics)
relate?
We believe there are sufficient convincing observations of a quadratic relationship
between walking speed/frequency and movement consistency, movement
dynamics and stride interval dynamics in the literature to apply a dynamical system
theoretical approach to explain this phenomenon. Hence this theoretical framework
would suggest that the movement solution used during walking at PWS/PSF
constitutes a stable coordination pattern characterized by local minima in a number
of measures compared to speeds/frequencies above and below PSF/PWS. The
present study raises the question whether this is applicable to another task with
oscillatory leg movements. The previous observations would suggest that a
concomitant observation of minima in multiple characteristics (movement
consistency and dynamics) is required to confirm this generalization of the theory.
We have clarified this in the introduction.
o Similarly, the authors argue that even though in their previous work they saw no
change in stride interval characteristics with frequency that the framework may still
apply to coordination patterns? How exactly is it that the framework could exist for
one of these measures and not the other? The framework should be grounded in
some theory that would justify which of these measures would be appropriate to
consider. In general, it comes across as if the authors are searching for any variable
(whether a measure of consistency or dynamics, whether related to coordination or
interstride dynamics) in stairclimbing that can support generalization of this
“framework”.
Our previous work was not designed to address this topic. Thus, it was limited to
only include stepping frequencies at and above PSF and only analysis of the
dynamics of stride interval characteristics. The present study provides valuable
information regarding the formation of stable behavioral state during oscillating
movements. Thus, it does not seem that the formation of stable behavioral state
relies only on the presence of oscillatory segment movements or that it is sensitive
to changes in oscillatory rhythm (stepping frequency). We have clarified this in the
text.
o The authors need to better justify the rationale for looking at both CoD and LyE.
We have justified the use of both CoD and LyE in the introduction.
• It is my understanding that for the LyE analysis, the state space chosen should in
theory capture the dynamics of the entire system. If so then why would the LyE
differ for different choices of state space (joint angles)? In general, why are multiple
joints being considered in the analysis particularly when there are no hypotheses
relating to the effects of joints? Similarly, in absence of hypotheses, there is no clear
reason to present statistical findings for joint differences.
This is an excellent point by the reviewer. The state space will capture the dynamics
of the entire system if the time series utilized for its construction are generated
from a variable that does so. However, if we consider that different joints are
different systems, due to their anatomical structure, then we can utilize this
approach to evaluate different systems. This approach will allow us to eventually
better understand the synergistic way these joints function. Thus, by choosing to
calculate LyE and CoD for the hip, knee and ankle joint angles we can understand
better how they come together to cooperate in the function of the lower limb. The
statistical test of the inter-joint differences was conducted to establish if the inter-
joint relationship of consistency and dynamics changed as function of task or
stepping frequency.
• In light of the many comparisons being made (3 joints, 5 frequencies, 3
measures) it is challenging to follow the flow of the results section. Can the authors
use headers and break up results – e.g., Effects of stepping frequency on LyE , Effect
of Joint on LyE. I can also see how this may limit readability since there would be
too many breaks byt I think there is a compromise to be made.
This is a good point. We have added two subheadings in Results section and
rearranged the text to improve the clarity of the section.
• Is 50 steps a sufficient number for calculating LyE? In addition the authors did
not seem to account for intrinsic time scales differences for each subject (i.e.
different walking speeds and stepping frequencies). In order to compare conditions,
isn’t it necessary to scale the time axes by multiplying by the average cycle
frequency for each subject. This seem non trivial given that step frequency was
nearly twice as much during walking than at PSF on the stairclimber (first sentence
in Results). Also was this difference significant?
To the best of our knowledge no evidence based consensus exists of the required
number of strides needed for reliable calculations of LyE. However, previous studies
have included down to 30 strides (Buzzi et al. 2003, Clinical Biomechanics and
England and Granata 2007, Gait and Posture).
It is correct that we did not adjust the time series for the intrinsic time scale. While
this approach is typically used in studies applying the Rosenstein et al. algorithm
(e.g. England and Granata 2007, Gait and Posture; Dingwell and Marin 2006, Journal
of Biomechanics; Bruijn et al. 2009, Journal of Biomechanics), the present study
applied the Wolf et al. algorithm and used the same approach as Wurdeman et al.
2014, Chaos; Myers et al. 2011, Clinical Biomechanics; Raffalt et al. 2017, Scientific
Reports). In this latter algorithm, the reference trajectory is compared with the
entire time series (Cignetti et al. 2012, Annals of Biomedical Engineering).
We did not perform a statistical test for the difference in stepping frequency at PWS
and 100% PFS but the 95% confidence intervals presented in Table 2 do not overlap
so it is fair to assume that there was a significant difference.
• Page 9 under Statistical Analysis: “A linear regression was preformed..” It
sounds as though this was simply a correlation as there are only 2 variables (PWS
and PSF)
We performed a linear regression analysis with the stepping frequency during PWS
as the independent variable and the stepping frequency during stairmill at PSF as
the dependent variable. There was no significant linear relationship between the
two variables so the equation was not reported. Instead we reported the p-value
and r2.
• Second sentence of Discussion: “The present study challenged the notion that
the framework could be generalized to stairmill …” First, it was not clear that others
argues or showed that the framework could in fact be generalized such that it is
challengeable. Regardless, I thought that the hypotheses were consistent with the
framework and attempting to demonstrate, rather than challenge, generalizability.
We have highlighted the formulation of the proposed theoretical framework in the
introduction.
We have also changed the word ‘challenged’ to ‘tested’ for clarity. We believe that
no previous studies could fully reject the proposed generalization of the relationship
between walking speed/frequency and gait variability and movement dynamics.
Thus, initially we were encouraged to presume that the theory indeed could be
generalized to stairmill climbing (hence the supportive hypothesis). However, the
overall aim of the study was to test and not to demonstrate this generalization.
• This is a theoretical question for the authors rather than something requiring
direct addressing in the manuscript, but would high stepped marching on a treadmill
be more similar to stair walking? Would leg dynamics in this task on the treadmill
show the generalized behavior you expect?
This is an interesting question. High stepped marching and stairmill climbing might
have similar joint angle dynamics during the first part of the leg swinging phase
where the foot is lifted. However, during the late part of the swing phase during
stairmill climbing, the foot is ‘transported’ down by the steps of the stairmill in
contrast to the free movement of the foot during the high stepped marching. The
joint dynamics during high stepped marching might look more like that of normal
walking compared to the reported joint dynamics of the present study.
• In addition to ref [33] the authors may consider additional citations to support
the effects of narrow base of support walking on gait dynamics , ones in which the
base of support was directly manipulated and metrics of stability were
measured for example:

synergies: The effects of walking within a more narrow pathway." Neuroscience

We thank the reviewer for bringing these papers to our attention. We have added
them as references.
• What is the difference between a biological, biomechanical, environmental
and task constraints (pg 14 line 9). Doesn’t the task constraint of having to maintain
a straighter narrower step also constrain biomechanics?
While the biological and biomechanical constraints refer to the intrinsic physical and
psychological limitations of the system (human body), the environmental and task
constraints refer to the objective of either walking or climbing on the
treadmill/stairmill with the corresponding limitations imposed on the possible
movements performed. There is an inherent interaction between the different
constraints in the formation of the movements. We have clarified this in the text.
• The authors compared standard deviations in joint angles between the tasks yet
present no evidence that the ranges of motion are similar. If they are different than
coefficient of variation would be more appropriate.
The joint angle consistency was calculated by 1) time normalizing each stride to
100% 2) calculating the standard deviation for each time point across all 50 strides
and 3) averaging all standard deviations. Thus, this method quantifies (in absolute
terms) how similar the joint angle was across the 50 strides. We do not believe that
the method is influenced by the joint angle range of motion (defined as the
difference between the maximal and minimal joint angle). In contrast, the method is
sensitive to large changes in joint angles occurring in a short period of time (i.e. high
joint angle velocity). However, this potential bias is not solved by using the
coefficient of variation.
• Page 16 line 16 reword. “While the aforementioned studies suggest…. At the
self-selected frequency”. The sentence is too long and confusing. I would actually
recommend removing this entire paragraph as any discussion of energy
optimization is beyond the scope of the work and purely speculative. In general, the
discussion was long. Along these lines, the second paragraph in the discussion
should be broken or shortened.
We agree with the reviewer that the paragraph (on page 16) was too speculative
and it is now removed.
• PWS was not first defined before the abbreviation was presented
Preferred walking speed is now introduced in the introduction where it is
abbreviated to PWS. This abbreviation is then used throughout the manuscript.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Manoj Srinivasan):
Associate Editor: 1
Comments to the Author:
The reviewer has suggested that the article may not be acceptable in its
current form and that a more substantial and in-depth revision may be
required, specifically toning down the generality of the conclusions.
We have some further comments and suggestions below on the article. The
page numbers below are from the article proper starting from the article's title
page.
(1) page 6. lines 2-5: "The present study included analysis of data collected
during the experimental part of a previous study [16]. Thus, the included
subjects and parts of the protocol are identical between the two studies.
However, the present study has an extended experimental protocol and
includes analyses of unpublished data."
where [16] is: Raffalt, P. C., Vallabhajosula, S., Renz, J. J., Mukherjee, M.,
Stergiou, N. 2017 Dynamics of Stride Interval Characteristics during
Continuous Stairmill Climbing. Frontiers in Physiology. 8,
(10.3389/fphys.2017.00609).
The authors should more clearly state in the methods section what the
difference in the protocol was and what the difference in the analysis was,
rather than later in the paper.
Authors’ response:
This is a good point and we have elaborated on this in the initial part of the
method.
(2) The current title of the paper is: "Joint angle dynamics during oscillatory
lower limb gaits is task-dependent".
The authors make this claim based on differences in variability and other
quantities computed (LyE, CoD). It seems to me that tens of other papers have
computed such quantities under many different walking and running
conditions and usually these quantities have been found to be different in
different situations. So, I feel that the authors cannot lay claim to this result
and this general-sounding title, given that many other papers have already
obtained results implicitly establishing this result. In fact, the authors'
previous article [16] also implicitly has the result subsumed by this title.
(3) A more acceptable title for the article could be something more specific,
like:
"Joint variability, trajectory divergence, and dimensionality are different in
stair-mill climbing and treadmill walking."
The central result that may still remain (if not covered in [16]) is that PSF for
stairmill climbing does not minimize joint angle or other variability.
Authors’ response:
This is a good point. We have revised the title accordingly. It now reads:
‘Lower limb joint angle variability and dimensionality are different in
stairmill climbing and treadmill walking’.
(4) The authors make the hypothesis that "the joint angle dynamics will be
task-independent". Why? Given all the studies that have come before? Case in
point: In page-4, lines 7-13, the authors say that their own earlier paper [16]
doing similar analysis on stride times and stride lengths found that stair mill
climbing was different in most metrics they considered.
Specifically, in [16] the authors showed that the variability in stride lengths
are different between walking and stairmill climbing.
The joint angle excursions are quite related to the stride or step lengths.
Bigger the step lengths, bigger the joint angle excursions (at least some of
them). So I would expect, logically, that variability results for step lengths
would extend, qualitatively, to joint angles.
Authors’ response:
The deduction of the hypothesis in our present study is partly based on the
observations of our previous study [16] and partly on the convincing evidence
related to walking at different walking speeds and stepping frequencies. The
purpose of our previous study was to investigate the existence of statistical
persistence in stride characteristics during stairmill climbing at PSF and
stepping frequencies above. Additionally, the regularity of stride
characteristics was established using sample entropy. Stride length
fluctuations during stairmill climbing exhibited statistical anti-persistence
significantly different from that of treadmill walking and stride time was
significantly less regular during stairmill climbing. While we did not observe
any effect of increased stepping frequency, it did not include stepping
frequencies below PSF. Thus, we do not believe that the previous study
provides sufficient data to formulate a hypothesis contradicting the
substantial observations made on walking supporting a U-shape relationship
between speed or stepping frequency and measures of movement dynamics.
We do not support the notion that the variability in stride length necessarily is
related to the variability of the joint angle trajectory. Before calculating the
meanSD, the joint angle is time-normalized to the duration of the stride phase
which potentially removes some of the absolute variation in stride time and
stride length. Thus, meanSD quantifies the total amount of spatial variation in
the joint angle trajectory relative to the stride phase.
The above were made clearer in our revised manuscript.
(5) page 4. line 10-11. "While these observations do not support the existence
of a stable behavioral state at PSF for continuous stairmill climbing, they were
limited to stride-to-stride characteristics and stepping frequencies above PSF."
It seems to me again that the authors are using the term 'stable' incorrectly -- at
least inconsistent with its typical mathematical definition from Dynamical
Systems theory.
Very roughly, an 'unstable' behavior (equilibrium or periodic motion)
generally means that small deviations from the nominal behavior would take
the movement further away from the nominal motion. [there is an epsilon-
delta definition but let's ignore that for now. but see here:
https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-

Thus, it seems to me that PSF (preferred step frequency) cannot be unstable
by its very definition. Because, it is "preferred" over neighboring stride
frequencies (presumably). So given a choice between a range of stride
frequencies, the subjects would converge to, or prefer, the PSF. Thus the PSF
must be stable, by definition. If not, in what sense is it "preferred"?
In other words, if you plot a hypothetical "preference rating" (as expressed by
subjects) as a function of step frequency, presumably, this preference rating
will have a maximum at PSF, and be lower at neighboring frequencies. The
authors not finding such a maximum or minimum in the quantities they
considered just means that the quantities they considered are not good
predictors of "preference".
Authors’ response:
We thank the editor for raising this point. We have made several adjustments
throughout the manuscript to clarify our interpretation of the existing
literature and the presented results.
We agree with the editor that the mathematical definition of stability refers to
whether neighboring orbits of a dynamical system will remain nearby over
time or diverge. While this characteristic of a system could be quantified by
the Lyapunov exponent, we believe this measure alone is not enough to
describe the complex behavior of attractor states in human movements. In
several studies on human movement, we have applied multiple nonlinear tools
to describe various characteristics of the movement dynamics. The advantage
of this approach is that while the rate of trajectory divergence might change
due to a specific external stimulus (e.g. walking speed or visual input), the
dimensionality of the movement trajectory could remain constant (quantified
by correlation dimension) or vice versa. Thus, behavioral differences from
one attractor to another can be assessed in more detail.
By combining two nonlinear methods (LyE and CoD) to quantify the dynamics
of the joint angle trajectories in the present study, we aimed at providing a
more detailed description of the behavior (and thereby the interaction
between neuromuscular control and biomechanical and anatomical
constraints) of these parameters. Identifying local maximum or minimum in
these characteristics at PSF, equivalent to that observed during treadmill
walking, would suggested that the behavior exhibited an optimal pattern
related to PSF.
We do not support the notion that movement solutions at PSF cannot be
unstable. If this was the case, it would suggest 1) that all possible parameters
of the system would behave equally and 2) that the system is selectively
optimized based on what is experienced as the preferred stepping frequency
by the subjects. While the latter cannot be excluded, other criteria such as
optimization of energy expenditure or minimization of muscle force
production have been suggested as the determining factor for PSF. Thus, it
remains an unanswered question whether humans walk in a particular way
with the purpose of minimizing energy expenditure (or force production) or
the configuration of the system’s degrees of freedom inevitably lead to a
minimization of energy expenditure. However, this topic is beyond the scope
of the present study.
(6) How was preferred step frequency and preferred walking speed computed?
Authors’ response:
The stepping frequency of the stairmill was increased and decreased multiple
times above and below what the subjects reported to be comfortable. A similar
protocol was used for the preferred walking speed. This information is
available now in the methods.
(7) page 4. line 12-13. "joint angle dynamics and joint angle consistency".
I feel the words 'dynamics' and 'consistency' may be overly broad and not
precise enough to describe what the authors are specifically doing.
The authors say clearly and early on that consistency is quantified by standard
deviations. So why not just use the precise and well-known terms 'standard
deviation' or 'variance' throughout the paper instead of using the vague non-
technical term 'consistency'?
Authors’ response:
We agree with the editor that the term consistency can appear vague. We have
replaced it with variability as that has been used in other similar studies.
We believe the term dynamics is often used in the biomechanical literature
regarding the nonlinear behavior of human movements. We included two
different nonlinear analyses to quantify different characteristics of how the
joint angles evolve over time during the two conditions.
(8) In a response to an earlier review, that authors responded that LyE has
previously been computed with much lower than 50 strides (but it is unclear if
that previous study did any error analysis to show that their computations had
low enough error variance). I wonder similarly if fractal dimension CoD can
be reasonably inferred from *just* 50 strides, especially in a high dimensional
dynamical system as this. Have the authors done any validation of their
methods for computing CoD by explicitly computing error estimates?
Authors’ response:
We thank the editor for raising this important point. The influence of the total
number of included data points and the number of included strides on the
outcome of nonlinear methods is understudied in gait research. We have
performed additional analyses on the effect of the number of included steps
for the LyE and CoD outcomes during both treadmill walking and stairmill
climbing. We have included a range of steps from 10 to 50 during stairmill
climbing and from 10 to 150 for treadmill walking. We have included this
analysis in the supplementary material. In summary, the between-task and
between-joint differences in CoD and LyE do not change with data length,
although the absolute values of primarily the CoD change with increase in the
number of included strides. Thus, CoD for all three joints were higher during
stairmill climbing compared to treadmill across all investigated stride
numbers. Similarly, the LyE did not differ between tasks for the three joint
angles across stride numbers.
(9) page 9, line 6-7. "A linear regression analysis was performed to determine
the nature of the relationship between stride frequency during treadmill
walking at PWS and stairmill climbing at PSF."
(10) page 9. line 18-19. "Level of significance was set at 0.05 and statistical
power at p=0.05 was calculated."
Were the p-value corrected for multiple comparisons, either via a Bonferroni
correction or other less conservative corrections for multiple comparison?
Note that any such correction needs to take in to account the various p-values
and comparisons considered in the previously published study as well [16].
Authors’ response:
This is a valid point. We have now adjusted our level of significance to 0.0034
to account for the 15 one way ANOVA tests completed in our previous study.
We have revised the results and discussion accordingly.
(11) Very minor. page 9. 7-9. "P-value and the overall percentage of variance
accounted ..." The sentence should probably begin with "The p-value ..."
rather than "P-value ...". The "p" in p-value is usually lower-case.
Authors’ response:
This has been corrected as suggested.
(12) page 10. lines 18-20. "There was a significant interaction effect (F(2,16)
= 5.1, p = 0.019, power = 64%) indicating that differences in LyE between
tasks depended on the joint in question."
If the different body segments are dynamically coupled, according to the
dynamical systems theory, it seems to me that the largest Lyapunov exponent
should not depend on the variable used, but should be an invariant of the
system. I know people compute these quantities in the gait literature, but I'm
not sure if they conform to the properties suggested by mathematicians
studying nonlinear dynamics.
Authors’ response:
This is an interesting point. First of all, adjusting the p-values based on the
number of performed statistical comparisons has removed this significant
interaction. However, we find it relevant to briefly address this topic on a
more general level to justify the performed statistical comparisons. While
different body segments are dynamically coupled and their LyE most likely
will be correlated to some extent, the anatomical constraints of the individual,
segments and joints linking the segments will differ and affect the level of
correlation between the segments. Furthermore, it is likely that adjacent
segments will have more similar behavior due to shared motor control input
and anatomical structures linking the segments, compared to segments further
apart (with less in common). In our opinion, it is not straight forward to
quantify the level of dynamical coupling between different body segments and
is currently unknown with respect to the joint in question in the present study.
Thus, we believe it is of great interest to investigate the responses and
dynamic behaviors of different joint angles to the exposure of the different
tasks.
(13) page 13: "According to a Dynamical Systems Theory approach, the
existence of quadratic relationships between stepping frequency and walking
speed on one hand and the gait variability on the other hand, suggests that the
optimal movement solution during walking at 100% PSF and PWS constitutes
a stable behavioral state."
See comment (5).
Authors’ response:
See earlier response to comment 5.
(14) "According to Dynamical Systems Theory, stable behavioral states
emerge from the synergistic organization of the neuromuscular system based
on the inherent interaction among environmental, biomechanical, biological
and task-related constraints [14, 15, 32, 33]."
This seems a somewhat vague statement. Are not all behaviors of a system
arise from the interactions between various dynamically coupled components
of the system and the relevant constraints?
Authors’ response:
This is a good point. We have revised the sentence.
(15) page 16, line 11. "A linear relationship between the PSF during walking
and the PSF during running in healthy individuals has been suggested to
indicate that the two gait modalities share a common neural drive from the
CPG [45]."
[45] Sardroodian, M., Madeleine, P., Voigt, M., Hansen, E. A. 2015. Freely
chosen stride frequencies during walking and running are not correlated with
freely chosen pedalling frequency and are insensitive to strength training. Gait
& posture. 42, 60-64. (10.1016/j.gaitpost.2015.04.003).
I would suggest that Sardroodian et al's remarks are only speculation. They
have provided no direct evidence for their suggestion of common neural drive.
The correlation between walking and running stride frequencies could be due
to any number of other reasons: for instance, just the fact that they are both
locomotion tasks and require similar overall mechanics albeit at different
speeds. Just because walking and running frequencies tend to be correlated is
no reason to conclude that they are produced by the same CPG circuit. One
can buy a $5 signal generator that can produce frequencies from 1 Hz to 1
MHz. So it is unclear why a complex neural system such as a human's, with
perhaps hundreds or thousands or millions of neurons (and such obviously
amazing movement capabilities), should be so restricted in its behavioral
repertoire and frequency-producing capabilities (unless someone shows that it
indeed is).
Authors’ response:
We agree with the editor that the study by Sardroodian and colleagues [45]
does not provide direct evidence for a common neural drive for walking and
running and we have revised accordingly the above sentence. In general, we
are very skeptical towards the theory emphasizing the importance of a CPG
for the control of human locomotion but we acknowledge that this theory has
substantial support from studies on rodents and cats. Furthermore, although
speculative, the observations of the aforementioned study [45] could be
explained by the ‘common core hypothesis’, as done by the authors. Adopting
a similar premise when evaluating the results of the present study, would not
support the idea that walking and stairmill climbing share the same CPG
input. We have emphasized that our speculations are similar to those
proposed by Sardroodian and colleagues [45].
(16) Minor: page 14. lines 12-14. "In contrast to these observations, joint
angle movements were less consistent during stairmill climbing suggesting
that a higher number of different movement solutions were used to solve the
task of stairmill climbing."
Please state if the box plots in the figures correspond to the subject-to-subject
variability or to actual error estimates of the statistical inferences of LyE,
CoD, etc. Same remarks for various figures.
Authors’ response:
The box plots depicture the median value and the 5th, 25th, 75th, and 95th
percentile of the variable. This has been clarified in the statistics paragraph.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have made some changes to address concerns. Although they
have made a good effort to answer the queries, most changes in the
manuscript are cosmetic. The central issues raised have not been addressed.
Authors’ response:
We thank the reviewer for careful and thorough review and we have revised
the manuscript according to the raised issues.
1. The authors equate ‘stable behavior state’ with ‘optimal movement
solutions’ (‘The above data can also provide support for dynamical systems
theory which suggests that stable behavioral states or optimal movement
solutions arise from…’). First, simply replacing ‘stability of the coordination
pattern’ with ‘stable behavioral state’ is not particularly useful or illuminating.
Second, optimality of individual joints is conflated with stability of the entire
behavior. I am not convinced that looking at the dynamics and variability of
individual joints as independent entities allows for conclusions regarding ‘a
stable behavioral state’ or ‘Synergistic organization of the neuromuscular
system’.
Authors’ response:
We have further revised the manuscript to address this point. We would also
like to mention that there is also a plethora of studies that have utilized the
dynamics and variability of individual joints to explore stable behavioral
states. However, we agree with the reviewer that such generalizations may be
too much. Thus, we have downplayed our explanations to the point that we
have even changed our title.
2. Motor commands become more variable as the strength of the command
increases. This is a rather general formulation of the signal-dependent-noise
idea (Osu et al, 2003). The distinction between discrete vs cyclic tasks is not
relevant. Furthermore, the view that optimization principles are incompatible
with the dynamic system theory approach to movement is not necessarily true
(Schaal et al. 2007). The authors have chosen a rather narrow reading of one
paper.
3. These problems make the discussion section quite weak.
Authors’ response:
We have included the references mentioned above in our paper and we have
considered the above notion presented by our reviewer for the interpretation
of our results.
Please note that the references provided are not exhaustive. They simply
illustrate a point. Authors may want to dig deeper to compose a well informed
opinion.
Authors’ response:
We would like to thank the reviewer for raising this issue which is now
included in our paper and strengthened our interpretations.

Comments to the Author(s)
It is recommended that the interaction effect on the joint angle meanSD is
interpreted (Page 12).
Authors’ response:
We thank the reviewer for this recommendation. We have added the following
paragraph to the discussion:
“The change in stepping frequency during stairmill climbing affected the knee
and ankle joint angle variability but did not alter the corresponding dynamics.
Thus, higher variability was observed at low stepping frequencies indicating
that a higher number of movement solutions were utilized for two distal joints.
This is in agreement with previous observations during treadmill walking
[11], suggesting a common mechanism determining the movement variability
during walking and stairmill climbing and different mechanisms determining
the joint angle dynamics.”
