Dear editor and authors,
First of all I want to thank you for a good read. I agree with the authors that exploration of
correlation of soil properties and invertebrate diversity is a very interesting topic, and that DNA
metabarcoding can be a powerful tool to assess invertebrate diversity. As my expertise lies within
eDNA, I will restrict my review to the parts of the manuscript concerning this.
My main comment is that this manuscript uses metabarcoding for abundance measures of
invertebrate diversity. See line 163-166 saying that PCA plots are based on abundance measures
and Fig 8 in Supp info. Many factors influence the copy numbers of taxa in second generation
sequencing outputs (e.g. PCR stochasticity, primer biases, differential degradation of taxa) and no
matter the sample size and taxonomical level in question, metabarcoding data should not be used
for abundance measures without thorough examination of whether the primers, target taxa and
templates, sample type, PCR inhibitors, degradation and amount of different taxa within
samples, study set-up etc. allows it. Please see e.g. Deagle et al 2013, Deagle et al 2014, Pinol et al
2014, Elbrecht et al 2015, Murray et al 2015 and other papers (like Ziesemer et al 2015 and Bru et
al 2008) on the topic.
Furthermore, please consider making the relation to your Soil Biology & Biochemistry 2016 paper
clear and state the originality of the present manuscript compared to this as well as how the two
studies complement each other.
Further comments and suggestions
Please add how many samples were analysed from the different sites and make it clear which
were sequenced on Illumina and which were sequenced on the 454.
Wording: Please consider whether amplicon sequencing/metabarcoding is metagenomics. Please
consider rephrasing to DNA metabarcoding or amplicon sequencing (see e.g. Taberlet et al 2012).
454 data is often associated with higher error rates than Illumina – could sequencing error have
inflated taxonomic outputs for samples sequenced on the 454?
Line 44: Delete comma.
Line 60: Double space.
Line 60-64: This is what this study does, right? Then consider making it clear to the reader. See
comment to line 81-94.
Line 65-72: If you mean metabarcoding, then please specify.
Line 72: Not metagenomics, please use DNA metabarcoding or amplicon sequencing.
Line 72: The reference for metataxonomic is on microbiomes. I have never heard the word
metataxonomic for metabarcoding of biodiversity. I think to keep it simple and not to confuse the
invertebrates with microbiomes, maybe just use amplicon sequencing or metabarcoding.
Line 75: ‘more recent high throughput approaches’ – please be more specific about which
methods you are talking about. Metabarcoding?
Line 81-94: This sounds like abstract/conclusion text (and is rather similar in wording in both
abstract and conclusion). Consider deleting this and rather use the space to make the relevance of
this study very clear, that is, e.g. how this study contributes with something new in relation to
your study in Soil Biology & Biochemistry and in relation to line 53-59 and 60-64.

Line 97-110 and line 144-166: These are the same samples and the same collection and processing
as in Czechowski et al 2016, Soil Biology & Biochemistry, right? If so, you can consider saving
space by referring to detailed descriptions of collection, extraction, further lab processing,
sequencing and analyses in this paper and just give an overview here as well as add any
modifications.
Line 144-146: Please add the primer names and references, what taxonomical groups they target
and the marker length.
Line 348-350: Please relate this to the previous sentence to make it clear whether your findings are
in agreement with this.
Specifically to Supplementary information
Line 32-48: Please add the primer names and references, what taxonomical groups they target
and the marker length.
Line 57: Please specify how the negative controls looked as inspected on agarose gels.
Line 59-68: Please consider whether tag switching/jumping could have caused taxa to be falsely
assigned to samples/sites with the 454 set-up and specify how this is acknowledged in the
analyses. See Blaalid et al. 2013, 2014; Carew et al. 2013; Davey et al. 2013, 2014; Lindner et al.
2013; Botnen et al. 2014. Taxa in high copy numbers will have a greater probability of ‘jumping’.

Review of ‘Age-related environmental gradients determine invertebrate distribution in the Prince
Charles Mountains, East Antarctica.’
4
The study presented in the submitted manuscript investigates which of the included parameters
best explains the diversity of sediment invertebrates in the region of the Prince Charles
Mountains of East Antarctica. The study is very interesting and has a very high scientific quality.
It can always be discussed, if knowledge about invertebrate diversity in the polar-regions have
huge global impact and the overall impact of the findings could be more clear in the presented
manuscript. Nevertheless, I think it is an important study and I strongly advocate publication
with minor to some changes.
Suggestions
• Put the findings into a global context
Questions
• Why use phylotype and not OTU/MOTU? Did you try to analyse your data using
MOTUs instead. If so, did you get the same results??
• Did you revisit any of the sampling locations at different time points? If not why don’t
you think seasonal variations will influence you conclusions?
Key concerns:
• Replication of diversity estimates: it is not clear if intra sample variation was explored
and compared to inter sample variation. It is key for understanding the usability of the data.
Furthermore replication within sites is equally important to exclude that the observed variation
could be due to mere sample variation? It might very well have been done but is it not clear from
the presented data. I do not think this is required within all samples and all sites, but maybe a
handful.
• The use of PCR replicates is super important in diversity investigations using a
metabarcoding approach. It is clear that each PCR is done in triplicates and that is super good. It
is however less clear if the information from these triplicate PCR is used to reduce the key and
very detrimental effects of amplicon chimeras. I suggest this comparison is take into
consideration when selecting true phylotypes or if it is done already then it has to be more clear
in the text
• It is not clear if the authors tried to analyse the read data from each location separately ie.
Mount Menzies, Mawson Escarpment and Lake Terrasovoje? To se if it is the same overall
parameter explaining the biodiversity of invertebrates at each individual location or that only
stands out as significant when data from all three locations are pool? Could that approach give
stronger support to the overall findings or does the pattern get more blurred? Maybe there is
insufficient data per location to perform the analysis or maybe it is done already but it is not
clear? If so I would strongly advocate that it is explained more elaborate and clear

r Matthew Allinson and Andrew Dunn,
hereby re-submit our revised manuscript (RSOS-160296.R1) entitled: “Age-related
ironmental gradients influence invertebrate distribution in the Prince Charles Mountains, East
arctica” for consideration in ‘Royal Society Open Science’ as an original research article. We
reciated the helpful comments provided by the two reviewers and yourself, and the overall
itive feedback on the manuscript.
implementation of a current abundance correction algorithm as requested by the reviewers
essitated a complete recoding of the analysis, which enabled us to review all statistical
roaches. Implementation of this algorithm necessitated excluding the COI data from our analysis,
ch did not negatively affect analysis, results, sample size or our conclusions. These changes now
vide much improved and robust analyses alongside a compelling paper, which will be of high
rest for many researchers. As part of this re-submission we provide a tracked-changes version of
article main file (highlighting our edits), new figures, and a detailed response to all of the

Reply: We appreciate the positive reply.
Comment: My main comment is that this manuscript uses metabarcoding for abundance
measures of invertebrate diversity. See line 163-166 saying that PCA plots are based on abundance
measures and Fig 8 in Supp info. Many factors influence the copy numbers of taxa in second
generation sequencing outputs (e.g. PCR stochasticity, primer biases, differential degradation of

not be used for abundance measures without thorough examination of whether the primers, target
taxa and templates, sample type, PCR inhibitors, degradation and amount of different taxa within

2014, Elbrecht et al 2015, Murray et al 2015 and other papers (like Ziesemer et al 2015 and Bru et
al 2008) on the topic.
Reply: Many studies have highlighted the potential of metabarcoding as at least a semi-quantitative
method for both nuclear ribosomal (Hirai et al. 2015; Lindeque et al. 2013; Sun et al. 2015; Weber &
Pawlowski 2013) and mitochondrial DNA markers (Evans et al. 2016; Kelly et al. 2014; Murray et
al. 2011). We have now included primer specificity information and specificity test results in the
supplementary information. In the current version of the manuscript we employ cumulative sum
scaling (CCS, Paulson et al. 2013) to allow semi-quantitative abundance comparisons between
sampling regions. To implement this algorithm robustly, stringent pre-filtering was necessary,
requiring the exclusion of cytochrome oxidase 1 sequence data from the study. This change did not
affect sample size or analysis results.
Comment: Furthermore, please consider making the relation to your Soil Biology & Biochemistry
2016 paper clear and state the originality of the present manuscript compared to this as well as
how the two studies complement each other.
Reply: This comment also relates to comments 4,9,14,15 below. The mentioned work
(Czechowski et al., 2016) can be regarded as a pilot study to this work in several ways: (1.) Both
works are based on the same field campaign and the same sampling collection methods. (2.)
Czechowski et al., (2016) uses substantially fewer samples than the present study (12 versus
136). (3.) Czechowski et al., (2016) investigates eukaryotic diversity, while this work focusses
explicitly on invertebrates. (4.) Czechowski et al., (2016) interprets biogeographic patterns in
relation to proxy variables (latitude and altitude). Here, a large number of soil geochemical and
geological predictor variables are considered.
In order to address this comment, we changed the manuscript at several locations: (1.) The
present version of the manuscript now makes the reader aware of the presence of a pilot study
(last paragraph of the Introduction). (2.) The relation to our previous study is now more
thoroughly described in the last paragraph of the Introduction. (also see comment 14). (3.) A
section describing field work methods was shortened, and description of molecular laboratory
work extended (section 2.1 and section 2.4; see comment 15). (4.) We are now relating our
present finding to our earlier study in the Discussion (section 4.1). (5.) We now highlight our
previous work, involving the analysis of proxy variables, in the context of other work
investigating the suitability of predictor variables for the description of biogeographic patterns
(Discussion, subsection 4.3, beginning of third paragraph.).
Comment: Please add how many samples were analysed from the different sites and make it clear
which were sequenced on Illumina and which were sequenced on the 454.
Reply: A total of 136 samples were considered for this study, with 20 from MM, 64 from ME and
52 from LT (see section 2.1). Since COI data was excluded, all samples were sequenced using the
Illumina machine (section 2.4 now cross referencing the supplemental methods and our earlier
study.) 90 samples yielded invertebrate DNA (66%), with eight samples from MM (40%), 38
from ME (59%), and 44 samples from LT (84%) (see section 3.2.).
Comment: Wording: Please consider whether amplicon sequencing/metabarcoding is
metagenomics. Please consider rephrasing to DNA metabarcoding or amplicon sequencing (see
e.g. Taberlet et al 2012).
Reply: We revised the terminology in the current version of the manuscript. Specifically,
(Introduction, 3rd paragraph, 1st line), we are now defining "amplicon sequencing" and
"metabarcoding" in reference to Taberlet et al (2012). Throughout the manuscript, we replaced
"metataxonomic" (6 former instances) with "metabarcoding", where appropriate. Where
inappropriate, sentences were slightly modified.
Comment: 454 data is often associated with higher error rates than Illumina – could sequencing
error have inflated taxonomic outputs for samples sequenced on the 454?
Reply: The current version of the manuscript does not include any 454 data.
Comment: Line 44: Delete comma.
Reply: We deleted the comma in the third line of the Introduction. We checked comma usage
and punctuation thoroughly in the revised version of the manuscript.
Comment: Line 60: Double space.
Reply: We also removed all double spaces in the manuscript.
Comment: Line 60-64: This is what this study does, right? Then consider making it clear to the
reader. See comment to line 81-94.
Reply: This comment is related to comments 3, 14 and 15. In the current version of the
manuscript, we extended the text accordingly to address this comment. (Introduction, 3
paragraph). We also reference our recently published pilot study (Czechowski et al., 2016).: “In
a previous study [25] we used HTS of 18S ribosomal DNA (18S rDNA) to describe eukaryotic
diversity in the Prince Charles Mountains (PCMs), East Antarctica, revealing trends in diversity
related to latitudinal and elevational gradients. In the present study, we provide a detailed analysis
of the environmental determinants for the four predominant Antarctic invertebrate phyla
(nematodes, rotifers, tardigrades and arthropods) across a much larger spatial scale in the PCMs
using multivariate statistics.”
Comment: Line 65-72: If you mean metabarcoding, then please specify.
Reply: We have specified the approach to be "metabarcoding" throughout the manuscript.
Comment: Line 72: Not metagenomics, please use DNA metabarcoding or amplicon sequencing.
Reply: We now explicitly refer to "metabarcoding" throughout the manuscript.
Comment: Line 72: The reference for metataxonomic is on microbiomes. I have never heard the
word metataxonomic for metabarcoding of biodiversity. I think to keep it simple and not to confuse
the invertebrates with microbiomes, maybe just use amplicon sequencing or metabarcoding.
Reply: We now refer to another study for the definition of terminology (Taberlet et al, 2012;
third paragraph of introduction). We now use the term "metabarcoding" throughout the
manuscript
Comment: Line 75: ‘more recent high throughput approaches’ – please be more specific about
which methods you are talking about. Metabarcoding?
Reply: We are now using the term "metabarcoding" at the indicated position in order to be more
specific (Introduction, 3rd paragraph, beginning of last third.
Comment: Line 81-94: This sounds like abstract/conclusion text (and is rather similar in wording
in both abstract and conclusion). Consider deleting this and rather use the space to make the
relevance of this study very clear, that is, e.g. how this study contributes with something new in
relation to your study in Soil Biology & Biochemistry and in relation to line 53-59 and 60-64.
Reply: This comment and the text locations indicated are related to comments 3, 9, and 15. We
have redesigned the fourth paragraph of the introduction and now relate to our previous works
throughout the manuscript
Comment: Line 97-110 and line 144-166: These are the same samples and the same collection and
processing as in Czechowski et al 2016, Soil Biology & Biochemistry, right? If so, you can consider
saving space by referring to detailed descriptions of collection, extraction, further lab processing,
sequencing and analyses in this paper and just give an overview here as well as add any
modifications.
Reply: This comment is related to comments 3, 9, and 14. As a pilot study, our previous
publication (Czechowski et al., 2016), used the same field work techniques but analysed fewer
samples (see reply 3 above). We shortened section 2.1 and modified section 2.4. These sections
and the entire manuscripts now relates to our earlier works.
Comment: Line 144-146: Please add the primer names and references, what taxonomical groups
they target and the marker length.
Reply: Section 2.4. now contains “To amplify a 125 bp region of the eukaryotic 18S rDNA the
primers ‘Euk1391f’ and ‘EukBr’ [43] where used. During initial tests, those primers successfully
amplified rotifers, tardigrades, nematodes and arthropods (Arachnida) in bulk positive controls
(electronic supplementary material, text, figure 3).”
Comment: Line 348-350: Please relate this to the previous sentence to make it clear whether your
findings are in agreement with this.
Reply: We have revised section 2.4 entirely and this comment does not apply anymore.
Comment: SI Line 32-48: Please add the primer names and references, what taxonomical groups
they target and the marker length.
Reply: The primer references and target length are now provided in the main text (section 2.4.,
also see reply 16). Primer specificity is tested in this project as shown in supplemental text,
figure 3. Well over a hundred individual primer sequences were used to realize this project, and
the primer design is published in our earlier work (Czechowski et al. 2016) and initially in
Parfrey et al. (2014). Supplemental text, section 1.2 now provides detailed information on
primer design, and both earlier works are cross referenced accordingly. The necessary barcode
information is available from supplemental text, figure 2.
Comment: SI Line 57: Please specify how the negative controls looked as inspected on agarose
gels.
Reply: Please note that we sequenced control reactions (incl. blank PCR reactions) alongside
the actual samples, and that sequence information obtained from negative controls was
subtracted from the data intended for the analysis (see supplemental information, text, section
1.3 and 1.6). The negative controls, in some instances, had faint bands visible, and were
sequenced, as noted in supplemental information, text, section 1.3. In the revised version of the
manuscript we now provide, in supplemental information, text, figure 3, detailed information
regarding the purified DNA concentration of all sequenced libraries (including the PCR blanks
referred to in this comment). Supplemental information, text, section 1.3 now cross-references
this s.i. figure 3. Given that (1.) the concentration values for all PCR blanks are now provided,
and (2) all sequence data from negative controls passing filtering was subtracted from the
sample data, we believe mentioning of agarose gel inspection is unnecessary. We have removed
all references to agarose gel inspection from the s.i..
Comment: SI Line 59-68: Please consider whether tag switching/jumping could have caused taxa
to be falsely assigned to samples/sites with the 454 set-up and specify how this is acknowledged in
the analyses. See Blaalid et al. 2013, 2014; Carew et al. 2013; Davey et al. 2013, 2014; Lindner et
al. 2013; Botnen et al. 2014. Taxa in high copy numbers will have a greater probability of ‘jumping’.
Reply: The current version of the manuscript does not anymore include any 454 data.
Comment: SI Page 10: ‘Illumina fusion primers (upper) employed in this study were described
in detail elsewhere (Chapter 2)...’: there are no chapter 2.
Reply: We revised the supplemental information, text. The cross-reference intended here is
now established (Czechowski et al., 2016).
ponses to second reviewer
Comment: The study presented in the submitted manuscript investigates which of the included
parameters best explains the diversity of sediment invertebrates in the region of the Prince Charles
Mountains of East Antarctica. The study is very interesting and has a very high scientific quality. It
can always be discussed, if knowledge about invertebrate diversity in the polar-regions have huge
global impact and the overall impact of the findings could be more clear in the presented
manuscript. Nevertheless, I think it is an important study and I strongly advocate publication with
minor to some changes.
Reply: We appreciate the positive reply. In order to highlight the impact of our work in a global
context, we have added a paragraph to the Discussion (in new subsection 4.4.).
Comment: Put the findings into a global context.
Reply: We have added a paragraph to the Discussion (in new subsection 4.4.)
Comment: Why use phylotype and not OTU/MOTU? Did you try to analyse your data using MOTUs
instead? If so, did you get the same results??
Reply: The terms "phylotype" and "MOTU/OTU" can be used interchangeably, According to
Moreira and Purificación (2011) "[...] a phylotype is an environmental DNA sequence or group of
sequences sharing more than an arbitrarily chosen level of similarity of a particular gene marker
[...] phylotypes, often referred to as Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), are a proxy for species"
Consequently, following Lawley et al. (2004), we use the term "phylotype" instead of the
acronym "OTU" or "MOTU" throughout the manuscript. To aid the reader, we have inserted a
short definition of the chosen terminology into the revised version of the manuscript, at the first
mentioning of "phylotype", along with two references (subsection 2.4, beginning of first
paragraph).
Comment: Did you revisit any of the sampling locations at different time points? If not, why don’t
you think seasonal variations will influence your conclusions?
Reply: Due to logistic constraints and high costs of remote Antarctic field work, we were not
able to revisit different sampling sites at different times. However, we sampled in the austral
summer when biological activity would be highest, hence our results should reflect the most
ecologically significant community. Similarly, as our approach enabled detection of
environmental DNA, this would have averaged out seasonal variation to some degree.
Accordingly, we added to the Discussion (section 4.3. last paragraph): “Each site was sampled
only once in our study. Consequently, we cannot rule out the possibility of seasonal variation in the
invertebrate communities at these locations. However, we sampled during the austral summer
when biological activity is highest, and consequently our results would reflect the most ecologically
significant invertebrate community. Also, the relatively large amount of soil processed, the short
markers used (125 bp), and high potential for DNA preservation in polar environments [73] would
allow the detection of environmental DNA. Hence, the detected communities are effectively a
composite sample integrated over time, averaging out seasonal variation to some degree. For these
reasons, we feel our conclusions would not be altered by variation in the invertebrate community
over time.”
Comment: Replication of diversity estimates: it is not clear if intra sample variation was explored
and compared to inter sample variation. It is key for understanding the usability of the data.
Furthermore, replication within sites is equally important to exclude that the observed variation
could be due to mere sample variation? It might very well have been done but is it not clear from
the presented data. I do not think this is required within all samples and all sites, but maybe a
handful.
Reply: Our redesigned analysis gave us the opportunity to thoroughly address environmental
and biological sample variation. Main figures two, three and four in particular depict sample
environmental and biological sample variation more explicitly then our previous figures in the
previous manuscript version. Sample variation is now also more explicitly addressed
throughout Results and Discussion sections of the manuscript. E.g. we now mention high sample
variation in the results section 3.1. “Yeo-Johnson transformation, scaling and centring of
environmental predictors considerably improved normality and variance uniformity, with some
variables (NH4+, NO3-, K, P and C) exhibiting bimodal distributions due to measurements below
the detection limit (NH4+and P at MM), or heteroscedasticity across measurement values (NO3-,
K, and C; electronic supplementary material, main analysis figures 8 and 9).” We also provide
highly documented analysis code including all analysis graphics and statistics alongside the
manuscript, which are cross-referenced throughout the main text. We believe that any reader
will now be able to thoroughly the quality of our data, our analysis and the variations associated
with the environmental and biological data.
Comment: The use of PCR replicates is super important in diversity investigations using a
metabarcoding approach. It is clear that each PCR is done in triplicates and that is super good. It
is however less clear if the information from these triplicate PCR is used to reduce the key and very
detrimental effects of amplicon chimeras. I suggest this comparison is take into consideration
when selecting true phylotypes or if it is done already then it has to be more clear in the text.
Reply: This comment is related to comments 6, 19 and 20 of the 1st reviewer. We revised
section 2.4. of the main text, now addressing chimera removal and filtering explicitly. Further
related explanations are provided in section 1.4 and 1.6 of the s.i., text.
Comment: It is not clear if the authors tried to analyse the read data from each location separately
ie. Mount Menzies, Mawson Escarpment and Lake Terrasovoje? To see if it is the same overall
parameter explaining the biodiversity of invertebrates at each individual location or that only
stands out as significant when data from all three locations are pool? Could that approach give
stronger support to the overall findings or does the pattern get more blurred? Maybe there is
insufficient data per location to perform the analysis or maybe it is done already but it is not clear?
If so I would strongly advocate that it is explained more elaborate and clear.
Reply: The analysis has been re-code in its entirety. The methods section most relevant to this
comment has been rewritten (section 2.5. main text), alongside many other changes throughout
the manuscript (mainly sections 2 and 3). We believe it now to be clear that all biological and
environmental data was related to each other as a whole, and that only salt-age regressions
were also conducted within individual regions in addition to regressing across all samples (see
section 3.1.). We believe it now also to be clear that our main interest of this study is to describe
large-spatial relationships between environment and organisms, and hence performing
localised analyses would not advance our study goal. By supplying revised figures, main text
and comprehensive analysis documentation, we believe it now to be clear that the of
environmental and biological data is of very heterogeneous nature and more localized analyses
would not help the analysis. Accordingly, we have qualified our finding in section 4.3, end of first
paragraph: “Considering the properties of the Antarctic terrain, our study delivers compelling
insight into the relationships between biodiversity and constraints of its distribution imposed by
highly heterogeneous environmental factors.”
Comment: Line 234 and 251: 4.1 appears twice in the headers.
Reply: We revised the section numbering throughout the entire manuscript.
