In the manuscript the application of a tool that appears to be useful to solve fractional
partial differential equations is presented.
This tool is named fractional-order reduced differential transform method (FRDTM)
and it has been recently introduced by the authors and collaborators in references [51, 52, 53].
The authors discuss six examples to show that an improvement is obtained with respect to the
existing literature
methods to solve some time-fractional diffusion equations in the multidimensional case.
The Introduction is very well written and interesting, however some flaws arise. In particular,
the full text is an overstatement of the real results.
For this reason, I think that a major revision is needed before to consider it for publication.
In my opinion, the athours should strongly reconsider the text before resubmit the manuscript.
Below I give Main and Minor remarks that are just a few ideas to improve the manuscript.
Main remarks
In the Introduction, authors stress the role of fractional calculus to solve nonlinear problems.
Moreover,
equation (1.1) seems to be the reference equation of the following research. But, looking to the six
considered
examples, the authors do not study nonlinear equations, but linear only.
Moreover, in the Conclusion the following is reported:
"Moreover, performed computations depicts that the implemented method is very easy to use as
compared to M-HPM,
3
and need less conditions as compared to ADM.
The small size of calculation in the FRDTM contrary to the M-HPM is its advantage."
But these comparisons are neither discussed and neither showed in the text.
At least a short introduction of these alternative methods should be given.
In fact, this part is very important to justify the publication.
Minor remarks
In the abstract, space-fractional differential equations are mentioned but the manuscript is
devoted only to time-fractional differential equations. Then, I think that it is better to remove
this and eventually include it in the introduction.
Page 2, type Crank-Nicolson rather than CrankNicolson
Page 3 below (2.1), the sentence "In his work, Caputo and Mainardi proposed ..." seems to be not
gramatically correct.
Maybe "In their work, Caputo and Mainardi ...".
Page 3 beginning of Section 2.1, please correct psi(x,t)=f(x)g(x) with psi(x,t)=f(x)g(t)

Approximate series solution of multi-dimensional
time-fractional-order heat like diffusion equations
using FRDTM
September 29, 2014
By: Brajesh Singh and Vineet Srivastava
Approximate series solutions for time fractional diffusion problems were studied. The au-
hor used the so called fractional-order reduced differential transform method to deal with
he approximation of the Caputo derivative. The author did not provide any stability or
convergence analysis. But, some numerical results were presented to demonstrate the effi-
ciency of the proposed approach. To some extent, the obtained results are interesting and I
will recommend the paper for publication in Royal Society Open Science after considering
my concerns below.
a) There is confusion in the notations in the paper. For example, in (1.1), what is Dta ?,
a a
what about the other notation: <U+2202><U+2202>t a . What is the difference between Dta and <U+2202><U+2202>t a ? In (2.2),
again a differnet notation was used for the Caputo derivative. What is the difference be-
a
ween Dta , Da , and <U+2202><U+2202>t a . Are they all the same?
b) On page 2, paragraph after Eq (1.2), the authors mentioned that for a = 1, Eq (1.1)
reduces into classical heat equation. I think this is not true. More precisely, for constant
diffusion parameter, the alternative formulation of the model problem in Eq (1) given by
u' = s <U+2202>ta <U+2207>2 u (with <U+2202>ta being the RiemannLiouville time fractional derivative operator of
order a ) reduces to classical heat equation for a = 1.
c) Section 2, the first sentence needs to be rephrased. Similarly, for the sentence after
Eq (2.1).
d) In Lemma 2.1, the authors should use the variable t instead of x.
e) In Lemma 2.2, in (a) and (c), what is the domain of the variable k? or what is k?
f) In Eq (3.3), Uk (x, y) should be replaced with Uk (x).
2
g) In Eq (3.3), you have x2 , however in (3.5), you dont have the factor 12 . Why? It
seems to me there something not right.
h) On pages 16 and 17, there are some type-setting issues. For instance, Eq (3.15) is
appearing immediately after Eq (3.11), and Eq (3.12) occurs on page 17.
i) The authors did the experiments for 6 different examples, and I think it would be
better to reduce them to 4 examples (maximum) and add some more details. For instance,
n all figures, the authors chose a = 1, what about the comparison for other values of a ?
j) In Example 5, Eq (3.29), there is a typo.
k) For references, there are several papers in the literature dealing with efficient high-
order numerical methods for solving the model problem in Eq (1.1) and its alternative
formulation. For instance, I bring the attention of the authors to the following very recent
contributions:
1- Mustapha, Discontinuous Galerkin methods for fractional diffusion problems, Nu-
merische Mathematik (2014), http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.6976.pdf
2- Cockburn and others, Hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods for fractional or-
der diffusion problems, Numerische Mathematik (2014), http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.7383v1.pdf
3- Mustapha and others, A discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin method for time-fractional
diffusion equations, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., (2014), http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1935v1.pdf
Finally, I ask the authors to read the paper very carefully. Indeed, there are few gram-
mar mistakes, for instance, Section 1, line 1, idea is it should be idea. Another thing,
n the paragraph straight after Eq (1.2), in the second last line, Is is the practical super-
diffusion? or the practical sub-diffusion?
Good luck

yal Society of Open Science
I am very thankful to you for considering the submitted manuscript. I am also thank-
to the referees for their valuable comments which improved both technical quality and
sentation of the paper.
The details of the point by point response to the reviewers comments is as follows:
Response to the Reviewer 1s comments
proximate series solutions for time fractional diffusion problems were studied. The author
d the so called fractional-order reduced differential transform method to deal with the
roximation of the Caputo derivative. The author did not provide any stability or conver-
ce analysis. But, some numerical results were presented to demonstrate the efficiency of
proposed approach. To some extent, the obtained results are interesting and I will rec-
mend the paper for publication in Royal Society Open Science after considering
concerns below.
Reply: Thank you very much for your valuable time and comments, given below. The
onse of each comment is written below the comment.
There is confusion in the notations in the paper. For example, in (1.1), what is Dta , what
<U+2202>a a <U+2202>a
about the other notation: <U+2202>t a . What is the difference between Dt and <U+2202>ta ? In (2.2),
again a differnet notation was used for the Caputo derivative. What is the difference
<U+2202>a
between Dta , Da and <U+2202>t a . Are they all the same?
Reply: All the notations mentioned above are same. In the revised version, it is clearly
a
mentioned that Dta u = <U+2202><U+2202>tau , and throughout manuscript, the notation Dta u is used uni-
formly, and the third notation is removed.
On page 2, paragraph after Eq (1.2), the authors mentioned that for a = 1, Eq (1.1)
reduces into classical heat equation. I think this is not true. More precisely, for constant
diffusion parameter, the alternative formulation of the model problem in Eq (1) given by
u0 = s<U+2202>ta <U+2207>2 u (with <U+2202>ta at being the Riemann-Liouville time fractional derivative operator
of order a) reduces to classical heat equation for a = 1:
Reply: Yes, you are right. In the revised manuscript, the text is modified accordingly
(with the help of eqn. (2.1) and (2.2) for integer m=1).
Section 2, the first sentence needs to be rephrased. Similarly, for the sentence after Eq
(2.1).
Reply: Rephrased accordingly.
In Lemma 2.1, the authors should use the variable t instead of x.
Reply: Changed accordingly.
In Lemma 2.2, in (a) and (c), what is the domain of the variable k? or what is k?
Reply: The domain of k is the set of non-negative integers. Mentioned it in Lemma
2.2(a), in Lemma 2.2(c), there is no need.
In Eq (3.3), Uk (x, y) should be replaced with Uk (x).
Reply: Changed accordingly.
2
In Eq (3.3), you have x2 , however in (3.5), you dont have the factor 21 . Why? It seems
to me there something not right.
2 2
Reply: It is correct. The factor 12 is cancelled out, due to the fact 12 ddxx2 = 1. Thus, for
k = 0, the right hand side of (3.3) gives only x2 . Similarly, the rest term can be verified.
On pages 16 and 17, there are some type-setting issues. For instance, Eq (3.15) is ap-
pearing immediately after Eq (3.11), and Eq (3.12) occurs on page 17.
Reply: Actually, you are talking about the text setting problem at pages 6-7. I see the
typo, occurred due to misplace of the text. In the revised manuscript, the problem is
removed (due to selection of only four examples among six suggested by you), and the
typo is erased.
The authors did the experiments for 6 different examples, and I think it would be better
to reduce them to 4 examples (maximum) and add some more details. For instance, in
all figures, the authors chose a = 1, what about the comparison for other values of a?
Reply: In the revised manuscript, we consider only four test examples. Also, the com-
parison with different values of a is included.
In Example 5, Eq (3.29), there is a typo.
Reply: In the revised manuscript Example 5 Eq (3.29) is Example 3 Eq (3.15). extra +
sign is removed.
For references, there are several papers in the literature dealing with efficient high order
numerical methods for solving the model problem in Eq (1.1) and its alternative for-
mulation. For instance, I bring the attention of the authors to the following very recent
contributions:
1- Mustapha, Discontinuous Galerkin methods for fractional diffusion problems, Nu-
merische Mathematik (2014), http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.6976.pdf
2- Cockburn and others, Hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods for fractional order
diffusion problems, Numerische Mathematik (2014), http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.7383v1.pdf
3- Mustapha and others, A discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin method for time-fractional
diffusion equations, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., (2014), http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1935v1.pdf
Reply: Yes, We saw. We have included these articles.
ally, I ask the authors to read the paper very carefully. Indeed, there are few grammar
takes, for instance, Section 1, line 1, idea is it should be idea. Another thing, in the
agraph straight after Eq (1.2), in the second last line, Is is the practical super-diffusion?
the practical sub-diffusion?
ply: Section 1, line 1, idea is is replaced by idea. It is practical sub-diffusion, i.e.,
diffusion (a < 1).
Response to the Reviewer 2s comments
mments to the Author(s) In the manuscript the application of a tool that appears
e useful to solve fractional partial differential equations is presented. This tool is named
tional-order reduced differential transform method (FRDTM) and it has been recently
oduced by the authors and collaborators in references [51, 52, 53]. The authors discuss
examples to show that an improvement is obtained with respect to the existing literature
hods to solve some time-fractional diffusion equations in the multidimensional case.
Introduction is very well written and interesting, however some flaws arise. In particular,
full text is an overstatement of the real results. For this reason, I think that a major
ision is needed before to consider it for publication. In my opinion, the athours
uld strongly reconsider the text before resubmit the manuscript. Below I give Main and
or remarks that are just a few ideas to improve the manuscript.
Reply: Thank you very much for your valuable time and comments, given below. The
onse of each comment is written below the comment.
in remarks: In the Introduction, authors stress the role of fractional calculus to solve
linear problems. Moreover, equation (1.1) seems to be the reference equation of the
owing research. But, looking to the six considered examples, the authors do not study
linear equations, but linear only.
reover, in the Conclusion the following is reported:
oreover, performed computations depicts that the implemented method is very easy to
as compared to M-HPM, and need less conditions as compared to ADM. The small size
alculation in the FRDTM contrary to the M-HPM is its advantage.
these comparisons are neither discussed and neither showed in the text. At least a short
oduction of these alternative methods should be given. In fact, this part is very important
ustify the publication.
ply: In the revised manuscript, the text in the introduction is modified accordingly. In
paper, my main goal is to find series solution of time fractional order multi-dimensional
-diffusion (and heat like diffusion) equations. The nonlinear problem can also be solved
using FRDTM, if needed one example will be provided. I compare FRDTM with ADM
M-HAM in terms of theocratical computation. A brief introduction of the method is
uded in introduction.
nor remarks:
the abstract, space-fractional differential equations are mentioned but the manuscript
evoted only to time-fractional differential equations. Then, I think that it is better to
ove this and eventually include it in the introduction.
ply: Abstract is modified accordingly.
e 2, type Crank-Nicolson rather than CrankNicolson
ply: CrankNicolson is replaced by Crank-Nicolson.
e 3 below (2.1), the sentence In his work, Caputo and Mainardi proposed ... seems to
not gramatically correct. Maybe In their work, Caputo and Mainardi ....
ply: Modified Accordingly.
e 3 beginning of Section 2.1, please correct psi(x,t)=f(x)g(x) with psi(x,t)=f(x)g(t)
ply: The correction is done.
e 5 below (3.4), U should be U.
ply: Checked in each example and corrected it, (i.e., Uk0 s is replaced by Uk s).
e 6, formula enumeration jumps from (3.11) to (3.15). Formulae from (3.12) to (3.14) are
age 7.
ply: I see the typo, occurred due to misplace of the text. In the revised manuscript, the
blem is removed (due to selection of only four examples among six), and the issue is
rted out.
e 7, the text above and below (3.14) is centered.
ply: Again the same problem, occurred due to misplace of the text. In the revised
nuscript, the problem is removed (due to selection of only four examples among six),
typo is erased.
nowledgements are still in progress.
ply: Acknowledgements is inserted in the revised manuscript.
