This manuscript presents research on the mating behavior of a weevil species and attempts to
characterize the importance of cuticular compounds (specifically hydrocarbons) on mating
behavior. While narrow in scope, the paper is well written and the statistical analyses are sound
(but see exception below).
I have serious concerns about the author's definition of courtship behavior. The authors make the
statement that 'courtship behavior' is inappropriate to describe male-male mounting behaviors.
However, a behavior does not depend on the outcome (copulation or insertion of genitalia), it is
the sequence of events that are predictable and repeatable (per the ethogram in Fig 1, stages 1-3).
This phrase needs to be removed and the authors should utilize a comprehensive term that
includes the same-sex mountings. Considering the high percentage of male-male pairs (78%)
observed, the authors need to revise places in the analysis where male-male mountings were
excluded for instances of determining behavior. As the authors mention, one of their objectives is
to determine mechanisms of gender identification, specifically as it pertains to the mating
sequence. From the places where it was included, the data suggests that males do not distinguish
between genders (pg 5) but rather the distinction is upon females.
Specific comments:
Pg 3, line 15: Rephrase to state "volatilization of beads occurs for X hours"
Pg 3, line 26, replace judgement with observation.
Pg 3 - how was video used? please describe
Pg 4, ln10: same-sex riding behavior? use same-sex mounting behavior
Suggest putting observation on "Behavioral experiment using alive weevils" before the section
using hexane extracts
pg 4, line 52: did you compare within sexes for duration of courtship and matin trials? Include.
Pg 5, line 1-4: clarify that the treatments evaluated here are the hydrocarbon extract vs. the
hexane control
Discussion
The authors should expand the discussion to compare their results to the broader literature,
specifically other instances where males do not differentiate gender. What are the implications of
this research?

This is a behavioral study that investigated a sequence of mating of the West Indian sweet potato
weevil, Euscepes postfasciatus, a notorious invasive pest in sweet potato fields in southwestern
islands of Japan. The authors described under-laboratory observations of mating behaviors of the
weevil by using both live insects and crude solvent extracts containing waxy components on their
body surface in glass dishes. The authors also analyzed their data by using the Cox proportional
hazard model and clearly showed that male individuals were significantly arrested by female-
body-derived hexane extracts. Overall, I found their experiments and analyses are well-done.
However, I think the manuscript has a couple of issues to be addressed before publication. My
major concern is that the authors described almost nothing about a potential value of their
findings, that is the function of body surface waxy compounds in mating of the weevil, for pest
managements, nevertheless they stated in Abstracts and Introduction that “The present study
would considerably aid the identification of effective attractants for the weevils and thus for the
establishment of successful pest management (P2, L25)”. I agree that the waxy compounds found
in this study are not volatile. Moreover, this insect loses flight ability (P6, L44). Thus I imagine it
is difficult to use these chemical stimuli for monitoring trap lures or improvements of them. I
would like the authors to show some idea to apply their insight to pest management programs of
this serious pest weevil.
My other comments are as follows;
1. P1, L28
mating -> mate
2. P2, L44

3. P3, L4

show the behavior of Stage II. Is there no difference between female and male behaviors? Please
clarify.
4. P3, L22
There is no descriptions about the age (12-17-d-old as individuals used in bioassays?) and mating
status of weevils used for extraction, which is critical in the present experiment. Also, timing of
4
extraction is generally essential for chemical stimuli used in sexual communications. Please
clearly describe them.
5. P3, L26

7. P3, L35

8. P3, L43

11. P5, L7
However, in males, no individual showed behaviour such as rubbing and/or raising the forelegs
in the control experiment (only hexane solvent), while 10 of 26 and 17 of 33 males displayed
either or both of these behaviour on beads covered with male and female extract, respectively; as
a result, the difference in frequency was significant between mounting and pre-copulatory
behaviour (P = 0.008; FET) -> this sentence is hard to be understand; how did you calculate
P=0.008?
12. P5, L23
(male:female=32:41, P=1; FET) -> is male:female=32:41 an expected number, which is identical to

13. P5, L45

14. P6, L3
The experiment examining mating trials using live weevils also revealed that E. postfasciatus
males tended to exhibit mounting behaviour irrespective of sex when they encountered a
congenerous individual. -> I agree that this observation is unusual and interesting. Is this often
found in weevils or other beetles? Alternatively, is there any possibilities that such the behavior is
triggered by laboratory manipulations? For example, the behavior was investigated in a very
limited space (4.7 mm in diameter), and the insects are reared under laboratory for a long term
(nearly 10 years), which may have driven unintentional selections such as a kin selection. I would
like the authors to discuss more about this topic.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Alexander Ophir):
Dear Dr. Tatsuta,
I have now received the comments from two expert reviewers of your manuscript. As you will
see there were some very positive comments regarding your paper and I believe there is some
important value to your study. However, both reviewers raised some important concerns,
including that you have not discussed the importance of this work in a way that will resonate
with a broad audience. Reviewer 1 also raises a very important conceptual problem with your
paper: that your characterization of courtship behavior is unjustified. Indeed, I agree with their
argument that a behavior does not depend on the outcome (copulation or insertion of genitalia),
it is a sequence of events that is predictable and repeatable. The omission of some of your
behavioral data (male-male mounting) also posed an issue if your goal was to identify chemical
cues for infraspecific gender identification. Your interpretations will require adjustment. Finally,
as I mentioned, both reviewers indicated that your manuscript is narrow in scope, a concern I had
originally. Their confirmation of this point has convinced me that your paper would be more
appropriate in a Taxon-specific journal such as Insect Behavior.
As a result, unfortunately, I must recommend rejection of your paper for publication in RSOS.
Subject Editor Comments to Author:
I appreciated the comments of one reviewer and the AE that this study is narrow in its scope;
however, that is not a criterion for RSOS, and so this issue must be discounted. However there
are some major issues with the interpretation raised by the reviewers and so we will allow
resubmission if these are addressed. thanks for your submission.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Alexander Ophir):
Dear Dr. Tatsuta,
I have once again received the reviews from two reviewers. Reviewer 1 was largely satisfied with
your revised submission with a few very easily addressable points that you should incorporate.
The second reviewer did not provide many specifics, but felt that you should shorten your paper.
This could be achieved by being more succinct in your discussion points and by potentially
reducing some unnecessary references. The second reviewer also felt that your study would have
been more compelling if you had incorporated gas-chromatography and mass spectrometry to
obtain pure compounds and used that instead of just the extracts. Perhaps you can briefly
address this point in your discussion section? These points aside, you have done a nice job of
addressing the concerns of the previous reviews and I appreciate your efforts on your
manuscript. I look forward to receiving a finalized version of this paper.

I have now received the comments from two expert reviewers of your
manuscript. As you will see there were some very positive comments
regarding your paper and I believe there is some important value to your
study. However, both reviewers raised some important concerns,
including that you have not discussed the importance of this work in a
way that will resonate with a broad audience. Reviewer 1 also raises a
very important conceptual problem with your paper: that your
characterization of courtship behavior is unjustified. Indeed, I agree with
their argument that a behavior does not depend on the outcome
(copulation or insertion of genitalia), it is a sequence of events that is
predictable and repeatable. The omission of some of your behavioral
data (male-male mounting) also posed an issue if your goal was to
identify chemical cues for infraspecific gender identification. Your
interpretations will require adjustment. Finally, as I mentioned, both
reviewers indicated that your manuscript is narrow in scope, a concern I
had originally. Their confirmation of this point has convinced me that
your paper would be more appropriate in a Taxon-specific journal such
as Insect Behavior.

We appreciate your comments and suggestions. We tried to improve the
manuscript in accordance with the advice of two experts and added
discussion about the same-sex sexual behaviour (SSB).
>Subject Editor Comments to Author:
I appreciated the comments of one reviewer and the AE that this study is
narrow in its scope; however, that is not a criterion for RSOS, and so this
issue must be discounted. However there are some major issues with the
interpretation raised by the reviewers and so we will allow resubmission
if these are addressed. thanks for your submission.
-Reply
We are really grateful for your thoughtful suggestion. We tried to
broaden the scope of topics we dealt with in the present study according
to the suggestions by two experts, especially for the intriguing issue of
same-sex sexual behaviours (SSB) and the possible usage of extracted
reagents in monitoring weevils.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
I have serious concerns about the author's definition of courtship
behavior. The authors make the statement that 'courtship behavior' is
inappropriate to describe male-male mounting behaviors. However, a
behavior does not depend on the outcome (copulation or insertion of
genitalia), it is the sequence of events that are predictable and repeatable
(per the ethogram in Fig 1, stages 1-3). This phrase needs to be removed
and the authors should utilize a comprehensive term that includes the
same-sex mountings. Considering the high percentage of male-male
pairs (78%) observed, the authors need to revise places in the analysis
where male-male mountings were excluded for instances of determining
behavior. As the authors mention, one of their objectives is to determine
mechanisms of gender identification, specifically as it pertains to the
mating sequence. From the places where it was included, the data
suggests that males do not distinguish between genders (pg 5) but rather
the distinction is upon females.
-Reply
Thank you very much for valuable suggestions. We totally agree with the
above opinion. We have learned the same-sex sexual behaviours (SSB)
from some recent literatures and realised that SSB is common in some
insect species, while it is controversial to determine whether SSB is
merely a by-product and is non-adaptive. We updated our knowledge on
SSB, especially based on the magnificent review of Scharf & Martin
(2013: Behav Ecol Sociobiol 67). We added explanation for SSB in
Introduction (L37-39) and in the section 3.2 in Materials and Methods.
Specific comments:
Pg 3, line 15: Rephrase to state "volatilization of beads occurs for X
hours"
-Reply
We rephrased as “After the beads were left for ca.12 hours to sufficiently
volatize the solvent…”
Pg 3, line 26, replace judgement with observation.
-Reply
We replaced the word.
Pg 3 - how was video used? please describe
-Reply
Since we were not sometimes really confident of our judgement of
weevil behaviours on beads that were hard to see under the dark
condition. To make sure the judgement, we recorded the behaviours
using video and made certain of the judgement by looking at it after the
experiments. A phrase explaining these was inserted in the texts (section
3.4 in Materials and Methods).
Pg 4, ln10: same-sex riding behavior? use same-sex mounting behavior
-Reply
Ref#2 also suggested a bit different wording. We described as “same-sex
sexual behaviour (SSB)” as defined in the section of 3.2 in Materials and
Methods.
Suggest putting observation on "Behavioral experiment using alive
weevils" before the section using hexane extracts
-Reply
We moved the section on “Behavioural experiment using alive weevils”
as suggested. Accordingly, we altered the order of appearance of sections
in the Results. In addition, we exchanged the order of statistical
explanations in section 3.5 in Materials and Methods so as to fit the
order of appearance.
pg 4, line 52: did you compare within sexes for duration of courtship and
mating trials? Include.
-Reply
We noticed that the previous description was inappropriate; precisely, we
compared between mating pairs (male-male vs. male-female pair), not
sexes. We corrected the sentence so as to clarify the meaning.
Pg 5, line 1-4: clarify that the treatments evaluated here are the
hydrocarbon extract vs. the hexane control
-Reply
Here we compared whether the frequency of contact behavior was
proportional to the frequency of the beads that have been initially settled
in each treatment (i.e. hexane control vs. male extract vs. female extract)
in each sex. Indeed, the initial sentence seems confusing, so we changed
it to clarify the meaning. Please see section 4.2 in Results.
Discussion
The authors should expand the discussion to compare their results to the
broader literature, specifically other instances where males do not
differentiate gender. What are the implications of this research?
-Reply
We added general discussions concerning SSB, with an example of flour
beetle. We also mentioned the conditions of the experiment, which was
pointed out by ref#2; however, because we did not know the details of
hidden background on the genetic nature of reared weevils, we just
raised the plausible items that might affect the sexual behaviours (the
second paragraph in Discussion).
Reviewer: 2
However, I think the manuscript has a couple of issues to be addressed
before publication. My major concern is that the authors described
almost nothing about a potential value of their findings, that is the
function of body surface waxy compounds in mating of the weevil, for
pest managements, nevertheless they stated in Abstracts and Introduction
that “The present study would considerably aid the identification of
effective attractants for the weevils and thus for the establishment of
successful pest management (P2, L25)”. I agree that the waxy
compounds found in this study are not volatile. Moreover, this insect
loses flight ability (P6, L44). Thus I imagine it is difficult to use these
chemical stimuli for monitoring trap lures or improvements of them. I
would like the authors to show some idea to apply their insight to pest
management programs of this serious pest weevil.
-Reply
Thank you for pointing out very substantial issue. We addressed our idea
to improve effectiveness of trapping weevils in the last paragraph in
Discussion.
My other comments are as follows;
1. P1, L28
mating -> mate
-Reply
We corrected it.
2. P2, L44
Kohama and Sugiyama (2000) -> please revise this to a proper citation
style.
-Reply
We corrected it so as to fit the style of RSOS.
3. P3, L4
the male grasps the other individual… -> according to the data in Table 1,
female weevils also show the behavior of Stage II. Is there no difference
between female and male behaviors? Please clarify.
-Reply
Thank you for the important comments. Most of studies investigating
mating behaviors using the weevils have mainly focused on the
behaviour of males, not of females. We found in the present study that
females also took actions categorised in Stage II when beads were
provided. There seems no marked difference in behaviours between the
sexes. We added the description in the texts as “We note here that we
found the female also took actions very similar to those taken by males
categorised in Stage II in the present experiment (also see Table 1). ”.
4. P3, L22
There is no descriptions about the age (12-17-d-old as individuals used
in bioassays?) and mating status of weevils used for extraction, which is
critical in the present experiment. Also, timing of extraction is generally
essential for chemical stimuli used in sexual communications. Please
clearly describe them.
-Reply
As described in the section 3.1, all individuals used in behavioural
experiments were 12-17-day-old virgin weevils. These weevils can be
regarded as well sexually matured; thus are suitable for assays of sexual
communications. To clarify the contexts, we added the description in the
texts as “We used sexually matured 12-17-day-old virgin weevils were
used for the extraction of cuticular lipids.”.
5. P3, L26
These extracts were transferred to a clean glass vial and evaporated to 30
µl -> These extracts were transferred to a clean glass vial and evaporated
to 30 µl under nitrogen stream (? Or under vacuum? using an
evapolatior?)
-Reply
We used nitrogen stream for the evaporation, so added the explanation in
texts.
6. P3, L34
ca. 4 individuals -> ca. 4-individual-equivalent)
-Reply
We corrected it as suggested.
7. P3, L35
covered -> applied
-Reply
We corrected it.
8. P3, L43
after which the light was removed -> how did you observe insects under
a dark photoperiod? Using a red light as the next observation?
-Reply
Yes, we used the same red light appeared in the next section. Because we
exchanged behavioural assay and experiment using alive insects, we
added the explanation of torch in newly numbered section 3.4
(behavioural assay section).
9. P4, L9
same-sex riding -> intrasexual mounting
-Reply
We termed as “same-sex-sexual behaviour (SSB)” as proposed by Bailey
& Zuk (2009) and Scharf & Martin (2013). This indication is related to
the main criticism by Ref#1.
10. P4, L45
reproductive -> mating
-Reply
We corrected it.
11. P5, L7
However, in males, no individual showed behaviour such as rubbing
and/or raising the forelegs in the control experiment (only hexane
solvent), while 10 of 26 and 17 of 33 males displayed either or both of
these behaviour on beads covered with male and female extract,
respectively; as a result, the difference in frequency was significant
between mounting and pre-copulatory behaviour (P = 0.008; FET) ->
this sentence is hard to be understand; how did you calculate P=0.008?
-Reply
We compared frequencies in Stage I and those in Stage III in males. In
order to clarify the meaning, we rephrased the corresponding part as
follows:
“We have to note that no males showed behaviour such as rubbing
and/or raising the forelegs, both of which are categorised as Stage III, on
beads coated with only hexane solvent (i.e. control), while 10 of 26 and
17 of 33 males displayed either or both of these behaviours on beads
covered with male and female extract (i.e. treatment); as a consequence,
a significant deviation in observed frequency was found between
mounting (Stage I) and pre-copulatory (Stage III) behaviour (P = 0.008;
FET).”
12. P5, L23
(male:female=32:41, P=1; FET) -> is male:female=32:41 an expected
number, which is identical to an observed number? If not, P=1 is error.
-Reply
We appreciate the important comments you made about the problem. As
pointed out, the P-value was definitely incorrect; this was because we
used expected proportion, not expected frequency. We have done FET
and put the correct P-value (P = 0.233) in the text.
13. P5, L45
attraction -> behavioral
-Reply
We corrected it.
14. P6, L3
The experiment examining mating trials using live weevils also revealed
that E. postfasciatus males tended to exhibit mounting behaviour
irrespective of sex when they encountered a congenerous individual. -> I
agree that this observation is unusual and interesting. Is this often found
in weevils or other beetles? Alternatively, is there any possibilities that
such the behavior is triggered by laboratory manipulations? For example,
the behavior was investigated in a very limited space (4.7 mm in
diameter), and the insects are reared under laboratory for a long term
(nearly 10 years), which may have driven unintentional selections such
as a kin selection. I would like the authors to discuss more about this
topic.
-Reply
Thank you for intriguing suggestions. This issue is quite interesting and
studies revealed that same-sex-sexual behavior (SSB) is also found in a
flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Levan et al. 2008: J Evol Biol 22). We
added the details of SSB in other animals as well as experimental
conditions in Discussion section. Because neither SSB found in wild
condition nor genetic background in the lineages of reared weevils has
been provided, we just raised unintended matters that might affect
mating behaviours in the second paragraph in Discussion. The diameter
of a glass Petri dish provided in behavioural assay using hexane extracts
was 27mm, so 4.7mm is probably a misinterpretation.
15. Figure 3
There is no label in the Y-axis. Please show it.
-Reply
We added labels in both X- and Y-axis.

>Associate editor:
I have once again received the reviews from two reviewers. Reviewer 1
was largely satisfied with your revised submission with a few very easily
addressable points that you should incorporate. The second reviewer did
not provide many specifics, but felt that you should shorten your paper.
This could be achieved by being more succinct in your discussion points
and by potentially reducing some unnecessary references. The second
reviewer also felt that your study would have been more compelling if
you had incorporated gas-chromatography and mass spectrometry to
obtain pure compounds and used that instead of just the extracts. Perhaps
you can briefly address this point in your discussion section? These
points aside, you have done a nice job of addressing the concerns of the
previous reviews and I appreciate your efforts on your manuscript. I look
forward to receiving a finalized version of this paper.
-Reply
We greatly appreciate these comments. We deleted some redundant
explanations in discussion section and referred to gas-chromatography
and mass spectrometry in the last paragraph. We also deleted some
references as suggested.
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 2
I found that the revised manuscript is substantially improved following
the comments from the reviewers. I would like to request a couple of
additional revisions.
-Reply
Thank you very much for providing helpful suggestions. We have
corrected all the points as follows.
P9, L36 and some other places
extracted reagents -> extracts
-Reply
We corrected the wording.
P10, L26; P11, L35
alive -> live
-Reply
We corrected the word.
P12, L10
30 µl -> ca. 30µl
-Reply
We corrected the wording.
P12, L11
2 individuals/µl -> ca. 2 individual equivalents/µl
-Reply
We corrected the wording.
P12, L15
4-individual-equivalent -> 4 individual equivalents
-Reply
We corrected the wording.
P12, L45
the expected ratio of male-to-female encounters is 2:1 -> the expected
ratio of homosexual and heterosexual encounters is 1:2. (? Please
confirm this sentence again.)
-Reply
Because two males and one female were placed in a Petri dish, we
rephrased the sentence as “the expected ratio of homosexual (i.e. male
meets male) and heterosexual (i.e. female meets male) encounters is
1:2”.
P15, L24
This finding implies that extracted lipid composition could make weevils
stay longer on a substrate that is coated with extracted compounds from
the body surface of the weevils -> This finding implies that extracts from
the body surface could make weevils stay longer on a substrate that is
coated with them
-Reply
We corrected the sentence as suggested.
Reviewer: 3
The text can be reduced significantly since most of the statements were
overly described and can be shortened.
-Reply
We tried to concise the discussion section according to the advice.
P11, L4
Delete the sequence of…
-Reply
We deleted the words as suggested.
P11, L35
Replace with live.
-Reply
We replaced the word.
P11, L36
Did you do only one observation or several observations. If several use
plural and change was to were.
-Reply
We changed the phrase as suggested because we observed the behaviour
many times.
Other points:
- We deleted “…no female undertook any behaviours categorized as
Stage III” since Stage III behaviour is impossible in females.
- We modified the explanation of Stage II (P11, L5-) so as to clarify
the meaning.
- We corrected formats in references.
