Synopsis. The material cause of tooth wear is a topic of debate, and the present manuscript is an
important contribution to this discussion. The authors report an experiment that refutes the
findings and interpretations of Xia et al. 2015, a paper published in PNAS. The authors present a
convincing explanation for the discrepancies in the two studies and present a new model of
enamel surface texture formation based on the presence and properties of silica particles.
Specific comments.
1. The paper is well-written, accessible to non-specialists, and clearly illustrated. I have very few
comments of substance.
2. Page 5, line 16 (“complex microwear texture”) – given the distinction between true wear
(abrasion) and enamel surface features (aka surface textures, fabrics) it might be a good idea to
avoid the word “microwear” here… better to say “complex surface textures” or something
similar. It is an awkward lexically to claim that microwear isn’t wear.
3. Page 5, line 18 (“grit rather than hard foods”) – this binary statement is perhaps too strongly
worded. If grit is more common on some hard foods, or if there are strong interactions between
grit and food hardness, then complex textures could be the partial result of both traits operating
in tandem.
4. Page 10, line 30 (“obviously to microwear textures”) – again (see point #2 above), you might
say “obviously to the surface textures that were typically classified as microwear”
5. Page 13, line 21 (“experimentally [398]”) – citation error. I think the authors intended citation
39 here.
6. Page 15, lines 41-42 (“absence of…” “does not indicate the absence”) – the use of triple negative
concepts is a bit confusing to follow. Why not say, “…the absence of complex microwear is
compatible with hard foods in the diet…”
7. Page 16, line 7 – (“show the opposite”) – better to say “demonstrates the reverse pattern”
8. Page 17, lines 39 & 44 (“microwear textures”) – again, I wonder if there isn’t a different word to
characterize these textures. The present model differentiates between surface textures and surface
wear, so it is awkward to retain the word microwear when referring to a non-wearing process.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In this paper, the authors examined the surface hardness of the metal spheres used by [12]. Based
on the nanoindentation tests, the authors reported that both the aluminum and brass spheres are
harder than enamel because of the surface oxidation of aluminum and work-hardening of brass.
Finally, they concluded that Xia et al.’s results are actually predicted by the mechanical model of
Lucas et al.
However, the main results of the authors only include three figures. Among these figures, Figure
1 is the core data which supports the authors’ main viewpoint. But the analysis of average contact
pressure in Figure 1c is flawed and invalidates the study. Given the similar indentation depths
obtained by the authors of both the rebuttal and original papers, the actual hardness of the
aluminum balls measured by the authors may be in the range from 0.67 to 2.7 GPa, which is
much lower than the hardness of enamel.
In addition, the finite element analysis on brass ball in Figure 2 shows that hard enamel surfaces
yield by a soft brass ball under high friction coefficient so that material removal of enamel would
occur. Thus, this result actually supports Xia et al’s experimental results that soft particle can
abrade the hard enamel.
Finally, most of the statements about the cause of dental microwear are misleading or false. For
example, the citations used to support the statement that hard foods are sheared do not consider
microscale movements of teeth. The statement that “microwear is somewhat flawed” because
tooth shape affects tooth guidance is incorrect. Numerous study have showed no consistent
differences in microwear pattern between unworn (sharp) and heavily worn (flatter) teeth. Also,
the statement that Daegling et al did not control for dust in the environment is false, and
regarding phytoliths in shell casings, this conflicts with the point made by Lucas et al that
phytoliths cannot wear teeth. In any event, the bone samples have no phytoliths and produce
notable tissue loss.
Therefore, the conclusions presented in this paper lack both experimental rigor and reliable
theoretical bases.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
I have read the article by van Casteran etal., and have to admit that I find it difficult to follow.
There does not seem to be a compelling message, and it is hard to see where the story is going.
The paper is not well constructed and not well balanced, as if different parts have been written by
different authors with totally different styles.
The Intro section is lengthy (3 1/2 pages). This section, along with the Abstract, seems to be soley
fixated on defending an earlier theory of wear by Lucas and some of his co-authors (Lucas etal),
in conjunction with an effort to discredit another paper by some other workers who have an
opposing viewpoint on the role of particulates in wear modeling. The Lucase model itself has
come under scrutiny, by Rabenold and co-workers, but these latter authors are not referenced in
the current text. Recent work by Constantino on wear processes are referenced, but not
discussed.
The Materials & Methods and Results sections are, by comparison, very short (about 1 page in
total) and present very limited information, confined to the surface hardness of spheres used in
wear tests. It is not altogether clear how these last two sections are central to the ensuing
discussion. The basis of the argument that aluminum and brass spheres are much harder than
bulk material because of production of an oxide layer during sliding is not compelling to this
reader, and is more directed to discrediting an antagonistic author than confirming the Lucas
theory. The images in Fig 1 are also very hard to read.
The Discussion section itself is very long (over 10 pages), contains much detailed conjecture on
wear mechanisms, and is difficult to follow. I can see how some researchers might find some of
the detailed assertions hard to accept. Again, the overall argument appears to be directed toward
confirmation of the earlier theory by Lucas etal. and refutation of their antagonists, but the
message gets lost in the detail.
If it were my work, I would be inclined to present the results as a Short Communication, cutting
to the quick, because I don’t see much that is new here. Either way, if the editor does decide to
5
accept this article, it would require major revision.

Associate Editor's comments:
Thank you for your patience with this review. There was a large difference in opinion in the two
original reviews, so I sought an additional referee.
One reviewer was generally positive, but two of the reviewers voiced substantial concerns about
the technical merit of the results, and the third reviewer identified additional problems with the
writing. Because of the positive viewpoint, I am allowing a revision to be carried forward.
However, all concerns of the reviewers must be met in order for the manuscript to be considered
for publication.

This resubmission does not meet today’s professional standards of the Royal Society. The paper
itself has a number of inaccuracies that show at best, sloppiness, to support a disproven model. I
provide two examples:
1. Analysis: The authors used an incorrect method to evaluate the hardness of the aluminum
balls in Figure 1c. It is unclear why the authors did not give the actual hardness of the system.
The authors showed the stresses produced in enamel by an aluminium ball without an oxide film
and with a 1 µm oxide film in Figure 3. How did the authors determine actual thickness of oxide
film coated on the aluminium ball?
2. Interpretation: The demonstration that crushing occurs with transverse motion relative to the
occlusal plane does not invalidate the association between pitting and crushing – it confirms it.
Because mammals are anisognathous, most have a large transverse component to slow close.
This explains why phase II wear facets are positioned on the sides of facets rather than on their
tips. Indeed, the inclination (i.e., strike and dip) of phase II wear facets has been studied for
nearly a century and related to occlusal/masticatory dynamics in countless publications by
11
Simpson, Butler, Mills, Crompton, Hiiemae, Kay, etc etc etc. The inclination of a typical
bunodont primate’s phase II facets requires transverse excursion of the jaw just as observed for
opposing wear surfaces to align in crushing.
These examples demonstrate a lack of knowledge of fundamental principles of engineering and
biology that are disturbing in light of the accomplishments of the authors. In any event, these
fundamental flaws invalidate the conclusions of this paper -- I do not believe this work warrants
publication unless and until they are addressed.

There still remains a substantial difference in viewpoint by the reviewers, with one reviewer
recommending publication and the other suggesting that major issues remain. I have not heard
back from the third reviewer, but in fairness to the authors to move forward, I am sending the
manuscript back for revision. Reviewer 2 says that there are a number of inaccuracies, and
documents two. I would suggest addressing these two items, and scouring the manuscript—as

Dear Alice,
We thank you very much for your consideration of our paper . We have revised the manuscript in accord
with the reviewer and editorial comments, interpolating below in blue the specific changes that we have
made.
In general, we have changed:
THE TITLE: From
Testing one’s mettle: Using metallic proxies can lead to errors when assessing the mechanics of
microwear formation
to
Evidence that metallic proxies are unsuitable for assessing the mechanics of microwear formation
and a new theory of the meaning of microwear
We feel that the new title emphasizes more the novel theory that we present, addressing some of the
concerns raised by Reviewer 3 about the apparent negativity of the paper.
EXTRA FIGURES: We have added two extra figures, again generated from analytic expressions (not finite
element analysis) to indicate the likely pattern of break-up of the aluminium oxide film at the margins of the
contact zone with enamel. We hope that this helps to address Reviewer 2’s concern that the original paper
acked figures.
NEW COAUTHORS: The production of Figures 2 and 3 taxed the time of two leaders in such research (Drs
Schwarzer and Bierwisch). In addition, they offered us a lot of advice over the best model of the contact to
adopt. So we have now offered them co-authorship, which they have kindly accepted. Their role in the
paper is indicated under Contributions.
We have also added several references.

Synopsis. The material cause of tooth wear is a topic of debate, and the present manuscript is an important
contribution to this discussion. The authors report an experiment that refutes the findings and
nterpretations of Xia et al. 2015, a paper published in PNAS. The authors present a convincing explanation
for the discrepancies in the two studies and present a new model of enamel surface texture formation
based on the presence and properties of silica particles.
We thank reviewer 1 for these kind words.
Specific comments.
1.The paper is well-written, accessible to non-specialists, and clearly illustrated. I have very few comments
of substance.
2. Page 5, line 16 (“complex microwear texture”) – given the distinction between true wear (abrasion) and
enamel surface features (aka surface textures, fabrics) it might be a good idea to avoid the word
“microwear” here… better to say “complex surface textures” or something similar. It is an awkward lexically
to claim that microwear isn’t wear.
We have now changed ‘complex microwear textures’ to ‘complex surface texture’, but we note here in
passing that ‘complex’ refers to current microwear usage.
3. Page 5, line 18 (“grit rather than hard foods”) – this binary statement is perhaps too strongly worded. If
grit is more common on some hard foods, or if there are strong interactions between grit and food
hardness, then complex textures could be the partial result of both traits operating in tandem.
We have now changed the phrase to read ‘more directly of grit rather than hard foods’ to comply with this.
The phrase is thus toned down.
4. Page 10, line 30 (“obviously to microwear textures”) – again (see point #2 above), you might say
“obviously to the surface textures that were typically classified as microwear”
We have now adopted this phraseology exactly as specified by this reviewer, writing ‘…obviously to the
surface textures that were typically classified as microwear.’
5. Page 13, line 21 (“experimentally [398]”) – citation error. I think the authors intended citation 39 here.
This was indeed an error: changed to ref. 39.
6. Page 15, lines 41-42 (“absence of…” “does not indicate the absence”) – the use of triple negative
concepts is a bit confusing to follow. Why not say, “…the absence of complex microwear is compatible with
hard foods in the diet…”
We agree and have followed this form exactly:
If, however, the absence of complex microwear is compatible with hard foods in the diet, then the premise
of Ungar and Hlusko’s [52] hypothesis disappears.’
7. Page 16, line 7 – (“show the opposite”) – better to say “demonstrates the reverse pattern”
We agree again and have followed this form exactly: ‘…but this is contradicted by experiment in humans
and capuchin monkeys that demonstrate the reverse pattern [37,38].’
8. Page 17, lines 39 & 44 (“microwear textures”) – again, I wonder if there isn’t a different word to
characterize these textures. The present model differentiates between surface textures and surface wear,
so it is awkward to retain the word microwear when referring to a non-wearing process.
Awkward though the phrase may be, we have opted to retain ‘microwear textures’ as coined in the title of
ref. 1, i.e. Scott et al. (2006), which remains a key paper in this field, initiating the study of wear marks in
three dimensions.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_13
In this paper, the authors examined the surface hardness of the metal spheres used by [12]. Based on the
nanoindentation tests, the authors reported that both the aluminum and brass spheres are harder than
enamel because of the surface oxidation of aluminum and work-hardening of brass. Finally, they concluded
that Xia et al.’s results are actually predicted by the mechanical model of Lucas et al.
However, the main results of the authors only include three figures. Among these figures, Figure 1 is the
core data which supports the authors’ main viewpoint. But the analysis of average contact pressure in
Figure 1c is flawed and invalidates the study. Given the similar indentation depths obtained by the authors
of both the rebuttal and original papers, the actual hardness of the aluminum balls measured by the authors
may be in the range from 0.67 to 2.7 GPa, which is much lower than the hardness of enamel.
We thank this reviewer for these comments. However, the reviewer does not state explicitly why the results
n Fig 1c are flawed. We agree that the resultant maximum depth of penetration for the application of the
same force bear a superficial resemblance to the study by Xia et al. as do the average contact pressures.
However, as clearly illustrated in the indentation force-displacement responses shown in Fig 1a, the
mechanical behaviour of the aluminium ball is not that expected for an elastic-plastic material and indicates
that this resemblance is due to fractures, not to plasticity. There is a series of “pop-in” fracture events
typical of the response of a brittle film on a softer elastic-plastic substrate. We show evidence that ball is
coated and, in tests where there is no obvious cracking, the mean contact pressure passes way above the
range quoted by this reviewer. In other words, the hardness of the outer (oxide) coating must actually be far
greater than that of enamel.
In answering this reviewer as fully as we can, we now show stress maps for coated aluminium balls on
enamel. The source of this is theoretical work by Dr Norbert Schwarzer (with a key paper – current ref. 29 -
now cited). Together with Nick Bierwisch, these researchers have produced extra stress maps for our
specific application. We have added a new Fig. 3 to show these. Because of the amount of work necessary
to do this, we have now invited Drs. Schwarzer and Bierwisch to join the authorship of the paper.
In detail:
…the main results of the authors only include three figures.’
We have now added another two figures, but in producing composite figures, we are hoping to keep the
space required for the paper as small as possible.
… the analysis of average contact pressure in Figure 1c is flawed and invalidates the study.’
The reviewer may be alluding here to the treatment of the tip of a sharp indenter as being blunt when
making a small radius of contact. However, such an analysis of the mean contact pressure during the initial
stages of loading, as depicted in Fig. 1b, is based upon a very simple yet robust contact mechanics
expression that has been adopted in many previous studies.
In addition, the finite element analysis on brass ball in Figure 2 shows that hard enamel surfaces yield by a
soft brass ball under high friction coefficient so that material removal of enamel would occur. Thus, this
result actually supports Xia et al’s experimental results that soft particle can abrade the hard enamel.
We thank this reviewer also for feedback regarding Fig. 2. We feel that it is apparent from these comments
that we have not sufficiently explained the basis of this figure. Firstly, this is not a finite element analysis but
rather an analytical analysis (i.e. via formulae derived from fundamental principles) for the response of a
sphere of aluminium (figure 2) and a sphere with a thin (1 micron thick) higher modulus film (figure 4) that is
oading enamel via varying normal and tangential forces. This analysis is now referenced as ref. 29.
Secondly, the analysis only considers elastic von Mises shear stresses that develop in both the ball and
enamel. Thirdly, we suggest that only with the aluminium ball and the higher modulus film do high
coefficients of friction develop: it is in this situation only that plastic yield of the metallic aluminium occurs.
Fourthly, based upon the stresses alone, we cannot state that material removal will happen. Instead, we do
argue that, based upon the outcome of the analysis for the contact pressures during loading in Figure 1
and the evident fracturing of a hard brittle layer (much harder than enamel), that this is capable of causing
removal of enamel tissue as shown by Xia et al.
Finally, most of the statements about the cause of dental microwear are misleading or false. For example,
the citations used to support the statement that hard foods are sheared do not consider microscale
movements of teeth. The statement that “microwear is somewhat flawed” because tooth shape affects
tooth guidance is incorrect. Numerous study have showed no consistent differences in microwear pattern
between unworn (sharp) and heavily worn (flatter) teeth. Also, the statement that Daegling et al did not
control for dust in the environment is false, and regarding phytoliths in shell casings, this conflicts with the
point made by Lucas et al that phytoliths cannot wear teeth. In any event, the bone samples have no
phytoliths and produce notable tissue loss.
In answer to the specific objections made in this paragraph:
For example, the citations used to support the statement that hard foods are sheared do not consider
microscale movements of teeth.
We do not understand what ‘microscale movements of teeth are’. Does this refer to movement of a tooth
within its (tight) socket? We do not know how such tiny movements can be measured. Instead, we have
offered a simple theory to explain pits vs. scratches on teeth. A particle dusted in abrasive dust or grit may
either roll (potentially producing enamel pits) or else slide (potentially abrading the enamel), dependent on
particle shape. We are advancing this as a simple explanation of basic features of worn enamel surfaces.
The statement that “microwear is somewhat flawed” because tooth shape affects tooth guidance is
ncorrect. Numerous study have showed no consistent differences in microwear pattern between unworn
(sharp) and heavily worn (flatter) teeth.
What we actually wrote was:
While occlusal relief may influence microwear patterns to some degree, insofar as the contact facets of
high crowned, crested teeth may slide past each other to a greater degree than those of rounded, bunodont
teeth, if that were to be generalized, then microwear patterns would reflect dental morphology rather than
food material properties per se, making current predictions about the causes of microwear textures
somewhat flawed.’
This long sentence has now been reset as follows:
Occlusal relief may influence microwear as, to some extent, teeth act as guides during chewing [40]. By
virtue of their shape, low cusped bunodont teeth may offer greater degrees of freedom for food and tooth
movement during mastication as compared to high crested teeth. This relationship, in primates should be
maintained throughout life because, even as teeth wear, they tend to maintain general occlusal slope
patterns [40]. If this holds true, then some portion of microwear patterning may reflect dental morphology
rather than food material properties per se. so indicating that current predictions about the causes of
microwear textures may be somewhat flawed.’
Ref. 40 here is Ungar (2015), who seems to support what we say. We have now cast part of the above
section in the language of that paper to reflect this.
…the statement that Daegling et al did not control for dust in the environment is false,…
We see no statement in that paper suggesting EDS scans for the presence of dust and its composition.
… and regarding phytoliths in shell casings, this conflicts with the point made by Lucas et al that phytoliths
cannot wear teeth.
Lucas et al. actually said that, in a single contact, phytoliths would be likely to rub enamel (i.e., not remove
enamel tissue by abrasion), so this comment is a misreading of that paper. Lucas et al. also stated
explicitly that repeated rubbing could cause tissue loss due to fatigue.
Therefore, the conclusions presented in this paper lack both experimental rigor and reliable theoretical
bases.
We hope that we have countered both these objections in the revised paper. We see no experimental flaws
and the analysis has a well-established theoretical basis, i.e., the stress maps are derived from basic
theory. Both Swain and Schwarzer, long-term leaders in the field of indentation, are coauthors. We do not
believe that this work can be dismissed lightly.

label_comment_14
I have read the article by van Casteran etal., and have to admit that I find it difficult to follow. There does
not seem to be a compelling message, and it is hard to see where the story is going. The paper is not well
constructed and not well balanced, as if different parts have been written by different authors with totally
different styles.
The Intro section is lengthy (3 1/2 pages). This section, along with the Abstract, seems to be soley fixated
on defending an earlier theory of wear by Lucas and some of his co-authors (Lucas etal), in conjunction
with an effort to discredit another paper by some other workers who have an opposing viewpoint on the role
of particulates in wear modeling. The Lucase model itself has come under scrutiny, by Rabenold and co-
workers, but these latter authors are not referenced in the current text. Recent work by Constantino on
wear processes are referenced, but not discussed.
The Materials & Methods and Results sections are, by comparison, very short (about 1 page in total) and
present very limited information, confined to the surface hardness of spheres used in wear tests. It is not
altogether clear how these last two sections are central to the ensuing discussion. The basis of the
argument that aluminum and brass spheres are much harder than bulk material because of production of
an oxide layer during sliding is not compelling to this reader, and is more directed to discrediting an
antagonistic author than confirming the Lucas theory. The images in Fig 1 are also very hard to read.
The Discussion section itself is very long (over 10 pages), contains much detailed conjecture on wear
mechanisms, and is difficult to follow. I can see how some researchers might find some of the detailed
assertions hard to accept. Again, the overall argument appears to be directed toward confirmation of the
earlier theory by Lucas etal. and refutation of their antagonists, but the message gets lost in the detail.
If it were my work, I would be inclined to present the results as a Short Communication, cutting to the quick,
because I don’t see much that is new here. Either way, if the editor does decide to accept this article, it
would require major revision.
We thank this reviewer for these comments and have taken them very seriously. We indicate our
responses in categories:
THE INTENT OF THIS PAPER: is to provide a rebuttal of the evidence presented by Xia et al. as refutation
of Lucas et al. (2013), to review experiments published in its wake that are entirely germane to this, and to
provide a simple new theory explaining how pits vs. striations may appear on enamel surfaces. The surface
hardness of the balls, produced in one case by an oxide coating and in the other by work hardening, is
crucial to how these balls interact with dental enamel. The theory isn’t mentioned by this reviewer, but is
prominent in the title and the abstract.
RABENOLD AND PEARSON: In neither the first Rabenold and Pearson critique [2014 J. Hum. Evol. 74:
130-133], nor the second by Rabenold as sole author [2017 J. Hum Evol. 102: 78-80] were any
experiments reported at all. We have replied to the first critique [2017 J. Hum. Evol. 102-75-77], but see no
real reason to answer Rabenold’s second [which is in the same journal issue as our reply, directly following
t].
CONSTANTINO et al.: We have cited Borrero-Lopez et al. (ref. 57 in the current revision), on which
Constantino is a co-author, but purely for the one point that matters to the Discussion. Ref. 57 includes
original experiments. We have not cited Constantino et al. [2016 Bioessays 89-99] here because it does
not provide original experimental data. If the latter is not the paper that this reviewer refers to, then we have
to ask which is the other one by this prolific author that should be cited. Whatever, we cannot find a
precedent in the papers of this research group for our theory.
NEW THEORY: Again, this depicts a food particle coated with isolated small abrasive particles that either
rolls (potentially producing pits) or slides (potentially producing abrasive scratches) as it crosses an enamel
surface. Though simple, this theory has to be nuanced and detailed enough to indicate that we are aware
of the statistical behaviour of food particles during oral comminution. This theory is now both in the title and
the abstract. We think that it is completely new.
LENGTH OF INTRODUCTION AND DISCUSSION COMPARED TO METHODS and RESULTS: We see
no necessary link between the relative length of these sections: simple results can require great space to
nterpret. We also introduce the stress maps and the theory in the Discussion.
OVERALL: In response to the overall assessment of the length and value of this paper, we ask this
reviewer to understand that setting out the biological context properly is crucial for a general reader to
understand the importance of this subject. That takes up space. Dental microwear is important because it is
one of two elements, the other being enamel isotopes, used to assign diet to many fossil vertebrates,
particularly fossil hominins. This is a matter of great popular and scientific interest. This journal is
appropriate for it because it has broad readership. It is a very controversial field largely because of its
current importance in understanding hominin evolution. Our aim here is not to discredit ‘other authors’. We
ntend to publish a refutation of an ill-thought out experiment that is being widely-cited as refuting Lucas et
al. (2013) and to introduce a theory that explains basic textural patterns on worn teeth.
WRITING STYLE: Six co-authors contributed to the writing of this paper. We have endeavoured now to
even out the writing style differences, but have failed to see exactly where the difficulties lie.
FIGURE 1: We have enlarged the lettering on the approximate percentage of elements present. Is this
what reviewer 3 was referring to? Whatever, we feel that the ability to zoom in on interesting features
produces much more flexibility in online publications as compared to papers in hardcopy journals. That
said, we hope that the features of each figure, including the new ones, are visible.
Yours sincerely,
Peter Lucas

There still remains a substantial difference in viewpoint by the reviewers, with one reviewer recommending
publication and the other suggesting that major issues remain. I have not heard back from the third
reviewer, but in fairness to the authors to move forward, I am sending the manuscript back for revision.
Reviewer 2 says that there are a number of inaccuracies, and documents two. I would suggest addressing
these two items, and scouring the manuscript—as reasonably as possible—for any other potential issues.
Thank you very much for these comments. We realize that this must be a difficult editorial decision, given
the stance that Reviewer 2 now takes. We note big differences between the first review by this reviewer
and the following one. We answered all previous comments. The new review implies in a hidden manner
that there is much more wrong with the paper than the new comments indicate. However, we cannot
answer criticisms that are unsaid.

This resubmission does not meet today’s professional standards of the Royal Society. The paper itself has
a number of inaccuracies that show at best, sloppiness, to support a disproven model. I provide two
examples:
We answer these two examples here, finding neither of these to be addressing sloppiness nor lack of
professional standards.
1. Analysis: The authors used an incorrect method to evaluate the hardness of the aluminum balls in
Figure 1c.
The spherical approximation that we employ has been known for a long time, being used prominently by
Johnson (1985) in what is probably the most famous book on contact mechanics [cited >18,000 times
according to Google Scholar]. We now cite this reference in support. The depth range to which this
approximation can be applied has been examined closely in two papers: Bei et al. 2005 and Ma & Levine
2007, both of which we now cite. These papers measured the tips to produce descriptors that were unique
to that tip and its particular stage of wear. Unfortunately, they concentrated on subsurface shear stresses
with findings that run in opposite directions (as indicated in the manuscript and in the excerpt from it below)
and ignored contact pressure. However, to a depth of 10 nm, the spherical approximation is very accurate.
Since the average pressure in all our curves exceeded 5 GPa within 5 nm of indentation, there seems little
doubt to us that the oxide is harder than enamel. Beyond this range, the approximation can still be applied
to indenter penetration depths of up to half the radius of the tip. We do not believe that any inaccuracy is
such to invalidate our conclusion that the oxide hardness must be >10 GPa.
It is unclear why the authors did not give the actual hardness of the system.
This is because there was minimal indication of plastic deformation prior to the pop-in event. Hardness is
resistance to plastic indentation. Since deformation prior to pop-in was largely elastic, we could not give a
definitive value for this (but it is certainly much harder than dental enamel). We now cite a key paper on thin
brittle oxide films (Kramer et al. 2009), indicating that a fracture mechanics approach is needed to
understand this properly. Even that analysis does not seem to include the residual stresses in such films. It
s a very complex subject, lying way beyond our aims here.
We now write in the Discussion:
‘The approximation of the rounded Berkovich indenter tip to a partial sphere is very accurate at shallow depths.
Attempts to define the shapes of worn tips more precisely have produced contrasting results: one group [27]
found that a spherical approximation slightly underestimated the subsurface resolved shear stresses while the
other [28] states that it produces a slight overestimate. Clearly, each tip might be unique in form. However,
neither paper [27,28] deals with the issue of contact pressure versus depth, which is our focus. Further, neither
had to consider an oxide film [29]. Such a film increases the load needed to initiate dislocation motion and pop-
in associated with oxide film fracture [30]. Problems, particularly with the issue of residual stresses in these
films, remain unresolved.’
The authors showed the stresses produced in enamel by an aluminium ball without an oxide film and with a
1 µm oxide film in Figure 3. How did the authors determine actual thickness of oxide film coated on the
aluminium ball?
The film is very thin, even absent in some places, uneven and with sharp asperities. Thus, an exact
thickness can’t be given. The one-micron thickness given in the stress analysis is thus arbitrary. However,
the importance of the theoretical analysis that we present is that it is based on first principles. Thus, it is
generalizable and can be used in predictions. In contrast, finite elements are particular, being unique to
each usage. If there is concern that an oxide film was not present on the aluminium balls used by Xia et al.,
then we refer the reviewer to the spectra of their Fig. S1 which clearly show oxygen presence.
2. Interpretation: The demonstration that crushing occurs with transverse motion relative to the occlusal
plane does not invalidate the association between pitting and crushing – it confirms it. Because mammals
are anisognathous, most have a large transverse component to slow close. This explains why phase II
wear facets are positioned on the sides of facets rather than on their tips. Indeed, the inclination (i.e., strike
and dip) of phase II wear facets has been studied for nearly a century and related to occlusal/masticatory
dynamics in countless publications by Simpson, Butler, Mills, Crompton, Hiiemae, Kay, etc etc etc. The
nclination of a typical bunodont primate’s phase II facets requires transverse excursion of the jaw just as
observed for opposing wear surfaces to align in crushing.
This is an interesting précis of a lot of old work on the contacts between teeth in the upper and lower jaws
of mammals. We have studied that literature: for example, Hiiemae was PWL’s original thesis supervisor;
Butler was a thesis examiner, and he has met all those named except Simpson. As impressive as the
mention of countless publications must sound, that literature has nothing to do with the paper that we have
submitted. Predating 1975, it mentions neither foods and their properties nor the behaviour of individual
food particles in the mouth at all. Research that does deal with food in this way dates only from the 1980’s.
So we fail to see where the above is going in relation to what we write. The important point is that teeth
guide food particles, but do not control their movements. For example, isodiametric food particles can
rotate between teeth. None of the above literature says, or could say, anything about that and thus the
above comment in no way contradicts what we write. Moreover, the key dental microwear literature
addressed by this paper specifically associates pitting with more vertical jaw movements, and scratches
with more transverse movements. We are not contradicting any of the above.
These examples demonstrate a lack of knowledge of fundamental principles of engineering and biology
that are disturbing in light of the accomplishments of the authors. In any event, these fundamental flaws
nvalidate the conclusions of this paper -- I do not believe this work warrants publication unless and until
they are addressed.
We cannot concur with this assessment and are concerned that the reviewer has “shifted the goalposts”
significantly between the first and second review.
