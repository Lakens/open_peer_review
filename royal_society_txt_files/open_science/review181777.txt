My thanks to the Editor and the Authors for the opportunity to review the present paper.
Social learning theory has grown dramatically in recent years. One focus has been its underlying
cognitive mechanisms. The submitted paper explores how social learning phenomena can be
explained by a combination of genetic predispositions and associative learning. The Authors
introduce a simple model to formalise associative learning of (social, non-social, or a mix of both)
stimuli that covers a surprising range of social learning terms. I find the paper compelling. Just as
minimal neural networks give an idea of how complex a mechanism has to be to solve a given
problem, the present model gives insight into the minimal requirements for solving a given social
learning situation. Some specific comments follow, most of which are minor.
1. ll. 53–56 While I generally agree with the statement, it appears to be a bit too general. Copying
the majority, for example, can be seen as social learning but does not require the majority to be
experienced (e.g. mate-choice copying in Drosophila). Social learning can also be useful for
updating information (e.g. waggle dance communication in honey bees).
2. l. 100 “… if a sequence of behavior is considered rather than a single a response.”: Is this
sentence supposed to end with “behavior”?
3. l. 257 Doesn’t the stimulus-response association approach 25 in figure 1?
4. ll. 277–278 “Somewhat surprisingly, the model predicts that animals with smaller behavioral
repertoires are more likely to learn to imitate.”: Where is this shown?
5. Following l. 315 eq. (9) refers to the non-social stimulus as S_X, whereas in the text above and
below it seems to be referred to as X only. Is there a difference between the two? Personally, S_X
might be the better option for a non-social stimulus as it follows the nomenclature of S_social.
Maybe it is worth changing it in the rest of the manuscript.
6. l. 371 “… sequences of l behaviours.”: Should this be “of length l”?
7. l. 441 “sequence backwards by starting at S_n” If the sequence started from the end should it
then start with S_l?
8. l. 454 “simulations such as the one in 5 can be conducted.” Should that be a reference to section
3.5?

Review of RSOS-181777
This paper describes a model for associative learning taking into account various mechanisms
and sequences of behaviours and stimuli from a social perspective. I think the writing was
fantastic and have very few comments. My one confusion by the end of it was the applicability or
usefulness of the model for those of us that study learning. The models were created and run,
giving a nice overview of expectations I guess under certain learning scenarios. However I think
that the purpose of the models were a little bit muddled by so much discussion. I would just
suggest to make the aim of the model, and its potential applicability to future studies much more
clear throughout the paper. In other words, why bother doing this, or why should others bother
thinking about it? Can it help us just to understand? Or does it give us a really nice theoretical
framework in which to interpret our own experimental results? (I would suggest both). I think
just reinforcing the value of this computation model and its potential to help reserchers analyse,
interpret and discuss their own work in context would help the paper reach its full potential.
Other than this, I think it’s wonderful work and I really appreciate the effort that has gone into
this!
Minor comments
Line 25 – I’m not sure what you mean by acquiring “productive behaviour” – is there another
way to describe what you are trying to say? Can you clarify?
Line 26 – One of the major benefits of social learning is reducing individual risk (rather than, say,
energy expenditure). I’d suggest mentioning this here.
Line 29 – You should probably provide a short definition of what you mean by traditions and/or
culture here, considering you’re just trying to introduce the whole topic your terms need to be
very clearly defined.
Lines 64-65 – You say “as a benchmark” twice in the sentence.
Line 59 (and elsewhere) – Can you just define the aim of your model a little bit more? Your title
implies it will be computational, will it therefore be predictive or simply explanatory? Do you
hope it will be used by others as a framework in which to analyse their own data or experiments?
4
What are you hoping is the outcome from introducing this model, how will this model serve the
field specifically? Just a bit more here would be great.
Line 100 – Remove “a” before the word response.
Line 167 – This is great, a really important feature allowing for individual actions to reinforce (or
not) particular learned behaviours.
Line 637 – I would say that there is an exception to this rule in birdsong: most studies have used
production imitation as the explanatory process of learning to sing (either through active tutoring
or eavesdropping, or even copying non-biotic sounds somehow, such as in Superb lyrebirds or
mockingbirds). It is thus widespread in passerines in this particular context (although they need a
complex set of brain structures and a highly developed auditory and vocalization pathway for
this) – the sequences are based on auditory memories (but take a lot of self-reinforcement). I
would probably mention this because song is not mentioned much in this paper yet this is a
major theme for some of us that study learning and cognition. It’s an interesting one because
while there is a reward, this reward only comes after a very long time, once the energy has been
put in (for months or years sometimes) of imitation and production. The motivations are still very
unclear, but thought to have a genetic component.

This is another in a great series of papers showing how certain behaviours that are thought to
require specialized and/or complex cognitive mechanisms can be produced via associative
learning. I really enjoyed reading the paper, and thought you did an excellent job of showing
how your model could account for many different kinds of social learning in a clear and
accessible way.
One (very) minor but valuable point that needs to be made over and over is that the "deep
5
learning" that is so fashionable at the moment, and which is seen as 'revolutionary' is, as you
point out, good old fashioned associative learning (albeit with a great deal of opacity in terms of
working out what exactly has been learned).
Overall, and this is something that rarely happens, I can think of no suggestions for
improvement, as the paper makes its case clearly, and well and will make a valuable and
important contribution to the social learning literature, and to the field of animal cognition in
general.

2.1 Major points
• Social learning theory has grown dramatically in recent years. One focus
has been its underlying cognitive mechanisms. The submitted paper ex-
plores how social learning phenomena can be explained by a combination
of genetic predispositions and associative learning. The Authors introduce
a simple model to formalise associative learning of (social, nonsocial, or
a mix of both) stimuli that covers a surprising range of social learning
terms. I nd the paper compelling. Just as minimal neural networks give
an idea of how complex a mechanism has to be to solve a given problem,
the present model gives insight into the minimal requirements for solving
a given social learning situation. Some specic comments follow, most of
which are minor.
2.2 Detailed comments
1. ll. 5356 While I generally agree with the statement, it appears to be a bit
too general. Copying the majority, for example, can be seen as social learn-
ing but does not require the majority to be experienced (e.g. matechoice
copying in Drosophila). Social learning can also be useful for updating
information (e.g. waggle dance communication in honey bees).
To avoid misunderstandings we omitted all, and changed logic to adap-
tive value. The changed sentence now reads: This diversity notwith-
standing, the adaptive value of social learning is that inexperienced indi-
viduals can learn to behave more eciently by using social information
from experienced individuals. .
2. l. 100 ... if a sequence of behavior is considered rather than a single a
response.: Is this sentence supposed to end with behavior?
No, here we have used response instead of a behavior. But, the sen-
tenced contained an extra a making it strange. The extra a has been
omitted.
3. l. 257 Doesn't the stimulusresponse association approach 25 in gure 1?
This is correct, thank you for pointing this out. The text has been changed
and 10 was replaced with 25. We checked the scripts in supplementary
information, and they were correct and consistent with text and gures in
the ms.
4. ll. 277278 Somewhat surprisingly, the model predicts that animals with
smaller behavioral repertoires are more likely to learn to imitate.: Where
is this shown?
2
This is a good point. We haven't elaborated on this, but it is a conse-
quence of the model in that animals have repertoires of dierent sizes and
that animals explore new situations probabilistically using their behavior
repertoire. We elaborate on the combinatoric argument in Learning a be-
havior sequence (line 371). To make this point less obscure we have added
the following sentence to this part: In fact, all else being equal,the like-
lihood that an individual will learn to use the same behavior as another
is greater in species with a smaller repertoire, simply because there are
fewer behaviors to choose from (see also 3.4 for discussion on combinatorial
matters).
5. following l. 315 eq. (9) refers to the nonsocial stimulus as S_X, whereas
in the text above and below it seems to be referred to as X only. Is there
a dierence between the two? Personally, S_X might be the better option
for a nonsocial stimulus as it follows the nomenclature of S_social. Maybe
it is worth changing it in the rest of the manuscript.
Thanks for pointing this out, we have changed throughout in accordance
with the suggestion. Now non-social stimuli are always referred to as
Sx (and e.g. Sy ). We have also changed this in the gures.
6. l. 371 ... sequences of l behaviours.: Should this be of length l?
Yes, thanks for correcting this. We changed this so it now reads: An ani-
mal with a repertoire of n behaviors, for example, can try out nl behavior
sequences of length l.
7. l. 441 sequence backwards by starting at S_n If the sequence started
from the end should it then start with S_l?
Thanks again for nding this incorrect detail, we have changed to the
correct Sl .
8. l. 454 simulations such as the one in 5 can be conducted. Should that be
a reference to section 3.5?
Thanks for pointing this out, we had missed the word gure. It now
reads as the one in gure 5 can be conducted.

muddled by so much discussion. I would just suggest to make the aim of
the model, and its potential applicability to future studies much more clear
throughout the paper. In other words, why bother doing this, or why should
others bother thinking about it? Can it help us just to understand? Or
does it give us a really nice theoretical framework in which to interpret our
own experimental results? (I would suggest both). I think just reinforcing
the value of this computation model and its potential to help reserchers
analyse, interpret and discuss their own work in context would help the
paper reach its full potential. Other than this, I think it's wonderful work
and I really appreciate the eort that has gone into this!
We thank the reviewer for the comments. We agree that there is a lot of
discussion of dierent aspects of social learning in our manuscript. Our
attempt was to focus on a few cases that have some general applications,
going from simpler to more complex cases. We are of course all for  re-
inforcing the value of this computation model and its potential to help
reserchers analyse, interpret and discuss their own work in context would
help the paper reach its full potential.. In response to this request by re-
viewer 2, and to emphasize and clarify the potential applicability of our
ms, we have added the following to the abstract. Simulations were per-
formed using a new learning simulator program. The simulator is publicly
available and can be used for further theoretical investigations, and to
guide empirical research of learning and behavior. We hope these sen-
tences together with the end of the abstract better showcase the scope
and applicability of the ms.
3.2 Minor comments
1. Line 25  I'm not sure what you mean by acquiring productive behaviour
 is there another way to describe what you are trying to say? Can you
clarify?
To avoid misunderstandings we have claried this and changed this part
to: At the individual level, social learning helps naïve individuals acquire
information from more experienced individuals resulting in behaviors that
have positive outcomes or results in avoidance of negative ones. This saves
time and energy and reduces individual risk, ultimately enhancing survival
and reproduction.
2. Line 26  One of the major benets of social learning is reducing individual
risk (rather than, say, energy expenditure). I'd suggest mentioning this
here.
We added reducing individual risk to this sentence. This part now reads:
thereby saving time and energy, and reducing individual risk, ultimately
enhancing survival and reproduction.

3. Line 29  You should probably provide a short denition of what you mean
by traditions and/or culture here, considering you're just trying to intro-
duce the whole topic your terms need to be very clearly dened.
We claried this by adding a citation that delves into the details and de-
nitions of traditions and cultures. In the text, after mentioning traditions,
we added (sensu Galef, 1992). This citation points to the paper The
question of animal culture (Human Nature, 1992, 3(2), 157-178).
4. Lines 6465  You say as a benchmark twice in the sentence.
Thanks for this correction.
5. Line 59 (and elsewhere)  Can you just dene the aim of your model a
little bit more? Your title implies it will be computational, will it therefore
be predictive or simply explanatory? Do you hope it will be used by others
as a framework in which to analyse their own data or experiments? What
are you hoping is the outcome from introducing this model, how will this
model serve the eld specically? Just a bit more here would be great.
As mentioned above, we expanded the abstract pointing out that we think
our model can be used both for future theoretical research and as a guide
for empirical tests of animal behavior. We do specify that our aim is to
see if our model can account for social learning phenomena in animals
(line 60-62). But, to better introduce our model and its scope, we added
the following to the text: This model, closely related to optimization
algorithms in machine learning, can learn optimal behavior in ecologically
relevant circumstances. This model has previously been shown capable of
producing 'intelligent' behavior, such as tool use, self-control, and planning
(Enquist et al. 2016, Lind 2018).
6. Line 100  Remove a before the word response.
The a was omitted, thanks.
7. Line 167  This is great, a really important feature allowing for individual
actions to reinforce (or not) particular learned behaviours.
Thank you!
8. Line 637  I would say that there is an exception to this rule in birdsong:
most studies have used production imitation as the explanatory process
of learning to sing (either through active tutoring or eavesdropping, or
even copying nonbiotic sounds somehow, such as in Superb lyrebirds or
mockingbirds). It is thus widespread in passerines in this particular context
(although they need a complex set of brain structures and a highly developed
auditory and vocalization pathway for this)  the sequences are based on
auditory memories (but take a lot of selfreinforcement). I would probably
mention this because song is not mentioned much in this paper yet this
is a major theme for some of us that study learning and cognition. It's
an interesting one because while there is a reward, this reward only comes
5
after a very long time, once the energy has been put in (for months or
years sometimes) of imitation and production. The motivations are still
very unclear, but thought to have a genetic component.
This is an interesting question raised by reviewer 2. Luckily, when we
explored memory for stimulus sequences in Ghirlanda, Lind, & Enquist
(2017, also in Royal Society Open Science) we also found data for song-
birds (including starlings that are capable of imitating sounds). All stud-
ies available suggests that there seems to be no fundamental dierences
between how songbirds (capable of song learning and vocal imitation) rec-
ognize and remember sequences of arbitrary stimuli in comparison with
other birds (e.g. pigeons) and mammals (e.g. rats, dogs, and macaques).
This means that although imitation is common in some birds (such as
starlings), it cannot develop through production imitation because pro-
duction imitation requires faithful memory of stimulus sequences, which
is something that appears to be absent in all nonhuman animals that so
far have been tested.
However, we do agree that song learning is an important aspect of social
learning, and importantly song learning contains important aspects of ge-
netic specializations for social input. For this reason we end the ms with
pointing out the importance of song learning as an example of social learn-
ing that is beyond the scope of our model. A part of the nal paragraph
reads:
we concur with Heyes (2012) that the suggestion that social learning is
mediated by associative processes does not imply that all learning is as-
sociative. In non-human animals, exceptions exist in systems with strong
genetic support, such as in song learning in hummingbirds, passerines, and
parrots (Catchpole and Slater 2003).
Thanks also to reviewer 2 for pointing this out, because it lead us to
correct the citation for bird song. It should of course be Catchpole and
Slater 2003, not Janik and Slater 1997.
4 Reviewer 3
4.1 Major points
• This is another in a great series of papers showing how certain behaviours
that are thought to require specialized and/or complex cognitive mecha-
nisms can be produced via associative learning. I really enjoyed reading
the paper, and thought you did an excellent job of showing how your model
could account for many dierent kinds of social learning in a clear and
accessible way. One (very) minor but valuable point that needs to be made
over and over is that the "deep learning" that is so fashionable at the mo-
ment, and which is seen as 'revolutionary' is, as you point out, good old
fashioned associative learning (albeit with a great deal of opacity in terms
6
of working out what exactly has been learned). Overall, and this is some-
thing that rarely happens, I can think of no suggestions for improvement,
as the paper makes its case clearly, and well and will make a valuable and
important contribution to the social learning literature, and to the eld of
animal cognition in general.
We would like to thank reviewer 3 for these kind comments. In response
to the deep learning comment, we changed a sentence in the nal para-
graph of the Introduction to connect with this literature. This sentence
now reads: This model, closely related to optimization algorithms in
machine learning that are commonly used in for example deep learning
studies (Goodfellow et al. 2016), can learn optimal behavior in ecologically
relevant circumstances.
