Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
In this manuscript, Chang and Lai retrieved and the bHLH sequences from the transcriptomic
data sets of 126 crustaceans from public databases, and assigned the orthology based on gene tree
construction. The authors then further investigated the bHLH genes in three decapod crustacean
genomes. Below are my concerns and suggestions, which hopefully can improve the manuscript.
Major:
1) A major concern I perceived is that the authors have been making claims, interpretations, and
drawing implications based on the available transcriptomic data sets downloaded from the
public databases. Given 1) different organs/tissues at different physiological status/treatments
will have significant different expression of transcripts, 2) the sequencing depth for the
transcriptomes are probably non-uniform (some are sequenced much more in depth than the
others), and 3) biases could easily be included to some groups of crustaceans if they have more
transcriptomes being deposited to the public database (i.e. analysed in this study); thus, 1+2
simply mean that the absence of revealing certain bHLH genes are probably inconclusive, and 3
also makes the counting of number of bHLH genes in different groups an unfair comparison
given the uneven distribution. When they sum up, it makes all the claims a bit weak for this
study.
I suggest the authors should: 1) taking the considerations mentioned above to normalise the
graph shown in Figure 1A, and to add potential error bars or at least including the number of
transcriptomes being analysed as shown in Figure 1B. ii) table out the details of the
transcriptomes being used in the study as supplementary information so that the readers can get
a better estimation (data size, tissue, and any additional relevant information such as
physiological status/treatments, etc). iii) these limitations should also be mentioned in the
abstract, conclusion, and bring up in the discussion.
2) The authors have investigated three decapod genomes in more details (i.e. shrimp Litopenaeus
vannamei, crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus and crab Scylla olivacea). In the materials and
methods, I could not find how the authors have retrieved the sequences from. If these genomes
have been published, they should cite the references in the manuscript. If they have not been
published, have they already seek the permissions of those who own the genome(s) for
publishing this part of work?
In addition, there are also many new crustacean genomes published these days. The authors
should also investigate the bHLH genes in them in order to strengthen the different claims in this
study (e.g. numbers in different groups and lineage-specific duplications) in this study.
3) In addition to constructing the ML tree, the authors should also use other methods (e.g.
Bayesian Inference) to test the robustness of different supports.
Minor:
1) p.2, line 12, it is untrue that "Yet, relatively little is known about bHLHs in nonmodel species,
particularly in.... i.e. crustaceans". According to my understanding, there are many excellent
studies annotating the bHLH genes in metazoans, including in study carried on crustaceans more
3
than a decade ago (e.g. Simionato et al 2007). The authors have also cited this reference but only
briefly mentioned its works on sponge (p.6, line 34). The authors should indeed expand the
background for inclusion of different works that have been carried out on bHLH genes in
metazoans, especially those carried out in crustaceans. This will give the readers a better
understanding of the field.
2) p.4, line 40, orthologues than orthologs (since this is a British journal)
3) Figure 3, should probably remake the current figure and only show the strong support values
on nodes. The current version of the figure can go to the supplementary file so that readers can
refer to it if they prefer.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In this manuscript, the authors describe a large-scale analysis of basic-Helix-Loop-helix (bHLH)
transcription factors in crustaceans. They identified bHLH-encoding genes in a large number of
crustacean species using existing transcriptomic and genomic data, performed phylogenetic
analyses of the identified bHLHs in three Decapoda species, and analyzed in details one subclass
of bHLH proteins, those in which the bHLH domain is associated to another domain called "PAS
domain". This is a well designed and conducted study; the methods used are appropriate; the
results obtained are interesting both for people interested by crustacean genomics and people
interested by bHLH evolution. I have a few comments/suggestions:
- it would be very useful to have a figure that shows the current consensual view of the
crustacean phylogenetic tree indicating for the main groups of crustaceans the number of species
for which transcriptome and/or genome data have been used to identify the bHLH genes;
- please try to avoid the use of "lower order crustaceans" - in evolutionary terms, "lower" doesn't
mean anything;
4
- what was not clear for me when reading the manuscript is whether only transcriptome data
have been used or whether some full genome sequence data have been used too for the few
species for which this data are available (some published; some not necessarily published, but
already available using for example the i5k portal). if not already included, I could be important
to do so as transcriptome data might be less complete than genomic data;
- it's a pity that detailed phylogenetic analyses have been performed only on three Decapoda
species - I of course understand that the authors didn't want to do these analyses for many
species, but I would strongly urge the authors to do it on a few additional species that belong to
other large groups of crustaceans (at least a Branchiopoda and a Copepoda). This could provide
some additional insights on the evolution of bHLH genes in crustaceans, for example about the
evolution of group D and F bHLHs.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr David Ferrier):
Both expert reviewers think that this is a valuable manuscript, but that revisions should be made
in order to properly realise the aims of the work. In particular, it is necessary to clarify some of
the methodology, improve the sampling from whole genome sequences, and strengthen the
phylogeny and classification of the genes.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr David Ferrier):
Associate Editor: 1
Comments to the Author:
The reviewer correctly points out that there are a number of whole genome sequences now
available for crustaceans and that analysis of at least some of these sequences would clearly
strengthen the current manuscript. Since the current manuscript is a worthwhile new
contribution to our understanding of bHLH gene evolution, however, I see two possible
acceptable ways forward. First, the authors could choose to include an analysis of several
crustacean genomes (as both referees have suggested previously), to make this manuscript as
strong as possible. Alternatively, a second option that would cater for the authors not being in a
position to carry out these extra analyses would be to make a minor revision to the text to
12
highlight that the current analyses are almost entirely focused on crustacean transcriptome data
and so there is a clear requirement for future work to survey whole genome sequences.
The comment that the authors inserted into the abstract in their first revision, about overcoming
limitations associated with transcriptome mining, is not really justified since their analyses lack
crustacean genome data except for Parhyale hawaiensis. Instead the abstract should be focused
on the fact that the authors have produced an extensive analysis of crustacean transcriptome
data, and then the conclusion can include a clear comment about the future need for whole
genome sequence analyses to overcome the limitations of transcriptome mining.

made in order to properly realise the aims of the work. In particular, it is necessary to clarify
some of the methodology, improve the sampling from whole genome sequences, and
strengthen the phylogeny and classification of the genes.
We thank Prof. Ferrier for his positive comments on our manuscript. We have now addressed
all comments from the reviewers, which have helped improve the quality of our work.

Comments to the Author(s)
In this manuscript, Chang and Lai retrieved and the bHLH sequences from the transcriptomic
data sets of 126 crustaceans from public databases, and assigned the orthology based on
gene tree construction. The authors then further investigated the bHLH genes in three
decapod crustacean genomes. Below are my concerns and suggestions, which hopefully can
improve the manuscript.
Major:
1) A major concern I perceived is that the authors have been making claims, interpretations,
and drawing implications based on the available transcriptomic data sets downloaded from
the public databases. Given 1) different organs/tissues at different physiological
status/treatments will have significant different expression of transcripts, 2) the sequencing
depth for the transcriptomes are probably non-uniform (some are sequenced much more in
depth than the others), and 3) biases could easily be included to some groups of crustaceans
if they have more transcriptomes being deposited to the public database (i.e. analysed in this
study); thus, 1+2 simply mean that the absence of revealing certain bHLH genes are probably
inconclusive, and 3 also makes the counting of number of bHLH genes in different groups an
unfair comparison given the uneven distribution. When they sum up, it makes all the claims a
bit weak for this study.
I suggest the authors should: 1) taking the considerations mentioned above to normalise the
graph shown in Figure 1A, and to add potential error bars or at least including the number of
transcriptomes being analysed as shown in Figure 1B.
We thank Reviewer 1 for his/her comments to help improve the manuscript.
As per the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now included details on the number of
transcriptomes being analysed for each taxon in parentheses. With this addition, we hope that
readers could appreciate the uneven distribution on the number of transcriptomes used in this
study. We have used jittered points to represent the absolute number of bHLH genes identified
from each species, with box plot overlays representing information about the median, range
and quartiles for each taxon and violin plots illustrating sample distribution and kernel
probability density (proportion of data located in a given area) for each taxon. We believe that
by using a box-violin plot combination, this would help readers appreciate the differences in
bHLH gene count within each species and their distribution across taxa. For instance, one can
immediately recognise the outliers from the graph, Paracyclopina nana and Daphnia magna
(marked with red arrows), that possess above average bHLH gene numbers.
ii) table out the details of the transcriptomes being used in the study as supplementary
information so that the readers can get a better estimation (data size, tissue, and any
additional relevant information such as physiological status/treatments, etc).
We couldn’t agree more with the reviewer’s suggestion on providing further information on the
data size and sample type for the transcriptomes used in this study. We have updated
Supplementary table 1 to include the number of sequences/transcripts for each transcriptome
and other relevant information such as tissue/sample type and references. We have also
highlighted the data type (transcriptome or genome) in the table.
iii) these limitations should also be mentioned in the abstract, conclusion, and bring up in the
discussion.
Indeed, we agree that it is important to highlight the potential caveats associated with
transcriptome mining in the main text. We have made the appropriate edits in the main text as
per Reviewer 1’s suggestion.
2) The authors have investigated three decapod genomes in more details (i.e. shrimp
Litopenaeus vannamei, crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus and crab Scylla olivacea). In the
materials and methods, I could not find how the authors have retrieved the sequences from.
If these genomes have been published, they should cite the references in the manuscript. If
they have not been published, have they already seek the permissions of those who own the
genome(s) for publishing this part of work?
We thank Reviewer 1 for raising this point. The transcriptome datasets used in this study are
publically available on the European Nucleotide Archive (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena). We have
listed the accession numbers in Supplementary table 1 and have cited the appropriate
references in the table.
In addition, there are also many new crustacean genomes published these days. The authors
should also investigate the bHLH genes in them in order to strengthen the different claims in
this study (e.g. numbers in different groups and lineage-specific duplications) in this study.
We thank Reviewer 1 for the comment. Indeed, we agree that our analysis should also include
complete genomes, which we have already performed. We understand that this may not be
apparent in the current manuscript and have now highlighted analyses on whole genomes in
the main text. In summary, we have included 7 genomes in this work; the number of bHLH
genes identified are listed in parentheses: Parhyale hawaiensis (57 bHLH genes), Ixodes
scapularis (43 bHLH genes), Anopheles gambiae (44 bHLH genes), Aedes aegypti (53 bHLH
genes), Strigamia maritima (55 bHLH genes), Mesobuthus martensii (63 bHLH genes) and
Drosophila melanogaster (78 bHLH genes). Complete fasta sequences are also included in
Supplementary file 1. Given that the number of bHLH genes identified from whole genome
range from 43 to 78 (with an average of 56 genes), we have therefore hypothesised that the
high number of bHLH genes in Daphnia magna and Paracyclopina nana could have possibly
arisen from lineage-specific duplication events rather than being an ancestral feature of
arthropods. We have updated the main text to include this observation.
3) In addition to constructing the ML tree, the authors should also use other methods (e.g.
Bayesian Inference) to test the robustness of different supports.
We agree with Reviewer 1. In addition to the Maximum Likelihood trees in the main figures,
we have now included Bayesian Inference trees as Supplementary figures 1, 2, 3 and 5.
Overall, the topologies are well supported using Bayesian and maximum likelihood
approaches.
Minor:
1) p.2, line 12, it is untrue that "Yet, relatively little is known about bHLHs in nonmodel species,
particularly in.... i.e. crustaceans". According to my understanding, there are many excellent
studies annotating the bHLH genes in metazoans, including in study carried on crustaceans
more than a decade ago (e.g. Simionato et al 2007). The authors have also cited this reference
but only briefly mentioned its works on sponge (p.6, line 34). The authors should indeed
expand the background for inclusion of different works that have been carried out on bHLH
genes in metazoans, especially those carried out in crustaceans. This will give the readers a
better understanding of the field.
We thank Reviewer 1 for the comments and agree that the background should include
descriptions on previous studies looking at bHLH genes in metazoans and crustaceans. We
have updated the main text accordingly.
2) p.4, line 40, orthologues than orthologs (since this is a British journal)
We have changed orthologs to orthologues.
3) Figure 3, should probably remake the current figure and only show the strong support
values on nodes. The current version of the figure can go to the supplementary file so that
readers can refer to it if they prefer.
We have recreated Figure 3 to only include strong support values on nodes (>0.7) and have
put the initial version as Supplementary Figure 4.

Comments to the Author(s)
In this manuscript, the authors describe a large-scale analysis of basic-Helix-Loop-helix
(bHLH) transcription factors in crustaceans. They identified bHLH-encoding genes in a large
number of crustacean species using existing transcriptomic and genomic data, performed
phylogenetic analyses of the identified bHLHs in three Decapoda species, and analyzed in
details one subclass of bHLH proteins, those in which the bHLH domain is associated to
another domain called "PAS domain". This is a well designed and conducted study; the
methods used are appropriate; the results obtained are interesting both for people interested
by crustacean genomics and people interested by bHLH evolution. I have a few
comments/suggestions:
We thank Reviewer 2 for his/her positive comments on our work.
- it would be very useful to have a figure that shows the current consensual view of the
crustacean phylogenetic tree indicating for the main groups of crustaceans the number of
species for which transcriptome and/or genome data have been used to identify the bHLH
genes;
We agree with Reviewer 2. We have included a figure (Figure 1A) illustrating the phylogenetic
relationship of Crustacea inferred from a study by Regier and colleagues
(doi:10.1038/nature08742). As per the reviewer’s comment, we have also included the
number of species used in parentheses.
- please try to avoid the use of "lower order crustaceans" - in evolutionary terms,
"lower" doesn't mean anything;
We have remove this terminology and have replaced it with the appropriate term basal
crustaceans referring to branchiopods and copepods.
- what was not clear for me when reading the manuscript is whether only transcriptome data
have been used or whether some full genome sequence data have been used too for the few
species for which this data are available (some published; some not necessarily published,
but already available using for example the i5k portal). if not already included, I could be
important to do so as transcriptome data might be less complete than genomic data;
We agree that our analyses on 7 whole genomes (please refer to response to Reviewer 1)
isn’t apparent in the current manuscript. We have now highlighted this in the main text.
- it's a pity that detailed phylogenetic analyses have been performed only on three Decapoda
species - I of course understand that the authors didn't want to do these analyses for many
species, but I would strongly urge the authors to do it on a few additional species that belong
to other large groups of crustaceans (at least a Branchiopoda and a Copepoda). This could
provide some additional insights on the evolution of bHLH genes in crustaceans, for example
about the evolution of group D and F bHLHs.
We agree that it may be important to include phylogenetic analyses on additional crustacean
taxa. As per the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now included analyses (Bayesian and
Maximum Likelihood) on Daphnia magna (Branchiopoda) and Paracyclopina nana
(Copepoda) as a supplementary figure and have updated the main text.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr David Ferrier):
The reviewer correctly points out that there are a number of whole genome sequences now available for
crustaceans and that analysis of at least some of these sequences would clearly strengthen the current
manuscript. Since the current manuscript is a worthwhile new contribution to our understanding of bHLH
gene evolution, however, I see two possible acceptable ways forward. First, the authors could choose to
include an analysis of several crustacean genomes (as both referees have suggested previously), to
make this manuscript as strong as possible.
Alternatively, a second option that would cater for the authors not being in a position to carry out these
extra analyses would be to make a minor revision to the text to highlight that the current analyses are
almost entirely focused on crustacean transcriptome data and so there is a clear requirement for future
work to survey whole genome sequences.
The comment that the authors inserted into the abstract in their first revision, about overcoming
limitations associated with transcriptome mining, is not really justified since their analyses lack
crustacean genome data except for Parhyale hawaiensis. Instead the abstract should be focused on the
fact that the authors have produced an extensive analysis of crustacean transcriptome data, and then
the conclusion can include a clear comment about the future need for whole genome sequence analyses
to overcome the limitations of transcriptome mining.
We thank Prof. Ferrier for his comments. We have now updated the abstract to further emphasise that
our analysis is focused on transcriptome data sets and highlight the need for future analyses on whole
genome sequences.
