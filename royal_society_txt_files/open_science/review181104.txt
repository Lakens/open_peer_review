In this manuscript, the authors focus on the decomposition mechanism of c-C4F8 which is a
potential eco-friendly insulating gas to replace SF6. The ReaxFF simulation was carried out to
explore the decomposition process of c-C4F8 and c-C4F8/N2 gas mixtures. The reaction
enthalpies of the main decomposition pathways under different temperatures were also
calculated based on the DFT method. The authors have conducted a thorough analysis and the
results are of interest to the community. However, before this paper can be accepted, the
following comments should be addressed.
(1) Line 48, there exists a spelling error in the following sentence, “liquefaction temperature of
26.9<U+25A1>and 49<U+25A1>under normal pressure”. Is the <U+25A1> denotes to <U+2103>?
(2) Line 90-92, the authors should explain that why you chose the c-C4F8/N2 system which is
composed of 100 c-C4F8 and 400 N2 molecules for simulation?
(3) Line 92, there exists a spelling error which is similar to that in Line 48.
(4) Line 106, more details on the DFT calculation should be added. For example, did you perform
a frequency analysis and check imaginary frequencies of all the particles?
(5) Line 124-125, the author should explain why the simulation temperature range is set to 2600-

In this work, Zhang et al studied the decomposition process of the c-C4F8 and C4F8/N2 gas
mixture by the combination of reactive molecular dynamics method and density functional
theory. The main products of C4F8 decompositions are discovered. The reaction path and
enthalpy were calcualted. Overall, this is an original work with some interesting results. I would
recommend it for publication if the following concerns can be properly addressed.
1. What are the parameters from the ReaxFF to describe the covalent and vdW interactions
within/between the moleculars? These are critical information for the readers to reproduce this
work.
2. The authors used DFT to calculate the reaction enthalpy. Despite the accuracy it can achieve,
the computational efforts likely would be more significant compared to Reax-MD. Why not
directly extract enthalpy based on the energy outputs of MD?
3. Did the authors tested different models with various densities of C4F8/N2. Will the
decomposition results change? In other words, have the results converged with gas densities?
The authors need to clarify this point.
4. Fig 5a, b, what are the reasons of non-monotonic molecular number changes at some

We have also corrected some errors in our previous version of manuscript. All
the changes are marked in pink characters in the revised manuscript.
Reviewer 1:
In this manuscript, the authors focus on the decomposition mechanism of
c-C4F8 which is a potential eco-friendly insulating gas to replace SF6. The
ReaxFF simulation was carried out to explore the decomposition process of c-
C4F8 and c-C4F8/N2 gas mixtures. The reaction enthalpies of the main
decomposition pathways under different temperatures were also calculated
based on the DFT method. The authors have conducted a thorough analysis and
the results are of interest to the community. However, before this paper can be
accepted, the following comments should be addressed.
(1)Line 48, there exists a spelling error in the following sentence, “liquefaction
temperature of 26.9<U+25A1>and 49<U+25A1>under normal pressure”. Is the <U+25A1> denotes to <U+2103>?
Answer: Thanks for your suggestions. We are deeply sorry for this type error. As
you said, here we means “liquefaction temperature of 26.9<U+2103> and 49<U+2103> under normal
pressure”. We have corrected relevant content in the revised manuscript. (Line 47)
(2)Line 90-92, the authors should explain that why you chose the c-C4F8/N2
system which is composed of 100 c-C4F8 and 400 N2 molecules for simulation?
Answer: Thanks for your advice. Considering that the insulating and arc quenching
performances of N2 are inferior, the proper mixed ratio of the c-C4F8-N2 mixture
needs to be determined in order to obtain a good insulation performance. At present,
scholars have studied the liquefaction temperature characteristics of c-C4F8/N2
mixture.
Figure 1 Saturated vapor pressures of different c-C4F8-N2 mixtures at different gas
temperatures.
Figure 1 gives the saturated vapor pressures of different c-C4F8-N2 mixtures
at different gas temperatures [1]. And the restriction of operational temperature can
be obtained from these data. Taking the case of 20%c-C4F8/80%N2 gas mixture as
an example, the highest allowable pressure of gas mixture at -20<U+2103> and -30<U+2103> is
about 0.35MPa and 0.2 Mpa, respectively. And most medium-voltage equipment
working at 0.15-0.3MPa. In order to explore the decomposition mechanism of c-
C4F8-N2 mixture at this scale, we built models containing 100 c-C4F8 and 400 N2
molecules. We have added relevant content in the revised manuscript. Thanks again
for your suggestions. (Line 86-90)

(3)Line 92, there exists a spelling error which is similar to that in Line 48.
Answer: Thanks for your advice. We have corrected this spelling error in the
revised manuscript. (Line 93)
(4)Line 106, more details on the DFT calculation should be added. For example,
did you perform a frequency analysis and check imaginary frequencies of all
the particles?
Answer: Thanks for your advice. In this manuscript, we firstly did ReaxFF
simulation to explore the main decomposition paths of c-C4F8 and c-C4F8-N2 gas
mixture. Then the structures of particles involved in each path were built and
optimized at mGGA-M06L level. The frequency analysis was also did to check the
stability of each particle and provide temperature corrections on thermodynamic
quantities such as enthalpy and Gibb’s free energies. The reaction enthalpy of each
decomposition path at different temperatures were then calculated using the
following equation,
Erelative <U+F03D> Eproducts <U+F02D> Ereactants (1)
Ereactants <U+F03D> ESPE <U+F02B> EZPE <U+F02B> E<U+F044>T (2)
Eproducts <U+F03D> ESPE <U+F02B> EZPE <U+F02B> E<U+F044>T (3)
where Eproducts and Ereactants represent the energy of products and reactants.
ESPE , EZPE and E <U+F044>T correspond to the single point energy, zero point energy
and correcting values of enthalpy, respectively.
We have added relevant content in the revised manuscript. Thanks again for
your suggestions. (Line 110-113)
(5)Line 124-125, the author should explain why the simulation temperature
range is set to 2600-3400K? What is its significance?
Answer: Thanks for your advice. Actually, the temperature in the central region of
arc discharge is in the range of 3000K-12000K. As to the corona discharge, the
maximum temperature in the central region is in the range of 700-1200 K. In
general, the simulation time scale of MD simulations is normally limited to several
dozens of nanoseconds due to the computational cost. In order to allow chemical
reactions to occur within a few picoseconds, enhancing the temperatures to
accelerate the simulation process is usually used in MD simulation. It should be
noted that increasing temperature allows chemical reactions to be observed on the
computational affordable time scale and does not affect the reaction mechanism.
We have tested and found that the c-C4F8 and c-C4F8-N2 gas mixture begins
to decompose largely at 2600K. So we selected the simulation results of this
temperature to discuss the decomposition paths of c-C4F8 and c-C4F8-N2 gas
mixture. We have added relevant content in the revised manuscript. Thanks again
for your suggestions. (Line 129-132)
(6)Line 195, there exist some type errors in Table 1. The <U+25A1> in the reaction
equations should be corrected.
Answer: Thanks for your advice. We are deeply sorry for this type error and we
have corrected them in the revised manuscript. Thanks again for your suggestions.

Reviewer 2
In this work, Zhang et al studied the decomposition process of the c-C4F8
and c-C4F8/N2 gas mixture by the combination of reactive molecular dynamics
method and density functional theory. The main products of c-C4F8
decompositions are discovered. The reaction path and enthalpy were calcualted.
Overall, this is an original work with some interesting results. I would
recommend it for publication if the following concerns can be properly
addressed.
1. What are the parameters from the ReaxFF to describe the covalent and vdW
interactions within/between the moleculars? These are critical information for
the readers to reproduce this work.
Answer: Thanks for your advice. In order to help readers to reproduce this work,
we have uploaded the force field file using in this manuscript in the Data
Availability section. All the parameters using to describe the covalent and vdW
interactions within or between the molecules are given in the files. We also added
relevant content in the revised manuscript. Thanks again for your suggestions.
(Line 26)
2. The authors used DFT to calculate the reaction enthalpy. Despite the
accuracy it can achieve, the computational efforts likely would be more
significant compared to Reax-MD. Why not directly extract enthalpy based on
the energy outputs of MD?
Answer: Thanks for your advice. In this manuscript, we studied the decomposition
process of c-C4F8 and c-C4F8-N2 mixture using both the reactive force field
molecular dynamics (ReaxFF-MD) method and density functional theory (DFT).
ReaxFF-MD simulation can help us understand the main decomposition paths and
the DFT calculation is utilized to calculate the enthalpy of each reaction path
accurately. According to the simulation results, CF2, CF, F and C particles are the
main decomposition particles of the system. The enthalpy obtained based on DFT
shows that c-C4F8 can decompose to C2F4 by absorbing 43.28 kcal/mol, which is
the main decomposition path and this process is easy to occur under high
temperature. Overall, the ReaxFF-MD and DFT results are consistent with each
other.
Moreover, all the ReaxFF-MD simulations in this manuscript were carried out
using the ADF (Amsterdam Density Functional) package. We found that the
calculation platform cannot output the enthalpy of each reaction path and can only
give us the information such as total energy of the system. Considering that the
system we studied contains several small gas molecules and large number of atoms
and there exists many reaction occurred at the same time, it may be impossible for
us to extract enthalpy based on the energy outputs of MD. We are deeply sorry for
this and we are looking forward to your understanding.
3. Did the authors tested different models with various densities of c-C4F8/N2.
Will the decomposition results change? In other words, have the results
converged with gas densities? The authors need to clarify this point.
Answer: Thanks for your advice. In this manuscript, we studied the decomposition
characteristics of c-C4F8 and c-C4F8-N2 mixture using the ReaxFF-MD method.
The wide length of the c-C4F8 system model is 155Å, which contains 100 c-C4F8
molecules with the density about 0.008918g/cm3. And the wide length of c-C4F8/N2
model is 265Å, which contains 100 c-C4F8 molecules and 400 N2 molecules with
the density about 0.00274g/cm3. We have tested and found that the final
decomposition amount and the decomposition rate of c-C4F8 in c-C4F8/N2 system
are lower than that of pure c-C4F8 system at the same temperature. Considering that
the density of c-C4F8 system is higher than that of c-C4F8/N2 system, the molecules
in the unit volume increase, resulting in the increase of the effective collision
number and the intense of reactions. Thus the decomposition amount of c-C4F8 in
the c-C4F8 system is higher than that of c-C4F8/N2 system at the same temperature.
That is to say, the decomposition amount of c-C4F8 increases with the gas density.
We have added relevant content in the revised manuscript. Thanks a lot for your
comments. (Line 139-143)
4. Fig 5a, b, what are the reasons of non-monotonic molecular number changes
at some temperature values?
Answer: Thanks for your advice. As shown in Figure 5 a) and b), the content of
CF3 and CF2 particles shows a decreased trend at higher temperature (3200K and
3400K). This is due to the re-composition of CF3 and CF2 occurs and the generation
of CF4 molecules. We have added relevant content in the revised manuscript to
make it clearer. Thanks again for your comments. (Line 170-174 )
5. Fig 5d, e are very rough. Can the authors increase the output frequency to
make it smoother?
Answer: Thanks for your advice. As shown in Figure 5 d), the generation of CF4
increases significantly at temperatures above 3200K in the range of 400-1000ps.
And the generation of C2F4 reached its peak at the beginning of the simulation at
3200K and 3400K, and then begins to decrease. Actually, the iteration number of
ReaxFF-MD in this manuscript is set to 4000000, and the time step is set to 0.25fs.
The output frequency is set to 2500, which means the structure was saved for 2500
iterations once. We are deeply sorry that the output frequency cannot be changed
when the simulation is finished. We believed that the results shown in Figure 5 e)
can demonstrate the change of C2F4 particle. Thanks again for your suggestions and
we are looking forward for your understanding.
6. Table 1. Some characters are shown as blank squares. Please check.
Answer: Thanks for your advice. We are deeply sorry for this type error and we
have corrected them in the revised manuscript. Thanks again for your suggestions.
(Line 205-206)
7. References 1, 7, 11 have wrong formats.
Answer: Thanks for your advice. We are deeply sorry for these wrong formats and
we have corrected them in the revised manuscript. (Line235-237, 251-253, 262-
264 )
We acknowledge the reviewers’ and editor’s comments and suggestions very
much, which are valuable in improving the quality of our manuscript. Thanks again
