In the work titled "Utilization of steric hindrance of alkyl lithium based initiator to synthesize
high 1, 4 unit containing hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene" by Xin Min, Xiaodong Fan, Jie Liu,
the authors describe the anionic polymerization of hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene initiated
by novel alkyl lithium based initiator with large steric hindrance. They determined structural
parameters of polymer like polymer molecular weight, polydispersity and content of 1.4-unit.
They also sought the best parameters for the reaction, such as time, temperature and initiator
concentration. This work presented to me for review is a continuation of the studies of the
authors on the anionic polymerization of butadiene. It is very interesting work, but it have to be
improved before the manuscript could be published in Royal Society Open Science.
I did not receive supporting information (in which calculation methods are showed), so it was
difficult to assess the method of calculations carried out at work. Moreover, I think, that
calculation methods are very important and should be included in main text.
Polydispersity index is calculated from Mw/Mn not Mn/Mw. Authors should correct this
mistake.
In "Measurements" authors described sample preparation for FTIR studies, but only for polymer.
Were low molecular weight compounds prepared in the same way? What was the concentration
of HTPB in CH2Cl2? Why solutions of HTPB were prepared if they were liquids? They were to
viscous to obtain the spectrum to analyze absorption bands appropriately?
What was the pressure used for solvent remove in section synthesis of HTPB (page 7)?
On page 15 it should be mentioned in the text that the effect of time on the HTPB synthesis
reaction was tested for reactions conducted at 50°C. Similarly for the influence of the initiator
concentration on the course of the reaction (50°C and 4h). Providing parameters for conducting
the reaction will make it easier to understand the text. There will be no need to search for
parameters under the tables, where the information provided is given in small print.
How many times have the synthesis been performed for given reaction parameters? Did authors
repeated the synthesis? Were the statistics for the structural parameters determined? You give in
table 2 for reaction carried out in 50oC for 4h: Mn=4050g/mol, Mw/Mn=1.09 and 1,4 content
91,5%. Then in table 3: Mn=4035g/mol, Mw/Mn =1.09 and 1,4 content 91,6% and table in 4:
Mn=4046g/mol, Mw/Mn =1.11 and 1,4 content 91,6%. If we look for structural parameters
obtained i.e. for reaction carried out for 3, 4 or 5 hours they have very similar results. Maybe it is
a statistical spread of results? And 3 hours are enough time for this reaction?
I suggest that English should be improved in this paper. For example: All the solvents used in the
experiment followed the purification process: Firstly, hydrogenated calcium was added in
solvents; Secondly, the decompression distillation and specific temperature fraction were
employed; Third, molecular sieve was added when the solvents were stored; Fourth, solvents
must be purified (must be purified or you purified your solvents) with high purity argon to
replace the trace air.
All the solvents used in the experiment were purified according to the procedure. Firstly,
hydrogenated calcium was added to solvents. Secondly, the decompression distillation and
specific temperature fraction were employed. Thirdly, molecular sieves were added when the
solvents were stored. Fourthly, solvents were purified with high purity argon to replace (or
remove) the trace air.
In many places, there is no space between words, which makes text reading difficult.
The drawings are too small and therefore they are difficult to read.
In figure 5 "n" monomer molecules should be used over the second arrow.

As I mentioned earlier this is continuation of studies provided by authors on initiator structure
on anionic polymerization of butadiene. Authors little change the structure of earlier describe
initiator; they change triisopropyl siloxy substituent (TIPSODMPrLi) for tert-butyl dimethyl
siloxy (TBDMSODPrLi). This change in the design of the initiator only slightly affects the change
of structural parameters of HTPB. In the previous work authors obtained 1.4-unit content at the
level of 92%, Mw/Mn=1.1 and Mn=4100. So this change in the initiator structure did not bring
about a significant improvement in the parameters of the polybutadiene obtained.

The authors studied the effects of steric hindrance of lithium initiator on 1,4 units of HTPB. Some
questions need to be considered as follows.
(1) In anionic polymerization, solvent-controlled synthesis of 1,4 structures has been studied
extensively. The author had better review whether the steric hindrance of lithium initiators can
affect the 1,4 structures.
(2) According to the author's theory, tert-butyllithium initiator causes a higher 1,4 structure than
n-butyllithium initiator. Is there a similar report in the literature?
(3) It is recommended that the authors add n-butyllithium initiator experiment as a comparative
example to see if the 1,4 addition is also low. Make the experimental results more convincing.
(4) The steric hindrance of the initiator only affects the initiationreaction. No matter what initiator
is used, the active species of growth chains are the same and will not affect the growing structure
of propagation chains.

Appendix A
Reviewer 1: I did not receive supporting information (in which calculation methods are showed),
so it was difficult to assess the method of calculations carried out at work. Moreover, I think, that
calculation methods are very important and should be included in main text.
Reply:Thank you very much for your suggestion, we had added the calculation methods in
main text already. Beside, we reupload the Supporting Information for you.
Reviewer 1:Polydispersity index is calculated from Mw/Mn not Mn/Mw. Authors should correct
this mistake.
Reply:That was indeed our mistake, we had correct it from Mn/Mw to Mw/Mn, thanks for
your reminding.
Reviewer 1:In "Measurements" authors described sample preparation for FTIR studies, but only
for polymer. Were low molecular weight compounds prepared in the same way? What was the
concentration of HTPB in CH2Cl2? Why solutions of HTPB were prepared if they were liquids?
They were to viscous to obtain the spectrum to analyze absorption bands appropriately?
Reply : The Nicolet iS10 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
was used to obtain the infrared spectra for both low molecules weight compounds and
polymers. Samples preparation were conducted as follows: 2ml CH2Cl2 solution of HTPB
or low molecules weight compounds (2mg/ml) was coating on the KBr tablets and dried at
room temperature and pressure, this way can avoid that coatings were too thick to obtain
correct data.
Reviewer 1:What was the pressure used for solvent remove in section synthesis of HTPB (page
7)?
Reply : vacuum degree: 0.08Mpa.
Reviewer 1: On page 15 it should be mentioned in the text that the effect of time on the HTPB
synthesis reaction was tested for reactions conducted at 50°C. Similarly for the influence of the
initiator concentration on the course of the reaction (50°C and 4h). Providing parameters for
conducting the reaction will make it easier to understand the text. There will be no need to search
for parameters under the tables, where the information provided is given in small print.
Reply: thank you for you suggestion, we had added necessary parameters in the table, you
can see it in main text.
Reviewer 1: How many times have the synthesis been performed for given reaction parameters?
Did authors repeated the synthesis? Were the statistics for the structural parameters determined?
Reply: All the synthesis experiment had been repeated for 3 times, the data we provided was
the average value of the results of these 3 experiments.
Reviewer 1: You give in table 2 for reaction carried out in 50oC for 4h: Mn=4050g/mol,
Mw/Mn=1.09 and 1,4 content 91,5%. Then in table 3: Mn=4035g/mol, Mw/Mn =1.09 and 1,4
content 91,6% and table in 4: Mn=4046g/mol, Mw/Mn =1.11 and 1,4 content 91,6%. If we look
for structural parameters obtained i.e. for reaction carried out for 3, 4 or 5 hours they have very
similar results. Maybe it is a statistical spread of results? And 3 hours are enough time for this
reaction?
Reply: we had mentioned in Page 16 of main text, The 1,4 unit content and molecular
weight distribution were also not changed significantly when the polymerization
time was changed. But polymerization time can influence the Mn of HTPB, the
result accorded well to the living polymerization mechanism with which fast
trigger, slow growth and the degree of polymerization were increasing gradually
with the time. When the time was extended over 4 hours, the molecular weight
was not subjected too much increase, for consideration of efficiency we think 4h
was the optimal time for polymerization.
Reviewer 1: I suggest that English should be improved in this paper. For example: All the solvents
used in the experiment followed the purification process: Firstly, hydrogenated calcium was added
in solvents; Secondly, the decompression distillation and specific temperature fraction were
employed; Third, molecular sieve was added when the solvents were stored; Fourth, solvents must
be purified (must be purified or you purified your solvents) with high purity argon to replace the
trace air.
Reply: thanks for your suggestion, we had imroved the English you mentioned and we
considered seek for language polishing service to help this manuscript express more clear.
Reviewer 1: In many places, there is no space between words, which makes text reading difficult.
The drawings are too small and therefore they are difficult to read.
Reply: thank you for your suggestions, this maybe the difference of different Microsoft
Office version, we had upload a PDF file to solve these problems.
Reviewer1:In figure 5 "n" monomer molecules should be used over the second arrow.
Reply: we have correct the defect of figure 5, you can see it in main text.
Reviewer 1: As I mentioned earlier this is continuation of studies provided by authors on initiator
structure on anionic polymerization of butadiene. Authors little change the structure of earlier
describe initiator; they change triisopropyl siloxy substituent (TIPSODMPrLi) for tert-butyl
dimethyl siloxy (TBDMSODPrLi). This change in the design of the initiator only slightly affects
the change of structural parameters of HTPB. In the previous work authors obtained 1.4-unit
content at the level of 92%, Mw/Mn=1.1 and Mn=4100. So this change in the initiator structure
did not bring about a significant improvement in the parameters of the polybutadiene obtained.
Reply: Frank S. Bates` work synthesized TIPSODMPrLi with triisopropyl siloxy as the
steric hindrance group, but triisopropyl siloxy was far away from Li atom, the effect of steric
hindrance cannot be exhibit sufficiently. Furthermore, TIPSODMPrCl which is the
precursor of TIPSODMPrLi was too expensive to realize industrialization; It need at least
22h to synthesized the initiator to guarantee the conversion of TIPSODMPrCl, this is
inefficient for industrialization too. Based on this analysis, in this article, TBDMSODPrLi,
with high steric hindrance was designed and synthesized by low-cost materials. It just need 4
h to obtain satisfactory productivity, you can see the result in Page 4 of main text. By
cooperating methyl in the structure of the initiator which was close to the Li atom, the
branching coefficient was markedly increased leading to raise the steric hindrance of the
initiator, as a result, the end chain association could be effectively avoided during
polymerization.
Reviewer 2: According to the author's theory, tert-butyllithium initiator causes a higher 1,4
structure than n-butyllithium initiator. Is there a similar report in the literature? It is recommended
that the authors add n-butyllithium initiator experiment as a comparative example to see if the 1,4
addition is also low. Make the experimental results more convincing.
Reply: Thank you for your suggestions. Sinn [13] suggested that there was no unassociated
alkyl lithium when the concentration of alkyl lithium was more than 10-3 mol/L, which
indicated that the associated alkyl lithium was the main active center under this
circumstance. Natta [14] indicated that 1,2 structure of butadiene polymerized by tert-butyl
lithium increased from 7% to 47% when the concentration of tert-butyl lithium
concentration increased from 0.005mol/L to 0.5mol/L. In these information, we make a
deduction that the associated alkyl lithium is not beneficial to the production of 1, 4 unit, and
the association degree of n-butyllithium is higher than t-butyllithium in n-hexane, so
according to the deduction abovementioned we think the 1,4 content of t-butyllithium should
be higher than n-butyllithium. For verifying the viewpoint comparation between
n-butyllithium and t-butyllithium was operated, the 1H-NMR of PB synthesized by
n-butyllithium and t-butyllithium showed in figure 1. After integral computation, the 1,4
content of n-butyllithium was 88.6%, the 1,4 content of t-butyllithium was 91,3%. The result
was consistent with our deduction.
Figure 1 1H-NMR of PB synthesized by n-butyllithium and t-butyllithium
Reviewer 2: The steric hindrance of the initiator only affects the initiation reaction. No matter
what initiator is used, the active species of growth chains are the same and will not affect the
growing structure of propagation chains.
Reply: Indeed, the active species of growth chains are the same and will not affect the
growing structure of propagation chains in the PB with thousands of polymerization degree.
But the polymerization degree of HTPB which industrial demand is low (the range is 40-200),
it means the polymerization is rest on the preliminary stage, so the steric hindrance effect is
important in this stage. For example, when the polymerization degree is designed to 50, 5 of
1,2 unit means 10% 1,2 content or 90% 1,4 content, if the microstructure can be controlled
to reduce 1 time of 1,2 inserion in early initiation stage, then the 1,4 content can be enhance
to 92%. This effect is unsignificant when the polymerization degree is more than 1000, but it
become significant gradually with the reducing of polymerization degree.
