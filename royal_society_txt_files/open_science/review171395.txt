Summary
Suma et al. present an analytic model of cell death within tissues. Their model describes a group
of cells that excrete diffusible molecules dubbed “cooperative factors”. In this model, cooperative
factors uniquely determine each cell’s risk of death. This assumption allows the authors to
predict population-level mortality statistics using a model describing how cooperative factors are
created, how they diffuse, and how they are destroyed. Through simulation and analytic
investigation, Suma et al. explore the consequences of diffusion-driven death-rate determinants
in tissues of different morphologies.
Suma et al. provide experimental data to support their model, measuring the rate of death of rat
cardiac fibroblasts cultured in 3D hydrogels and seeded with 0.2 mM hydrogen peroxide. The
authors find that in these conditions, the kinetics of cell death show a non-trivial time and tissue-
shape dependence. They show that with certain parameter sets, their analytic models can
recapitulate the death-kinetics observed in their fibroblasts. The authors propose their model as a
general way through which time-dependent and spatially heterogeneous tissue-level aging
phenomena can emerge from groups of otherwise identical and non-aging cells.
The author’s analytic derivation and simulations appear sound. Their experimental system
provides a useful complement to existing in vivo models, as it allows the authors to perform the
type of highly-controlled experiments needed to validate the quantitative modelling approaches
they seek to develop. However, the current work is limited in two respects that call into question
the applicability of their model to describe their own experimental data as well as the generality
of their model to describe other multicellular systems.
First, the authors’ model appears to require several restrictive assumptions for which
experimental justification is not provided. These unproven assumptions make the authors’
model less compelling as the most likely explanation for the phenomena they observe in
fibroblasts, as the possibility is left open that a different model with different (or fewer)
assumptions might exist. Can the authors provide evidence that would exclude the possibility
that some uncharacterized complexity in cardiac fibroblast physiology produces the survival
curves they collect? Taken literally, the predictive power of the author’s model would seem to
crucially depend on the assumption that a single type of freely-diffusing molecule uniquely
determines the risk of cell-death in their fibroblasts. This assumption appears in conflict with an
existing body of literature that paints a much more complicated picture involving, minimally,
several forms of cell death—senescence, apoptosis, necrosis—each influenced by diverse
endocrine, paracrine, and juxtacrine pathways. How do the authors reconcile their model with a
paper such as, say, Jung-Soon Mo et al, “Notch1 modulates oxidative stress induced cell death
through suppression of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1”, PNAS, 2013, that finds cell-death in
the presence of hydrogen peroxide is regulated by non-diffusible Notch signaling?
Second, from a perspective of statistical inference and model selection, it remains unclear to what
extent the reader’s confidence in the authors’ analytic model should be reinforced by the
experimental data provided. In cardiac fibroblasts, the authors observe a time-dependent
increase in the risk of cell death and the model (with a particular parameter set) does appear to
recapitulates this trajectory. However, the author’s model would seem general enough to fit a
wide range of potential function forms and therefore would seem general enough correspond
3
with a variety of different empiric data sets. Equation 2.9 has three parameters and includes a hill
function—shouldn’t this allow it to describe a wide range of different death kinetics? From the
error bars provided, the fibroblast data would seem to exhibit a substantial degree of variance
between measurements, which would additionally to make it a less restrictive test of any model.
The reader is left wondering whether equation 2.9 would (at some parameter range ) fit nearly
any survival curve shape well of similar quality well enough to meet the author’s standards for
acceptance. The authors should clarify why, had experimental data looked different than it does,
the model would no longer have fit as well.
These points would be best addressed by providing a substantially larger and more diverse set of
experimental data—for example, testing different cell-killing media recipes, making different
types of measurements in addition to scoring alive/dead, or investigating different cell types. A
larger data set would more convincingly 1) demonstrate that the assumptions taken in the model
are reasonable, 2) non-redundantly validate multiple aspects of their model and 3) demonstrate
that the model can be as general as is claimed. It may be possible that the authors can address
these same points without additional data by clarifying the limitations placed on their model by
the assumptions they take and explaining in more detail the statistical inference methods used in
matching the model to the existing experimental data.
Major points
1. The authors state that 0.2 mM hydrogen peroxide would produce a constant rate of death “if
cells died only due to oxidation”. This is asserted without data to justify it in cardiac fibroblasts
and without reference to any broader literature on the topic. If this constant hazard rate is taken
a priori, then the authors should explain the logic behind it. Why couldn’t individual cells exhibit
time-dependent hazard rate, in the same way that organisms do? The authors’ prior work
demonstrates that complex interdependent networks of non-aging components can intrinsically
exhibit time-dependent hazard rates--cardiac fibroblasts would certainly seem sufficiently
complex for a cell-autonomous time-dependent hazard rate to emerge in this way. Why is the
assumption in Eq. 2.2 of a time-independent effect of local CF concentration the most likely
assumption to make? Furthermore, even absent emergent effects, wouldn’t cells exposed to a
constant concentration of hydrogen peroxide nevertheless experience a time-dependent
cumulative exposure of hydrogen peroxide? If cells become increasingly oxidized over time, it
seems reasonable that they would become increasingly likely to die over time. This would seem
to be a simpler model that might reasonably explain the data presented in figure 2, obviating the
need for cell-cell interactions to explain the effect.
The authors should provide or cite experimental evidence in fibroblasts exposed to hydrogen-
peroxide that supports their assertion that rat fibroblasts exhibit a constant hazard rate in the
absence of muti-cellular phenomena.
2. The authors state that their observations “are unlikely to be caused by a diffusion limitation” in
nutrients or oxygen. This statement would appear to be in conflict with the authors’ model that
explicitly includes diffusion-limited “cooperative factors” capable of exhibiting increased
concentration near fibroblast cells. If protective factors are diffusion limited, why are nutrients
not? If cells can produce a high local concentration of some protective factor, why assume they
cannot produce a local depletion of oxygen or nutrients?
The authors state that nutrient and oxygen concentrations are in excess. However, this does not
seem to be sufficient grounds for excluding spatial inhomogeneity in nutrients and oxygen. At
any location in the media, the local concentration of a nutrient would seem to be determined by
the flux of nutrients into that space (via diffusion) and the flux of nutrients out of that space (by
uptake of nutrients by nearby fibroblasts). Unless nutrient uptake negligible compared to
diffusion rates, local nutrient concentrations will be dependent on fibroblast density, regardless
of the diffusion penetration length or overall nutrient abundance. In short, nutrients and oxygen
would seem to behave exactly like cooperative factors in respect to their diffusion and therefore
4
require the same explicit consideration in the author’s model.
To exclude the effects of nutrients and oxygen, the authors would need to provide or cite
experimental evidence that nutrient and oxygen uptake rates are very small compared to nutrient
and oxygen diffusion rates.
3. In evaluating the results of comparing “young” and “old” cell populations in figure two, the
authors state “The agreement between theory and experiment is acceptable”. Surely, the authors
can be more precise here. Some metric describing the goodness of fit of between their model and
their data should be provided along with some quantitative method for evaluating how likely it
is that their model would fit the data even if it was not the correct model. Null hypothesis testing
would be the most conventional way to do this, comparing the AIC scores of alternate models
would be another. In any case, the authors should demonstrate somehow why the concurrence of
their model and the experimental data is non-trivial. Furthermore, as the quality of the model’s fit
hinges crucially on the particular parameter values used, the authors should reflect on the
interpretation of those parameters. As a general model would ideally fit both panels with the
same parameter fit, a justification of why it does not should be provided. Finally, error bars are
provided for the experimental data, but are not defined or explained. If multiple biological
replicates were performed for the same experiment, it would be informative to know the quality
of fit of the model on each replicate.
4. The authors state that “our conclusions should be expected to hold true for the aging dynamics
of any multicellular system, as long as cells cooperatively interact via diffusion factors”. Here,
the authors appear to misstate the assumptions of their model as described earlier in the
manuscript. Their model assumes cells interact via diffusion factors, yes, but it also assumes that
(a) the diffusible factors uniquely determine each cells’ time-independent risk of death
(b) the basic unit of aging (e.g cells) are accurately modeled as single point sources
(c) nutrients and oxygen are always in excess and never diffusion-limited
(d) Eq 2.1 includes all the relevant contributors to “cooperative factors”, eg. diffusion is the
/only/ phenomenon determining local cooperative factor concentration
(e) The concentration of death-causing factors (here, hydrogen peroxide) does not themselves
change as a function of time.
(f) Death-causing factors move into the proximity of cells by diffusing in from the outside tissues,
rather than being produced (as seems more likely) inside the tissue itself. It seems very unlikely
that all these conditions would be met in a tumor or microbial community, and certainly not in
“any multicellular system”. The authors should produce substantively more evidence that the full
set of relevant assumptions hold broadly, or else substantially refine their claims.
5. No detailed description of the image analysis approach is provided beyond the fact that a
heatmap was constructed. The authors should provide some evidence that their choice of image
analytic approach does influence the quality of fit of their model to the data.
Minor points
1. The authors state that their cells are “uniformly distributed around ~40 um”. To avoid
confusion with the concept of a uniform probability distribution, the authors might consider
rephrasing, for example by changing “uniformly” to “evenly”.
2. The authors predict the propagation rate of the edge of dying tissues, and demonstrate that
their simulated results agree with their analytic predictions. However, unlike other predictions
in the paper, they provide no experimental evidence to validate or reject this aspect of the model.
It would seem that the propagation rate should be measurable in the author’s experimental data,
and this aspect of their model can be tested in the same way as they do elsewhere in the paper.
Minimally it should be made clear the point at which the authors stop exploring “experiments
with synthetic tissues and an analytic model consistent with experiments” and begin to explore
5
“a number of implications that follow the analytic model”.

The goal of this study is to propose a quantitative theory of tissue failure in order to understand
what is happening between different scales (cellular/organ) when a damage occur at the cellular
level. The authors then compared their theoretical results with experiments showing a good
agreement between the two. The paper is generally well-written and organised though there are
some problems within the text and figures. In addition, I believe that often the authors make
strong statements within the manuscript without referring to relevant published papers.
My comments below
Page2, Line 48: “the hydrogel material….. was chosen to prohibit cells from migrating or
proliferating”. The author says that this is the way to ensure that the observed effects are due to
the intercellular cooperation only. Do you have any reference to support this?
Page 2, Line 53: The author states “cells located at smaller angles die faster than those at larger
angles”, and they refer to Fig2. In addition, in Fig2 legend, the author says “a layer of death cells
form and rapidly thicken until tip are completely consumed and the population collapse
propagates inwards”. I think the author should spend a bit more on this because I cannot see
anything of what he is saying. Where are the completely consumed tips? Why the shape for the
30-degree case at time 0 seems to change orientation at time 8 and 16? In addition, in fig2 bottom,
the author shows that cells start dying close to the edges and corners, and the dead layer
propagate inwards. Are you just interest to show this trend or you want to highlight the influence
of different angle on this propagation effect? If this is the case, are the difference between angles
statistically significant?

all cells to cell it will be always 0.

sufficiently smaller……., cells can be approximated by point sources…..When the cells density is
uniform, we can approximate the cell density to not have spatial dependence”. Why are these

Summary
Suma et al. present an analytic model of cell death within tissues. Their model describes a group

Suma et al. provide experimental data to support their model, measuring the rate of death of rat

These points would be best addressed by providing a substantially larger and more diverse set of

larger data set would more convincingly 1) demonstrate that the assumptions taken in the model
are reasonable, 2) non-redundantly validate multiple aspects of their model and 3) demonstrate
that the model can be as general as is claimed. It may be possible that the authors can address
these same points without additional data by clarifying the limitations placed on their model by
the assumptions they take and explaining in more detail the statistical inference methods used in
matching the model to the existing experimental data.
Major points
1. The authors state that 0.2 mM hydrogen peroxide would produce a constant rate of death “if

Appendix A
Response to Referee 1
December 11, 2017
We sincerely thank the referee for this very extensive review. We have addressed these concerns,
made changes and added clarifications to our paper accordingly. Two of the most important points
raised by the referee is (1) the possibility of aging in the subcellular scale (2) the possibility of
local depletion of externally provided resources such as nutrition and oxygen.
Most of the concerns of the referee are addressed rigorously in an earlier work where we have
varied the density of the cells and shown that when the cells are separated far apart the aging
effect vanishes [9]. When the cells are spread far apart, they have a constant death rate. When
they are nearby, they have a death rate that increases with time. In the same study, we have
exchanged the media of young and old tissues and investigated its effects. The conclusion of this
study was that 1. there are cooperative factors 2. aging happens on a sub cellular level as well as
at an intercellular level. However the latter plays a much larger role. 3. aging in the subcellular
scale is coupled to the aging in the intercellular scale: This is because aged cells loose their ability
to receive or process the cooperative factors.
The present study can be viewed as the theoretical analysis of [9], additionally supported by
extra spatial data.
We will now address the concerns of the referee on a point by point basis:
The authors state that 0.2 mM hydrogen peroxide would produce a constant rate
of death “if cells died only due to oxidation”. This is asserted without data to justify
it in cardiac fibroblasts and without reference to any broader literature on the topic.
We have now added a reference to this, and clarified. From earlier experiments, we know that
when the cells are spread apart they cannot interact, and their death rate is constant in time. [9]
Taken literally, the predictive power of the author’s model would seem to crucially
depend on the assumption that a single type of freely-diffusing molecule uniquely
determines the risk of cell-death in their fibroblasts. This assumption appears in con-
flict with an existing body of literature that paints a much more complicated picture
involving, minimally, several forms of cell death–senescence, apoptosis, necrosis–each
influenced by diverse endocrine, paracrine, and juxtacrine pathways.
We have now added in the manuscript, in the last paragraph of discussion section, how there
may be such complications and how our model should be modified to include such complications.
The referee is right that there may be additional complications not taken into account by our
model. For example, there may be multiple cooperative factors. However this need not change the
general structure of the theory; i.e if these factors have different diffusion lengths the factor with
the shortest length should be the limiting one, and f should be interpreted as the concentration of
the limiting cooperative factor. If the diffusion lengths of two cooperative factors are similar, and
if a cell can die due to the lack of either cooperative factor, then these factors can be summed up
and labeled as one.
It is still possible that there may be more “interesting” complications. e.g. it may be possible
that factor 1 and factor 2 are both necessary, but if factor 3 is present, it can be used as a substitute
for both 1 and 2. We do not have experimental evidence for such interesting complications, so for
now, in the spirit of Occam’s razor, we have just constructed the simplest model that works.
The authors should clarify why, had experimental data looked different than it
does, the model would no longer have fit as well.
The experimental data could have shown no aging, in which case the best fit would have been
exponential. The experimental data could have shown signs of anti-aging, if say, the cells could
replicate / rejuvenate, in which case our model would no longer fit.
For comparison purposes we have included in Fig2, the null model what the data would have
looked like if the system did not age.
1
Why couldn’t individual cells exhibit time-dependent hazard rate, in the same way
that organisms do?
We have now explained this in section2 paragraph 2. Aging occurs both on the subcellular
scale and the intercellular scale. In [9] we have observed both, but found the latter to be a much
stronger effect. Short answer is, once the tissue is prepared such that the distance between cells
are large enough, the hazard rate becomes nearly flat [9].
If protective factors are diffusion limited, why are nutrients not?
Because the nutrients / oxygen surround the 2D sample: every cell is immediately near the
nutrients / oxygen. This is not true for protective factors. For example, if the tissue has only two
cells left, on two ends of the hydrogel, both cells are very far away from the source of protective
factor.
In [9] we have observed that the death rate is much larger for separated cells, even though they
receive the same amount of external resources.
In evaluating the results of comparing “young” and “old” cell populations in figure
two, the authors state “The agreement between theory and experiment is acceptable”.
Surely, the authors can be more precise here.
We agree with the referee. We have originally obtained the fits “by hand”. We now do a least
squares error fit, and report the p value for the fit in the figure legend, both using inbuilt functions
of mathematica software. Since there are many data points, and the agreement is quite well, we
get p = 5 * 10-15 and p = 1 * 10-24 . We have also added an additional pair of plots to compare
our experimental findings and theory with the null-model where cells die at a constant rate.
Furthermore, as the quality of the model’s fit hinges crucially on the particular
parameter values used, the authors should reflect on the interpretation of those pa-
rameters. As a general model would ideally fit both panels with the same parameter
fit, a justification of why it does not should be provided.
We now briefly discuss and clarify these matters in the legend of Fig2.
The stoichiometric constant k is typically a small integer between 1 - 5 in a typical biochemical
reaction. For our curves k = 1, 2 did not fit the data, so we picked the next best ?small number?,
k = 3 for both panels. The constant a is the hazard rate of a lone cell, i.e. death rate due to
steadily occurring extrinsic or intrinsic hazards. We reasoned that this should also probably be
similar for the curves in both panels, and fixed its value. Thus the only parameter that needs
to be adjusted for the young cells and old cells is ß. beta is a combination a number of physical
and biological variables. If we exclude the physical constants that should be the same for the two
experiments, we are left with cooperative factor secretion rate A and cooperative factor receival
(or processing) F0 , which can be a little different in young versus old cells. Nevertheless, the best
fit for beta turns out to be in the same ball park for young and old cells (3.8 versus 3.1).
Error bars are provided for the experimental data, but are not defined or explained.
Thanks for pointing this out. We performed all cell culture experiments in triplicates. Data
points represent the mean value, and error bars represent the standard deviation. We have now
added this to the paper, at the end of the methods section.
The authors state that “our conclusions should be expected to hold true for the
aging dynamics of any multicellular system, as long as cells cooperatively interact
via diffusion factors”... It seems very unlikely that all these conditions would be met
in a tumor or microbial community, and certainly not in “any multicellular system”.
The authors should produce substantively more evidence that the full set of relevant
assumptions hold broadly, or else substantially refine their claims.
We agree that our claim should be softened. We have now replaced the phrase
“our conclusions should be expected to hold true for the aging dynamics of any multicellular
system, as long as cells cooperatively interact via diffusion factors. Such systems include tumuors,
biofilms, colonies and microbial consortia.”
with
“our conclusions may also hold true for the aging dynamics of a larger class of cooperative mul-
ticellular systems. Such systems may potentially include tumuors, biofilms, colonies and microbial
consortia...However we should expect important qualitative differences in systems where a limiting
cooperative factor is produced centrally and / or transported by a non-diffusive mechanism.”
2
we have continued by cautioning
“However if there is a non-trivial dependence on substitutable combinations, e.g. if survival
depends on (1 AND 2) or (3 AND 4), then eqn (2.2) should be modified appropriately, as [such
and such]”
Again, we sincerely thank the referee for this very thorough review, and for helping us improve
our paper significantly.

Appendix B
Response to Referee 2
December 11, 2017
We sincerely thank the referee for suggestions and comments. We have addressed them, below.
Page2, Line 48: “the hydrogel material... was chosen to prohibit cells from migrat-
ing or proliferating”. The author says that this is the way to ensure that the observed
effects are due to the intercellular cooperation only. Do you have any reference to
support this?
Yes. We have prior work to show that the hydrogel material prohibits cells from migrating or
proliferating (cf. [1,2] below). We have also established that the observed effects are due to the
intercellular cooperation in another work, since the effects go away when the density of the cells
is reduced so that the cells can no longer interact [3]. These references and clarification has now
been added to the second paragraph of section 2.
Page 2, Line 53: The author states “cells located at smaller angles die faster than
those at larger angles”, and they refer to Fig2. In addition, in Fig2 legend, the
author says “a layer of dead cells form and rapidly thicken until tip are completely
consumed and the population collapse propagates inwards”. I think the author should
spend a bit more on this because I cannot see anything of what he is saying. Where
are the completely consumed tips? Why the shape for the 30-degree case at time
0 seems to change orientation at time 8 and 16? In addition, in fig2 bottom, the
author shows that cells start dying close to the edges and corners, and the dead layer
propagate inwards. Are you just interest to show this trend or you want to highlight
the influence of different angle on this propagation effect? If this is the case, are the
difference between angles statistically significant?
We apologize for the oversight in the orientation of microscope images. We have now rotated all
images so that they are aligned in the same way. Additionally, we have added heatmaps indicating
the number density of dead cells, from which we have obtained the plots. We have also indicated,
with a thin white line, the layer of dead cells in the heatmap. Everything should be much clearer
now.
Page2, Line 55: Fig1, left. I think you meant Fig1, top. Page3, Line 7: Fig1, right.
I think you meant Fig1, bottom.
Corrected. Many thanks for noticing this.
Page3, Line 14: “we would expect to see the center die first and propagate out-
wards,...”. Do you have any reference to support this?
The reasoning is that if oxygen and nutrition did not diffuse inside the tissue by sufficient
amounts, the cells in the center would receive less of these things and die. This does not happen
in our experiment. i.e. neither do the cells in the center of the plane receive less resources (since
resources come from the top), nor do they die before those near the edges.
Page 3, Line 39: there is a problem in the last part of the equation. As it is the
CF contribution by all cells to cell it will be always 0.
Fixed, many thanks.
Here the author talks about reasonable approximations. “If the size of the cell if
sufficiently smaller..., cells can be approximated by point sources...When the cells den-
sity is uniform, we can approximate the cell density to not have spatial dependence”.
Why are these assumptions reasonable? Can you refer to any paper?
The first argument is a geometric one: The distance of all points on a sphere to a far away
point is approximately equal. (e.g. my distance to the surface of the sun is equal to the center of
the sun, so I can assume all the sun is concentrated in one point if I want to calculate the amount
of light I receive)
The second assumption is statistical: We assume that cells are uniformly distributed, even
though in reality cells are discrete entities and small regions can have a bit more or a bit less
1
number of cells. (e.g. It is just like assuming that a water has a constant density, 1kg per meter
cube, even though in reality it is made of atoms and on the small scale there may be slightly more
or slightly less number of atoms per unit volume)
Figure4: The x axis in all the four images are unreadable.
For some reason, we do not see anything peculiar in the x axis labels in fig4. We will make sure
this remains to be the case after our manuscript passes through the submission system.
Again, we sincerely thank the referee for helping us improve our paper.
