This paper documents a series of laboratory scale experiments focusing on coordination leaching
zinc from metallurgical slag and dust in NH3-CH3COONH4-H2O system. In the current study,
the research angle and method of this thesis are comparatively creationary. The data is
convincing and clear, the paper well written. The quality of results and argumentation is on a
good level. The diagrams and figures are readable. The conclusion follows from the work
described. Over all, the results are nicely presented. This manuscript could be considered for
3
publication in Royal Society Open Science after minor revisions.
1. Literature review of the relevant process is detailed and well organized.
2. “Chapter 2.1, Experimental materials, the high content of alkaline gangues (7.90%,
Si+CaO+Mg)” : in metallurgy only Ca and Mg are considered alkaline, Si is acidic. Pleases make
sure to make changes to related internal pages.
3. With higher temperature, is there no vaporization of the leachant that effects the total ammonia
concentration of the solution?
4. Finally, why would this be a clean zinc production process using NH3-CH3COONH4 as a
leaching agent and what is this basis?

Best regards!
The revised sentences and words are indicated in red in this revised manuscript,
and the statement of what has been done in this revised manuscript to each comment
of the reviewers and the editor-in-chief is as follow:
Reviewer_1:
1. Response to comment: In the "Abstract" (page 1 line 17) the word “Zinc” is must be written
in lowercase.
Response: We have revised the manuscript according to the reviewer’s suggestion.
2. Response to comment: Correction character format: "25 °C" to "<U+2103>" (page 1 line 27),
(page 7 line 33, 57)....
Response: We have revised the full text according to the reviewer’s suggestion.
3. Response to comment: page 5 line 42-44, the sentence is not clear, please reformulate it.
Response: We have revised the manuscript. See “Chapter 2.2 Experimental methods”: where,
CZn is the Zn concentration of the leaching solution (g/L), V is the leaching solution volume
*
(L), m is the mass of the MSD (g), and wZn is the Zn content of the MSD (%).
4. Response to comment: page 7 line 53, replace "Figure 8 describes the effect of the
liquid/solid ratio on..." by "Figure 8 describes the effects of the liquid/solid ratios on...".
Response: We have revised the manuscript.
5. Response to comment: Figure 8 does not correspond with "....solid/liquid ratios...". replace
“solid/liquid ratios” by “ liquid/solid ratios” (page 27 line 31).
Response: We have revised the manuscript according to the reviewer’s suggestion.
6. Response to comment: Please resolve similar problems of comment 5 and 6.
Response: The full text was reviewed and modified .
7. Response to comment: page 15 line 5, "The experimental results indicated that the zinc
extraction was the highest...". The leaching efficiencies of zinc are increase in the reaction
temperature from 35 °C to 55 °C. replace “highest...” by “ reached to...”.
Response: We have revised the manuscript according to the reviewer’s suggestion: replace
“highest...” by “ reached to...”.
Reviewer _2:
1. Response to comment: Literature review of the relevant process is detailed and well
organized.
Response: Thank you.
2. Response to comment: “Chapter 2.1, Experimental materials, the high content of alkaline
gangues (7.90%, Si+CaO+Mg)” : in metallurgy only Ca and Mg are considered alkaline, Si is
acidic. Pleases make sure to make changes to related internal pages.
Response: We have revised the manuscript according to the reviewer’s suggestion: As
shown in “2.1 Experimental materials”.
3. Response to comment: With higher temperature, is there no vaporization of the leachant that
effects the total ammonia concentration of the solution?
Response: With higher temperature, the leachant is volatile clearly. However, the leaching
device is sealed with condensate outlet. Therefore, the leaching agent can condensate reflux
into the reaction vessel as temperatures go up.
4. Response to comment: Finally, why would this be a clean zinc production process using
NH3-CH3COONH4 as a leaching agent and what is this basis?
Response: Compared with the traditional pyrometallurgical and sulfuric acid extraction
technology, a high zinc recovery can be obtained by the prometallurgical process, huge
energy consumption, high production costs and secondary pollution prevent its wide
industrial application. Sulfuric acid leaching for the low grade zinc oxide ores, especially
those containing high contents of iron, calcium and silicon, the excessive acid consumption
and complex purification process would cause a significant concern. However, a selective
ammoniacal leaching process should be more suitable for these kinds of ores, more will not
cause secondary pollution. So, the leaching process is a clean non-polluting new technique.
Reviewer _3:
1. Response to comment: Page 2, line44 “RCOO-” replaced by “RCOO-” (superscript)
Response: We have revised the manuscript according to the reviewer’s suggestion: As
shown in “1. Introduction”.
2. Response to comment: Page 2, line 28 “hydrometallurgical methods are the most common
method of zinc extraction” replaced by “hydrometallurgical method is the most common
method of zinc extraction”
Response: We have revised the manuscript according to the reviewer’s suggestion: As
shown in “1. Introduction”.
3. Response to comment: Page 2, line 40 “Zinc” replaced by “zinc”, “a” should be deleted
Response: I have revised the manuscript, “as the metal Zinc passes into a solution while the
iron” to “as the metal zinc passes into solution while the iron”.
4. Response to comment: Page 2, line 46 “research” replaced by “researches”
Response: We have revised the manuscript according to the reviewer’s suggestion.
5. Response to comment: Page 5, line 18 “-” should be deleted
Response: We have revised the manuscript according to the reviewer’s suggestion: “300-mL”
to “300 mL”.
6. Response to comment: Page 5, line 20 “a” should be deleted
Response: We have revised the manuscript according to the reviewer’s suggestion.
7. Response to comment: Page 6, line 16“analysis” replaced by “analyses”
Response: We have revised the manuscript according to the reviewer’s suggestion.
8. Response to comment: Page 6, line 53 “were” should be deleted
