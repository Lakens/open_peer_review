label_comment_1
The manuscript addresses the interplay between two potential roles of dark coloration, crypsis
and social signaling, in a freshwater fish. The manuscript describes two experiments and is
clearly structured. The first experiment is rather clear and although I’ve got some comments on
the analysis and interpretation, I am convinced that it shows that subordinated male fish that had
been exposed to a darker background and responded by darkening receive and execute more
attacks in a competitive context. This is an interesting finding, although it is open to alternative
explanations. The second experiment aims to test if subjects adjust their darkening response to a
dark background depending on whether they acted as dominants or subordinates in previous
interactions. The authors identify a significant two-way interaction, which means that the degree
of status-dependent darkening depends on the sequence of tests. In the abstract this morphs into
“males that were dominant in their first encounter with a rival darkened more than males that
were first subordinate” (Lines 35-36), which is an interpretation of the treatment difference in the
first round and the P value for this is P = 0.093 (Table 4). The two-way interaction is indeed
difficult to interpret, because there is no obvious a priori hypothesis associated with it (at least
none is presented). I think the conclusions have to be rephrased, but I am afraid that they will
remain rather unclear.
Main issues with experiment 1
There are two issues with the first experiment. The more important one is related to the
experimental design. I am a bit surprised that the treatment was only ‘up’ and not also ‘down’.
The way it is now, half of the subjects experienced a change while the other half didn’t and this is
‘change’ is completely confounded with darkening. Males exposed to dark backgrounds
apparently darkened while individuals in constant (brown) environments did not modify their
color. What if the increased aggressions has nothing to do with black patches as a signal of status,
but that males did not recognize each other while control pairs did? They might simply fight out
their dominance status, while the others accept their old roles. It is also possible that darkened
subordinated individuals did not receive more attacks because they ‘faked’ a signal of status, but
if they provoked more attacks because they initiated more attacks, possibly as a by-product of the
change they went through?
The second point on the first experiment is that the analysis is unnecessarily complicated and I in
my view also inappropriate. With the design here, a straightforward test is a linear model with
post-treatment aggression as a response, treatment as a predictor and possibly pre-treatment
aggression as a covariate. All this work around with triyad random effects, status and stage is
really not helpful. Only subordinate males at stage 2 (the second trial) had received the treatment.
The experimental design clearly suggests a two-sample t test or an ANCOVA, while the current
analysis with collinear predictors, necessity to fit two-way (and indeed also three-way)
interactions, etc. is completely over the top.
3
Main issues with experiment 2
The second experiment I think has issues with carry over effects. Lines 300-302 claim that there
was no overall change in color between successive trials, but with a P = 0.081 and N = 21 I am not
convinced; there seems to be a trend for being darker in the second trial. If they are indeed darker
before entering the second round, darkening might simply be reduced because there is less room
for change. The dominance first ground, in particular tended to darken slightly (though not
statistically significantly) more that the subordinated, which might have further reduced the
potential (or necessity) for further darkening. At very least the interpretation of the interaction
has to be taken serious and should not be distorted as it is currently done in the abstract.
There is a second, potentially important issue with experiment 2 that might simply need some
clarification. I understand that the rear and side walls of the tank were lined with background
color, but that the lid and the front were transparent. If you separated three individuals spatially
in this setup isn’t it unavoidable that some get more background walls around them while others
get more clear (and thus lighter) walls?
Further comments:
First paragraphs: The first three sentence all need a bit of rephrasing. The first one, for example,
reads a bit like a definition of adaptive color, but it isn’t a definition.
Line 58: “as opposed to physiological changes”
Lien 62: A reference would be useful.
Line 80: I think it is technically correct, but confusing, because “black ones” might refer to charr
or to backgrounds.
L116: full stop missing.
Line 131: Provide approximate group sizes.
Line 146: “total number of subjects 126” is better, because the sample size N in the statistical sense
is 42 (the number of groups, because this is where the treatment is applied)
Line 149: expectation > prediction (collecting data with some expectation sounds like there could
be inherent biases in the data collection)
Line 189-191: There is a bit of an issue with summing correlated variables. If both original counts
are generated by correlated Poisson processes, the sum of these counts will not be Poisson. The
sum of independent (!) Poisson processes, however, will follow a Poisson distribution. The is a
result of Var(A+B)=Var(A)+Var(B)+2*cov(A,B). I don’t think this constitutes a big issue here, but
obviously the decision will affect the excess dispersion in the model.
Line 202-203: It is a bit confusing that this is highlighted, because dominance is assigned based on
the performance of the majority of aggressive behaviors.
Line 228-230: I understand that some fish have been re-used from Experiment 1, but it remains
unclear if this was (subordinate) individuals that had experience a color change in Experiment 1
or control individuals or dominant individuals that both did not experience a color change.
Recycling individuals from the treatment groups seems like a bit of an unfortunate choice.
4
Line 247, 260: Where and what are these sections b and c?
Line 264: Unclear reference. I am not quite clear about how often fish of the second experiment
have been photographed. Once before and once after the each trial or only three times in total?
Line 295-296: Changes in percentages are often problematic because of ceiling effects and right
skew. How was the distribution and how did you deal with this potential issue? Furthermore,
what are paired t tests in the context of a linear mixed effects model?
Line 301-306: I think this is just testing for a pre-treatment difference in black coloration based on
the first measurement, isn’t it? Under proper random assignment to treatments, we would expect
no difference. How is this related to the reverting in color that is mentioned in Lines 305-306?
Line 317: It is not quite appropriate to interpret P = 0.052 as evidence for lack of an effect!
Lines 347-348: Reference 36 is on Harris sparrows that are not very closely related to house
sparrows. The text reads as if this was all about house sparrows.
Figures: With several difficult variables, such as percentage changes that are bounded, low counts
that are certainly non-normal etc., it would be nice to see more of the actual distribution of the
data. The summaries by means and SE hide too much. With 21 data points, it would be easy to
show them all or to use at least density plots or boxplots.
Table 1 & Figure 1: There is apparently an issue with zero counts in the subordinate group for
bites and head shakes. If there is no variation in one of the treatment groups (as it seems to be the
case here), models will give meaningless results as can be seen from the crazily large SE (and P
values at or near 1 are also suspicious). This can lead to the disturbing condition where the
difference is plain obvious, but the statistical tests cannot deal with it. Either you leave out the
test, or you add an observation of a bit/head shake to the subordinate groups (as if you had just
missed it by a second) and thus get a conservative estimate, P value for it. However, this would
need to be explained and justified.
Table 2+3: Are this linear or generalize linear mixed models?
Table 2: The stage effect in model b seems to have the wrong sign. But maybe I misunderstand
what is contrasted here. For all predictors it should be clear if the contrast refer to a change from
treatment level A to B or from B to A (e.g. subordinate to dominant or vice versa).
Table 3: Why not include the intercept?
Table 3+4, Lines 302-317: Why are the df 28? There are 21 focal subjects tested for two changes,
hence Nobservations=42. Minus 1 df each for the two main effects, the interaction and the
intercept, I get to 38. Similarly, why is df=14 in Table 3b and Line 317? There should be N=21/2
subjects per treatment, and I would think that a paired t test has 9 or 10 df. I know that linear
mixed models have been used, but I think this is not quite appropriate here (and the df would be
unlikely be identical for the two tests in Line 315 and Line 317).
Line 456: “on” missing.
Small things in the reference list: There are formatting issues in ref 11., missing initial in 23 and
40, misspelled names in 34 and 35.

This set of experiments strike me as well conceived and well executed. The explanations are
based on recent literature and current concepts. Importantly, the chosen fish species allow a
certain set of questions to be addressed and that brings a new and different view to functions and
tradeoffs of slow morphological color change. It is a quite surprising finding that darkening of
the skin was dependent on a male’s previous social experience and current social status; and that
there was a negative effect on camouflage in some conditions. I am mostly a marine invertebrate
researcher (cephalopods and recently fishes) and I found the paper to be very interesting on a
comparative basis.
Lines 58 and 59 seem to have morphological and physiological color change mixed up; delete the
c.f. in parentheses
Lines 375-378. It is noteworthy that this phenomenon is somewhat unique to slow color change.
The time for this change was first calculated to be 1 week but was found to occur in 3 days; how
fast can they make this change - can it be less than 3 days?

Comments to the Author:
Two reviewers have commented on your manuscript. Although reviewer #2 is broadly
supportive, reviewer #1 raises a substantial number of criticisms about your experimental design,
your choice of analysis techniques, and your interpretation of the results. Based on these
criticisms, I think that at the least you have some major changes to make to the manuscript in
order to answer them, and I particularly need to be persuaded that the reviewer's critique of the
experimental design can be addressed.

hich we have taken on board. We have endeavored to address the concerns of both referees and
ve substantially revised our manuscript (all changes are highlighted in yellow) so that all data
ve been re-analyzed and all tables and figures have been re-drawn. Our overall findings and
nclusions are the same, but we believe that we now present a much a clearer picture of the
ta and a more thorough understanding of the observed effects.
e have addressed the comments of each reviewer in turn; major issues (reviewer #1 only) are
nsidered in the text below, minor issues are addressed in the following table for clarity.
eviewer 1
ain issues with experiment 1.
viewer #1 suggests that an important issue with experiment 1 is that we did not perform a
ciprocal treatment, where colour change was induced in the opposite direction (i.e. skin
htening, rather than darkening). For simplicity, we decided a priori not to implement an
ditional ‘pale’ colour change treatment because previous research with fishes has demonstrated
at skin darkening plays a particularly important role in mediating aggression (references in
anuscript) and we did not feel that this further treatment would add anything to the study.
rthermore, our preliminary observations with this study species revealed that males that had
rker colouration tended to exhibit more aggression, so we wanted to investigate whether
rtificial’ darkening would heighten this effect. We do not feel that the treatment (dark
ckground or control) is confounded with darkening because control subordinate males
derwent the same procedure (isolation for one week) as treatment males, only the colour of
e visual background differed during the treatment period. Nonetheless, we agree that readers
ay find it odd that we did not perform a ‘pale’ treatment, so we have commented on this in the
scussion (P16, L443-448).
viewer #1 also suggests that skin darkening in the treatment group may have impeded
dividual recognition of the treatment fish but not the control fish. Although this is an interesting
ggestion, we think this is highly unlikely because social recognition plays a critical role in many
haviours (e.g. predator inspection, mate choice) and would otherwise break down when fish
ange colour for background matching (which is likely frequent). Indeed, a recent study with
chlids has shown that facial patterns serve for individual recognition and act independently of
erall body colouration [1]. We have added a few sentences to the discussion to acknowledge
is possibility (P16, L448-458).
viewer #1 points out that it is possible that darkened subordinates may not have received more
tacks because they faked their social status through skin darkening, but because they initiated
ore attacks as a by-product of the skin darkening. This is an excellent point, which we have
arified in the revised manuscript; we found that increased aggression was only observed by
minants towards subordinates, and not by subordinates towards dominants (P8, L223-226).
hile the analysis of the first experiment may seem overly complicated, the random effect of tank
necessary to control for tank effects, which are often observed in experiments of this nature [2]
e to subtle differences in tank environmental conditions (e.g. tank position, lighting) or the
cial attributes individuals comprising the fish groups. However, we have simplified the analysis
experiment 1 by performing separate analyses for the ‘before’ (Table 1) and ‘after’ (Table 2)
haviour. As suggested, the ‘after’ analysis now includes only the treatment effect and pre-
eatment aggression as a covariate (which was not significant). The overall findings of experiment
have not changed.
ain issues with experiment 2
viewer 1 suggests that there may be carryover effects between the first and second round of
servations in experiment 2 (P=0.081), associated with the male’s previous colouration or social
le. We have investigated this further by including ‘previous colouration’ as a covariate in the
alysis (P11, L307-309) and by specifically testing for an effect of social status of colouration
fore trial 1 and before trial 2 (P12, L316-323). The reviewer was correct, before taking part in
al 2, fish that were dominant in trial 1 were darker than those that were subordinates in trial 1.
onetheless, our findings remain the same when we include previous colouration as a covariate in
l our models. The reviewer is also correct that darker males show less change in colouration than
ler fish; we now present an additional figure (Fig. 3b) showing the predicted effects of previous
louration on colour change for each treatment group. Both carryover effects, and the
portance of previous colouration are now included in the Discussion (P14 & 15, L402-423).
e did not adequately describe how the three fish in experiment 2 were positioned with
spected to the light environment. We now confirm (P10, L264-267) that males were positioned
the front of the tank (to facilitate monitoring and individual identification), while the females
ere positioned in a larger compartment at the back. The experimental males were therefore
posed to equal amounts of the visual background provided by the sidewalls.
e have put the reviewers’ minor points and our responses in a table for clarity:
