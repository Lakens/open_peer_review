The authors performed a coalescent-based Bayesian method (extended Bayesian skyline plots
performed using the Beast tool) in complete mtDNA genomes from the 1000 genomes project
phase 3, aiming to reconstruct the changes in effective population size through time. Bayesian
skyline plots (BSP) are commonly used to reconstruct historical demography movements given
multiple haploid genomes without recombination. These plots are very useful in order to
associate the population size with climatic events and provide insights into the origins of lineage
diversity and range expansions. However, several errors can influence the accuracies of a
historical reconstruction of a population, including levels of sequence polymorphism, sampling
scheme, sample size, natural selection, and estimates of mutation rate. A persistent problem is the
estimation of mutation rates to calibrate the molecular clocks used to date historical population
events. The authors used the age of ancient samples to estimate the rate and therefore improved
the accuracy of the mutation rates in this methodology.
Nevertheless, and like the authors claim, the use of Bayesian skyline plots to infer accurate
population histories is very difficult due to the complexity of modern human populations
(several levels of stratification) and the fact the authors focused the entire paper in only this
methodology weakens this paper. In addition, mitochondrial DNA data have only limited power
to inform us about the human evolutionary history thought the maternal lineage and therefore it
can fail to detect specific population movements. Most of the available publication apply the BSP
plots in mtdna haplogroups in order to reduce the complexity background history of several
countries.
The paper lacks a clear and relevant aim, without new added data, and due to the complexity of
the data they failed to detect the signal of important expansions such as the Neolithic transition.
The authors were able to apply a coalescent model and an improved mutation rate but I do not
see enough relevance in the paper for a publication.

I previously reviewed this manuscript. The authors took in account most of my comments (and
probably those from other reviewers as well). The main message of the paper is that demographic
reconstruction based on the analysis of mtDNA data by BEAST software would reflect
demographic changes of ‘ancient population source’ potentially located in other regions than the
current one. Although not really new, this perspective is emphasized by the paper to advice for a
more cautious interpretation of results from such an analysis. The manuscript is well written.

accessibility section should state where the article's supporting data can be accessed. This section
should also include details, where possible of where to access other relevant research materials
such as statistical tools, protocols, software etc can be accessed. If the data has been deposited in
an external repository this section should list the database, accession number and link to the DOI
for all data from the article that has been made publicly available. Data sets that have been
deposited in an external repository and have a DOI should also be appropriately cited in the

Please declare any financial or non-financial competing interests, or state that you have no
competing interests.
• Authors’ contributions
All submissions, other than those with a single author, must include an Authors’ Contributions
section which individually lists the specific contribution of each author. The list of Authors
should meet all of the following criteria; 1) substantial contributions to conception and design, or

acknowledgements.
We suggest the following format:
AB carried out the molecular lab work, participated in data analysis, carried out sequence
alignments, participated in the design of the study and drafted the manuscript; CD carried out
the statistical analyses; EF collected field data; GH conceived of the study, designed the study,
coordinated the study and helped draft the manuscript. All authors gave final approval for
publication.
• Acknowledgements

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
5
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript. Make sure it is clear in your data accessibility statement how the data
can be accessed;
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article
so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Rees Kassen):
Associate Editor: 1
Comments to the Author:
This paper uses coalescent approaches based on mtDNA sequence variation to make inferences
about the demographic history of a number of human groups. The work is interesting and I find
it compelling. I am not persuaded by the more negative reviewer's comments that there are
fundamental problems with the work, or that it has been duplicated elsewhere. Given that the
more positive reviewer is satisfied that their concerns have been addressed and in light of the fact
that the manuscript contains a more nuanced interpretation of the data that acknowledges very
directly the limitations of the approach used, I see no reason why the ms should not be accepted.
I therefore recommend it be published following the minor revision suggested by the second
reviewer.
