Comments to RSOS-180146:
This paper use a traditional electroless plating process to fabricate Ni-decorated h-BN powders
with the addition of ChCl-EG ionic liquid and different electroless plating times. The author gives
the systematic researches about the micrograph of Ni particles on h-BN powders with the effect
of ChCl-EG concentration and plating times. There are many highlights, for example, 30g/L
ChCl-EG as additive is conducive to the deposition phenomenon of the uniform and dispersed Ni
particles on h-BN. The agglomeration of Ni particles comes to reduce with the increase of plating
times when ChCl-EG is added. In addition, there are clear research ideas and accurate expression.
The results are interesting and I would like to recommend the manuscript acceptance after the
following minor revisions.
(1) What is the concrete experimental steps to fabricate Ni-decorated h-BN powders in section 2.4,
not experimental conditions?
(2) Why did not the initial concentration of Ni2+ show in fig.2a? Is it necessary to add this
parameter to the figure?
(3) In the introduction parts, the authors should point out the highlights of your work, and are
encouraged to review or cite the correlative Refs about the performance and application of h-BN
to display the novelty of your work.
(4) The equation need to be revised because of the non-conservation of elements and charges in
section 3.4.

Appendix A
Dear Alice Powder,
I am grateful to receive your decision letter. Following that, I have answered
each question, corresponding to reviewer 1 and 2. Meantime, I have modified my
manuscript according to those suggestions of reviewers.
Response to reviewer 1:
(1) Response: The concrete experimental steps to fabricate Ni-decorated h-BN
powders in section 2.4 was revised as following:
The electroless deposition of Ni particles on h-BN surface was performed in a
electroless solution with Ni2+. The composition and concentration of the materials
used in the electroless nickel bath was presented in Table 1. First, 25g NiSO4•6H2O
was dissolved with 100mL deionized water under the mechanical stirring speed of
300rpm. Similarly, 16.5g NaH2PO2•H2O and 20g C6H5Na3O7•2H2O can also be
respectively dissolved with 100ml deionized water under 300rpm. 12.5g H3BO3 was
dissolved with 200ml deionized water under 300rpm and 40oC. Then,
NaH2PO2•H2O solution, C6H5Na3O7•2H2O solution and H3BO3 solution was added
into NiSO4•6H2O solution in turn under 500rpm. A small amount of NaOH solution
was added into the above mixture solution to adjust pH of 8-9. Thus, the electroless
plating bath was obtained according to above steps. 5g h-BN was added into the
above 500mL electroless plating bath. Following that, ChCl-EG (0g/L, 30g/L,
60g/L, 90g/L) as additive were studied in the paper [4]. Besides, different plating
nickel times (1 times, 3 times, 5 times) were selected to investigate the deposition
phenomenon of Ni particles on h-BN surface. All reactions were carried out with a
mechanical stirring speed of 300 rpm/min and 60oC. The Ni-decorated h-BN
powders were characterized after washed with distilled water for several times,
filtrated and dried in a vacuum oven at 353K for 6h. The electroless deposition
experiments were repeated with three times to ensure the reproducibility.
(2) Response: The value of the initial Ni2+ concentration was 50g/L, and it was
larger than the residual Ni2+ concentration, so it was not necessary to show in fig.2a.
(3) Response: The highlights of our work has pointed out at the end of the
introduction. Some references about fabrication and application of h-BN have
reviewed and cited in the work, including [1] Gu JW, Lv ZY, Wu YL, Guo YQ, Tian
LD, Qiu H, Li WZ, Zhang QY. 2017 Dielectric thermally conductive boron

27-32. (doi: 10.1016/j.compositesa.2016.11.002)
(4) Response: I am sorry to write the wrong formula, and I will correct it as shown
below:
Ni2+ + H2 PO- - 2- 0
2 + 3OH <U+2192> HPO3 + Ni (s) + 2H2 O
(<U+2206>r G<U+03B8> = -258.62kJ/mol) (1)
[Ni(Cit)3- ]- + H2 PO2- - 0
2 + 3OH <U+2192> Ni (s) + Cit
3-
+ HPO2-
3 +2H2 O
((<U+2206>r G<U+03B8> = -213.60kJ/mol)) (2)
Besides, the following text will be added in the manuscript:
The standard free energy is the negative value, so the reaction of reducing Ni2+ is
spontaneous. Meantime, those energies of temperature and mechanical stirring
speed were implemented to speed up the reaction.
Response to reviewer 2:
1. Response: The sentence “Electroless plating nickel particles on hexagonal boron
nitride (h-BN) of ceramic powders are investigated in this paper” are modified to
another sentence “Ni-decorated h-BN powders are fabricated with ChCl-EG as
additive via electroless plating in the paper.”
2. Response: Those suggested references have cited in the manuscript, including:
