The authors report an extremely interesting and new means of preparing epoxides of C60.
Remarkably, they find that their procedure produces a different isomer of C60O2 than that
formed in the oxidation with m-chloroperoxybenzioc acid. The work seem well documented,
and other laboratories should be able to adopt their procedure for other oxidations of organic
compounds.
The authors may want to consider the following issues.
In general solutions of fullerene epoxides produced by other means slowly form precipitates
apparently due to polymerization. Is that also the case with the epoxides produced by this new
means? That is: is the polymerization a property of the fullerene epoxide or is it due to chemical
impurities remaining in the fullerene epoxides?
What other oxidations can be accomplished using their plasma jet procedure? I am sure you have
already studied the oxidation of C70.

Jiang et al report oxidation of C60 producing C60O and C60O2 etc by using oxygen plasma jet.
They obtained oxidized C60 and characterized products properly. They performed theoretical
calculation to investigate addition pattern in the isolated C60O2 isomer. Experiments and
discussion are considered reasonable and proper. I can suggest acceptance of this manuscript for
publication in Royal Society of Open Science with this form.

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
4
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Response to Referee 1:
We appreciate the reviewer for his/her comments.
Precipitates were also apparently observed during the formation of C60On under the
plasma conditions. However, we are not certain if the formation of the precipitates was
due to polymerization. We, therefore, simply changed“…to give a claret-red solution,
which was analysed…” to “…to give a claret-red solution along with brown precipitates,
which did not dissolve in commonly used organic solvents [14,16]. The solution was
analysed” and cited the related references.
We indeed studied the oxidation of C70, yet no good result was obtained. We added
“In addition, we had also preliminarily studied the oxidation of C70 under the plasma
conditions. Unfortunately, much less of C70 was converted when compared with C60,
likely due to its lower reactivity (see figure S17<U+2012>S19 in Electronic Supplementary
Material). Therefore, the oxidation of C70 by plasma jet was not investigated in more
details.” to the main text, and added S17<U+2012>S19 in Electronic Supplementary Material.
