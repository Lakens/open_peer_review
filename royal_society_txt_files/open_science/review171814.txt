In this paper, the authors has reported a self-delivery AmB-conjugated hydrogels containing
Asp-Lys (DK) dipeptide fragments to not only enhance antifungal activity but also construct
molecular hydrogelators. This is a interesting work and the results are supporting the hypothesis
of authors mentioned. Thus, this paper is suitable for published on Royal Society Open Science
as a research paper before the issues below got solved:

1. The title should be revised. “novel innovative strategy” is not a good form of expression. The
authors should use either “novel strategy” or “innovative strategy”.
2. In the synthesis of peptide gelators, the description on Nap-ended process and Npx-ended
process were missed. In the case of Dex-end one, Dex was coupled to the peptide after AmB was
conjugated. How to prevent the reaction of SA with the amino group on AmB?
3. The preparation of hydrogels, the procedures should be described more detailedly. In its
present format, the author stated that “All the compounds (about 4.0mg) were dissolved in 150µl
of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH7.4). The pH of the solutions were adjusted to neutral by
0.1mol/L of Na2CO3 (about 50µl) and measured by pH paper.” It is not clear in which step the
Na2CO3 was added. The PBS itself is in neutral pH, why is the Na2CO3 needed to adjust the pH

keep it bioactivity compared with native AmB? It’s better to conduct a contrast test using native
and released AmB at a serious of concentration.
5. In the drug release test, how to obtain the M8? Is this the actual drug content in the conjugates?
6. As described by the authors, the gelators are highly dissoluble in the aqueous solutions. What
might be the trigger of gelation? The factors that influence the gelation time should be studued
also.
7. The authors claimed that “The Nap-AmB, Npx-AmB and Dex-AmB hydrogels self-assembly
may act as ligand molecules which bind to fungal ergosterol like a receptor while its toxic activity
might be diminished.” Is there any evidence to support this declaration? How did the peptide
gelators affect the higher order molecular formation? Did “molecular formation” mean
conformation?
8. What information could be concluded from the CD spectra? The differences in CD spectra
might originate from the peptide conformation. In this work, since the sequence was changeless,
the differences in conformation might be mainly from the end groups (Nap-, Npx-, and Fmoc-),
thus their influence should be discussed.
9. For native AmB, the MIC and MBC were 0.00406 mg/mL and 0.130 mg/mL, respectively. But
the Nap-AmB, Npx-AmB, and Dex-AmB, the MICs were 0.0107, 0.0437 and 0.0401 mg/mL,
respectively; the MBCs were 0.171, 0.349, and 0.643, respectively. How could the “enhancement
of therapeutic efficacy” be concluded from these data?
10. Some minor typo- errors should be revised. Please check the manuscript carefully and

We have given the k value for the calculation as followings:
For Nap-AmB hydrogels, the rate constant values k of AmB released from 2.0 wt%, 3.0

0.6379 (r = 0.9083), respectively. Similarly, the rate constant values k are approximately
0.2846 (r = 0.9263), 0.3358 (r = 0.9152) and 0.4387 (r = 0.9081) for 2.0 wt%, 3.0 wt%, and
4.0 wt% Npx-AmB hydrogels, respectively. For Dex-AmB hydrogels, the rate constant
values k of AmB released from 2.0 wt%, 3.0 wt%, and 4.0 wt% hydrogels are about 0.2283 (r
= 0.9041), 0.3669 (r = 0.9255) and 0.6436 (r = 0.9143), respectively. The rate constant values
k of the Dex released from 2.0 wt%, 3.0 wt%, and 4.0 wt% Dex-AmB hydrogels are
approximately 0.1211 (r = 0.9104),0.3039 (r = 0.9037) and 0.6024 (r = 0.9068),
respectively. For all hydrogels, the rate constant values k approximately increases with

In this work, Shu et al. developed small molecule peptide hydrogels that conjugated Amphotericin
B (AmB) for antifungal functions. The Amphotericin B-conjugated hydrogelators assembled to
form nanofibers in neutral condition and allowed the gelation. AmB that was conjugated in the
peptide gelators was released in a controlled manner and showed antifungal activity against
Candida albicans. This manuscript needs major revision before it can be accepted for publication.
1. The title should be revised. “novel innovative strategy” is not a good form of expression. The
authors should use either “novel strategy” or “innovative strategy”.
We have revised the title as followings: Amphotericin B-conjugated poly-peptide hydrogels as
a novel strategy for fungal infections.
3. In the synthesis of peptide gelators, the description on Nap-ended process and Npx-ended
process were missed. In the case of Dex-end one, Dex was coupled to the peptide after AmB
was conjugated. How to prevent the reaction of SA with the amino group on AmB?
(1) The synthesis processes of Nap-ended, Npx-ended and Fmoc-ended peptide gelators were
similar. When the last Fmoc-protected amino acid (Fmoc-Phe) was coupled, the 2-naphthalene
acetic acid (Nap) or Naproxen (Npx) was coupled using HBTU (2 equiv.) and HOBt (2 equiv.)
as the coupling reagent, which were carried out by the standard SPPS protocol. At the final
step, the peptide was cleaved with TFA for 2 hours. The ice-cold diethylether was added, and
then was centrifuged for 10 min at 4,000rpm. The resulting precipitates were dissolved in
9
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and purified by reverse phase high preparative performance liquid
chromatography (HPPLC, Agilent1200, and America). The synthetic route of Nap-FFDKY
compound, Npx-FFDKY compound and Fmoc-FFDKY compound were described as
followings (In part “supporting information”):
Fig. S1 Synthetic route of Nap-FFDKY compound.
Fig. S4 Synthetic route of Npx-FFDKY compound.
10
Fig. S7 Synthetic route of Fmoc-FFDKY compound.
(2) As the reviewer said, there was some Dex-SA with the amino group on AmB as by-product.
Compared to Dex-AmB target product, the by-product of Dex-SA-AmB was less. It might be
related to the reaction mechanism or steric hindrance effect. In the synthesis we have purified
the Dex-AmB target product by reverse phase high preparative performance liquid
chromatography. The pure yellow powder Dex-AmB hydrogelators was obtained with yield of
35.1%.

Fig. S16 Synthetic route of Dex-AmB compound.
3. The preparation of hydrogels, the procedures should be described more detailedly. In its
present format, the author stated that “All the compounds (about 4.0mg) were dissolved in
150µl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH7.4). The pH of the solutions were adjusted to
neutral by 0.1mol/L of Na2CO3 (about 50µl) and measured by pH paper.” It is not clear in
which step the Na2CO3 was added. The PBS itself is in neutral pH, why is the Na2CO3 needed
to adjust the pH to neutral value?
The phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) is in neutral pH7.4. When the compounds were
dissolved the pH was below 7. So the 2 equiv. of Na2CO3 (0.1mol/L) were used to neutralize
the two carboxyl groups (-COOH) of compounds and adjust the pH to neutral value. We have
12
revised in the part “2.4 Hydrogels formation” of manuscript as followings:
2.4 Hydrogels formation
General procedure for formation of hydrogels: All the compounds were dissolved in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH7.4). 2 equiv. of Na2CO3 (0.1mol/L) were used to
neutralize the carboxyl groups (-COOH) of compounds and adjust the pH to neutral value.
Then the hydrogels were formed at room temperature (22~25<U+2103>) or 37<U+2103> within 30 min.
4. In the drug release test, trypsin was added to degrade the peptide. Thus the released AmB
would bear an amino acid residue, in this case lysine, at its carboxylic acid site. Would it
influence the measurement of drug release through HPLC? In addition, could the released
AmB keep it bioactivity compared with native AmB? It’s better to conduct a contrast test using
native and released AmB at a serious of concentration.
(1) In the HPLC test of drug release, the mixture sample was treated by centrifugation with
13,000rpm for 10 min. The AmB and Dex concentration in the supernatant solution was
detected by HPLC quantitatively. So the trypsin did not influence the results of the drug
release experiment.
(2) We have conduct a contrast test using native and released AmB at a serious of concentration in
antifungal assay to evaluate bioactivity (Fig.7). The AmB exhibits the antifungal activity with
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 0.00406 mg/mL and minimum bactericidal
concentration (MBC) value of 0.130 mg/mL respectively, which are consistent with the
previous literature reports. The Nap-AmB, Npx-AmB and Dex-AmB hydrogels significantly
exhibit the antifungal activity with MIC values of 0.0107, 0.0437 and 0.0401 mg/mL
respectively, and MBC values of 0.171, 0.349 and 0.643 mg/mL respectively. Results indicate
that the released AmB drugs from hydrogels had similar antifungal bioactivity to native AmB.
Furthermore, we obtained the detailed information about antifungal efficacy as a function of
both time and concentration by time-killing test (Fig.8) to assess the antifungal bioactivity of
released AmB. The concentration-dependent action of AmB and AmB-conjugated hydrogels
are confirmed by time-kill curves. Moreover, the curves also reveal the time-dependent action
between them. The time-kill curves show the AmB and Nap-AmB, Npx-AmB and Dex-AmB
hydrogels exhibit antifungal activity since 2 hours. The Npx-AmB and Dex-AmB hydrogels
exert fungistatic effect more quickly than AmB and Nap-AmB hydrogels. Discernible
improvement in the extent of antifungal activity and the slope function of the time-kill curve to
each sample is noted as the amount of drug in solution increased. Marked concentration
13
dependent antifungal activity was also observed, what's more, the rate and extent of antifungal
activity varied over time and the time to achieve an antifungal endpoint was shortened as the
dose increased.

5. In the drug release test, how to obtain the M8? Is this the actual drug content in the conjugates?
This is the actual drug content in the conjugates. We have given calculation examples of
the M8 as followings:
(1) Nap-AmB Hydrogels in PBS (pH = 7.4) solution contain 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 wt% of Nap-AmB
(MW = 1791.9) compound. So the AmB (MW = 924.1) in the hydrogels is about 10.3, 15.5
and 20.6 mg/ml.
MAmB / MHydrogel * C = 924.1 / 1791.9 * 2.0 % = 10.3 mg/ml
MAmB / MHydrogel * C = 924.1 / 1791.9 * 3.0% = 15.5 mg/ml
MAmB / MHydrogel * C = 924.1 / 1791.9 * 4.0 % = 20.6 mg/ml
(2) Npx-AmB Hydrogels in PBS (pH = 7.4) solution contain 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 wt% of
Nap-AmB (MW = 1835.9) compound. So the AmB (MW = 924.1) in the hydrogels is about
10.1, 15.1 and 20.1 mg/ml.
MAmB / MHydrogel * C = 924.1 / 1835.9 * 2.0 % = 10.1 mg/ml
MAmB / MHydrogel * C = 924.1 / 1835.9 * 3.0% = 15.1 mg/ml
MAmB / MHydrogel * C = 924.1 / 1835.9 * 4.0 % = 20.1 mg/ml
(3) Dex-AmB Hydrogels in PBS (pH = 7.4) solution contain 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 wt% of Dex-AmB
(MW = 2098.1) compound. So the AmB (MW = 924.1) in the hydrogels is about 8.81, 13.2
and 17.6 mg/ml.
MAmB / MHydrogel * C = 924.1 / 2098.1 * 2.0 % = 8.81 mg/ml
MAmB / MHydrogel * C = 924.1 / 2098.1 * 3.0% = 13.2 mg/ml
MAmB / MHydrogel * C = 924.1 / 2098.1 * 4.0 % = 17.6 mg/ml
(4) Dex-AmB Hydrogels in PBS (pH = 7.4) solution contain 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 wt% of Dex-AmB
(MW = 2098.1) compound. So the Dex (MW = 392.5) in the hydrogels is about 3.74, 5.61
and 7.48 mg/ml.
15
MDex / MHydrogel * C = 392.5 / 2098.1 * 2.0 % = 3.74 mg/ml
MDex / MHydrogel * C = 392.5 / 2098.1 * 3.0% = 5.61 mg/ml
MDex / MHydrogel * C = 392.5 / 2098.1 * 4.0 % = 7.48 mg/ml
6. As described by the authors, the gelators are highly dissoluble in the aqueous solutions. What
might be the trigger of gelation? The factors that influence the gelation time should be studued
also.
(1) The dipeptide of phenylalanine (FF) has been widely used to construct molecular
hydrogelators. We successfully synthesized the Nap-FFDK(AmB)Y, Npx-FFDK(AmB)Y and
Dex-FFDK(AmB)Y hydrogelators.
(2) There are many factors that influence the gelation time including temperature, pH,
heating-cooling cycle, hydrolysis, light irradiation, enzymatic triggeration and so on. In our
research we form the hydrogels through following general procedure: All the compounds
were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH7.4). 2 equiv. of Na2CO3 (0.1mol/L)
were used to neutralize the two carboxyl groups (-COOH) of compounds and adjust the pH to
neutral value. Then the hydrogels were formed at room temperature (22~25<U+2103>) or 37<U+2103>
within 30 min. The gelation times are different, falling within 3 min, 10 min and
approximately 30 min for Nap-AmB, Npx-AmB and Dex-AmB hydrogels, respectively, at
room temperature. The minimum gel concentration of Nap-AmB, Npx-AmB and Dex-AmB
hydrogels needed for gelation is about 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 wt%, respectively, in PBS solutions at
37 <U+2103>.
7. The authors claimed that “The Nap-AmB, Npx-AmB and Dex-AmB hydrogels self-assembly
may act as ligand molecules which bind to fungal ergosterol like a receptor while its toxic
activity might be diminished.” Is there any evidence to support this declaration? How did the
peptide gelators affect the higher order molecular formation? Did “molecular formation” mean
conformation?
Amphotericin B (AmB) is a broad-spectrum antifungal macrolide polyene antibiotic. Its
antifungal effect is exerted by forming complexes with membrane ergosterols to allow the
increase in permeability of the fungal membrane. It is well known, AmB is a macrolide
polyene chemotherapeutic that exists in three different aggregation states: monomer, dimer,
and poly-aggregate, which have exhibited different safety profiles. AmB is believed to
self-assemble into higher-order molecular forms that result in its toxic property. So the
immobilization of this drug on a substrate or attachment would minimize its chance of
self-assembly and would enhance its efficacy towards target binding (ergosterol), thus
16
diminishing its toxicity. In our research we design and synthesize several AmB-conjugated
poly-peptide hydrogels as a novel strategy for fungal infections. In order to express clearly, we
have modified the corresponding part “3.2 TEM and SEM micrographs”of the manuscript: The
Nap-AmB, Npx-AmB and Dex-AmB hydrogels self-assembly would minimize AmB
molecular chance of self-assembly and enhance its efficacy towards target binding (ergosterol),
thus diminishing its toxicity. The reference is as followings:

8. What information could be concluded from the CD spectra? The differences in CD spectra
might originate from the peptide conformation. In this work, since the sequence was
changeless, the differences in conformation might be mainly from the end groups (Nap-, Npx-,
and Fmoc-), thus their influence should be discussed.
(1) Circular dichroism (CD) is dichroism involving circularly polarized light, i.e., the differential
absorption of left- and right-handed light. Left-hand circular (LHC) and right-hand circular
(RHC) polarized light represent two possible spin angular momentum states for a photon, and
so circular dichroism is also referred to as dichroism for spin angular momentum. This
phenomenon was discovered by Jean-Baptiste Biot, Augustin Fresnel, and Aimé Cotton in the
first half of the 19th century. It is exhibited in the absorption bands of optically active chiral
molecules. CD spectroscopy has a wide range of applications in many different fields. Most
notably, UV CD is used to investigate the secondary structure of proteins. In our research, the
CD spectra of the solution hydrogels further help elucidate the molecular arrangement and the
secondary structure in gel phase.
(2) As the reviewer points out, since the sequence was changeless, so the difference is quite small.

Except that Fmoc-FFDKY hydrogels exhibits the existence of ß-like structure features, and the
Nap-FFDKY, Nap-AmB, Npx-FFDKY, Npx-AmB, Dex-AmB hydrogels exhibits the
existence of turn structures features. We have discussed based on the data and results in part of
“3.5 CD spectra” as followings:
3.4 CD spectra
The CD spectra of the solution of blank carriers and the corresponding drug deliveries
further help elucidate the molecular arrangement in gel phase. The CD spectrum of
Nap-FFDKY hydrogels exhibits positive peak near 198 nm, a broad positive band near 217
nm, negative peak near 207 nm and nagtive peak near 230nm, indicating the existence of turn
features. The positive peak of Nap-AmB hydrogels at 217 nm agrees with the Nap-FFDKY
hydrogels in a turn secondary structure (Fig.5A). For Npx-FFDKY hydrogels, the spectrum
exhibits positive peak near 200 nm, a broad positive band near 220 nm, negative peak near
215 nm and negative broad peak near 232nm, indicating the existence of turn features. The
positive peak of Npx-AmB hydrogels at 200 nm and 232 nm are similar to the Npx-FFDKY
hydrogels in a turn features structure (Fig.5B). Fmoc-FFDKY hydrogels exhibits positive
peak near 197 nm and a broad negative peak near 218 nm, indicating the existence of ß-like
features. Dex-AmB hydrogels exhibits different CD spectrum. There are positive peak near
197 nm and a broad positive peak near 220 nm, indicating the existence of turn features
(Fig.5C).

9. For native AmB, the MIC and MBC were 0.00406 mg/mL and 0.130 mg/mL, respectively. But
the Nap-AmB, Npx-AmB, and Dex-AmB, the MICs were 0.0107, 0.0437 and 0.0401 mg/mL,
respectively; the MBCs were 0.171, 0.349, and 0.643, respectively. How could the
“enhancement of therapeutic efficacy” be concluded from these data?
We concluded the enhancement of therapeutic efficacy based on data results of MIC,
MBC and time-kill curves tests. From the MIC and MBC value we get the following
conclusion: The Nap-AmB, Npx-AmB and Dex-AmB hydrogels significantly exhibit the
antifungal activity with MIC values of 0.0107, 0.0437 and 0.0401 mg/mL respectively, and
MBC values of 0.171, 0.349 and 0.643 mg/mL respectively. These findings illustrate an
innovative strategy to significantly inhibit fungal strains as low amount of AmB.

Furthermore, we obtained the detailed information about antifungal efficacy as a
function of both time and concentration by time-killing test (Fig.8) to assess the
pharmacodynamics of each antifungal agent. The concentration-dependent action of AmB
and AmB-conjugated hydrogels are confirmed by time-kill curves. Moreover, the curves also
reveal the time-dependent action between them. The time-kill curves show the AmB and
Nap-AmB, Npx-AmB and Dex-AmB hydrogels exhibit antifungal activity since 2 hours. The
Npx-AmB and Dex-AmB hydrogels exert fungistatic effect more quickly than AmB and
Nap-AmB hydrogels. Discernible improvement in the extent of antifungal activity and the
slope function of the time-kill curve to each sample is noted as the amount of drug in solution
increased. Marked concentration dependent antifungal activity was also observed, what's
more, the rate and extent of antifungal activity varied over time and the time to achieve an
antifungal endpoint was shortened as the dose increased. In addition, the AmB-conjugated
hydrogels resulted in strikingly improvement in extent of activity and trend toward a shorter
time to the antifungal endpoint versus AmB agents.
