The present manuscript describes a pre-registered study on the effects of tDCS (in combination
with response inhibition training) on food craving and consumption in a large non-clinical
sample. In contrast to the majority of previous studies (but in line with few other studies), the
current study did not find evidence for decreases in food craving and consumption when
applying tDCS. Overall, the manuscript is well-written and most parts are concisely and clearly
described. Specifically, I appreciate the authors’ efforts to pre-register their study and that they
make any deviations from the study protocol as transparent as possible. However, there remain a
few unanswered questions. Specific comments and questions are listed below:
Introduction
- The terms “hedonic factors” and “hedonic eating” (p.2, l.42 and l.51) should be defined and
examples for these terms may be provided. Furthermore, a definition of food craving—as one of
the main outcomes—is missing and the term is mentioned rather late in the introduction section
(p.3). Food craving (= strong desire to consume a specific type of food that can occur in the
absence of hunger) often leads to consumption of the craved food and, thus, a stronger rationale
for investigating both food craving and consumption should be provided earlier in the
manuscript by including a few more sentences on food craving in the first or second paragraph of
the introduction.
- Additionally, some further information on the dlPFC would be fine (p.2, second paragraph);
why is it a brain region that might be of relevance in terms of food craving and consumption?
- Page 5, ll.35 to 44 (“the snack buffet contains … used by Adams et al. (2017)”): this information
should be moved to the method section as it contains methodological details, which appear
misplaced at the end of the introduction.
- The term “commission errors” should be defined when first mentioned as the statement “fewer
commission errors” might be unclear for readers who are unfamiliar with go/no-go tasks (e.g.,
that more commission errors indicate lower inhibitory control).
Deviations from the pre-registered study protocol
- I had a look at the pre-registration on osf.io where it says that participants will be either
allocated to a go or a no-go training condition (see Figure 1 and corresponding figure caption of
the pre-registration protocol). Furthermore, all pre-registered hypotheses included the factor
“training condition” (go vs. no-go training) next to the factor “tDCS condition” (sham vs. active
stimulation). However, in the current version of the manuscript, it reads as if the authors first
tested all participants of the no-go condition, then analyzed the data, and then decided not to test
the second training group, which seems like a rather large deviation from the pre-registered data
collection. Particularly, allocating participants usually means that participants are randomly
assigned to either go training or no-go training. The authors should, therefore, justify why they
decided to exclusively recruit and test participants for the no-go training. Furthermore, this
information should be moved from the footnote to the section “deviations from the protocol”
(p.11).
- In their pre-registration, the authors hypothesized that the effects of tDCS would be stronger in
individuals with elevated restrained eating scores. The authors argued that only a few
3
participants met the cutoff score of 15 (and higher) to be classified as restrained eaters. This
argument, however, deserves some scrutiny: Indeed, it is not surprising that restrained eating
scores are lower in the current sample than suggested by Herman & Polivy (1980) given that all
fasting and dieting individuals were excluded from participation. Of note, the recommendation
of the cutoff score of 15 by Herman & Polivy (1980) is merely based on studies from the 1970s
when restrained and unrestrained eaters were defined by median splits of continuous Restraint
Scale scores. That is, the Restraint Scale does not have a real cut-off value that defines when a
person is a restrained eater, but it just happened in most US studies that the median of Restraint
Scale scores in their samples were about 15. Moreover, the underlying studies were all conducted
in North America over 30 years ago and, thus, likely cannot be applied to European samples or
the current one. In fact, it was found that individuals from Britain or the Netherlands generally
score lower on the Restraint Scale than US samples (for more information, see footnote 2 in
Jansen, Louwerse, Leemans, & Schouten, 1998: “Self-Esteem as a Better Predictor of Restrained
Eaters' Food Intake than Attributional Style and Disinhibition Tendency”). Despite these cultural
aspects, there are also some statistical considerations that dichotomizing data (e.g., via median
split) is not advisable. Rucker et al. (2015), for example, concluded that: “We show that
dichotomizing a continuous variable via the median split procedure or otherwise and analyzing
the resulting data via ANOVA involves a large number of costs that can be avoided by
preserving the continuous nature of the variable and analyzing the data via linear regression.”
Amongst older works, these costs and shortcomings are also described in recently published
papers (e.g., Rucker, McShane, & Preacher, 2015: “A researcher's guide to regression,
discretization, and median splits of continuous variables”; McClelland, Lynch, Irwin, Spiller, &
Fitzsimons, 2015: “Median splits, Type II errors, and false–positive consumer psychology: Don't
fight the power”). To conclude, rather than artificially categorizing the sample into groups and
using the rather arbitrary cutoff score of 15, which likely does not apply to the current sample, I
would recommend including restrained eating as a continuous predictor in multilevel models.
For example, time (pre vs. post-tDCS) can be modeled on level 1, and tDCS condition (sham vs.
active) as well as restrained eating and their interaction can be modeled on level 2 when
predicting state food craving. Thus, data should be reanalyzed or—at least—the reasoning for not
analyzing restrained eating should be revised.
Methods
- Were the food images obtained from a standardized database or where they self-made? Which
definitions were used for deciding whether a food item belonged to the healthy or unhealthy
category? For example, with 404 kcal/100g breadsticks seem rather high-caloric although they
were classified as healthy (the same is true for rice bread).
- On p.9, l.22 it says that the cover story was the “measurement of cognitive performance before
and after food consumption”; on p.5, l.39 it reads that the cover story contained “the
measurement of glucose levels on cognitive performance”. Were there two different stories
provided (i.e., one for food consumption and one for the overall study aim)?
- Measurement of food craving (p.8, ll.9ff): the Food Cravings Questionnaire-State was originally
developed by Cepeda-Benito et al. (2000). There is, however, a modified (“general”) version of
the Food Cravings Questionnaire available (Nijs, Franken, & Muris, 2006), which is usually
abbreviated with “G-FCQ-S”. As it seems that the authors used the original version by Cepeda-
Benito and colleagues, the prefix “G-“ should be omitted throughout the manuscript to avoid
confusion with this modified version (that is, it should just read “FCQ-S”). Moreover, several
subscales are described in the method section, but it should be further stated that a total score can
be calculated (ranging from 1 to 75) and that this was done in the current study. This way,
readers can make more sense of the magnitude of FCQ-S scores, for example, in the
supplementary table 2.
- Procedure section: the authors may move the questionnaires mentioned in the procedure to the
questionnaire section and may separate the questionnaire section into “filler questionnaires” and
“task-relevant questionnaires”; item wordings and response formats of the Visual Analogue Scale
4
items (hunger, fullness, and desire to eat), the pain and nausea questions, and the debriefing
questions should be stated in this section or in the supplementary material.
Results
- The authors stated that there were no differences in craving subscales and, thereby, reference to
Supplementary Table 2 (p.11, l.22). However, results of the craving subscales are neither
presented in this table nor in the main text and, thus, this statement should be either omitted or
the results should be added to the revised version of the manuscript.
- There is no reference to Supplementary Table 7 in the main text of the manuscript; Furthermore,
the table caption reads as if correlational analyses were conducted (i.e., “relationship between
group characteristics and total food consumption”). Therefore, it is not clear why t-values are
reported instead of correlation coefficients. If linear regressions were conducted, it should be
stated that either simple (each predictor separately) or multiple (each predictor at the same time)
regressions were applied. Were the results independent of the tDCS condition (i.e., were the
active and sham condition aggregated after testing for moderating effects?). In the pre-
registration, it reads that significant predictors will be included as covariates in all other analyses.
As BMI was significant, did the inclusion of BMI change the results (if (or if) not should be stated
in the manuscript).
Discussion
- Page 16, ll.27 to 51: Hill (2007) states that craving for sweets are more frequent but does not
provide evidence that these are more intense. Thus, another reference may be necessary here to
back up this statement. The authors refer to their sweet vs. savory analyses in the discussion
section but discussion sections usually do not include cross references to tables of the results
section. Thus, these results (or reference to them) should be included earlier (e.g., on page 12).
The same is true for the individual food analyses (reference to them and to Table 8 is missing in
the main text and, thus, should be provided—otherwise it is likely that readers will not pay
attention to these results).
Figures
- Reference to Figure 1 is missing in the main text.
- It seems that Figure 1 is a screenshot of a table with some red underlined words. The authors
may want to consider re-doing the screenshot after disabling the spellchecker.
Minor points
- The abbreviation dlPFC should be explained when first mentioned (p.2, l.55)
- The abbreviation ITI should be abbreviated when inter-trial interval is first mentioned (p.8, l.28)
- The abbreviation “VAS” is superfluous as the term is never mentioned again in the manuscript
(p.9, l.27).
- Tables and figures should be self-explanatory and, thus, abbreviations should be avoided or
should be explained in the table notes or in the figure caption (e.g., “ITI” in figure 2, kcal in Table
5, “SE” in all tables)
- The references of Tabachnick & Fidell (2007) and Herman & Polivy (1980) do not appear in the
reference list. Thus, the authors may check if all cited references in the main text appear in the
reference list and vice versa.
- I was wondering about the different decimals of the p-values. For example, p = .007 or p =.63 or
p=.1 (e.g., p.11, paragraph “tDCS tolerability and blinding”). Were the p-values rounded or were
the zeros omitted (e.g., a p-value of .1 should read .100)? I would suggest reporting three
decimals for p-values throughout.
I hope the authors find my comments and suggestions helpful and constructive.
Yours sincerely,

label_comment_2
This manuscript describes the findings of a preregistered single-session trial examining the effects
of bilateral tDCS (coupled with inhibitory control training) targeting the dlPFC on food cravings
and consumption. Stimulation intensity was set to 2mA, and the sample consisted of 172 healthy
adult females. Outcomes were food craving, ad libitum food consumption, and response
inhibition. Findings indicated no effect of active tDCS on any of the primary outcome measures in
pre-registered analyses. This is a very strong submission in my view, and I have mostly minor
suggestions and positive comments (no response necessary in the case of the latter):
1. This is a well planned and executed study, including pre-registration of protocol and target
outcomes (very rare in the tDCS literature). The stimulation intensity is the correct magnitude
based on recent meta-analyses on tDCS eating related outcomes; such effects appear to be nearly
absent below 2mA (see Hall et al, 2018, Nutritional Neuroscience), and generally questionable
efficacy in relation to food outcomes regardless of stimulation level (Lowe et al., 2017) in single-
session format.
2. The anode/cathode arrangement is not bilateral excitatory stimulation, but rather excitatory
right and inhibitory left (probably). This combination is not the same as bilateral excitatory
stimulation of both, and so the language in the manuscript should reflect this, and some note of
this issue in the discussion would be warranted (but briefly noted, given that the discussion is
already quite long). A related issue is that the choice of anode/cathode—and the fact that the
montage in this case was anode F4 and cathode F3—could produce null findings due to
inhibitory effects of the cathode on the left dlPFC (rather than absence of excitatory effects on the
right, or null bilateral excitatory effects). On the other hand, it is the case that this very
arrangement has resulted in improvements in inhibitory control and craving regulation in several
prior studies; for this reason, it is a very defensible arrangement to test in the current study.
3. The sample size was very large for a tDCS, study, and power was sufficient—based on the
6
observed power calculation—to detect an effect observed in two of the earlier trials of tDCS on
eating outcomes.
4. The current study involved a combined paradigm involving both tDCS (sham or active as per
the above montage description) and inhibitory training. The latter has shown small but reliable
effects on inhibitory control and cravings modulation in prior studies. This was a good design
feature, but could have attenuated the efficacy of cortical stimulation if there are subtle aspects of
inhibitory training that compete with neuromodulation procedures for control over behavior. I
don’t personally believe this, but being devil’s advocate here. This possibility should be
mentioned briefly in the discussion, if the authors agree.
5. A limitation of the study was the use of an all-female sample, this is consistent with other
studies in the literature, and there is good reason for focusing on females (higher dietary restraint
in everyday conditions, possibly more understood in terms response to the food test paradigm).
However, this does limit the generalizability of the findings; currently the findings are not stated
in relation to females, but as general across sexes. Some minor wording adjustment would rectify
this.
6. There should be a citation supporting the validity of the snack buffet paradigm as a measure of
food consumption (for example, see Robinson et al., 2017, Appetite).
7. There are plenty of details in this study indicative of careful attention to methodological details
(e.g., use of filler questionnaires, blinding procedure details). All of these are noted and
appreciated; very well done.
8. The between subjects design was a substantial strength, particularly in relation to the many
existing studies of single-session tDCS, which tend to be within-participant studies. However,
this does mean that the required sample size is much higher in order to achieve the same
statistical power, and the current study does now deviate from others in terms of a major aspect
of the methods.
9. There is a possible limitation regarding the timing of the assessments of food intake, which
ideally should be standardized across all participants, and anchored in relation to major meals of
the day. Perhaps this was indeed done, but additional detail would clarify.
10. There are a few too many references to “pre-registered” in the text. For example, I’m not sure
that it needs to be part of the subheadings in the Methods section. I agree that pre-registration
status should be prominent—it’s a critical strength of the study—but there is too much repetition
of the term currently.
11. The pattern of findings in the exploratory analyses is interesting, given that steering of
consumption in the direction of calories from healthy food is a benefit. The pattern of findings,
however, does reveal the power of pre-registration.
12. The discussion is thorough, thoughtful, and intelligently written. Really, this paper was a
pleasure to read on many levels.
In summary, this manuscript describes a pre-registered double-blind single-session trial
examining the effects of active tDCS compared to sham (both combined with inhibitory control
training), with food cravings and consumption as outcomes. All findings on preregistered
outcomes were null, although some exploratory analyses provided interesting hypotheses to be
tested in future research. There are many design features that—in my view—make this one of the
more well-executed studies in the published tDCS research literature. Moreover, from an analytic
7
standpoint, the substantial sample size coupled with Bayesian analyses increase confidence in the
null findings, and make this a compelling demonstration of the tenuous standing of conventional
tDCS as a modulator of food cravings/consumption when delivered in single-session format.

few unanswered questions. Specific comments and questions are listed below:

measurement of glucose levels on cognitive performance”. Were there two different stories
provided (i.e., one for food consumption and one for the overall study aim)?
- Measurement of food craving (p.8, ll.9ff): the Food Cravings Questionnaire-State was originally
developed by Cepeda-Benito et al. (2000). There is, however, a modified (“general”) version of
the Food Cravings Questionnaire available (Nijs, Franken, & Muris, 2006), which is usually
abbreviated with “G-FCQ-S”. As it seems that the authors used the original version by Cepeda-
Benito and colleagues, the prefix “G-“ should be omitted throughout the manuscript to avoid
confusion with this modified version (that is, it should just read “FCQ-S”). Moreover, several
subscales are described in the method section, but it should be further stated that a total score can
be calculated (ranging from 1 to 75) and that this was done in the current study. This way,
readers can make more sense of the magnitude of FCQ-S scores, for example, in the
supplementary table 2.
- Procedure section: the authors may move the questionnaires mentioned in the procedure to the
questionnaire section and may separate the questionnaire section into “filler questionnaires” and
“task-relevant questionnaires”; item wordings and response formats of the Visual Analogue Scale
items (hunger, fullness, and desire to eat), the pain and nausea questions, and the debriefing
questions should be stated in this section or in the supplementary material.
Results
- The authors stated that there were no differences in craving subscales and, thereby, reference to
Supplementary Table 2 (p.11, l.22). However, results of the craving subscales are neither
presented in this table nor in the main text and, thus, this statement should be either omitted or
the results should be added to the revised version of the manuscript.
- There is no reference to Supplementary Table 7 in the main text of the manuscript; Furthermore,
the table caption reads as if correlational analyses were conducted (i.e., “relationship between
group characteristics and total food consumption”). Therefore, it is not clear why t-values are
reported instead of correlation coefficients. If linear regressions were conducted, it should be
stated that either simple (each predictor separately) or multiple (each predictor at the same time)
regressions were applied. Were the results independent of the tDCS condition (i.e., were the
active and sham condition aggregated after testing for moderating effects?). In the pre-
12
registration, it reads that significant predictors will be included as covariates in all other analyses.
As BMI was significant, did the inclusion of BMI change the results (if (or if) not should be stated
in the manuscript).
Discussion
- Page 16, ll.27 to 51: Hill (2007) states that craving for sweets are more frequent but does not
provide evidence that these are more intense. Thus, another reference may be necessary here to
back up this statement. The authors refer to their sweet vs. savory analyses in the discussion
section but discussion sections usually do not include cross references to tables of the results
section. Thus, these results (or reference to them) should be included earlier (e.g., on page 12).
The same is true for the individual food analyses (reference to them and to Table 8 is missing in
the main text and, thus, should be provided—otherwise it is likely that readers will not pay
attention to these results).
Figures
- Reference to Figure 1 is missing in the main text.
- It seems that Figure 1 is a screenshot of a table with some red underlined words. The authors
may want to consider re-doing the screenshot after disabling the spellchecker.
Minor points
- The abbreviation dlPFC should be explained when first mentioned (p.2, l.55)
- The abbreviation ITI should be abbreviated when inter-trial interval is first mentioned (p.8, l.28)
- The abbreviation “VAS” is superfluous as the term is never mentioned again in the manuscript
(p.9, l.27).
- Tables and figures should be self-explanatory and, thus, abbreviations should be avoided or
should be explained in the table notes or in the figure caption (e.g., “ITI” in figure 2, kcal in Table
5, “SE” in all tables)
- The references of Tabachnick & Fidell (2007) and Herman & Polivy (1980) do not appear in the
reference list. Thus, the authors may check if all cited references in the main text appear in the
reference list and vice versa.
- I was wondering about the different decimals of the p-values. For example, p = .007 or p =.63 or
p=.1 (e.g., p.11, paragraph “tDCS tolerability and blinding”). Were the p-values rounded or were
the zeros omitted (e.g., a p-value of .1 should read .100)? I would suggest reporting three
decimals for p-values throughout.
I hope the authors find my comments and suggestions helpful and constructive.
Yours sincerely,
Anna Richard, University of Salzburg

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript describes the findings of a preregistered single-session trial examining the effects
of bilateral tDCS (coupled with inhibitory control training) targeting the dlPFC on food cravings
and consumption. Stimulation intensity was set to 2mA, and the sample consisted of 172 healthy
adult females. Outcomes were food craving, ad libitum food consumption, and response
inhibition. Findings indicated no effect of active tDCS on any of the primary outcome measures in
pre-registered analyses. This is a very strong submission in my view, and I have mostly minor
suggestions and positive comments (no response necessary in the case of the latter):
1. This is a well planned and executed study, including pre-registration of protocol and target
outcomes (very rare in the tDCS literature). The stimulation intensity is the correct magnitude
based on recent meta-analyses on tDCS eating related outcomes; such effects appear to be nearly
13
absent below 2mA (see Hall et al, 2018, Nutritional Neuroscience), and generally questionable
efficacy in relation to food outcomes regardless of stimulation level (Lowe et al., 2017) in single-
session format.
2. The anode/cathode arrangement is not bilateral excitatory stimulation, but rather excitatory
right and inhibitory left (probably). This combination is not the same as bilateral excitatory
stimulation of both, and so the language in the manuscript should reflect this, and some note of
this issue in the discussion would be warranted (but briefly noted, given that the discussion is
already quite long). A related issue is that the choice of anode/cathode—and the fact that the
montage in this case was anode F4 and cathode F3—could produce null findings due to
inhibitory effects of the cathode on the left dlPFC (rather than absence of excitatory effects on the
right, or null bilateral excitatory effects). On the other hand, it is the case that this very
arrangement has resulted in improvements in inhibitory control and craving regulation in several
prior studies; for this reason, it is a very defensible arrangement to test in the current study.
3. The sample size was very large for a tDCS, study, and power was sufficient—based on the
observed power calculation—to detect an effect observed in two of the earlier trials of tDCS on
eating outcomes.
4. The current study involved a combined paradigm involving both tDCS (sham or active as per
the above montage description) and inhibitory training. The latter has shown small but reliable
effects on inhibitory control and cravings modulation in prior studies. This was a good design
feature, but could have attenuated the efficacy of cortical stimulation if there are subtle aspects of
inhibitory training that compete with neuromodulation procedures for control over behavior. I
don’t personally believe this, but being devil’s advocate here. This possibility should be
mentioned briefly in the discussion, if the authors agree.
5. A limitation of the study was the use of an all-female sample, this is consistent with other
studies in the literature, and there is good reason for focusing on females (higher dietary restraint
in everyday conditions, possibly more understood in terms response to the food test paradigm).
However, this does limit the generalizability of the findings; currently the findings are not stated
in relation to females, but as general across sexes. Some minor wording adjustment would rectify
this.
6. There should be a citation supporting the validity of the snack buffet paradigm as a measure of
food consumption (for example, see Robinson et al., 2017, Appetite).
7. There are plenty of details in this study indicative of careful attention to methodological details
(e.g., use of filler questionnaires, blinding procedure details). All of these are noted and
appreciated; very well done.
8. The between subjects design was a substantial strength, particularly in relation to the many
existing studies of single-session tDCS, which tend to be within-participant studies. However,
this does mean that the required sample size is much higher in order to achieve the same
statistical power, and the current study does now deviate from others in terms of a major aspect
of the methods.
9. There is a possible limitation regarding the timing of the assessments of food intake, which
ideally should be standardized across all participants, and anchored in relation to major meals of
the day. Perhaps this was indeed done, but additional detail would clarify.
10. There are a few too many references to “pre-registered” in the text. For example, I’m not sure
that it needs to be part of the subheadings in the Methods section. I agree that pre-registration
14
status should be prominent—it’s a critical strength of the study—but there is too much repetition
of the term currently.
11. The pattern of findings in the exploratory analyses is interesting, given that steering of
consumption in the direction of calories from healthy food is a benefit. The pattern of findings,
however, does reveal the power of pre-registration.
12. The discussion is thorough, thoughtful, and intelligently written. Really, this paper was a
pleasure to read on many levels.
In summary, this manuscript describes a pre-registered double-blind single-session trial
examining the effects of active tDCS compared to sham (both combined with inhibitory control
training), with food cravings and consumption as outcomes. All findings on preregistered
outcomes were null, although some exploratory analyses provided interesting hypotheses to be
tested in future research. There are many design features that—in my view—make this one of the
more well-executed studies in the published tDCS research literature. Moreover, from an analytic
standpoint, the substantial sample size coupled with Bayesian analyses increase confidence in the
null findings, and make this a compelling demonstration of the tenuous standing of conventional
tDCS as a modulator of food cravings/consumption when delivered in single-session format.

Appendix B
Response to Reviewer 1
We are grateful for the diligent and constructive assessment provided by Reviewer 1. We
respond below to each issue raised.
1. Introduction
“The terms “hedonic factors” and “hedonic eating” (p.2, l.42 and l.51) should be defined
and examples for these terms may be provided. Furthermore, a definition of food craving—as
one of the main outcomes—is missing and the term is mentioned rather late in the
introduction section (p.3). Food craving (= strong desire to consume a specific type of food
that can occur in the absence of hunger) often leads to consumption of the craved food and,
thus, a stronger rationale for investigating both food craving and consumption should be
provided earlier in the manuscript by including a few more sentences on food craving in the
first or second paragraph of the introduction.”
We agree that these terms had not been explicitly defined. This has now been addressed in
the first paragraph with a definition of hedonic hunger and the earlier introduction of food
craving (p.2).
“Additionally, some further information on the dlPFC would be fine (p.2, second
paragraph); why is it a brain region that might be of relevance in terms of food craving and
consumption?”
Additional information on the DLPFC has now been included (p.3). We have explained why
the DLPFC was the region of interest and have drawn upon previous imaging and stimulation
studies to link the region specifically to food craving and consumption.
“Page 5, ll.35 to 44 (“the snack buffet contains … used by Adams et al. (2017)”): this
information should be moved to the method section as it contains methodological details,
which appear misplaced at the end of the introduction.”
This has been removed from the introduction and had been included at the end of section
2.2.3 which refers specifically to the snack buffet (p.8).
“The term “commission errors” should be defined when first mentioned as the statement
“fewer commission errors” might be unclear for readers who are unfamiliar with go/no-go
tasks (e.g., that more commission errors indicate lower inhibitory control).”
A definition of commission errors has now been included at the end of the introduction (p.6).
2. Deviations from protocol
“I had a look at the pre-registration on osf.io where it says that participants will be either
allocated to a go or a no-go training condition (see Figure 1 and corresponding figure
caption of the pre-registration protocol). Furthermore, all pre-registered hypotheses
included the factor “training condition” (go vs. no-go training) next to the factor “tDCS
condition” (sham vs. active stimulation). However, in the current version of the manuscript,
it reads as if the authors first tested all participants of the no-go condition, then analyzed the
data, and then decided not to test the second training group, which seems like a rather large
deviation from the pre-registered data collection. Particularly, allocating participants
usually means that participants are randomly assigned to either go training or no-go
training. The authors should, therefore, justify why they decided to exclusively recruit and
test participants for the no-go training. Furthermore, this information should be moved from
the footnote to the section “deviations from the protocol” (p.11).”
The pre-registration stated that although the aim was to collect data for the no-go and go
training groups, to save time and resources we would initially only recruit participants for the
no-go group (this was referred to as “subproject 1”; see p.4. of pre-registration). Had the
effects of tDCS been statistically significant then we would have collected data for the go
group, however as we found no significant effect, to collect data for the go training would
only serve as a potential addition to the response inhibition literature.
Our justification for this decision has now been moved to the “deviations from protocol”
section (p.11), along with all information from footnote 1.
“In their pre-registration, the authors hypothesized that the effects of tDCS would be
stronger in individuals with elevated restrained eating scores. The authors argued that only a
few participants met the cutoff score of 15 (and higher) to be classified as restrained eaters.
This argument, however, deserves some scrutiny: Indeed, it is not surprising that restrained
eating scores are lower in the current sample than suggested by Herman & Polivy (1980)
given that all fasting and dieting individuals were excluded from participation. Of note, the
recommendation of the cutoff score of 15 by Herman & Polivy (1980) is merely based on
studies from the 1970s when restrained and unrestrained eaters were defined by median
splits of continuous Restraint Scale scores. That is, the Restraint Scale does not have a real
cut-off value that defines when a person is a restrained eater, but it just happened in most US
studies that the median of Restraint Scale scores in their samples were about 15. Moreover,
the underlying studies were all conducted in North America over 30 years ago and, thus,
likely cannot be applied to European samples or the current one. In fact, it was found that
individuals from Britain or the Netherlands generally score lower on the Restraint Scale than
US samples (for more information, see footnote 2 in Jansen, Louwerse, Leemans, &
Schouten, 1998: “Self-Esteem as a Better Predictor of Restrained Eaters' Food Intake than
Attributional Style and Disinhibition Tendency”). Despite these cultural aspects, there are
also some statistical considerations that dichotomizing data (e.g., via median split) is not
advisable. Rucker et al. (2015), for example, concluded that: “We show that dichotomizing a
continuous variable via the median split procedure or otherwise and analyzing the resulting
data via ANOVA involves a large number of costs that can be avoided by preserving the
continuous nature of the variable and analyzing the data via linear regression.” Amongst
older works, these costs and shortcomings are also described in recently published papers
(e.g., Rucker, McShane, & Preacher, 2015: “A researcher's guide to regression,
discretization, and median splits of continuous variables”; McClelland, Lynch, Irwin, Spiller,
& Fitzsimons, 2015: “Median splits, Type II errors, and false–positive consumer psychology:
Don't fight the power”). To conclude, rather than artificially categorizing the sample into
groups and using the rather arbitrary cutoff score of 15, which likely does not apply to the
current sample, I would recommend including restrained eating as a continuous predictor in
multilevel models. For example, time (pre vs. post-tDCS) can be modeled on level 1, and
tDCS condition (sham vs. active) as well as restrained eating and their interaction can be
modeled on level 2 when predicting state food craving. Thus, data should be reanalyzed or—
at least—the reasoning for not analyzing restrained eating should be revised.”
Thank you for this suggestion. We conducted a linear mixed effects analysis using the lme4
package in R which revealed no significant main effects or interactions. The outputs have
been included in the manuscript (p.16).
3. Methods
“Were the food images obtained from a standardized database or where they self-made?
Which definitions were used for deciding whether a food item belonged to the healthy or
unhealthy category? For example, with 404 kcal/100g breadsticks seem rather high-caloric
although they were classified as healthy (the same is true for rice bread).”
The images were self-made and edited to ensure they were on a white background. All
images were matched as closely as possible for size and colour.
Foods were selected based on calorie and fat content, so although the breadsticks and rice
cakes are high in calories, they are low in fat compared to the unhealthy snacks (e.g.
breadsticks have 7.4g of fat per 100g whereas all unhealthy foods have at least 20g of fat per
100g). It should also be noted that as this is a replication of previous work using the same
images and foods.
“On p.9, l.22 it says that the cover story was the “measurement of cognitive performance
before and after food consumption”; on p.5, l.39 it reads that the cover story contained “the
measurement of glucose levels on cognitive performance”. Were there two different stories
provided (i.e., one for food consumption and one for the overall study aim)?”
Thank you for bringing this to our attention. The cover story was that we were looking at the
effect of glucose levels on task performance, manipulated using food consumption. Both
references to our cover story now relate specifically to glucose levels (p.5, 8 & 10).
“Measurement of food craving (p.8, ll.9ff): the Food Cravings Questionnaire-State was
originally developed by Cepeda-Benito et al. (2000). There is, however, a modified
(“general”) version of the Food Cravings Questionnaire available (Nijs, Franken, & Muris,
2006), which is usually abbreviated with “G-FCQ-S”. As it seems that the authors used the
original version by Cepeda-Benito and colleagues, the prefix “G-“ should be omitted
throughout the manuscript to avoid confusion with this modified version (that is, it should
just read “FCQ-S”). Moreover, several subscales are described in the method section, but it
should be further stated that a total score can be calculated (ranging from 1 to 75) and that
this was done in the current study. This way, readers can make more sense of the magnitude
of FCQ-S scores, for example, in the supplementary table 2.”
Thank you for highlighting this. The modified version (G-FCQ-S) was used however the
incorrect reference was cited. This has now been updated.
We have additionally made clear that a total score can also be calculated (p.8).
“Procedure section: the authors may move the questionnaires mentioned in the procedure to
the questionnaire section and may separate the questionnaire section into “filler
questionnaires” and “task-relevant questionnaires”; item wordings and response formats of
the Visual Analogue Scale items (hunger, fullness, and desire to eat), the pain and nausea
questions, and the debriefing questions should be stated in this section or in the
supplementary material.”
Thanks for this suggestion. Section 2.2.6 of the materials section has now been split into two
sections: task-relevant questionnaires (2.2.6; p.9) and filler questionnaires (2.2.7; p.9). In
section 2.2.6 the questionnaires have been explained, thus removing this detail from the
procedure section.
4. Results
“The authors stated that there were no differences in craving subscales and, thereby,
reference to Supplementary Table 2 (p.11, l.22). However, results of the craving subscales
are neither presented in this table nor in the main text and, thus, this statement should be
either omitted or the results should be added to the revised version of the manuscript.”
Thank you for bringing this to our attention. The differences in baseline craving subscales
have now been added to Supplementary Table 2 (p.S4).
“There is no reference to Supplementary Table 7 in the main text of the manuscript;
Furthermore, the table caption reads as if correlational analyses were conducted (i.e.,
“relationship between group characteristics and total food consumption”). Therefore, it is
not clear why t-values are reported instead of correlation coefficients. If linear regressions
were conducted, it should be stated that either simple (each predictor separately) or multiple
(each predictor at the same time) regressions were applied. Were the results independent of
the tDCS condition (i.e., were the active and sham condition aggregated after testing for
moderating effects?).”
Thank you for pointing out this oversight. In response, we have directed the reader to
supplementary table 7 where we discuss the analyses that have included BMI as a covariate
(p.13). We have additionally modified the information given in this table; it is now clearly
stated that a multiple regression was applied (in the manuscript, p.13), t-values have been
removed, and the summary has been reported underneath the table. All group characteristics
included in the analysis were pre-tDCS measures, so these results were independent of tDCS
condition.
“In the pre-registration, it reads that significant predictors will be included as covariates in
all other analyses. As BMI was significant, did the inclusion of BMI change the results (if (or
if) not should be stated in the manuscript).”
Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We re-did our three pre-registered ANOVAs
with BMI as a covariate however the results remained non-significant. We have included this
point in section 4.3.1 of the results (p.13) and additionally included the outputs in section 4 of
the supplementary information (p.S6).
5. Discussion
“Page 16, ll.27 to 51: Hill (2007) states that craving for sweets are more frequent but does
not provide evidence that these are more intense. Thus, another reference may be necessary
here to back up this statement. The authors refer to their sweet vs. savoury analyses in the
discussion section but discussion sections usually do not include cross references to tables of
the results section. Thus, these results (or reference to them) should be included earlier (e.g.,
on page 12). The same is true for the individual food analyses (reference to them and to
Table 8 is missing in the main text and, thus, should be provided—otherwise it is likely that
readers will not pay attention to these results).”
This information has now been modified accordingly to fit with the references provided.
Reference to the sweet vs. savoury analyses and the information on individual food analyses
has now been included at the end of section 4.3.2 (p.14).
6. Figures
“Reference to Figure 1 is missing in the main text.”
A reference has now been included at the beginning of the method section (p.6).
“It seems that Figure 1 is a screenshot of a table with some red underlined words. The
authors may want to consider re-doing the screenshot after disabling the spellchecker.”
The figure has been modified and the updated version included.
7. Minor points
“The abbreviation dlPFC should be explained when first mentioned (p.2, l.55)”
This abbreviation has now been defined in the introduction (p.3).
“The abbreviation ITI should be abbreviated when inter-trial interval is first mentioned (p.8,
l.28)”
This has been updated (p.7).
“The abbreviation “VAS” is superfluous as the term is never mentioned again in the
manuscript (p.9, l.27).”
This abbreviation has been removed (p.9).
“Tables and figures should be self-explanatory and, thus, abbreviations should be avoided or
should be explained in the table notes or in the figure caption (e.g., “ITI” in figure 2, kcal in
Table 5, “SE” in all tables)”
All abbreviations have now been defined in the figure captions or underneath the tables.
“The references of Tabachnick & Fidell (2007) and Herman & Polivy (1980) do not appear
in the reference list. Thus, the authors may check if all cited references in the main text
appear in the reference list and vice versa.”
Thank you for bringing this to our attention. All references have been checked and corrected.
“I was wondering about the different decimals of the p-values. For example, p = .007 or p
=.63 or p=.1 (e.g., p.11, paragraph “tDCS tolerability and blinding”). Were the p-values
rounded or were the zeros omitted (e.g., a p-value of .1 should read .100)? I would suggest
reporting three decimals for p-values throughout.”
All p-values have been changed to three decimal places.
Response to Reviewer 2
We are grateful for the positive and insightful appraisal of our manuscript. We respond below
to each issue raised.
“The anode/cathode arrangement is not bilateral excitatory stimulation, but rather excitatory
right and inhibitory left (probably). This combination is not the same as bilateral excitatory
stimulation of both, and so the language in the manuscript should reflect this, and some note
of this issue in the discussion would be warranted (but briefly noted, given that the discussion
is already quite long). A related issue is that the choice of anode/cathode—and the fact that
the montage in this case was anode F4 and cathode F3—could produce null findings due to
inhibitory effects of the cathode on the left dlPFC (rather than absence of excitatory effects
on the right, or null bilateral excitatory effects). On the other hand, it is the case that this
very arrangement has resulted in improvements in inhibitory control and craving regulation
in several prior studies; for this reason, it is a very defensible arrangement to test in the
current study.”
We have taken care to ensure that we do not refer to bilateral excitatory stimulation, and
instead that stimulation was either active or sham (p.7). While we agree that the montage of
anode F4 and cathode F3 could have explained our null findings, we sought to replicate the
methods of those studies that had observed statistically significant effects of tDCS on craving
and consumption, which is why this montage was used.
“The current study involved a combined paradigm involving both tDCS (sham or active as
per the above montage description) and inhibitory training. The latter has shown small but
reliable effects on inhibitory control and cravings modulation in prior studies. This was a
good design feature, but could have attenuated the efficacy of cortical stimulation if there are
subtle aspects of inhibitory training that compete with neuromodulation procedures for
control over behavior. I don’t personally believe this, but being devil’s advocate here. This
possibility should be mentioned briefly in the discussion, if the authors agree.”
This is an interesting possibility. We have included a footnote discussing this point (p.21).
“A limitation of the study was the use of an all-female sample, this is consistent with other
studies in the literature, and there is good reason for focusing on females (higher dietary
restraint in everyday conditions, possibly more understood in terms response to the food test
paradigm). However, this does limit the generalizability of the findings; currently the findings
are not stated in relation to females, but as general across sexes. Some minor wording
adjustment would rectify this.”
It wasn’t our aim to focus purely on women, but as the majority of the participants were
psychology undergraduate students, this resulted in a predominantly female sample (141
females, 40 males). The abstract now directs the findings towards this specific sample.
“There should be a citation supporting the validity of the snack buffet paradigm as a measure
of food consumption (for example, see Robinson et al., 2017, Appetite).”
Thank you for the reference; this has been included (p.8).
“The between subjects design was a substantial strength, particularly in relation to the many
existing studies of single-session tDCS, which tend to be within-participant studies. However,
this does mean that the required sample size is much higher in order to achieve the same
statistical power, and the current study does now deviate from others in terms of a major
aspect of the methods.”
We agree with this assessment, however by using a between-subjects design we eliminated
any potential session carry-over effects that could occur in a within-subjects design. We also
compensated for the reduced power by increasing the sample size accordingly.
“There is a possible limitation regarding the timing of the assessments of food intake, which
ideally should be standardized across all participants, and anchored in relation to major
meals of the day. Perhaps this was indeed done, but additional detail would clarify”.
We tried to control for this as much as possible: section 2.3 “On the day of testing,
participants were asked to eat something small three hours before the study and to then
refrain from eating during this period, thus standardising appetite and food motivation.”
Unfortunately as testing sessions began from 12pm, this meant that some participants had not
consumed any food on the day of the experiment. This is consistent with previous studies.
For example, Fregni et al. (2008) and Goldman et al. (2011) instructed participants to not eat
within 3 and 4 hours of the respective studies.
“There are a few too many references to “pre-registered” in the text. For example, I’m not
sure that it needs to be part of the subheadings in the Methods section. I agree that pre-
registration status should be prominent—it’s a critical strength of the study—but there is too
much repetition of the term currently.”
In the revised manuscript have ensured that “pre-registered” is not mentioned in any
