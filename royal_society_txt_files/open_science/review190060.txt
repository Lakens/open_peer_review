Dear Editor,
I have considered the manuscript by Collings et al. on ‘The impact of pelvic lateral rotation on
hindlimb kinematics and stride length in the red-legged running frog, Kassina maculata’.
Generally spoken, I like this contribution and I have only some minor comments, suggestions and
questions.
Line 85: What is meant with asynchronous (explain)?
Line 90: I think there does exist (yet probably not too detailed) kinematics of crawling (walking)
in frogs (e.g. Nauwelaerts & Aerts, 1992; J. Zool.).
Line 134: This is a rather arbitrary definition of transition between swing and stance and vice
versa, which is fine as such, but probably more prone to errors in its determination than the
rigorous and most often used ‘first contact’ and ‘last contact’ of the hands and feet. Maybe give a
short argumentation why this definition is used.
Line 173: Define ‘body side’ (as a segment) or at least refer explicitly to figure 1b.
Line 175: I find the use of ‘V’ to indicate (some) vectors rather confusing (at first I thought this
referred to speed (‘V’elocity). Why not using conventional vector script? (see also further).
Line 197: New notations are used for the same vectors.
Line 222: Increase length of the square root symbol (must encompass Z²).
Line 223&226: I suggest to use another variable name. Presently flexion/extension angles are
identical to joint angles (line: 197)
Line 251: This must be ‘contribution of the pelvis’ (in model 2 the hip also contributes because of
femur rotation)
Line 251-258: Personally, I do not think this explanation is really needed.
Line 277: Judging what follows, M must be replaced by MT.
Line 282: use matrix notation and remove capitals in Cos and Sin
Line 284: remove ‘.’ between R1 and MT. Moreover, I wonder whether the notation of equation
14 is correct (most likely calculations are OK). At first glance, R1 must not be transposed.
Furthermore, notice that according this equation, MBA becomes a 3x12 matrix. As such, the
explanation in lines 306-312 becomes very confusing (rotation of MBA). This means that MBA
must not be transposed for the rotation, although this is done according to equation 18. On the
other hand, this equation refers to MBAT, a matrix that is further not defined but probably means
‘the transposition of MBA’. As said, this is all very confusing and in general I think it will be
3
beneficial of the authors consult a mathematician to check and clean up the mathematical script
(including the vector notations).
Line 385: sounds a bit odd. What is exactly meant here?
Line 410: 0.04m/s => 0.26m/s is a 6fold increase (not 3fold) and seems to accord to what can be
seen in figure 6A
Line 411: If stride length is not changing, frequency must increase with a factor similar to that of
speed (i.e. 6-fold; cf. above). This is confirmed by the frequency range in figure 6A (0.5hz =>3hz).
Hence, the 3fold and 10fold increases mentioned in this part are confusing/puzzling.
Line 508: 6fold? (cf.above).

Review: The impact of pelvic lateral rotation on hindlimb kinematics and stride length in the red-
legged running frog, Kassina maculata.
This study uses a clever non-invasive computational method to quantify the contribution of
lateral pelvic movements to the stride length of walking frogs. The analysis is non-trivial yet done
carefully and explained well and succinctly. Pelvic anatomy and function in frogs is a research
topic that remains largely unexplored and this study will be a significant contribution. Overall, I
really enjoyed the manuscript and would like to see it published. However, I would like to
suggest some edits that I think would greatly improve the impact of this study.
First, I was hoping for a maximum calculated stride length increase with each degree of pelvic
rotation, based purely on the geometry of the skeleton (Fig. 1B). Given how short and rigid the
spine of the frog is I would not expect there to be much bending near the pelvis. Furthermore, the
4
pelvis itself is narrow and so even large angular movements of the could conceivably have a
small effect on stride length. So I was hoping for a hypothetical angle calculate, in the best case
scenario, i.e. all joint extensions occur synchronously so that proximal rotation is fully
transmitted to the distal limb.
The other thing I expected to see in the discussion was a constraint on stride length posed by the
shorter forelimbs. For example, if the forelimb joints are near full extension during the stride an
increase in hindlimb stride length would not be possible because the forelimbs would not be able
to keep up.
Secondly, it was unclear for much of the manuscript what the two models were that the authors
compared to each other. This was first described on line 238, even though there were several
allusions to two approaches earlier (E.g. line 88, 162). I would have liked a brief description even
in the abstract. At the end of the introduction (line 87) the first model is briefly described but the
comparison remained incomplete.
Specific remarks
Line 22: IS - I would spell out this anatomical structure for the sake of those who are not frog
anatomy fanatics (I don’t know who these would be, but one never knows…!)
Line 24: range of speeds – units missing
Line 27: The reporting of results could use some more clarification. The last three sentences of the
summary only made sense after reading the whole manuscript.
Line 68: “From salamander studies” could be omitted.
Line 70-71: I could find the illustration of this point in Figure 1.
Line 73-80: I had trouble seeing how pelvic rotation could not contribute to stride length increase.
Line 77-78: is this muscle activation pattern (citation 6) measured during walking or frog
jumping?
Line 87: “The first model…” there is no follow up with the second model.
Line 162: “… using two methods” this made we wonder whether these were the two models
being compared.
Line 176: “in terms of the skin marker landmarks”. I expected some guidance on where to find
the names for the landmarks that are given in the next page. It wasn’t obvious what “P” in Pkne
stood for…
Line 229-235: Excellent paragraph explaining the benefits of using polar coordinates!
Line 237-240: This was the first description of the 2 models. I would have liked to see it much
earlier in the manuscript. The authors do a good job of explaining the two models succinctly so it
should not be a problem to introduce them earlier.
Line 251-258: I thought the authors did a terrific job explaining global vs local coordinate systems
before line 251. The further explanation with a different example (throwing a ball) could be
omitted.
5
Line 329-330: I would have liked a little more explanation of why a sinusoidal motion in PV was
expected. Is that due to the periodicity of the measurements? How can that be achieved if only
one stride per sequence is digitized? I think this is a valuable contribution of this manuscript and
strengthens the dataset despite the relatively small number of strides digitized. It is also not a
frequently done analysis, even though it certainly should be. In my opinion, it therefore warrants
a little more description.
Line 357: Is the upper limit of the speed observed in this study (0.23 m s-1) close to the maximum
for this species? At what speed does this frog species switch to hopping? This is perhaps a point
for the discussion.
Line 368: “…creating sinusoidal curves” these are not the same sinusoidal waves as expected in
the tests for digitizing error, correct?
Line 377: “…contributed only modestly to limb segment motion”. This result was not obvious to
me from the reference to figure 3D-I in line 375.
Line 404-406: I did not understand the difference between Vpel and lateral rotation, so I could not
see how they had opposite relationship with speed (Fig. 5 vs 6).
DISCUSSION
Overall I had a hard time following the discussion to the final conclusion. There were often large
jumps from some exceptional descriptions of complex 3-dimensional kinematics (e.g. line 467-
478) to conclusions that did not follow directly.
Line 430-448: This is where I expected a discussion about the differences in pelvis length or
structure among the different species. A similar anatomical comparison would be very useful in
the following section on other sprawling tetrapods, as well.
Line 491: “… to 3.78 mm hypothetical increase in stride length” what is the origin of this
hypothetical value?
Line 499-505: Great explanation and discussion of the lateral COM movements and the potential
contribution to instability.
Line 517-520: In this section I expected discussion of the gait transition in Kassina, from walking
to jumping.
Line 533-535: This sentence seemed contradictory within itself.

Line 85: What is meant with asynchronous (explain)?
[R1.1] We originally used the word asynchronous here to note that the frogs when walking move their
right and left hindlimbs asynchronously i.e. not in sync as they do in jumping. However upon reflection it
is probably an unnecessary addition to the sentence and as such we have deleted it for clarity. Line 93.
Line 90: I think there does exist (yet probably not too detailed) kinematics of crawling (walking) in frogs
(e.g. Nauwelaerts & Aerts, 1992; J. Zool.).
[R1.2] We agree, there are examples of walking studies including some kinematics, particularly the
recent publication by Reynaga et al. (2018). Previous literature has also looked at the pelvis in isolation
but we look at the impact of pelvic kinematic in relation to the hindlimb, and to our knowledge are the
first to do so. We have reworded the sentence to clarify that this is the first use of 3D kinematics to
analyse the pelvis in relation to the hindlimb. Line 100.
Line 134: This is a rather arbitrary definition of transition between swing and stance and vice versa,
which is fine as such, but probably more prone to errors in its determination than the rigorous and most
often used ‘first contact’ and ‘last contact’ of the hands and feet. Maybe give a short argumentation why
this definition is used.
[R1.3] We do agree the definitions do seem quite arbitrary between swing and stance however it was
extremely challenging to rely on the more traditional first and last contact. As we mention, the frogs
gradually peeled their toes off of the ground and have a tendency to drag their long toes along the
ground during swing phase which meant that in some instances there was no clear point of last contact
at all even though the limb was protracting. Additionally, because of the elongated nature of their phase
transitions there are periods of contact with the ground where weight bearing is minimal as thus for all
intents and purpose the limb is effectively in swing. Similarly, the point of first contact with the first
finger in the forelimb is very early on in the transition to stance phase and therefore in contact with the
ground long before any weight bearing is going to occur. We appreciate that the arbitrary definitions we
use are somewhat subjective but we believe our definitions are more useful than relying on first and last
contact which just doesn’t work for these animals that have such long digits! Lines 144-149 explain our
reasoning for choosing arbitrary transition points. We have also added to the sentence starting line 149
to emphasise this is our best definition and is based on our chosen transition points. Line 149.
Line 173: Define ‘body side’ (as a segment) or at least refer explicitly to figure 1b.
[R1.4] We have now added a written definition of the joint segments and how they were calculated as
vectors including for the body side. Line 192.
Line 175: I find the use of ‘V’ to indicate (some) vectors rather confusing (at first I thought this referred
to speed (‘V’elocity). Why not using conventional vector script? (see also further).
[R1.5] Yes, this is a good point, thank you for raising this. We have corrected all uses of ‘V’ with ‘v’ to
denote vectors. Line 192 and throughout.
Line 197: New notations are used for the same vectors.
[R1.6] We can understand how our use of general symbols might be confusing; the equation is a generic
equation regardless of the names used for any particular vector. However, to clarify, we have replaced
the general symbols with vector names from above as an example of how hip 3D angle is calculated.
We also explain that other joint angles are calculated similarly. Line 215 and 219.
Line 222: Increase length of the square root symbol (must encompass Z²).
[R1.7] Yes, thank you for catching that. The square root symbol has been amended to include ‘z2’. Line
247.
Line 223&226: I suggest to use another variable name. Presently flexion/extension angles are identical
to joint angles (line: 197)
[R1.8] We have now changed the variable name for the flexion/extension angle from <U+03B8> to s to avoid
confusion. Line 248 and throughout.
Line 251: This must be ‘contribution of the pelvis’ (in model 2 the hip also contributes because of femur
rotation)
[R1.9] Yes you are correct, we have corrected ‘hip’ to ‘pelvis’. Line 292.
Line 251-258: Personally, I do not think this explanation is really needed.
[R1.10] We have now removed this explanation. Line 278.
Line 277: Judging what follows, M must be replaced by MT.
[R1.11] Thank you for pointing this out. If M is in the 12x3 configuration then it needs to be transposed
before being multiplied with R1. We have added an explanation to clarify. Line 324.
Line 282: use matrix notation and remove capitals in Cos and Sin
[R1.12] We have now added matrix notation and have removed the capital letters from cos and sin. Line
320 and 351.
Line 284: remove ‘.’ between R1 and MT. Moreover, I wonder whether the notation of equation 14 is
correct (most likely calculations are OK). At first glance, R1 must not be transposed. Furthermore,
notice that according this equation, MBA becomes a 3x12 matrix. As such, the explanation in lines 306-
312 becomes very confusing (rotation of MBA). This means that MBA must not be transposed for the
rotation, although this is done according to equation 18. On the other hand, this equation refers to
MBAT, a matrix that is further not defined but probably means ‘the transposition of MBA’. As said, this is
all very confusing and in general I think it will be beneficial of the authors consult a mathematician to
check and clean up the mathematical script (including the vector notations).
[R1.13] You are correct R1 is not transposed and multiplication of R1 and MT produces a 3x12 matrix. In
our code workflow, M is a 12 x 3 matrix, MT then is a 3 x 12 matrix which is multiplied with R1, to
produce a 3 x 12 matrix. Our code requires all matrices used in downstream calculations to be in the 12
x 3 configuration. Therefore, the resulting matrix generated from the multiplication of R1 and MT
requires transposing itself, hence the notation [R1.MT]T (I have highlighted the extra transposition acting
on the resulting matrix). MBA then, being the transpose of the calculation within the matrix, is a 12 x 3
matrix as required for our code. See the equation below for further clarification:
RM = [R.MT]T
Where M is 12 x 3 and R is 3 x 3, producing RM as a 12 x 3 matrix.
Of course without the reader knowing how the matrix needed to be structured, we can see where the
confusion has come from. To remain consistent with our code we have kept our notation the same
however to help clarify we have reworded our text (Line 312-324 & 347-355) and added a line below the
equations in question defining dimensions (Line 324 & 355). We have also removed the ‘.’ in the
equations as suggested (Lines 322 & 353). Lines 312 – 355.
Line 385: sounds a bit odd. What is exactly meant here?
[R1.14] In this sentence we meant to highlight that although the pelvic lateral rotation angles reported
for each trial were variable (i.e. some frogs showed a large pelvic angular excursion and others showed
a smaller range of angles peak-to-trough) all traces were statistically significant when compared with
signal noise – in our case digitising error.
We have now reworded the relevant sentences for clarification. Line 432.
Line 410: 0.04m/s => 0.26m/s is a 6fold increase (not 3fold) and seems to accord to what can be seen
in figure 6A
[R1.15] Thank you for catching that. We have now corrected this typo. Line 462.
Line 411: If stride length is not changing, frequency must increase with a factor similar to that of speed
(i.e. 6-fold; cf. above). This is confirmed by the frequency range in figure 6A (0.5hz =>3hz). Hence,
the 3fold and 10fold increases mentioned in this part are confusing/puzzling.
[R1.16] Yes, you are absolutely correct, apologies! We have corrected these typos. Line 463.
Line 508: 6fold? (cf.above).
[R1.17] Again you are correct, thank you for spotting. This has now been corrected. Line 585.

Comments to the Author(s)
Review: The impact of pelvic lateral rotation on hindlimb kinematics and stride length in the red-legged
running frog, Kassina maculata.
This study uses a clever non-invasive computational method to quantify the contribution of lateral pelvic
movements to the stride length of walking frogs. The analysis is non-trivial yet done carefully and
explained well and succinctly. Pelvic anatomy and function in frogs is a research topic that remains
largely unexplored and this study will be a significant contribution. Overall, I really enjoyed the
manuscript and would like to see it published. However, I would like to suggest some edits that I think
would greatly improve the impact of this study.
Thank you for your kind words.
First, I was hoping for a maximum calculated stride length increase with each degree of pelvic rotation,
based purely on the geometry of the skeleton (Fig. 1B). Given how short and rigid the spine of the frog
is I would not expect there to be much bending near the pelvis. Furthermore, the pelvis itself is narrow
and so even large angular movements of the could conceivably have a small effect on stride length. So I
was hoping for a hypothetical angle calculate, in the best case scenario, i.e. all joint extensions occur
synchronously so that proximal rotation is fully transmitted to the distal limb.
[R2.1] As we understand, the reviewer is suggesting that the morphology of the pelvis might influence
its hypothetical contribution to stride length. Specifically, the width of the pelvis might prevent the
femur from reaching a highly protracted angle. This is an interesting point which, as the reviewer
admits, is dependent on an assumption about spinal flexibility. Unfortunately, we cannot reliably
integrate this into our current calculations because we did not perform x-ray fluoroscope experiments
and therefore were unable to observe a) the precise morphology of the pelvis for each frog b) the flexion
of the spine. We have added a comment in our discussion that this issue should be addressed using
XROMM experiments in the future. Line 608.
The other thing I expected to see in the discussion was a constraint on stride length posed by the
shorter forelimbs. For example, if the forelimb joints are near full extension during the stride an increase
in hindlimb stride length would not be possible because the forelimbs would not be able to keep up.
[R2.2] Yes, this is a very good point. Indeed, the legs of Kassina are actually shorter to minimise this
effect (Reynaga et al., 2018). We have addressed this in our text. Line 579.
Secondly, it was unclear for much of the manuscript what the two models were that the authors
compared to each other. This was first described on line 238, even though there were several allusions
to two approaches earlier (E.g. line 88, 162). I would have liked a brief description even in the abstract.
At the end of the introduction (line 87) the first model is briefly described but the comparison remained
incomplete.
[R2.3] Yes, we agree, without clear description in the introduction it was unclear what the two models
were. Model 1 was called the fixed body axis model (FBA) and model 2 was called the fixed pelvic axis
model (FPA). We have now added sentences and headings in the various relevant sections to clarify the
definition of the two models. Line 24, Line 32, Line 95, Line 269, Line 265, Line 274, Line 290, Line 294,
Line 332, Line 361, Line 362.
Specific remarks
Line 22: IS - I would spell out this anatomical structure for the sake of those who are not frog anatomy
fanatics (I don’t know who these would be, but one never knows…!)
[R2.4] haha! Yes very good point! We have now modified that sentence for clarity. Line 25.
Line 24: range of speeds – units missing
[R2.5] Ah yes, thank you for catching that. The correct units have now been added. Line 28.
Line 27: The reporting of results could use some more clarification. The last three sentences of the
summary only made sense after reading the whole manuscript.
[R2.6] changed sentence structure to help clarify the results. Line 28 onwards.
Line 68: “From salamander studies” could be omitted.
[R2.7] deleted. Line 75.
Line 70-71: I could find the illustration of this point in Figure 1.
[R2.8] Apologies for this typo, we did not mean to refer to Figure 1 there. We have also re-worded that
sentence for further clarification. Line 78.
Line 73-80: I had trouble seeing how pelvic rotation could not contribute to stride length increase.
[R2.9] lateral rotation of the pelvis will only affect stride length if 1) rotation is large enough, 2) limb
and pelvic motion are temporally synchronised – depending on the synchronisation pelvic lateral rotation
can have a positive or negative effect on stride length. We discuss this in more detail in the discussion
between Lines 535-545.
Line 77-78: is this muscle activation pattern (citation 6) measured during walking or frog jumping?
[R2.10] The work done by Emerson and De Jongh (citation 6) looks at muscle activity during walking,
jumping, and swimming and has the EMG data for the coccygeoiliacus, coccygeosacralis, iliolumbaris,
and longissimus dorsi. We have clarified we are talking about muscle action in walking. Line 85.
Line 87: “The first model…” there is no follow up with the second model.
[R2.11] You are right, thank you for bringing that to our attention. As with comment [R2.3] We have
now added a description of the second model to this section for clarification. Line 95.
Line 162: “… using two methods” this made we wonder whether these were the two models being
compared.
[R2.12] We appreciate where the confusion has arisen. To clarify, the hindlimb kinematics were analysed
using both 3D vector angles and a polar co-ordinate angle. However, the models being compared were
the fixed body axis kinematic model (FBA) and the fixed pelvic axis kinematic model (FPA). FBA was
fixed to the body axis and therefore measured pelvic excursion *and* hindlimb motion, whereas FPA
was fixed to the pelvic axis and therefore measured hindlimb motion *only* without the contribution of
the pelvis. The changes we made in response to comment [R2.3] hopefully clarify this point, see Line
24, Line 32, Line 95, Line 269, Line 265, Line 274, Line 290, Line 294, Line 332, Line 361, Line 362.
Line 176: “in terms of the skin marker landmarks”. I expected some guidance on where to find the
names for the landmarks that are given in the next page. It wasn’t obvious what “P” in Pkne stood for…
[R2.13] We used ‘P’ to stand for points, as in joint marker points. We felt that ‘M’ for markers was too
confusing since we introduce matrices later on that are referred to by the letter ‘M’. We have re-written
this section and added some new text to define the marker points, and directed readers to Figure1 A-B
where they can find a labelled diagram of the frog showing the marker points and the vectors they
create. Line 182 onwards.
Line 229-235: Excellent paragraph explaining the benefits of using polar coordinates!
[R2.14] Thank you very much!
Line 237-240: This was the first description of the 2 models. I would have liked to see it much earlier in
the manuscript. The authors do a good job of explaining the two models succinctly so it should not be a
problem to introduce them earlier.
[R2.15] Thank you, we agree. Please see all revisions labelled [R2.3]. Line 24, Line 32, Line 95, Line
269, Line 265, Line 274, Line 290, Line 294, Line 332, Line 361, Line 362.
Line 251-258: I thought the authors did a terrific job explaining global vs local coordinate systems
before line 251. The further explanation with a different example (throwing a ball) could be omitted.
[R2.16] Thank you very much. We have now deleted the analogy. Line 278.
Line 329-330: I would have liked a little more explanation of why a sinusoidal motion in PV was
expected. Is that due to the periodicity of the measurements? How can that be achieved if only one
stride per sequence is digitized? I think this is a valuable contribution of this manuscript and strengthens
the dataset despite the relatively small number of strides digitized. It is also not a frequently done
analysis, even though it certainly should be. In my opinion, it therefore warrants a little more
description.
[R2.17] We know from the work of Ashley-Ross (Fig 4 citation 29) that the pelvis in salamanders
oscillates sinusoidally during walking/running and given we were trying to measure a similar motion in
the frogs (i.e. pelvic lateral rotation) we expected a similar sine wave pattern. As for whether you can
get a sine wave with one stride, one must make the assumption that the pattern repeats over multiple
stride cycles. Since, again, this is true of salamander pelvic oscillation we assume that it is also the case
in the frogs. We feel comfortable with this assumption for our current data because we put great effort
into ensuring we only used strides that represented steady speed locomotion where the animal was
travelling forwards in a straight line i.e. not pausing or turning. We have now added text to explain the
rationale for our expectation of oscillating pelvic angle in both the methods and the discussion. Line 373
and Line 484, respectively.
Line 357: Is the upper limit of the speed observed in this study (0.23 m s-1) close to the maximum for
this species? At what speed does this frog species switch to hopping? This is perhaps a point for the
discussion.
[R2.18] As far as we are aware, yes, this is approaching the upper limit of recorded running speeds for
them. There is not that much literature for this particular species however Ahn et al. (2004) has
reported speeds between 0.10 m s-1 and 0.30 m s-1. The great thing about this species – and indeed one
of the reasons we chose to work with it for this study – is that they are not known to switch to hopping
at all. Anecdotally in our experience with them they perform a single escape jump, a short burst of
hopping strides, or a series of walking strides, they never switch. Ahn et al. (2004) also make note of
this characteristic explaining that “Kassina uses this walking/running-type gait as its primary mode of
locomotion at all speeds on land”. We discuss their ability to maintain a walking/running at all speeds
without transitioning to another gait between Lines 585 and 599. We have added a new sentence in this
section to clarify that this species don’t switch gaits. Line 593.
Line 368: “…creating sinusoidal curves” these are not the same sinusoidal waves as expected in the
tests for digitizing error, correct?
[R2.19] No, that is correct, in line 415 (originally 368) we are referring to the hindlimb joint angle
traces. We tested the pelvic angle traces for digitising error since the pelvic angles were undergoing a
much smaller range of motion. In accuracy the pelvic angle traces aren’t strictly sinusoidal, they are
more triangular (like a zig zag wave rather than a smooth ‘S’ shaped curve) so on reflection we have
decided to refer to the pelvic angle traces as triangular waves and the hindlimb joint angle traces as
sinusoidal waves. We have amended our text accordingly. Line 431.
Line 377: “…contributed only modestly to limb segment motion”. This result was not obvious to me from
the reference to figure 3D-I in line 375.
[R2.20] We say this because the traces in Figures 3D-F show a fluctuation in horizontal angle throughout
the stride cycle indicating the limb segments are moving backwards and forwards throughout the limb
cycle. On the other hand figure 3G-I show very little change in vertical angle throughout the stride cycle
suggesting the limb segments don’t move up and down very much during a stride cycle hence our
statement that vertical motion contributed only modestly to overall limb segment motion. We have re-
worded the sentence slightly to help clarify this point. Line 424.
Line 404-406: I did not understand the difference between Vpel and lateral rotation, so I could not see
how they had opposite relationship with speed (Fig. 5 vs 6).
[R2.21] Vpel is the pelvic vector itself, the angle of lateral rotation (PV) is the angle between the midline
and Vpel. You are correct, they have the same relationship with speed as each other. Lateral rotation is
correlated with an increase in the cranio-caudal excursion of the hindlimb joints, but has a negative
relationship with speed. We have re-worded this section slightly to help clarify. Line 453 onwards.
DISCUSSION
Overall I had a hard time following the discussion to the final conclusion. There were often large jumps
from some exceptional descriptions of complex 3-dimensional kinematics (e.g. line 467-478) to
conclusions that did not follow directly.
[R2.22] We have reworked the second half of the section entitled ‘Pelvic lateral rotation only modestly
increases stride length and decreases with speed’ to help with the flow of discussion points. On reflection
there was a lot of unnecessary repetition of the previous points, so we have deleted text to better link
with the following paragraph. Line 566.
Line 430-448: This is where I expected a discussion about the differences in pelvis length or structure
among the different species. A similar anatomical comparison would be very useful in the following
section on other sprawling tetrapods, as well.
[R2.23] We have added to this paragraph now to include looking at the impact of pelvic geometry on
hindlimb kinematics as a suggestion for future work. Line 499.
Also see our response to comment [R2.1]. Line 608.
Line 491: “… to 3.78 mm hypothetical increase in stride length” what is the origin of this hypothetical
value?
[R2.24] The hypothetical gain in stride length was calculated by comparing the cranio-caudal excursion
of the joints in Model 1 and Model 2. Figure 4B-C provides a visual representation of how hypothetical
gain was calculated. The value of 3.78 is actually a typo and should read 3.72 which is taken from Table
S2. We have corrected the typo, have moved Tables 1 and 2 out of supplementary information and into
the main text, and have then made reference to Table 2 in the relevant sentence. Line 562.
Line 499-505: Great explanation and discussion of the lateral COM movements and the potential
contribution to instability.
[R2.25] Thank you very much for your kind words.
Line 517-520: In this section I expected discussion of the gait transition in Kassina, from walking to
jumping.
[R2.26] We have added a sentence to clarify that Kassina maculata does not switch gaits. Line 593.
Line 533-535: This sentence seemed contradictory within itself.
[R2.27] You are right, what was meant is that if the animals were not able to laterally rotate their pelvis
they would compensate if necessary which might impact stride length. We are making the point that we
are not saying our model shows exactly what would happen if you anatomically fixed the pelvis but
rather that our model is being used to demonstrate that rotation of the pelvis has the potential to impact
stride length (although it turns out just not all that much!). We have slightly re-worded the sentence to
help clarify. Line 614.
