In this revised manuscript the authors have substantially improved their presentation of this
work, clarifying a number of important details. The paper reads better, with better organization,
and gives a stronger rationale for the study and its significance as a biophysical model. I support
publication if the authors can address a couple of items as follows.
1. The author state that their fit result for the AI synthesis rate falls below that cited in prior
literature (refs 64, 65), but they do not state the literature values. Please as a courtesy to the
reader provide those prior estimates of the rate.
2. The authors emphasize that the quenching with short characteristic time 'is crucial to obtain a
reliable fit to the experimental data'. Consequently I wonder what evidence they find in prior
experimental studies that such a quenching mechanism exists, especially one with a time scale as
short as 32 seconds! That number raises some concerns, as it falls short of likely protein turnover
rates, and possibly also mRNA turnover rates. Do there exist either experimental studies or any
other biological rationales for this odd finding? I do not believe that single cell observations of
microbial luciferase activity (for example Nature. 2004 Jul 1;430(6995):81-5.) support such rapid
turnover.

be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look
forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get
in touch.

this revised manuscript the authors have substantially improved their presentation of this work,
rifying a number of important details. The paper reads better, with better organization, and gives a
onger rationale for the study and its significance as a biophysical model. I support publication if
e authors can address a couple of items as follows.
thank the referee for her/his positive evaluation.
The author state that their fit result for the AI synthesis rate falls below that cited in prior
erature (refs 64, 65), but they do not state the literature values. Please as a courtesy to the
ader provide those prior estimates of the rate.
provided the previous estimates in the main text. The revised sentence (page 9) now reads
his is somehow lower than the figure of 3-5 AI molecules produced per cell per second, generally
orted for basal SI production [64, 65], yet it would be consistent with what is known for the AI-2
nal molecule in V. harveyi [51].”
The authors emphasize that the quenching with short characteristic time 'is crucial to obtain a
iable fit to the experimental data'. Consequently I wonder what evidence they find in prior
perimental studies that such a quenching mechanism exists, especially one with a time scale as short
32 seconds! That number raises some concerns, as it falls short of likely protein turnover rates,
d possibly also mRNA turnover rates. Do there exist either experimental studies or any other
ological rationales for this odd finding? I do not believe that single cell observations of microbial
ciferase activity (for example Nature. 2004 Jul 1;430(6995):81-5.) support such rapid turnover.
We thank the referee for her/his observation. We agree with her/him that our finding of a very
rt quenching time is indeed quite surprising. In fact, we are not aware of prior experimental studies
wing the same effect. We feel this to be one of the main results of our work and we had already
phasized this to be a novel finding at different places in the manuscript. We had already commented
its possible biological rationale as well, in particular in the final paragraph of the Discussion section,
ere we refer to previous results that point to bacterial luciferase having a biological function
ferent from bio-luminescence, related to the detoxification of highly reactive oxygen species [31,32].
have now extended that paragraph to make this connection more explicit.
As a matter of fact, we agree with the referee that the quenching time is too short for bio-
inescence quenching to be explained by luciferase turnover. We had instead speculated that, in the
sence of highly reactive oxygen species in the very dry climate chamber where experiments are
ried on, luciferase enzymes are switching their functional activity from bio-luminescence to
oxification. As already stated in the manuscript, this hypothesis needs to be further tested in the
ntext of our experimental setup. However, it was nicely shown in [32] that a 'dark' mutant, where
iferase is nevertheless active, is still able to protect the growth of “Vibrio harveyi” colonies against
presence of highly reactive oxygen species, so that the detoxifying activity of luciferase in the
ence of bio-luminescence is an already established possibility.
In detail, the final paragraph in the Discussion section read, in the previous version of the
nuscript:
rom a biological perspective, it is intriguing to hypothesize that the bioluminescence quenching that
observe here could be due to the high amount of reactive oxygen species in the high drying
ironment where the experiments were carried out [30]. This behaviour could then be connected
h the physiological role suggested previously for bacterial luciferase in the protection of cells
ainst oxidative stress [32]. This had also been suggested to be at the origin of the development of
rine bioluminescence [31].”
It now reads, in the newly revised version:
rom a biological perspective, the very small value of the “quenching time” t makes a quenching
chanism based on luciferase turnover unlikely. On the other hand, it is intriguing to hypothesize that
bioluminescence quenching that we observe here could be due to a switch in the type of luciferase
ivity, driven by the high amount of reactive oxygen species in the high drying environment where the
eriments were carried out [30]. As a matter of fact, it had been previously reported that V. harveyi
iferase, but not necessarily the process of light emission, may be involved in the detoxification of
ctive oxygen species, thus playing a role in the protection of cells against oxidative stress [32]. This
e had also been suggested to be at the origin of the development of marine bioluminescence [31].”
