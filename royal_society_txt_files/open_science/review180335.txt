Xu et al. reported porous ZIF-derived catalytic thin film as Pt-free counter electrodes for high
performance quantum dot-sensitized solar cells. The resultant QDSSC with CE derived by the
sulfuration for 30 min showed an excellent light-to-electric conversion efficiency of 3.77%, which
is higher than that of QDSSC based on Pt CE (2.98%). The results are interesting. Thus, the
manuscript can be accepted for publication after the following issues have been well addressed.

In this study author prepared Zeolitic-imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), as novel porous materials
and used as a CE in QDSSCs. QDSSC based on CE derived by the sulfuration for 30 min shows an
excellent light-to-electric conversion efficiency of 3.77%, it is even higher than that of QDSSC
based on Pt CE (2.98%). I am impressed a lot with your way of explanation and this paper should
be published in Royal society open science with minor corrections.

As we all know Pt is not suitable CE in QDSSCs, how author compare with Pt CE and tells that an
excellent light-to-electric conversation is achieved. How ZIFs is beneficial compare to metal
sulfides such as CuS, NiS etc, should be explained in introduction section.
A ZIF layer is firstly prepared by coating ZIF-67 powders on the conducting glass, followed by
the careful calcination treatments in sulfur vapor (sulfuration) or nitrogen gas (carbonization).
How author coated powder on substrate, is it powder or paste?
Introduction section is good, but author should discuss few points of recently published paper
results using ZIFs in introduction section.
80<U+2103> in vacuum? (Check once).
The SILAR approach was employed to modify ZnS on the surface of CdSe QD-sensitized thin
film. Check once that “modify” word?
SEM images seems not so bad but draw graph nicely.
How high surface area useful for improving efficiency, should explain in BET analysis.
How Pt coated on FTO substrate? Should mention in experimental section
Why author used applied potential 0.13V for measurement of Tafel analysis.

showed an excellent light-to-electric conversion efficiency of 3.77%,
which is higher than that of QDSSC based on Pt CE (2.98%). The results
are interesting. Thus, the manuscript can be accepted for publication
after the following issues have been well addressed.
Thank you for your positive comments on our manuscript very much.
(1) What is the function of PVP during the preparation of ZIF-67 process?
Addition of PVP during synthesis of ZIF-67 is to control the particle size of ZIF-67.
PVP can prevent the growth of big ZIF-67 particles. The small ZIF-67 particles will
benefit the formation of homogeneous ZIF-67 thin film. All of these were
demonstrated in the revised manuscript.
(2) Amounts of KCl was used in the liquid electrolyte for the QDSSCs, and
what is the function of KCl?
Usually, KCl is used as supporting electrolyte to add in the electrolyte. Here, we
thought it can increase conductivity of polysulfide electrolyte.
(3) In Figure 7, The Z" should be -Z".
It has been corrected. Thank you very much.
(4) Some related works (Sci China Mater., 2017,60:295; ACS Applied

by the sulfuration for 30 min shows an excellent light-to-electric
conversion efficiency of 3.77%, it is even higher than that of QDSSC based
on Pt CE (2.98%). I am impressed a lot with your way of explanation and

Thank you for your positive comments very much. We have revised our manuscript
according to your suggestions.
As we all know Pt is not suitable CE in QDSSCs, how author compare with
Pt CE and tells that an excellent light-to-electric conversation is
achieved. How ZIFs is beneficial compare to metal sulfides such as CuS,
NiS etc, should be explained in introduction section.
Carbonization and sulfuration of ZIF-67 will form the hybrid composition of C and
CoS. The hybrid CE possesses the function of both CoS and C, which will be
beneficial compared to alone metal sulfides. These were explained in the introduction
section.
A ZIF layer is firstly prepared by coating ZIF-67 powders on the conducting
glass, followed by the careful calcination treatments in sulfur vapor
(sulfuration) or nitrogen gas (carbonization). How author coated powder
on substrate, is it powder or paste?
The paste of ZIF-67 formed from ZIF-67 powders was deposited on FTO by the
doctor-blade method to form ZIF-67 thin film. The preparation processes were
demonstrated in the revised manuscript.
Introduction section is good, but author should discuss few points of
recently published paper results using ZIFs in introduction section.
The literatures on the ZIFs were updated in the introduction section.
80<U+2103> in vacuum? (Check once).
It was revised.
The SILAR approach was employed to modify ZnS on the surface of CdSe
QD-sensitized thin film. Check once that “modify” word?
The word of modify was changed as deposit in the revised manuscript.
SEM images seems not so bad but draw graph nicely.
SEM images in Fig.1 were improved in the revised manuscript.
How high surface area useful for improving efficiency, should explain in
BET analysis.
High surface area can offer more active sites for the reduction process. Therefore, CE
with high surface area will be beneficial to the efficiency improvement of solar cell.
This discussion was added in the revised manuscript.
How Pt coated on FTO substrate? Should mention in experimental section
The thermal decomposition processes of chloplatinic acid to prepare Pt CE on FTO
was described in the experimental section.
Why author used applied potential 0.13 V for measurement of Tafel
analysis.
I am sorry that the description on Tafel results analysis is not clear leading to
misunderstand. The corresponding current values at potential of 0.13 V were selected
to compare the conductivity of different samples. This sentence was rewritten.
Once again thank reviewers for your very important comments. These valuable
suggestions really improve our manuscript very much.
