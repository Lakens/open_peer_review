Tonomori et al describe a new species of Allodesmus from the Miocene of Japan, an important
new specimen which represents one of the most complete skeletons known from the Western
North Pacific. They incorporate the new taxon into a thorough phylogenetic analysis, and revise
the taxonomy of Allodesmus.
The paper is fairly well written and the figures are excellent and thorough, documenting every
bone from this remarkably complete specimen. The phylogenetic analysis is strong, with a good
sampling of outgroup taxa and almost every species of Allodesmus, and the discussion of the
results, along with taxonomic recommendations, seem reasonable.
I don’t really have much in the way of critical suggestions for this article, but I do have one
important suggestion. Unfortunately for the authors, their paper was likely finalized and/or
submitted right around the same time as a new species of Allodesmus, from Washington state,
was published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society (Boessenecker and Churchill
2018). That taxon is clearly a different species from A. uraiporensis described here, so that doesn’t
pose a problem. However, given the similarities in conclusions and discussion points,
Boessenecker and Churchill 2018 should be incorporated into the introduction and discussion.
This shouldn’t add a huge degree of revision for the paper, as I see this paper and the former as
being complementary to one another.
I would also strongly suggest the authors include Allodesmus demerei into their phylogenetic
analysis. In addition, it would also be nice to see one of the Pinnarctidion species be included
within the phylogenetic analysis. This genus has often considered to be somewhat allied with
Desmatophocidae, and its inclusion may impact the topology recovered.
I have a few other minor comments, largely grammar and spelling edits, which I have included
with the attached manuscript. Other than the above points I find this an excellent addition to the
fossil marine mammal literature, and I commend the authors for producing such a high quality
fossil description!

Dear Editor,
The new manuscript by Wataru Tonomori and colleagues naming a new species of seal in the
genus Allodesmus marks a fine contribution to marine mammal paleontology and another
welcome advance in the current ‘fossil pinniped renaissance’. Allodesmus is a diverse genus of
well-documented phocoid pinnipeds from the mid-late Miocene of the North Pacific,
documented principally from California and Japan, with other fossils from Washington and Baja
California. The new species is represented by a partial cranium and an excellent postcranial
skeleton, and is named Allodesmus uraiporensis within. The description is of generally good
quality, and the prose is excellent with minimal language editing required. Some aspects of the
discussion do need some additional attention (see below). This manuscript was submitted either
before or immediately after publication of a recent article: Boessenecker and Churchill (2018): The
last of the desmatophocid seals: a new species of Allodesmus from the upper Miocene of
Washington, USA, and a revision of the taxonomy of Desmatophocidae. Zoological Journal of the
Linnean Society (Online Early). The new paper by Boessenecker and Churchill describe the new
species Allodesmus demerei, reassess the taxonomy of Allodesmus (nearly 100% in line with this
excellent work by Tonomori et al.), provide a cladistic analysis (26 taxa, 96 characters), and
discuss the factors potentially contributing to the decline of the Desmatophocidae. Much of the
current manuscript will need to be updated in light of the new study. I wish to express my
gratitude to the authors for publishing important new research on fossil pinnipeds and giving me
something to read that is more interesting than fossil cetaceans! Given the needed adjustments to
the description, figures, and cladistic analysis I recommend 'moderate' revision, though that
option is not really available, so I have erred on the side of "major revision". Some minor
language editing is needed in places and I have commented on most of the obvious spelling
errors; some clarification of awkward text is needed as well.
Kind regards, Robert W. Boessenecker, Ph.D.

Description: The cranial description is quite brief, and there are certain aspects that need
improvement throughout; the comments are so numerous that I will issue a blanket statement
here instead. 1) In many cases adjectives like ‘broad’ or ‘narrow’ are used without reference to a
plane or view; I have no idea if, for example, a neural spine is anteroposteriorly broad,
dorsoventrally broad, or transversely broad. The authors should go through and carefully
identify every case and clarify. 2) In other cases it would be helpful to quantify many of these
statements with simple metrics, such as saying “feature X is broad (X% transverse width of
feature Y)”. Reporting some basic proportional differences would be very informative indeed,
particularly for the comparisons.

Taxonomy: the recent paper by Boessenecker and Churchill (2018) suggested many of the same
taxonomic changes, echoing careful and reasonable proposals by Kohno (1996). One point of
difference between the present MS and that of Boessenecker and Churchill; the latter recognized
A. sadoensis as a separate species, though to be clear only one of the authors has seen the
specimen in person. A. sadoensis does differ from A. sinanoensis (sensu Kohno, 1996) in lacking
M1-2 and having a proportionally smaller I3 (the latter may be attributable to sexual
dimorphism). The enormous premolars are also fairly distinctive. I have no problem with the
suggestion of Tonomori et al. to synonymize these taxa, but I think it is going to require a bit
more explanation and more specific, exact comparisons than is already provided. Additionally,
could A. sadoensis be included as a separate OTU? If the two are synonymous then a sister taxon
relationship between the two and an explanation of differing features would be more than
sufficient reason.
Cladistic analysis: The cladistic analyses are of similar scope, but the Tonomori analysis could be
improved by greater taxonomic sampling: I suggest including some of the taxa included by
Boessenecker and Churchill: Pinnarctidion spp., Desmatophoca brachycephala, Allodesmus
demerei, Allodesmus sadoensis (see above), Thalassoleon, Devinophoca, Proneotherium,
Neotherium, and Gomphotaria. Additionally, the cladogram in the figures is presented without
branch support values; no mention of branch support is provided in the text either; this
absolutely needs to be rectified. Branch support, bremer support – many options are available
and different working groups have their own nuanced preferences; I don’t care which, I’d like to
see some (or both types). Lastly, it may be a good idea to cross-check the characters from the
Boessenecker and Churchill list, as there may a few additional useful characters that could be
added to the present study.
Figures: I find that many of the postcranial images are quite small, and it is difficult, for example,
to interpret the “cardinal” elements of the postcrania: humerus, femur, astragalus, calcaneum.
Anatomical labels would also greatly help. Additionally, please place the left and right elements
into a combined figure (e.g. left and right femora) rather than separating into a figure of left
elements and a figure of right elements. I also suggest for clarity: please provide the age
boundaries on the diatom zones in Figure 1.
Minor comments:
2:19: capitalize Allodesminae
2:34: suggest: stagnated, until recently (Boessenecker & Churchill)
2:43-44: This statement is misleading – Allodesmus constitutes perhaps the most well-known
fossil pinniped, with the most completely illustrated postcranial skeleton, thanks to Mitchell
(1966). The postcrania are not described well, however, as that paper, despite being a monograph,
was intended only as an introductory paper. The Allodesmus demerei holotype also includes a
skull, mandible, and extensive postcranial skeleton (albeit mostly axial remains).
5:19: smooth
6:10: don’t these taxa also have a prenarial shelf?
6:25, and elsewhere: stenebrae
7: 10-12: which microfossil zones? Please be specific, and provide boundary dates and
appropriate citations.
9:39: are now missing and presumed lost.
11:42: tubercles?
12:6: accessoria; suggest adding “as in Otariidae”
12:21: suggest diaphysis instead of body
12:28: is the head further proximal than the tuberosities? This was a feature of Allodesmus we
proposed in our recent study on A. demerei.
12:40: hemispherical suggests convex; I suggest changing it to bowl-shaped, or something similar
Femur: I suppose the femur lacks a teres fovea? If so, it should be stated clearly.
16:27: anteroposteriorly
16:30: Is this overlapped condition the same condition in Odobenidae? I may have missed that
before. I see it’s in the character matrix.
5
17:44-46 – specifically mention that this clade is the Phocoidea.
19:44: please also list the number of species
20:48: unclear; please change to “strongly laterally compressed and distorted so that the prenarial
shelf is not obvious”
22:19-21: This might be related to sampling. Perhaps suggest something to the effect of “Further
sampling of lower Miocene marine rocks in Japan is necessary in order to clarify whether this
absence is natural” – in other words, most pinnipeds have a circum-North Pacific distribution
(not necessarily at the genus level) as far back as the mid-Miocene; could our absence of early
Miocene pinnipeds be caused by incomplete sampling? This may warrant some additional
discussion.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
I am pleased to have reviewed this manuscript as it focuses on allodesmines, which is one of the
most interesting groups of pinnipeds from the North Pacific region. This manuscript is well
constructed; the description is very detail, as are most of the figures. The phylogenetic analysis
and discussion of the validity of the distinct species of Allodesmus from Japan is a topic of
interest to anyone working on this group or with pinnipeds of the North Pacific. I commend the
authors for the detailed description of the postcranial elements as they are poorly known in most
extinct pinnipeds. The figures are generally clear and informative, although I suggest that some
be modified (see below).
I have some recommendations that I have outlined in detail below and that I hope the authors
take into consideration.
Main comments:
1) I strongly suggest the authors include Allodesmus demerei Boessenecker & Churchill, 2018, in
their revised version, if not possible to include in the phylogenetic analysis (which should not be
much of a problem) they should at least include it in their discussion and comparisons. This is a
6
highly relevant paper where the validity of other species of Allodesmus from the Eastern Pacific
are discussed and the text should be updated accordingly.
- Boessenecker, R. W., and M. Churchill. 2018. The last of the desmatophocid seals: a new species
of Allodesmus from the upper Miocene of Washington, USA, and a revision of the taxonomy of
Desmatophocidae. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society zlx098.
2) I strongly suggest the authors to label the distinct features of the postcranial elements.
Pinniped postcrania are rarely discussed or figured mainly because newly described species often
lack associated postcrania. Herein they have a unique opportunity to showcase this amazing
specimen (even more) and label the distinct features discussed in the text. By doing so it will
facilitate comparisons and descriptions for current and future generations.
3) Through the text there are references to the characters used in the phylogenetic analysis, I
strongly suggest the authors add the state they are referring to. For example in page 6, lines 4-8:
where it says “… by having the palatine fissure (incisive foramen) that is located anterior to the
canine (character 7) and an anteriorly located supraorbital process of the frontal (character 20), a
developed peroneal tubercle of the calcaneum (character 98);…” would be updated to “… by
having the palatine fissure (incisive foramen) that is located anterior to the canine (character 7[1])
and an anteriorly located supraorbital process of the frontal (character 20[0]), a developed
peroneal tubercle of the calcaneum (character 98[1]);…”
4) In the supplementary files, the specimen numbers listed for Potamotherium valletoni actually
belong to a mix of non-related taxa. Is it possible they should have another acronym, and not
LACM?
5) I suggest the authors make reference to the tables throughout the text, not only in the materials
and methods section.
Specific comments:
Page 1, line 54: I suggest the authors change “Middle to Late” to “middle to late” as those
subdivisions are not official and should not be capitalized.
Page 2, line 19: I suggest the authors change “allodesminae” for “Allodesminae”
Page 2, line 21: I suggest the authors abbreviate Atopotarus courseni as At. courseni.
Page 2, lines 43/44: I suggest the authors change “have been known from” to “are known from”
Page 2, line 55; Page 6, line 42; Page 7, line 10; Page 20, line 49; Page 21, line 43; Page 22, lines 7/8,
11, 30: I suggest the authors change “Middle Miocene” to “middle Miocene” as that subdivision is
not official and should not be capitalized.
Page 5, Emended diagnosis of the genus: This should be updated based on the recent work by
Boessenecker & Churchill (2018)
Page 5, lines 28/29: Change “smmoth” to “smooth”
Page 5, Included species: I suggest the authors add Allodesmus demerei Boessenecker &
Churchill, 2018
Page 6, line 23; Page 8, line 55; Page 10, lines 22/23, 26/27, 40; Figure 4 caption: These are several
7
instances of the use of “lumber” or “lumbers” I suggest the authors change to “lumbar” or
“lumbars”
Page 6, lines 24/25: I suggest the authors change “sterna” to “sternebrae”
Page 6, lines 49/50: I suggest the authors change “Early Miocene to Late Pliocene” to “early
Miocene and late Pliocene” as those subdivisions should not be capitalized.
Page 7, lines 30/31: Change “carnium” to “cranium”
Page 7, lines 34/35: I suggest the authors change: “The premaxilla that forms the narial opening is
large and has thick margin…” to “The premaxilla forms the large narial opening and has thick
margins…”
Page 7, line 48: Change “paratal” to “palatal”
Page 7, line 51/52: “the infraorbital foramen is relatively enlarged…”
Stating that a feature is large or small is relative, can the authors add a ratio that can be used to
better quantify this. For example, can the authors compare with another measurement of the
skull, like “the infraorbital foramen is enlarged relative to the basal rostral width”, what would
be the ratio in this taxon and how does it compare to other species?
Page 8, lines 3/4: Does the palatine expands under the orbit?
Page 8, line 13: Change “alveorus” to “alveolus”
Page 8, line 15: I suggest the authors change: “The squamosal is almost missing…” to “The
squamosal is mostly missing…”
Page 8, line 19: I suggest the authors change: “… interrocking to the postorbital…” to
“interlocking with the postorbital…”
Page 8, line 32: change “tooth” for “teeth”
Page 8, lines 43/44: I suggest changing: “… than those of premolars.” to “… than those of the
premolars.”
Page 8, line 57: I suggest changing: “… preserved for AMP 25.” to“… preserved in AMP 25.”
Page 9, line 2: I suggest changing: “… are collected, of which…” to “… are preserved, of
which…”
Page 9, lines 11-12: I suggest changing: “… foramen is egg-shaped well as that of C6.” to “…
foramen is ovoid as well as that of C6.”
Page 9, line 23: I suggest changing: “The ventral tubercle is a fan-shaped thick plate, expanding
anteroposteriorly.” to The ventral tubercle is an anteroposteriorly expanded, fan-shaped, thick
plate.”

dorsoventrally.”
Page 9, lines 53/54: I suggest the authors change: “… is ventrodorsally long…” to “… is
dorsoventrally long…”

and…” to “The preserved four lumbars are very similar to each other and…”

astragalus.” to “… lateral surface of the astragalar trochlea.”
Page 15, line 46: “… astragalus is concave and rounded,” is it concave transversely,
dorsoventrally, or both?
Page 15, lines 46/48: I suggest the authors change: “… and it is laterally wide.”
Page 16, lines 3/4: “… longus on the planter.” do the authors mean “plantar surface”?
Page 16, line 17: I suggest the authors change: “The planter…” to “The plantar…”

Page 20, line 1: remove “nine”
Page 20, line 40: I suggest the authors change: “… because the morphologies of…” to “… because
the morphology of…”
Page 21, line 51: a more anteriorly located supraorbital process does not necessarily suggest a
smaller orbit, the postorbital process of the jugal is likely a better proxy. Allodesmus is
characterized by its relatively large orbits so this would be interesting. However, if the authors
want to test whether the eyes were relatively smaller, I suggest they compare the ratio between
diameter of the orbits (as measured in Debey & Pyenson, 2013) to the bizygomatic width of the
skull (it should be possible to estimate it for AMP25) or width of rostrum at base, and compare
those ratios with other species of Allodesmus.
Page 22, line 11: I suggest the authors change: “… in the eastern North Pacific during the…” to
“… in that region during the…”
Page 22, lines 33/36: I suggest the authors change: “…Allodesminae of the Desmatophocidae is
represented…” to “… Allodesminae is represented…”
Figure 3. change “superorbit” to “supraorbital”
Figure 11. My suggestion is that a time-calibrated tree is much more imformative that just a
simple tree showing the topology.

Comments to the Author(s)
Tonomori et al describe a new species of Allodesmus from the Miocene of Japan, an important
new specimen which represents one of the most complete skeletons known from the Western
North Pacific. They incorporate the new taxon into a thorough phylogenetic analysis, and revise
the taxonomy of Allodesmus.
The paper is fairly well written and the figures are excellent and thorough, documenting every
bone from this remarkably complete specimen. The phylogenetic analysis is strong, with a good
sampling of outgroup taxa and almost every species of Allodesmus, and the discussion of the
results, along with taxonomic recommendations, seem reasonable.
I don’t really have much in the way of critical suggestions for this article, but I do have one
important suggestion. Unfortunately for the authors, their paper was likely finalized and/or
submitted right around the same time as a new species of Allodesmus, from Washington state,
was published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society (Boessenecker and Churchill
2018). That taxon is clearly a different species from A. uraiporensis described here, so that doesn’t
pose a problem. However, given the similarities in conclusions and discussion points,
Boessenecker and Churchill 2018 should be incorporated into the introduction and discussion.
This shouldn’t add a huge degree of revision for the paper, as I see this paper and the former as
being complementary to one another.
I would also strongly suggest the authors include Allodesmus demerei into their phylogenetic
analysis. In addition, it would also be nice to see one of the Pinnarctidion species be included
within the phylogenetic analysis. This genus has often considered to be somewhat allied with
Desmatophocidae, and its inclusion may impact the topology recovered.
I have a few other minor comments, largely grammar and spelling edits, which I have included
with the attached manuscript. Other than the above points I find this an excellent addition to the
fossil marine mammal literature, and I commend the authors for producing such a high quality
fossil description!

Comments to the Author(s)
Dear Editor,
The new manuscript by Wataru Tonomori and colleagues naming a new species of seal in the
genus Allodesmus marks a fine contribution to marine mammal paleontology and another
welcome advance in the current ‘fossil pinniped renaissance’. Allodesmus is a diverse genus of
well-documented phocoid pinnipeds from the mid-late Miocene of the North Pacific,
documented principally from California and Japan, with other fossils from Washington and Baja
California. The new species is represented by a partial cranium and an excellent postcranial
skeleton, and is named Allodesmus uraiporensis within. The description is of generally good
quality, and the prose is excellent with minimal language editing required. Some aspects of the
discussion do need some additional attention (see below). This manuscript was submitted either
before or immediately after publication of a recent article: Boessenecker and Churchill (2018): The
last of the desmatophocid seals: a new species of Allodesmus from the upper Miocene of
Washington, USA, and a revision of the taxonomy of Desmatophocidae. Zoological Journal of the
Linnean Society (Online Early). The new paper by Boessenecker and Churchill describe the new
species Allodesmus demerei, reassess the taxonomy of Allodesmus (nearly 100% in line with this
excellent work by Tonomori et al.), provide a cladistic analysis (26 taxa, 96 characters), and
discuss the factors potentially contributing to the decline of the Desmatophocidae. Much of the
current manuscript will need to be updated in light of the new study. I wish to express my
gratitude to the authors for publishing important new research on fossil pinnipeds and giving me
something to read that is more interesting than fossil cetaceans! Given the needed adjustments to
the description, figures, and cladistic analysis I recommend 'moderate' revision, though that
option is not really available, so I have erred on the side of "major revision". Some minor
language editing is needed in places and I have commented on most of the obvious spelling
errors; some clarification of awkward text is needed as well.
Kind regards, Robert W. Boessenecker, Ph.D.

Description: The cranial description is quite brief, and there are certain aspects that need
improvement throughout; the comments are so numerous that I will issue a blanket statement
here instead. 1) In many cases adjectives like ‘broad’ or ‘narrow’ are used without reference to a
plane or view; I have no idea if, for example, a neural spine is anteroposteriorly broad,
dorsoventrally broad, or transversely broad. The authors should go through and carefully
identify every case and clarify. 2) In other cases it would be helpful to quantify many of these
statements with simple metrics, such as saying “feature X is broad (X% transverse width of
feature Y)”. Reporting some basic proportional differences would be very informative indeed,
particularly for the comparisons.
Taxonomy: the recent paper by Boessenecker and Churchill (2018) suggested many of the same
taxonomic changes, echoing careful and reasonable proposals by Kohno (1996). One point of
difference between the present MS and that of Boessenecker and Churchill; the latter recognized
A. sadoensis as a separate species, though to be clear only one of the authors has seen the
specimen in person. A. sadoensis does differ from A. sinanoensis (sensu Kohno, 1996) in lacking
M1-2 and having a proportionally smaller I3 (the latter may be attributable to sexual
dimorphism). The enormous premolars are also fairly distinctive. I have no problem with the
suggestion of Tonomori et al. to synonymize these taxa, but I think it is going to require a bit
more explanation and more specific, exact comparisons than is already provided. Additionally,
could A. sadoensis be included as a separate OTU? If the two are synonymous then a sister taxon
relationship between the two and an explanation of differing features would be more than
sufficient reason.
14
Cladistic analysis: The cladistic analyses are of similar scope, but the Tonomori analysis could be
improved by greater taxonomic sampling: I suggest including some of the taxa included by
Boessenecker and Churchill: Pinnarctidion spp., Desmatophoca brachycephala, Allodesmus
demerei, Allodesmus sadoensis (see above), Thalassoleon, Devinophoca, Proneotherium,
Neotherium, and Gomphotaria. Additionally, the cladogram in the figures is presented without
branch support values; no mention of branch support is provided in the text either; this
absolutely needs to be rectified. Branch support, bremer support – many options are available
and different working groups have their own nuanced preferences; I don’t care which, I’d like to
see some (or both types). Lastly, it may be a good idea to cross-check the characters from the
Boessenecker and Churchill list, as there may a few additional useful characters that could be
added to the present study.
Figures: I find that many of the postcranial images are quite small, and it is difficult, for example,
to interpret the “cardinal” elements of the postcrania: humerus, femur, astragalus, calcaneum.
Anatomical labels would also greatly help. Additionally, please place the left and right elements
into a combined figure (e.g. left and right femora) rather than separating into a figure of left
elements and a figure of right elements. I also suggest for clarity: please provide the age
boundaries on the diatom zones in Figure 1.
Minor comments:
2:19: capitalize Allodesminae
2:34: suggest: stagnated, until recently (Boessenecker & Churchill)
2:43-44: This statement is misleading – Allodesmus constitutes perhaps the most well-known
fossil pinniped, with the most completely illustrated postcranial skeleton, thanks to Mitchell
(1966). The postcrania are not described well, however, as that paper, despite being a monograph,
was intended only as an introductory paper. The Allodesmus demerei holotype also includes a
skull, mandible, and extensive postcranial skeleton (albeit mostly axial remains).
5:19: smooth
6:10: don’t these taxa also have a prenarial shelf?
6:25, and elsewhere: stenebrae
7: 10-12: which microfossil zones? Please be specific, and provide boundary dates and
appropriate citations.
9:39: are now missing and presumed lost.
11:42: tubercles?
12:6: accessoria; suggest adding “as in Otariidae”
12:21: suggest diaphysis instead of body
12:28: is the head further proximal than the tuberosities? This was a feature of Allodesmus we
proposed in our recent study on A. demerei.
12:40: hemispherical suggests convex; I suggest changing it to bowl-shaped, or something similar
Femur: I suppose the femur lacks a teres fovea? If so, it should be stated clearly.
16:27: anteroposteriorly
16:30: Is this overlapped condition the same condition in Odobenidae? I may have missed that
before. I see it’s in the character matrix.
17:44-46 – specifically mention that this clade is the Phocoidea.
19:44: please also list the number of species
20:48: unclear; please change to “strongly laterally compressed and distorted so that the prenarial
shelf is not obvious”
22:19-21: This might be related to sampling. Perhaps suggest something to the effect of “Further
sampling of lower Miocene marine rocks in Japan is necessary in order to clarify whether this
absence is natural” – in other words, most pinnipeds have a circum-North Pacific distribution
(not necessarily at the genus level) as far back as the mid-Miocene; could our absence of early
Miocene pinnipeds be caused by incomplete sampling? This may warrant some additional
discussion.

Comments to the Author(s)
I am pleased to have reviewed this manuscript as it focuses on allodesmines, which is one of the
most interesting groups of pinnipeds from the North Pacific region. This manuscript is well
constructed; the description is very detail, as are most of the figures. The phylogenetic analysis
and discussion of the validity of the distinct species of Allodesmus from Japan is a topic of
interest to anyone working on this group or with pinnipeds of the North Pacific. I commend the
authors for the detailed description of the postcranial elements as they are poorly known in most
extinct pinnipeds. The figures are generally clear and informative, although I suggest that some
be modified (see below).
I have some recommendations that I have outlined in detail below and that I hope the authors
take into consideration.
Main comments:
1) I strongly suggest the authors include Allodesmus demerei Boessenecker & Churchill, 2018, in
their revised version, if not possible to include in the phylogenetic analysis (which should not be
much of a problem) they should at least include it in their discussion and comparisons. This is a
highly relevant paper where the validity of other species of Allodesmus from the Eastern Pacific
are discussed and the text should be updated accordingly.
- Boessenecker, R. W., and M. Churchill. 2018. The last of the desmatophocid seals: a new species
of Allodesmus from the upper Miocene of Washington, USA, and a revision of the taxonomy of
Desmatophocidae. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society zlx098.
2) I strongly suggest the authors to label the distinct features of the postcranial elements.
Pinniped postcrania are rarely discussed or figured mainly because newly described species often
lack associated postcrania. Herein they have a unique opportunity to showcase this amazing
specimen (even more) and label the distinct features discussed in the text. By doing so it will
facilitate comparisons and descriptions for current and future generations.
3) Through the text there are references to the characters used in the phylogenetic analysis, I
strongly suggest the authors add the state they are referring to. For example in page 6, lines 4-8:
where it says “… by having the palatine fissure (incisive foramen) that is located anterior to the
canine (character 7) and an anteriorly located supraorbital process of the frontal (character 20), a
developed peroneal tubercle of the calcaneum (character 98);…” would be updated to “… by
having the palatine fissure (incisive foramen) that is located anterior to the canine (character 7[1])
and an anteriorly located supraorbital process of the frontal (character 20[0]), a developed
peroneal tubercle of the calcaneum (character 98[1]);…”
4) In the supplementary files, the specimen numbers listed for Potamotherium valletoni actually
belong to a mix of non-related taxa. Is it possible they should have another acronym, and not
LACM?
5) I suggest the authors make reference to the tables throughout the text, not only in the materials
and methods section.
Specific comments:
Page 1, line 54: I suggest the authors change “Middle to Late” to “middle to late” as those
subdivisions are not official and should not be capitalized.
Page 2, line 19: I suggest the authors change “allodesminae” for “Allodesminae”
16
Page 2, line 21: I suggest the authors abbreviate Atopotarus courseni as At. courseni.
Page 2, lines 43/44: I suggest the authors change “have been known from” to “are known from”
Page 2, line 55; Page 6, line 42; Page 7, line 10; Page 20, line 49; Page 21, line 43; Page 22, lines 7/8,
11, 30: I suggest the authors change “Middle Miocene” to “middle Miocene” as that subdivision is
not official and should not be capitalized.
Page 5, Emended diagnosis of the genus: This should be updated based on the recent work by
Boessenecker & Churchill (2018)
Page 5, lines 28/29: Change “smmoth” to “smooth”
Page 5, Included species: I suggest the authors add Allodesmus demerei Boessenecker &
Churchill, 2018
Page 6, line 23; Page 8, line 55; Page 10, lines 22/23, 26/27, 40; Figure 4 caption: These are several
instances of the use of “lumber” or “lumbers” I suggest the authors change to “lumbar” or
“lumbars”
Page 6, lines 24/25: I suggest the authors change “sterna” to “sternebrae”
Page 6, lines 49/50: I suggest the authors change “Early Miocene to Late Pliocene” to “early
Miocene and late Pliocene” as those subdivisions should not be capitalized.
Page 7, lines 30/31: Change “carnium” to “cranium”
Page 7, lines 34/35: I suggest the authors change: “The premaxilla that forms the narial opening is
large and has thick margin…” to “The premaxilla forms the large narial opening and has thick
margins…”
Page 7, line 48: Change “paratal” to “palatal”
Page 7, line 51/52: “the infraorbital foramen is relatively enlarged…”
Stating that a feature is large or small is relative, can the authors add a ratio that can be used to
better quantify this. For example, can the authors compare with another measurement of the
skull, like “the infraorbital foramen is enlarged relative to the basal rostral width”, what would
be the ratio in this taxon and how does it compare to other species?
Page 8, lines 3/4: Does the palatine expands under the orbit?
Page 8, line 13: Change “alveorus” to “alveolus”
Page 8, line 15: I suggest the authors change: “The squamosal is almost missing…” to “The
squamosal is mostly missing…”

“interlocking with the postorbital…”

dorsoventrally, or both?

Page 21, line 51: a more anteriorly located supraorbital process does not necessarily suggest a
smaller orbit, the postorbital process of the jugal is likely a better proxy. Allodesmus is
characterized by its relatively large orbits so this would be interesting. However, if the authors
want to test whether the eyes were relatively smaller, I suggest they compare the ratio between
diameter of the orbits (as measured in Debey & Pyenson, 2013) to the bizygomatic width of the
skull (it should be possible to estimate it for AMP25) or width of rostrum at base, and compare
those ratios with other species of Allodesmus.
Page 22, line 11: I suggest the authors change: “… in the eastern North Pacific during the…” to
“… in that region during the…”
Page 22, lines 33/36: I suggest the authors change: “…Allodesminae of the Desmatophocidae is

Figure 3. change “superorbit” to “supraorbital”
Figure 11. My suggestion is that a time-calibrated tree is much more imformative that just a
simple tree showing the topology.

Comments to the Author(s)
Tonomori et al describe a new species of Allodesmus from the Miocene of Japan, an
important new specimen which represents one of the most complete skeletons known
from the Western North Pacific. They incorporate the new taxon into a thorough
phylogenetic analysis, and revise the taxonomy of Allodesmus.
The paper is fairly well written and the figures are excellent and thorough, documenting
every bone from this remarkably complete specimen. The phylogenetic analysis is strong,
with a good sampling of outgroup taxa and almost every species of Allodesmus, and the
discussion of the results, along with taxonomic recommendations, seem reasonable.
I don’t really have much in the way of critical suggestions for this article, but I do have
one important suggestion. Unfortunately for the authors, their paper was likely finalized
and/or submitted right around the same time as a new species of Allodesmus, from
Washington State, was published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society
(Boessenecker and Churchill 2018). That taxon is clearly a different species from A.
uraiporensis described here, so that doesn’t pose a problem. However, given the
similarities in conclusions and discussion points, Boessenecker and Churchill 2018
should be incorporated into the introduction and discussion. This shouldn’t add a huge
degree of revision for the paper, as I see this paper and the former as being complementary
to one another.
<U+2192>We included Boessebecker and Churchill (2018) in our analysis and discussion. Thank
you very much for the information which updated our manuscript!
I would also strongly suggest the authors include Allodesmus demerei into their
phylogenetic analysis. In addition, it would also be nice to see one of the Pinnarctidion
species be included within the phylogenetic analysis. This genus has often considered to
be somewhat allied with Desmatophocidae, and its inclusion may impact the topology
recovered.
<U+2192>We added Allodesmus demerei, Pinnarctidion spp. and Desmatophoca brachycephala
to our analysis.
I have a few other minor comments, largely grammar and spelling edits, which I have
included with the attached manuscript. Other than the above points I find this an excellent
addition to the fossil marine mammal literature, and I commend the authors for producing
such a high quality fossil description!

Comments to the Author(s)
Dear Editor,
The new manuscript by Wataru Tonomori and colleagues naming a new species of seal in
the genus Allodesmus marks a fine contribution to marine mammal paleontology and
another welcome advance in the current ‘fossil pinniped renaissance’. Allodesmus is a
diverse genus of well-documented phocoid pinnipeds from the mid-late Miocene of the
North Pacific, documented principally from California and Japan, with other fossils from
Washington and Baja California. The new species is represented by a partial cranium and
an excellent postcranial skeleton, and is named Allodesmus uraiporensis within. The
description is of generally good quality, and the prose is excellent with minimal language
editing required. Some aspects of the discussion do need some additional attention (see
below). This manuscript was submitted either before or immediately after publication of
a recent article: Boessenecker and Churchill (2018): The last of the desmatophocid seals:
a new species of Allodesmus from the upper Miocene of Washington, USA, and a revision
of the taxonomy of Desmatophocidae. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society (Online
Early). The new paper by Boessenecker and Churchill describe the new species
Allodesmus demerei, reassess the taxonomy of Allodesmus (nearly 100% in line with this
excellent work by Tonomori et al.), provide a cladistic analysis (26 taxa, 96 characters),
and discuss the factors potentially contributing to the decline of the Desmatophocidae.
Much of the current manuscript will need to be updated in light of the new study.
<U+2192> We included Boessenecker and Churchill paper on Al. demerei in our revised
manuscript, including the phylogenetic analysis.
I wish to express my gratitude to the authors for publishing important new research on
fossil pinnipeds and giving me something to read that is more interesting than fossil
cetaceans! Given the needed adjustments to the description, figures, and cladistic analysis
I recommend 'moderate' revision, though that option is not really available, so I have erred
on the side of "major revision". Some minor language editing is needed in places and I
have commented on most of the obvious spelling errors; some clarification of awkward
text is needed as well.
<U+2192> We thank the reviewer for the encouraging comments and responded to every one of
them below.
Kind regards, Robert W. Boessenecker, Ph.D.

Description: The cranial description is quite brief, and there are certain aspects that need
improvement throughout; the comments are so numerous that I will issue a blanket
statement here instead.
1) In many cases adjectives like ‘broad’ or ‘narrow’ are used without reference to a plane
or view; I have no idea if, for example, a neural spine is anteroposteriorly broad,
dorsoventrally broad, or transversely broad. The authors should go through and carefully
identify every case and clarify.
2) In other cases it would be helpful to quantify many of these statements with simple
metrics, such as saying “feature X is broad (X% transverse width of feature Y)”.
Reporting some basic proportional differences would be very informative indeed,
particularly for the comparisons.
<U+2192> 1) The plane/view is mentioned throughout the revised manuscript
<U+2192> 2) Relative length and width of the prenarial shelf and the posterior expansion of the
palatine are important in distinguishing different species of Allodesmus, and they are
expressed in percentage terms in the revised description.
Taxonomy: the recent paper by Boessenecker and Churchill (2018) suggested many of
the same taxonomic changes, echoing careful and reasonable proposals by Kohno (1996).
One point of difference between the present MS and that of Boessenecker and Churchill;
the latter recognized A. sadoensis as a separate species, though to be clear only one of the
authors has seen the specimen in person. A. sadoensis does differ from A. sinanoensis
(sensu Kohno, 1996) in lacking M1-2 and having a proportionally smaller I3 (the latter
may be attributable to sexual dimorphism). The enormous premolars are also fairly
distinctive. I have no problem with the suggestion of Tonomori et al. to synonymize these
taxa, but I think it is going to require a bit more explanation and more specific, exact
comparisons than is already provided. Additionally, could A. sadoensis be included as a
separate OTU? If the two are synonymous then a sister taxon relationship between the
two and an explanation of differing features would be more than sufficient reason.
<U+2192> We re-analyzed with Al. sadoensis as a separate OTU, but no character distinguishes
this species and Al. sinanoensis. We interpret the differences pointed out by the
reviewer are attributed to sexual dimorphism or ontogeny.
Cladistic analysis: The cladistic analyses are of similar scope, but the Tonomori analysis
could be improved by greater taxonomic sampling: I suggest including some of the taxa
included by Boessenecker and Churchill: Pinnarctidion spp., Desmatophoca
brachycephala, Allodesmus demerei, Allodesmus sadoensis (see above), Thalassoleon,
Devinophoca, Proneotherium, Neotherium, and Gomphotaria. Additionally, the
cladogram in the figures is presented without branch support values; no mention of branch
support is provided in the text either; this absolutely needs to be rectified. Branch support,
bremer support – many options are available and different working groups have their own
nuanced preferences; I don’t care which, I’d like to see some (or both types). Lastly, it
may be a good idea to cross-check the characters from the Boessenecker and Churchill
list, as there may a few additional useful characters that could be added to the present
study.
<U+2192>We have recognized that limited number of taxon sampling for some non-allodesmine
pinnipeds may have been a factor of retaining the unresolved polytomy in the results of
our phylogenetic analyses. Because our primally focus was to reconstruct the
relationships of allodesmine species within the Allodesminae, and we thus concentrated
collecting more restricted morphological characters and more related taxa to consider
relationships within this clade than those within each clade of sister- and outgroup taxa.
Now we added some important and relevant taxa based on the advice from the reviewers
such as Pinnarctidion spp., Desmatophoca brachycephala, Allodesmus “sadoensis” (that
was initially treated as a junior synonym of Allodesmus sinanoensis and had excluded
from our cladistic analyses) as well as Allodesmus demerei (that was published just after
we submitted the current manuscript) to our data matrix to re-analyse their relationships
as a whole, and we obtained much clear result. The reviewers’ advice is appreciated.
Figures: I find that many of the postcranial images are quite small, and it is difficult, for
example, to interpret the “cardinal” elements of the postcrania: humerus, femur,
astragalus, calcaneum. Anatomical labels would also greatly help. Additionally, please
place the left and right elements into a combined figure (e.g. left and right femora) rather
than separating into a figure of left elements and a figure of right elements. I also suggest
for clarity: please provide the age boundaries on the diatom zones in Figure 1.
<U+2192> The revised figures of major bones (humerus, femur) are enlarged, and re-organized
per elements (not per side in the previous version). We also labeled important features.
In Figure 1, numerical ages for each diatom zones.
Minor comments:
2:19: capitalize Allodesminae
<U+2192>done
2:34: suggest: stagnated, until recently (Boessenecker & Churchill)
<U+2192>done
2:43-44: This statement is misleading – Allodesmus constitutes perhaps the most well-
known fossil pinniped, with the most completely illustrated postcranial skeleton, thanks
to Mitchell (1966). The postcrania are not described well, however, as that paper, despite
being a monograph, was intended only as an introductory paper. The Allodesmus demerei
holotype also includes a skull, mandible, and extensive postcranial skeleton (albeit mostly
axial remains).
<U+2192> Allodesmus demerei is mentioned in the revised manuscript. We mentioned all
previous works on reasonably preserved postcrania, and now do not think our statement
is misleading.
5:19: smooth
<U+2192>done
6:10: don’t these taxa also have a prenarial shelf?
<U+2192> The prenarial shelf is present in all species of Allodesmus, and the revised manuscript
mentions the different degrees of development of the shelf.
6:25, and elsewhere: stenebrae
<U+2192>done
7: 10-12: which microfossil zones? Please be specific, and provide boundary dates and
appropriate citations.
<U+2192> Specific zones and their dates and references are given in the revised manuscript.
9:39: are now missing and presumed lost.
<U+2192>done
11:42: tubercles?
<U+2192>we changed “tubercula” to “tubercles”
12:6: accessoria; suggest adding “as in Otariidae”
<U+2192>done
12:21: suggest diaphysis instead of body
<U+2192>done
12:28: is the head further proximal than the tuberosities? This was a feature of Allodesmus
we proposed in our recent study on A. demerei.
<U+2192> The head is damaged and only its base is preserved. However, as a reviewer pointed
out, it is slightly higher than both tuberosities on our specimen, so we added this in the
description.
12:40: hemispherical suggests convex; I suggest changing it to bowl-shaped, or
something similar
<U+2192>done (bowl-shaped)
Femur: I suppose the femur lacks a teres fovea? If so, it should be stated clearly.
<U+2192> The fovea capitis for the ligamentum teres femoris on the femoral head (i.e., fovea
capitis femoris or teres fovea) is absent and we mentioned it in the revised manuscript.
16:27: anteroposteriorly
<U+2192>done
16:30: Is this overlapped condition the same condition in Odobenidae? I may have missed
that before. I see it’s in the character matrix.
<U+2192> They do overlap in Odonbenidae, and we mentioned so in the revision.
17:44-46 – specifically mention that this clade is the Phocoidea.
<U+2192>done
19:44: please also list the number of species
<U+2192>we add the number of species.
20:48: unclear; please change to “strongly laterally compressed and distorted so that the
prenarial shelf is not obvious”
<U+2192>done
22:19-21: This might be related to sampling. Perhaps suggest something to the effect of
“Further sampling of lower Miocene marine rocks in Japan is necessary in order to clarify
whether this absence is natural” – in other words, most pinnipeds have a circum-North
Pacific distribution (not necessarily at the genus level) as far back as the mid-Miocene;
could our absence of early Miocene pinnipeds be caused by incomplete sampling? This
may warrant some additional discussion.
<U+2192> The possibility of sampling bias is mentioned, with additional info
(occurrence of Atpotarus sp. of similar age) which suggests certain level of
diversity of Allodesminae by the middle Miocene in Japan.

Comments to the Author(s)
I am pleased to have reviewed this manuscript as it focuses on allodesmines, which is one
of the most interesting groups of pinnipeds from the North Pacific region. This manuscript
is well constructed; the description is very detail, as are most of the figures. The
phylogenetic analysis and discussion of the validity of the distinct species of Allodesmus
from Japan is a topic of interest to anyone working on this group or with pinnipeds of the
North Pacific. I commend the authors for the detailed description of the postcranial
elements as they are poorly known in most extinct pinnipeds. The figures are generally
clear and informative, although I suggest that some be modified (see below).
I have some recommendations that I have outlined in detail below and that I hope the
authors take into consideration.
Main comments:
1) I strongly suggest the authors include Allodesmus demerei Boessenecker & Churchill,
2018, in their revised version, if not possible to include in the phylogenetic analysis
(which should not be much of a problem) they should at least include it in their discussion
and comparisons. This is a highly relevant paper where the validity of other species of
Allodesmus from the Eastern Pacific are discussed and the text should be updated
accordingly. - Boessenecker, R. W., and M. Churchill. 2018. The last of the
desmatophocid seals: a new species of Allodesmus from the upper Miocene of
Washington, USA, and a revision of the taxonomy of Desmatophocidae. Zoological
Journal of the Linnean Society zlx098.
<U+2192> We included the Boessenecker and Churchill paper in the revised manuscript. Refer
to our response to the similar suggestions from two other reviewers above.
2) I strongly suggest the authors to label the distinct features of the postcranial elements.
Pinniped postcrania are rarely discussed or figured mainly because newly described
species often lack associated postcrania. Herein they have a unique opportunity to
showcase this amazing specimen (even more) and label the distinct features discussed in
the text. By doing so it will facilitate comparisons and descriptions for current and future
generations.
<U+2192> We labeled distinct features of the postcranial elements in figures.
3) Through the text there are references to the characters used in the phylogenetic analysis,
I strongly suggest the authors add the state they are referring to. For example in page 6,
lines 4-8: where it says “… by having the palatine fissure (incisive foramen) that is
located anterior to the canine (character 7) and an anteriorly located supraorbital process
of the frontal (character 20), a developed peroneal tubercle of the calcaneum (character
98);…” would be updated to “… by having the palatine fissure (incisive foramen) that is
located anterior to the canine (character 7[1]) and an anteriorly located supraorbital
process of the frontal (character 20[0]), a developed peroneal tubercle of the calcaneum
(character 98[1]);…”
<U+2192>Done
4) In the supplementary files, the specimen numbers listed for Potamotherium valletoni
actually belong to a mix of non-related taxa. Is it possible they should have another
acronym, and not LACM?
<U+2192> Yes! They are NMNS specimens and mentioned so in the revised supplementary file
(with two more specimens missed in the first version).
5) I suggest the authors make reference to the tables throughout the text, not only in the
materials and methods section.

Stating that a feature is large or small is relative, can the authors add a ratio that can be
used to better quantify this. For example, can the authors compare with another
measurement of the skull, like “the infraorbital foramen is enlarged relative to the basal
rostral width”, what would be the ratio in this taxon and how does it compare to other
species?

Page 21, line 51: a more anteriorly located supraorbital process does not necessarily

Allodesmus is characterized by its relatively large orbits so this would be interesting.
However, if the authors want to test whether the eyes were relatively smaller, I suggest
they compare the ratio between diameter of the orbits (as measured in Debey & Pyenson,
2013) to the bizygomatic width of the skull (it should be possible to estimate it for
AMP25) or width of rostrum at base, and compare those ratios with other species of
Allodesmus.
