In this manuscript, the authors summarized the research and application of MOFs in the area of
lithium-ion batteries and lithium-sulfur batteries. The content of the manuscript is of logic and
significance. But there are some problems as follows:
(1) The authors wrote that “Zhou et al [101] proposed a compartment with MOFs, which plays an
important role in ion separation in lithium-sulfur batteries. Its working principle is shown in
Figure 31.” But I don’t think this part belongs to MOF-derived carbon electrode materials for
lithium-sulfur batteries. It should be MOF-based separator for lithium-sulfur batteries. The
authors can deal with them separately and add some similar content and tables for better
comparison.
(2) Many figures are chosen with no logic. The structure and electrochemical performance should
be shown as one figure. And the image resolution of the figures should be improved.
After the above problems have been carefully addressed, the manuscript is suitable for
publication in Royal Society Open Science.

where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.

Response to reviewers
We would like to thank the editor and the reviewers for the valuable comments and
good suggestions. We have incorporated most of the reviewers’ comments and
suggestions into the revised manuscript, and also provided more explanations to the
reviewers’ questions.

Comments:
In this manuscript, the authors summarized the research and application of MOFs in the area of
lithium-ion batteries and lithium-sulfur batteries. The content of the manuscript is of logic and
significance. But there are some problems as follows:
1. The authors wrote that “Zhou et al [101] proposed a compartment with MOFs, which
plays an important role in ion separation in lithium-sulfur batteries. Its working principle is
shown in Figure 31.” But I don’t think this part belongs to MOF-derived carbon electrode
materials for lithium-sulfur batteries. It should be MOF-based separator for lithium-sulfur
batteries. The authors can deal with them separately and add some similar content and
tables for better comparison.
In the revised manuscript, we delete this part that does not belong to electrode materials, because
we mainly introduce electrode materials of lithium-ion batteries and lithium-sulfur batteries in our
manuscript, this part belongs to the separator of batteries and does not belong to the electrode
materials, so we delete this part from initial manuscript.
2. Many figures are chosen with no logic. The structure and electrochemical performance
should be shown as one figure. And the image resolution of the figures should be improved.
The result of the modification is to make the selection of pictures more logical and to combine
structure and performance on a single figure. The resolution of many images has been improved as
much as possible.

The review titled “The application of metal-organic frameworks in the electrode materials for
lithium-ion batteries and lithium sulfur batteries” by Zhu et al. covers the literature of some of the
hottest aspects in the field of electrochemical energy storage. Most of the previous comments have
been addressed with care. The manuscript looks well-organized and of high technical standard.
Hence, it can be accepted after following minor revisions.
1.The role of MOFs in MOFs based composites should be clearly highlighted w.r.t.
electrochemical energy storage.
In the revised manuscript, we added a paragraph to emphasize the role of MOFs in MOFs-based
composites after introducing lithium-sulfur batteries. In the last part, we emphasize the role of
MOFs in MOF-based composites by introducing composite electrodes.
2.Why MOF in its original (pristine) form do not perform well for batteries system?
Conductivity and stability are the main obstacles to the application of MOFs in batteries systems.
Many of the original forms of MOF are unstable in the air and can only be preserved in specific
solvents,normally, the conductivity of original form of MOF is not very good, so MOF in its
original (pristine) form do not perform well for batteries system. In the revised manuscript,at the
beginning of the MOF-derived electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries and the end of MOF-
derived carbon electrode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries, we have a brief introduction of the
additions.
3.Following MOF based articles on other electrochemical energy storage systems can be
cited in the introduction: J. Mater. Chem. A, 2016,4, 16432-16445; J. Mater. Chem. A,
2017,5, 17998-18011; J. Mater. Chem. A, 2019,7, 1725-1736.
We quote some of the articles mentioned by the reviewer. References 110, 111, 112 can be found in
the revised manuscript.
