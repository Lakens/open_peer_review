Associate Editor comments to authors:
I have reviewed the topic of the paper and the reviewers' comments and subsequent replies. I
think the paper is of interest to the open science audience and that the authors have made
considerable efforts to answer the reviewers comments (which were mostly about positioning
and motivation). I believe this should be published in open science.
