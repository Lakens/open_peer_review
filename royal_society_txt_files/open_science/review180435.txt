Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
This manuscript describes work conducted on a population of Kalahari meerkats that investigates
the relationships among social status, physiology (hormones, etc) and immune defense. The
manuscript purports to test, or at least provide support for, the immunocompetence handicap
hypothesis of Folstad and Karter (1992).
As I reiterate below, the writing is clear and enjoyable to read. The authors are clear in building
their argument in the introduction, they provide substantive explanation for various claims, etc.
So, as they will see my issue with the paper doesn’t have to do with problems of clarity, nor with
the general science. Instead, it’s about how this paper is framed.
I’ll follow my main set of substantive comments with more detailed, and less critical, comments.
But the first comment is, I think, important because it addresses the primary “perspective” of this
paper. I think this paper, especially because it deals with a unique social system, could be a good
contribution to our understanding of the interplay between sociality (hierarchies, interactions, the
stress that comes with it, etc), ecology and eco-immunology (including here, both stress and
immune defenses/parasitism). But I think the notion of framing this paper as having anything to
do, at all, with the Folstad and Karter paper, or the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis, is
misguided. My comments that follow are fairly critical, but as I’ll explain later I think the “fix” is
actually not onerous and will result in a much better paper. OK, so here we go…
Personally, I am not a fan of the Folstad and Karter paper but my problem with how this current
manuscript frames itself as a test of the ICHH doesn’t depend on my opinion of the F&K paper.
The original Folstad and Karter paper, and the ICHH they propose, is very explicitly a paper
about honest signaling, and the term “handicap” in that paper has a very specific meaning in the
context of signaling. The ICHH was proposed as a proximate (ie physiological) explanation for a
mechanism that could explain how the Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis (sexually selected signals as
indicators of parasite resistance) could work. And as such, it was also very much in the “family”
of Zahavi’s idea of costly signals as handicaps. In fact, the ICHH was supposed to be a paper
about sexual selection for “good genes”. Although Zahavi later expanded his handicap idea to
other kinds of signals, and so things like status signals, etc. could also be argued to serve as costly
signals, these ideas (including the F&K ICHH paper) are, still, papers about the evolution of
signals. And, again, “handicap” has a very particular meaning in this context. It is not, as this
current manuscript seems to suggest, just another way of saying that immunity trades off with
other important traits and hormones are the physiological “linchpin”. (These authors are far
from the first to make this mistake, of course.) Nowhere in this manuscript do the words “signal”
or “honest(y)” or “good genes” (or Zahavi, Hamilton-Zuk, etc) ever appear, nor is there really
any substantive focus on signaling of any type. A very large number of papers that have
purported to “test” the ICHH argue, mistakenly, that a prediction of the hypothesis is that
testosterone (or some other hormone) suppresses immunity but this is actually one of the
observations that motived the hypothesis in the first place. That idea (that T/hormones suppress
immunity) is a starting observation and assumption, not a prediction derived from the
hypothesis.
3
The problem, in my opinion, with the authors’ use of the word/concept of
“handicap” (as in “immunohandicap”, line 285) is that they’ve taken a term that (for better or
worse) has a very specific meaning and they’ve essentially switched the meaning to just mean
“trade off” in very general terms or perhaps “physiological mechanism underlying a trade off”.
In a sense, if we take the authors use of handicap virtually any trade off is a handicap; for
example, sharp canine teeth become an “herbivory handicap”.
This current manuscript really ought to be framed in the context of status/health interaction,
such as is done in the work the authors cite by Sapolsky and other similar kinds of studies. The
contrast with status/immunity/physiology in hyenas, compared to meerkats (and other systems)
is very interesting and these are the kinds of ideas the paper should be framed to discuss. It
could, I suppose, be “forced” into some kind of signaling frame work and then linked more
explicitly to the F&K ICHH paper, but I cannot see any good reason for doing so. In any case,
what is the signal being studied here? Even if the authors want to argue it is about signaling
status, “status” is not the signal itself. The ICHH is about signals such as bright color, elaborate
song, large antlers, etc which signal (ie provide information about) something else…good genes.
My recommendation would be that this paper be completely re-framed as one about sociality and
immunity and how those are linked via both ecology and physiology, and the entire ICHH be
dropped completely. I don’t actually think this would be terribly onerous because, as I said, I
don’t think the paper works well as an ICHH “test” anyway. Much (most?) of what the paper
needs for this alternative framework is already here, but could be expanded once all aspects of
the ICHH perspective are cut. For example, your primary hypothesis is already stated in lines
112 and 113. It is, essentially, “variation in immune function among individual meerkats is due
to resource-based trade offs caused by the demands of maintaining social status.” (You have said
this is part of your prediction, but in fact that is your hypothesis, and the part that follows, i.e.
“we would expect dominant individuals to be more immunosuppressed” is the prediction.) Your
other sub-hypotheses, such as those about the hormonal mechanisms, are also stated in later
sentences. None of this is really relevant to the ICHH in any important way, nor does it need to
be framed as such to be a worthwhile contribution.
Overall, I thought the paper was well-written in that it was thorough and things (methods,
analyses, etc) were explained well. The sentence flow well, there are few if any typographical
errors, etc. But, I did think the Discussion could be shortened quite a bit. The discussion is
currently 8 paragraphs, but I think 6 or maybe even 5 would suffice. Rather than trying to
address so many broad ideas, focus on those things most interesting and unique about the
meerkat system and how it relates to the questions at hand. To me, the most interesting things
this study can address concern (as I already said) how social interactions, dominance hierarchies,
etc. can affect health and, in particular, immunocompetence and what makes this system so
interesting in this realm is that it is cooperative and the sex roles are “non-traditional” compared
to many other mammalian systems. To the degree that they can, the authors could focus very
much of the discussion on how the meerkat system is different (or in other ways, similar) to other
mammalian systems where status/immunity/hormones (or some combination of two of these)
has been studied.
L100: I don’t know if “babysit” might be too colloquial for all readers, so perhaps consider
another phrase or at least define/explain what is meant by “babysit” in this context.
L112-113: This sentence contains both the hypothesis and the prediction.
L199: Is this (“continuous variable in mo”) a typo? Is it supposed to read “in the model”? If not,
can you please explain what it means?
4
L285: As I argue above, “handicap” has a very specific meaning and is not the same as “trade off”
or “reduced immunity”. I would simply avoid that term, and stick with trade off or something
like that, e.g. “Dominant individuals trade immune defense for status.”
L298: “it stands to reason that” can probably be replaced by “probably” and moved to right
before “derive”
L300-302: In addition to the points the authors mention in this paragraph about why parasite
loads may not always show intuitive patterns, there is the addition issue of “tolerance” as an
alternative to “resistance”. For example, if dominance is related to other aspects of good
condition (other than immunocompetence), these individuals may be better able to tolerate
higher parasite loads. In that sense, the “price” they pay for immunosuppression may not be as
high as one supposes. I don’t know the literature on tolerance well, but one could almost
certainly find some discussion of the differences between tolerance and resistance in a way that
might be relevant to this paper.
L322: I think in this sentence, “that” should be replaced with “which”, since you are not saying
that particular dominant females out reproduce subordinates, but that this is essentially always
the case.
L331-342: this contrast, and how ecology (feeding, etc) might play a role, is very interesting.
Obviously, this paper cannot really explain all of the variation among systems like this without a
lot of speculation, but still, these are the points that I think are worth discussing.

The study by Smyth and colleagues examined the effects of social status on innate immune
reposes in male and female meerkats (Suricata suricata), a cooperatively breeding species.

Specifically, two measures of innate immunity (hemolytic complement and natural antibodies)
were assessed in male and females of dominant and subordinate rank. The findings showed that
relative to subordinates, dominate animals had reduced serum bacterial killing and hemolytic
complement activities. Regardless of sex or social status, androstenedione levels were negatively
related to immunity, The authors discuss the data in the context of the Immunocompetence
Handicap Hypothesis (ICHH), and the data support the idea that elevated androgens come at the
cost of immunosuppression, but in this case, via androstenedione and not testosterone. In
general, the paper is interesting and addresses an important topic. The design of the study
appears straightforward and the results are clear and properly analyzed. The manuscript is also
generally well-written. There are several issues that the authors should considered in a revised
draft. These issues, along with specific comments, are itemized below.
Major Comments
I think this is an impatient, well implemented study that provided novel data showing an effect
of social dominance on multiple measures of immune function. The findings are especially
interesting in a cooperatively breeding species where 1) females and not males express the
highest levels of androgen and 2) the predominant form is androstenedione and not testosterone.
I particularly like that it tests the ICHH with respect to a hormone other than T; it is a common
misbelief that the hypothesis uniquely addresses T. As the authors suggest, the hypothesis is
framed to be tested using any hormone, not just T.
I think that the key setup is about testing the ICHH using a unique model system. As such,
leading off with discussion of SES in humans seems a bit awkward. I would save this for the
discussion.
While I agree that all the details of the hormone assays need not be repeated in this manuscript,
some additional details seem necessary, especially those that can ensure that one can acrrualtey
tease apart A4 for T (see comment below).
Minor Comments

Line 189. While not all of the details of the hormone assays need to be here given a reference to a
previous procedure, it would be good to state the cross-reactivity of the assay among the various
steroids, especially between A4 and T.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr John Dalton):
The paper has been well received by our reviewers but one states 'recommendation would be
that this paper be completely re-framed as one about sociality and immunity and how those
are linked via both ecology and physiology...etc. This is not necessarily the opinion of the
second reviewer and hence we would request that you address this comment specifically in
your response.
Indeed, the reviewers had diametrically opposed views about how to best frame our study,
so our revisions necessitated striking a compromise, but as R1 suspected, achieving that
balance was ‘not onerous.’ Notably, we could address R1’s concern about ‘framework’
primarily by slightly modifying our title (L1), a single sentence in the abstract (L23-26), and our
concluding sentence (L408-411). With those (and other) changes in place, it should be more
apparent that the manuscript was already framed in the broader context of sociality and eco-
immunology (as requested by R1), and not as a ‘test’ of the immunocompetence handicap
hypothesis (ICHH), per se (as perceived by R1). We also extended our mention of sexually
selected, costly signals of dominance, relevant to the ICHH (L23-26, 34-38, 90-93, 368-374)
and added references to support the existence of those signals [31, 33-38].
Although providing this clarification about framework meant that we could not
accommodate R2’s main request, namely to elaborate upon the ICHH in the first paragraph of
the introduction, we hope to have maintained R2’s support, while staying true to our own goals
of ultimately relating our findings to the ICHH literature. That literature is what led us to conduct
this study, what facilitated our success obtaining federal funding for this study, and what
contributed to this work earning consecutive prizes for excellence from SICB’s Division of
Ecoimmunology and Disease Ecology. In recognition of that important body of work, we
appropriately retain mention of the ICHH in our title, the modified last sentence of our abstract,
and the modified ending paragraphs of our discussion (L368-374, 408-411).
Additional responses and changes to address the more specific concerns are detailed
below. We hope the editors agree with this compromise and our various edits.

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript describes work conducted on a population of Kalahari meerkats that
investigates the relationships among social status, physiology (hormones, etc) and immune
defense. The manuscript purports to test, or at least provide support for, the
immunocompetence handicap hypothesis of Folstad and Karter (1992).
Given the correlative nature of our data (and the absence of any new data relating to
secondary sexual characteristics or signals), we indeed do not ‘test’ the ICHH and have
removed any language that could have been construed as suggesting that we had. Notably, in
the original abstract, we had mentioned that the meerkat would be an appropriate model for a
test of the ICHH. We have now significantly modified that one sentence (L23-26), both by
removing mention of the ICHH and by more explicitly identifying the meerkat as a unique study
subject, characterized by a well-advertised class system and extreme reproductive skew.
Additionally, as indicated in the original title, our results merely provide ‘support’ in
meerkats for the endocrine mechanism underlying the ICHH; however, to prevent any further
misconception about our study being a ‘test’ of the ICHH, we have modified/toned down the
title by changing ‘support for the ICHH’ to ‘implications for the ICHH’ (L1-2). The latter is, in
fact, a more accurate statement about our study’s contributions.
That said, we would like to draw attention to the fact that, outside of the title and that one
sentence in the abstract, we had not specifically mentioned the ICHH until the end of the
discussion section (on page 17 of a 19-page manuscript). This delayed focus is relevant
because it is incompatible with R1’s claim that we had framed our study as a test of the ICHH;
indeed, our ‘failure’ to frame our study as a test of the ICHH forms the basis for R2’s main
suggestion to do so, specifically by modifying the introduction.
As I reiterate below, the writing is clear and enjoyable to read. The authors are clear in building
their argument in the introduction, they provide substantive explanation for various claims, etc.
So, as they will see my issue with the paper doesn’t have to do with problems of clarity, nor
with the general science. Instead, it’s about how this paper is framed.
We are glad R1 had no concerns with our writing nor with our study.
I’ll follow my main set of substantive comments with more detailed, and less critical,
comments. But the first comment is, I think, important because it addresses the primary
“perspective” of this paper. I think this paper, especially because it deals with a unique social
system, could be a good contribution to our understanding of the interplay between sociality
(hierarchies, interactions, the stress that comes with it, etc), ecology and eco-immunology
(including here, both stress and immune defenses/parasitism).
We are also glad that R1 appreciates our perspective about the benefits of studying
meerkats.
For clarification, our study is about androgens and immunity – not stress and immunity.
Whereas the topic of stress and immunity is often framed with regard to sociality and ecology,
the topic of androgens and immunity is most often framed within the context of the ICHH (see
R2). Nevertheless, we had already framed our study more broadly.
But I think the notion of framing this paper as having anything to do, at all, with the Folstad
and Karter paper, or the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis, is misguided. My
comments that follow are fairly critical, but as I’ll explain later I think the “fix” is actually not
onerous and will result in a much better paper. OK, so here we go…
Although it was not onerous to modify the abstract to correct R1’s perception about our
framework, we disagree with the statement that our study, which shows a tradeoff between
androgens and immunity, has ‘nothing’ to do with the Folstad and Karter paper. It is, in fact, the
very mechanism invoked by F&K. Please see below for more on this issue.
Personally, I am not a fan of the Folstad and Karter paper but my problem with how this
current manuscript frames itself as a test of the ICHH doesn’t depend on my opinion of the
F&K paper. The original Folstad and Karter paper, and the ICHH they propose, is very
explicitly a paper about honest signaling, and the term “handicap” in that paper has a very
specific meaning in the context of signaling. The ICHH was proposed as a proximate (ie
physiological) explanation for a mechanism that could explain how the Hamilton-Zuk
hypothesis (sexually selected signals as indicators of parasite resistance) could work. And as
such, it was also very much in the “family” of Zahavi’s idea of costly signals as handicaps. In
fact, the ICHH was supposed to be a paper about sexual selection for “good genes”. Although
Zahavi later expanded his handicap idea to other kinds of signals, and so things like status
signals, etc. could also be argued to serve as costly signals, these ideas (including the F&K
ICHH paper) are, still, papers about the evolution of signals. And, again, “handicap” has a very
particular meaning in this context. It is not, as this current manuscript seems to suggest, just
another way of saying that immunity trades off with other important traits and hormones are the
physiological “linchpin”. (These authors are far from the first to make this mistake, of
course.) Nowhere in this manuscript do the words “signal” or “honest(y)” or “good genes” (or
Zahavi, Hamilton-Zuk, etc) ever appear, nor is there really any substantive focus on signaling
of any type. A very large number of papers that have purported to “test” the ICHH argue,
mistakenly, that a prediction of the hypothesis is that testosterone (or some other hormone)
suppresses immunity but this is actually one of the observations that motived the hypothesis in
the first place. That idea (that T/hormones suppress immunity) is a starting observation and
assumption, not a prediction derived from the hypothesis.
Regarding disapproval of F&K: We appreciate R1’s perspective, but without providing any
rationale for the disapproval of F&K, specifically (or even of Hamilton-Zuk or Zahavi, more
generally), concern about the F&K framework lacks teeth. To paraphrase loosely, the concern
(expressed here and later) reads as “R1 doesn’t like F&K, so the researchers shouldn’t cite
them.” A critique of the F&K framework would be better served by a well-reasoned review – an
issue that is well beyond the scope of our study – than by censorship.
Regarding honest signaling: R1 is correct in that we had not originally used the words
‘honest signaling,’ but we had mentioned ‘costly secondary sex characteristics’ at the end of
the discussion (when we specifically introduced the ICHH), as had F&K. Although we were not
specifically focused on meerkat signals in this phase of our work, that omission does not imply
that honest signaling doesn’t exist in female meerkats. Quite the contrary: dominant females
undergo a morphological, physiological, behavioral and presumably chemical change with the
acquisition of dominance. These observable, sexually selected traits honestly signal the
dominant female’s status (or quality) and accurately reflect her heavily skewed reproductive
success. That a physiological mechanism underlying this suite of characteristics might come at
some cost would not be surprising. To address this aspect of R1’s concern, we have now
added information about ornaments and signals of dominance in male and female meerkats,
notably in the two modified sentences of the abstract (L23-26, 34-38), in the introduction (L90-
93) and associated new references [31, 33-38], as well as been more explicit about the relation
between the endocrine mechanism of the ICHH and honest signals in the discussion (L368-
374).
Regarding the allegation that numerous researchers are ‘mistaken’: One can regard F&K’s
hypothesis as involving two parts, one dealing with honest signals and good genes, the other
dealing with the tradeoff between androgens and immunity. The relevant point is that for the
ICHH to be broadly applicable, minimally the tradeoff described by F&K should exist. It is true
that many researchers examine only one ‘key aspect’ of the hypothesis (as we now state on
L370). While such a focus might render a ‘test’ of the ICHH incomplete, it does not mean that
the researchers are fundamentally mistaken.
The problem, in my opinion, with the authors’ use of the word/concept of
“handicap” (as in “immunohandicap”, line 285) is that they’ve taken a term that (for better or
worse) has a very specific meaning and they’ve essentially switched the meaning to just mean
“trade off” in very general terms or perhaps “physiological mechanism underlying a trade
off”. In a sense, if we take the authors use of handicap virtually any trade off is a handicap; for
example, sharp canine teeth become an “herbivory handicap”.
This last statement is a gross mischaracterization. We do not use the word
‘immunohandicap’ to mean any trade-off, certainly not a universal pattern (such as sharp
canines), otherwise known as a ‘trait,’ that would characterize every member of the species.
Instead, we talked about an immunohandicap that affects only certain animals during a certain
period of their life, in this case the single pair of dominant animals per social group and not the
majority of subordinate animals. The term immunohandicap seems appropriate, but to satisfy
R1, we have changed it to ‘immunocompromise’ both times we had used it (L32, 302). We had
already used ‘trade-off’ the other eight times.
This current manuscript really ought to be framed in the context of status/health interaction,
such as is done in the work the authors cite by Sapolsky and other similar kinds of studies. The
contrast with status/immunity/physiology in hyenas, compared to meerkats (and other
systems) is very interesting and these are the kinds of ideas the paper should be framed to
discuss. It could, I suppose, be “forced” into some kind of signaling frame work and then
linked more explicitly to the F&K ICHH paper, but I cannot see any good reason for doing so.
In any case, what is the signal being studied here? Even if the authors want to argue it is
about signaling status, “status” is not the signal itself. The ICHH is about signals such as
bright color, elaborate song, large antlers, etc which signal (ie provide information about)
something else…good genes.
Firstly, our study is already framed in the context of status and immunity (see, for
example, our introductory paragraphs, L44-76).
Secondly, Sapolsky’s work is about status-related stress and immunity, not status-related
androgens and immunity. Given that we do not report on glucocorticoids in this study, it doesn’t
make sense to us to discuss the Sapolsky literature any more than we already have. The
hyena paper (by Flies and colleagues) is, to our knowledge, the only other study of immune
function in a free-ranging, female-dominant species. Therefore, there is unfortunately no
additional raw material on which to expand that kind of discussion.
Thirdly, as we noted above, discussing rank-related signals in meerkats wouldn’t be
‘forced’ at all. As mentioned above, we have modestly amended the manuscript and added
citations to note that connection. In this species, one could argue that status is the signal,
given that it covaries with age, weight, size/body proportions, and many aspects of behavior,
including aggression and scent marking, as well as scent composition and associated ‘badges’
(pictured in Leclaire et al 2014, new reference [35]).
My recommendation would be that this paper be completely re-framed as one about sociality
and immunity and how those are linked via both ecology and physiology, and the entire ICHH
be dropped completely. I don’t actually think this would be terribly onerous because, as I said,
I don’t think the paper works well as an ICHH “test” anyway. Much (most?) of what the paper
needs for this alternative framework is already here, but could be expanded once all aspects of
the ICHH perspective are cut. For example, your primary hypothesis is already stated in lines
112 and 113. It is, essentially, “variation in immune function among individual meerkats is due
to resource-based trade offs caused by the demands of maintaining social status.” (You have
said this is part of your prediction, but in fact that is your hypothesis, and the part that follows,
i.e. “we would expect dominant individuals to be more immunosuppressed” is the
prediction.) Your other sub-hypotheses, such as those about the hormonal mechanisms, are
also stated in later sentences. None of this is really relevant to the ICHH in any important way,
nor does it need to be framed as such to be a worthwhile contribution.
Regarding the framework: As we previously documented (see our first response above),
our paper is already framed as being about sociality and eco-immunology. That being the
case, the reframing suggested by R1 is unnecessary.
Regarding dropping the ICHH entirely: As we also previously argued, our findings do
relate to the ICHH, so a censorship of that literature would be inappropriate. The F&K paper,
alone, has almost 2,500 citations (by Google Scholar’s count). Were we to exclude all mention
of the ICHH, we would (a) appear to be ignorant of that well-cited and relevant literature,
including our own published work (e.g. Smyth et al 2016, citation [24]) and (b) risk having our
current study be overlooked by those working in that area. Given that we have two important
and relevant messages to contribute, both consequences would be unfortunate.
Regarding separating the hypothesis from the predictions: We have moved the
main/single hypothesis to the start of the prior paragraph, along with its associated main
prediction (L108-111). We do not, however, think the remaining aims (specific to meerkats)
rise to the level of hypotheses, so we have left those as ‘additional’ predictions (beginning on
L118).
Overall, I thought the paper was well-written in that it was thorough and things (methods,
analyses, etc) were explained well. The sentence flow well, there are few if any typographical
errors, etc. But, I did think the Discussion could be shortened quite a bit. The discussion is
currently 8 paragraphs, but I think 6 or maybe even 5 would suffice. Rather than trying to
address so many broad ideas, focus on those things most interesting and unique about the
meerkat system and how it relates to the questions at hand. To me, the most interesting
things this study can address concern (as I already said) how social interactions, dominance
hierarchies, etc. can affect health and, in particular, immunocompetence and what makes this
system so interesting in this realm is that it is cooperative and the sex roles are “non-
traditional” compared to many other mammalian systems. To the degree that they can, the
authors could focus very much of the discussion on how the meerkat system is different (or in
other ways, similar) to other mammalian systems where status/immunity/hormones (or some
combination of two of these) has been studied.
Ultimately, the suggestion to shorten the discussion is the same criticism as above, given
that the proposed paragraphs to be cut presumably ‘should be’ the ones about the ICHH. Also,
as we had noted above, there isn’t a hidden wealth of relevant field studies of eco-immunology
that we have failed to mention. We think the space allocated is appropriate to information
available and the messages being conveyed.
L100: I don’t know if “babysit” might be too colloquial for all readers, so perhaps consider
another phrase or at least define/explain what is meant by “babysit” in this context.
This word may seem colloquial, but it is traditionally used in the cooperation literature,
without definition (as its meaning is fairly intuitive). Nevertheless, we have added the word
‘guard’ (L104) and inserted the following citation of babysitting behavior to help clarify [42].
Clutton-Brock, T. H., Brotherton, P. N. M., O'Riain, M. J., Griffin, A. S., Gaynor, D., Sharpe, L.,
... & McIlrath, G. M. (2000). Individual contributions to babysitting in a cooperative
mongoose, Suricata suricatta. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological
Sciences, 267(1440), 301-305.
L112-113: This sentence contains both the hypothesis and the prediction.
Changed (as noted above).
L199: Is this (“continuous variable in mo”) a typo? Is it supposed to read “in the model”? If
not, can you please explain what it means?
‘Mo’ is the standard abbreviation for months (as a measure of age); however, for clarity,
we have now spelled it out. For consistency, we also changed the earlier weight abbreviation
of ‘g’ to ‘grams’ (L215).
L285: As I argue above, “handicap” has a very specific meaning and is not the same as “trade
off” or “reduced immunity”. I would simply avoid that term, and stick with trade off or
something like that, e.g. “Dominant individuals trade immune defense for status.”
Changed (as addressed above).
L298: “it stands to reason that” can probably be replaced by “probably” and moved to right
before “derive”
Done (L316).
L300-302: In addition to the points the authors mention in this paragraph about why parasite
loads may not always show intuitive patterns, there is the addition issue of “tolerance” as an
alternative to “resistance”. For example, if dominance is related to other aspects of good
condition (other than immunocompetence), these individuals may be better able to tolerate
higher parasite loads. In that sense, the “price” they pay for immunosuppression may not be
as high as one supposes. I don’t know the literature on tolerance well, but one could almost
certainly find some discussion of the differences between tolerance and resistance in a way
that might be relevant to this paper.
The ‘tradeoff’ between resistance and tolerance is indeed what this section was about. We
have inserted a sentence to make the existing comparisons between resistance and tolerance
more explicit (L318-320), and have also added the following two references to better flesh out
this issue [67,68]:
Blanchet, S., Rey, O., & Loot, G. (2010). Evidence for host variation in parasite tolerance in a
wild fish population. Evolutionary Ecology, 24(5), 1129-1139.
Råberg, L., Sim, D., & Read, A. F. (2007). Disentangling genetic variation for resistance and
tolerance to infectious diseases in animals. Science, 318(5851), 812-814.
L322: I think in this sentence, “that” should be replaced with “which”, since you are not saying
that particular dominant females out reproduce subordinates, but that this is essentially always
the case.
Done (L340].
L331-342: this contrast, and how ecology (feeding, etc) might play a role, is very
interesting. Obviously, this paper cannot really explain all of the variation among systems like
this without a lot of speculation, but still, these are the points that I think are worth discussing.
We are glad that R1 finds this section interesting. Given that the hyena study is, to our
knowledge, the only other study of immune function in a free-ranging, female-dominant
species, we unfortunately have little raw material on which to expand the discussion.

Comments to the Author(s)
The study by Smyth and colleagues examined the effects of social status on innate immune
reposes in male and female meerkats (Suricata suricata), a cooperatively breeding
species. Specifically, two measures of innate immunity (hemolytic complement and natural
antibodies) were assessed in male and females of dominant and subordinate rank. The
findings showed that relative to subordinates, dominate animals had reduced serum bacterial
killing and hemolytic complement activities. Regardless of sex or social status,
androstenedione levels were negatively related to immunity, The authors discuss the data in
the context of the Immunocompetence Handicap Hypothesis (ICHH), and the data support the
idea that elevated androgens come at the cost of immunosuppression, but in this case, via
androstenedione and not testosterone. In general, the paper is interesting and addresses an
important topic. The design of the study appears straightforward and the results are clear and
properly analyzed. The manuscript is also generally well-written. There are several issues that
the authors should considered in a revised draft. These issues, along with specific comments,
are itemized below.
Major Comments
I think this is an impatient, well implemented study that provided novel data showing an effect
of social dominance on multiple measures of immune function. The findings are especially
interesting in a cooperatively breeding species where 1) females and not males express the
highest levels of androgen and 2) the predominant form is androstenedione and not
testosterone. I particularly like that it tests the ICHH with respect to a hormone other than T; it
is a common misbelief that the hypothesis uniquely addresses T. As the authors suggest, the
hypothesis is framed to be tested using any hormone, not just T.
We thank R2 for this positive review.
I think that the key setup is about testing the ICHH using a unique model system. As such,
leading off with discussion of SES in humans seems a bit awkward. I would save this for the
discussion.
We agree that the traditional start to a study on T and immunity would immediately launch
into the ICHH; however, for the sake of reaching a compromise between the two reviewers’
conflicting recommendations, we propose the following: (1) leaving our introduction &
framework largely as is to satisfy R1 and (2) leaving mention of the ICHH to the end of the
abstract and discussion to satisfy R2 (and ourselves).
While I agree that all the details of the hormone assays need not be repeated in this
manuscript, some additional details seem necessary, especially those that can ensure that
one can acrrualtey tease apart A4 for T (see comment below).
We have added those details (L197-208).
Minor Comments
Line 136. There are pronounced seasonal influences on immune responses in
vertebrate. Can the author add the photoperiodic range during the time of sampling?
We did not collect data on photoperiodic range, but it would seem that the pronounced
influences of day length are experienced by species, such as Siberian hamsters, that
experience striking seasonal changes in day length. In our case, we collected samples from
Sept – March, and have added that this time frame spans from spring through summer (L141-
142), when photoperiod would not change all that much.
Line 189. While not all of the details of the hormone assays need to be here given a reference
to a previous procedure, it would be good to state the cross-reactivity of the assay among the
various steroids, especially between A4 and T.
Done, as addressed above.
Line. 246. Change weakest to lowest. Weakest suggests worse and to a later point your
make, immunity is a double edged sword so lower is not necessarily worse.
Done (L262. We also changed ‘weak’ to ‘low’ on L288 or ‘lower’ on L315.
Line 270. Was there a statistical basis for removing this outlier other than it changes the
findings?
This dominant female had exceptionally low HCA scores (e.g. 14.56 and 30.76), whereas
the mean (SE) for all dominant females was 178.76 (17.320). We have specified now that the
reason she was excluded is because she was an outlier (L284). Her T concentrations were
also exceptionally high (we have now specified that the only higher T concentrations owed to a
‘roving’ male, specifically (L288). Thus, there was a statistical basis (for both measures) for
removing her.
Line 382. 11-ketotestosterone is usually abbreviated 11-KT
Changed (however, the reference we cited, by Kurtz et al 2007, used 11kT).
