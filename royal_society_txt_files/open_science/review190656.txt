Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
This is a very interesting, well written and coherent article, that directly tackles an important gap
in the literature. It reports the results of a study investigating whether children can modulate
their voice parameters (namely, F0 and <U+0394>F) to modulate gender-related attributes when
impersonating same-sex child characters. The results suggest that, in fact, both girls and boys
lower F0 and <U+0394>F to masculinise their voices when impersonating stereotypically masculine child
characters, and (girls and older boys) raise them for stereotypically feminine same-sex child
characters. This is particularly interesting, as the authors mentioned, given the strong sexual
dimorphism of the human voice, and the little attention it has received as a marker of the
development of gender stereotypes.
The results are sensible, but the manuscript has a few problems (detailed below) that should be
addressed before publication. With some modification the manuscript would be appropriate for
publication.
General comments:
The main (but solvable) problem I find is related to the statistics. Given that this is a novel (and
somewhat exploratory) study, it is understandable that there is not a priori power (and sample
size) analysis. However, this creates a problem for the interpretation of statistical significance, as
the existence of an association cannot be inferred simply from p values. In other words, the study
may be, for example, underpowered to detect some moderate or weak associations between
predictors and outcome variables. In addition, there is no information of influential data points,
nor diagnostics of the adequacy model fit (i.e. residual distribution for ANCOVAs and
regressions, which I suggest could be included as supplemental material). I would also
recommend providing additional information to infer potential associations, like using bootstrap
techniques to identify confidence intervals (having CIs would help assessing associations even in
the absence of p values). In particular, bootstrapping regressions could really help in dealing with
all these issues (see e.g. Fox, 2016, Chapter 21).
In addition, there are few descriptive statistics reported, and I think these are important for
interpretation and to inform power calculations in future studies and potential replication
attempts. I recommend the authors to include a table of descriptives (e.g. n, mean, median, SD,
min, max) of F0 and <U+0394>F for the impersonations of the three characters, by participant sex and
age.
Also, according to the review system “It is a condition of publication that authors make their
supporting data, code and materials available”, but the link the authors provided to access the
data (http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/83066/) gives a “404 File not Found” error. Also, I did
not see any mention of code (or SPSS syntax, which from the figures I think the authors used) to
reproduce the analyses, but because these are clearly described in the manuscript, it is perhaps
desirable, but not too necessary in this particular case to include it (other supplementary files are
available with the submitted files).
Finally, perhaps due to some sort of problem or confusion with the submission system, or an
author oversight, there are no figure captions.

Specific comments:
Page 2, line 52. The citation should be “Perry, Ohde, & Ashmead, 2001”, instead of “Perry &
Ashmead, 2001”.
Page 3, lines 73-76. In the Participants section, the authors categorise the ages of the participant
children in years 1 to 6. I wonder why use Years 1-6, instead of age 6-10? I'd rather use the actual
age for the sake of simplicity. It is not clear (at least for me) why these categories are used and,
more importantly, why use 6 categories when there are only 5 years of age under study.
However, if there is a justification behind this decision, I would like to see it in the manuscript,
because it is not obvious to me (and probably some readers of the published paper).
Page 3, line 80. “Participants provided their own verbal consent”. Given that they were children,
very young in some cases, shouldn’t it be “assent” instead of “consent”? (see De Lourdes Levy,
Larcher, & Kurz, 2003).
Page 4, line 143. For consistency, I think the first results reported in “F0 (R<sup>2</sup> = .13,
F(1, 34) = 5.08, ß= - 0.36, p =.031, Figure 1a; boys: R<sup>2</sup> = .21, F(1, 34) = 8.89, ß = -.46,
p = .005, Figure 1b)” should start with “girls: ”.
Page 5, line 145. Figure 2a cited here, only illustrates the quadratic model, described below
without reference to the figure, but not the linear one reported here. Perhaps both the linear and
quadratic could be shown in this same figure panel?
Page 5, lines 153-154. This is not necessary, but I would personally like to see the significant age
and sex interaction here reported illustrated with a figure (or figure panel). Also, Figs 1 and 2
could perhaps be just one fig with 4 (or 5) panels, illustrating all results related to Age and sex
differences in the natural voice.
Page 5, lines 159-160. The authors report that the covariate (age) was men centred. This is the
correct desicion, but when the interaction is significant, I think the authors should centre to at
least low, high and central (age) values to explore the interaction between character type and age
(see Delaney & Maxwell, 1981; Schneider, Avivi-Reich, & Mozuraitis, 2015; Taylor, 2011; for an
example of this in an analogous design on voice research, see Leongómez, Mileva, Little, &
Roberts, 2017). I really do think this will help interpret the interaction, and how the model slopes
vary for kids of different ages. In addition, this technique will keep the n as the values are
estimated, and you would not lose statistical power.
Page 5, line 163. Did you adjust the alpha for multiple comparisons? An alternative, to limit Type
I error inflation, would be to instead use (simple) planned contrasts on the estimated values from
the covariate (centred to different values), using the neutral character responses as reference (i.e.
comparing responses to the feminine and masculine character vs the neutral). In SPSS, see
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/no/SSLVMB_24.0.0/spss/advanced/syn_gl
m_repeated_measures_contrasts_wsfactor.html
Page 6, line 192. Here I would suggest centring lo low, mid, and high age.
Page 6, lines 210-211. “(…) boys spoke with an overall 4.5% lower <U+0394>F in girls” should be “4.5%
lower <U+0394>F than girls”.

This is an interesting paper reporting a straightforward study that shows further evidence that
pre-pubertal children are aware of the stereotypes associated with voice pitch. My only
suggestion is to improve the figures. Violin plots would be a much better way to present the data

and the little attention it has received as a marker of the development of
gender stereotypes.
The results are sensible, but the manuscript has a few problems (detailed
below) that should be addressed before publication. With some modification
the manuscript would be appropriate for publication.
<b>General comments:</b>
The main (but solvable) problem I find is related to the statistics. Given that
this is a novel (and somewhat exploratory) study, it is understandable that
there is not a priori power (and sample size) analysis. However, this creates a
problem for the interpretation of statistical significance, as the existence of an
association cannot be inferred simply from p values. In other words, the study
may be, for example, underpowered to detect some moderate or weak
associations between predictors and outcome variables.
Although overall the results are in line with our hypotheses, we
acknowledge the reviewer’s point about the potential for underpowered
analyses to detect weak effects. The one association that may fall into
this is the finding that boys’ upward shifts in F0 in the feminine
condition did not reach significance compared to the gender-neutral
condition. As we explain in the discussion, boys of similar age to the
ones in the present study were found to be able to feminise their voices,
as previously reported (Cartei et al., 2014). Future studies with a bigger
sample size are required to investigate this further, and we have added a
statement to this effect in the discussion (lines 233-236):
Both sexes were also capable of raising F0 and <U+0394>F to feminise their voices for the
stereotypically feminine child characters, although boys’ upward shifts in these acoustic parameters did
not reach overall significance (a result that could be further investigated by replicating the study on a
larger sample).
In addition, there is no information of influential data points, nor diagnostics of
the adequacy model fit (i.e. residual distribution for ANCOVAs and
regressions, which I suggest could be included as supplemental material).
We have now added the residual plots (Figures S1 and S2) for the
ANCOVAs in the imitation task as supplementary material (lines 158-
159). These do not suggest any problems with the assumptions or
adequacy of the model.
I would also recommend providing additional information to infer potential
associations, like using bootstrap techniques to identify confidence intervals
(having CIs would help assessing associations even in the absence of p
values). In particular, bootstrapping regressions could really help in dealing
with all these issues (see e.g. Fox, 2016, Chapter 21).
We re-run all the regressions with bootstrapping (n=1000) and now we
report bootstrapping 95% CI in the text (lines 141-147, 220-222). None of
the CIs for the significant regressions include 0.
In addition, there are few descriptive statistics reported, and I think these are
important for interpretation and to inform power calculations in future studies
and potential replication attempts. I recommend the authors to include a table
of descriptives (e.g. n, mean, median, SD, min, max) of F0 and <U+0394>F for the
impersonations of the three characters, by participant sex and age.
We have decided to report the table of descriptives (Table S1), as
suggested by the reviewer, in the supplementary material (line 167).
Given that age was treated as a continuous variable in the statistical
analyses, we used participant year group for Table S1 to give an
indication of the age-related changes in the acoustic variables.
Also, according to the review system “It is a condition of publication that
authors make their supporting data, code and materials available”, but the link
the authors provided to access the data
(http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/83066/) gives a “404 File not Found” error.
Also, I did not see any mention of code (or SPSS syntax, which from the
figures I think the authors used) to reproduce the analyses, but because these
are clearly described in the manuscript, it is perhaps desirable, but not too
necessary in this particular case to include it (other supplementary files are
available with the submitted files).
We changed the link to:
https://sussex.figshare.com/s/285aef9e3bd234a5541c
The link will become live once the paper is published.
Finally, perhaps due to some sort of problem or confusion with the submission
system, or an author oversight, there are no figure captions.
These have now been uploaded.
<b>Specific comments:</b>
<b>Page 2, line 52</b>. The citation should be “Perry, Ohde, & Ashmead,
2001”, instead of “Perry & Ashmead, 2001”.
Corrected.
<b>Page 3, lines 73-76</b>. In the Participants section, the authors
categorise the ages of the participant children in years 1 to 6. I wonder why
use Years 1-6, instead of age 6-10? I'd rather use the actual age for the sake
of simplicity. It is not clear (at least for me) why these categories are used
and, more importantly, why use 6 categories when there are only 5 years of
age under study. However, if there is a justification behind this decision, I
would like to see it in the manuscript, because it is not obvious to me (and
probably some readers of the published paper).
We had reported the year groups to show that the children were roughly
equally distributed in terms of sex and age across the primary school
years. However, we agree with the reviewer that reporting year groups is
confusing, so we replaced them with the participants’ age range from 6
to 10, which is consistent with the fact that age was entered in the
analyses as a continuous covariate. We replaced the original text below
(line 74):
24 in UK Years 1&2 (10 girls, mean age=6.48; SE=.14; 14 boys, mean age = 7.0 SE =.11), 22 in
Years 3& 4 (12 girls, mean age= 8.6 SE=.13; 10 boys, mean age = 8.4 SE =.17), and 26 in Years 5&6
(14 girls, mean age= 9.97 SE=.14; 12 boys, mean age =9.7 SE =.12)
with:
A total of 72 children (36 girls), aged 6 to 10, took part in this study.
<b>Page 3, line 80</b>. “Participants provided their own verbal consent”.
Given that they were children, very young in some cases, shouldn’t it be
“assent” instead of “consent”? (see De Lourdes Levy, Larcher, & Kurz, 2003).
Corrected.
<b>Page 4, line 143</b>. For consistency, I think the first results reported in
“F0 (R<sup>2</sup> = .13, F(1, 34) = 5.08, ß= - 0.36, p =.031, Figure 1a;
boys: R<sup>2</sup> = .21, F(1, 34) = 8.89, ß = -.46, p = .005, Figure 1b)”
should start with “girls: ”.
Corrected.
<b>Page 5, line 145</b>. Figure 2a cited here, only illustrates the quadratic
model, described below without reference to the figure, but not the linear one
reported here. Perhaps both the linear and quadratic could be shown in this
same figure panel?
Both the linear and quadratic trends (and their R2 values) have now been
added to figure panel 1c.
<b>Page 5, lines 153-154</b>. This is not necessary, but I would personally
like to see the significant age and sex interaction here reported illustrated with
a figure (or figure panel).
We feel that the interaction is adequately represented by reporting the
<U+0394>F by age scatterplots for girls and boys as two adjacent figures (1c,
1d).
Also, Figs 1 and 2 could perhaps be just one fig with 4 (or 5) panels,
illustrating all results related to Age and sex differences in the natural voice.
These two figures have now been combined into one (Figure 1), and all
the other figures re-numbered accordingly.
<b>Page 5, lines 159-160</b>. The authors report that the covariate (age)
was mean centred. This is the correct decision, but when the interaction is
significant, I think the authors should centre to at least low, high and central
(age) values to explore the interaction between character type and age (see
Delaney & Maxwell, 1981; Schneider, Avivi-Reich, & Mozuraitis, 2015; Taylor,
2011; for an example of this in an analogous design on voice research, see
Leongómez, Mileva, Little, & Roberts, 2017). I really do think this will help
interpret the interaction, and how the model slopes vary for kids of different
ages. In addition, this technique will keep the n as the values are estimated,
and you would not lose statistical power.
Although we had presented participants’ age as three separate year
groups in the Participants section, age was treated as a continuous
variable in all the analyses. Therefore, we have now changed the
participants section to reflect this (line 73). In the stats we do not believe
that mean centering within groups would be relevant.
<b>Page 5, line 163</b>. Did you adjust the alpha for multiple comparisons?
An alternative, to limit Type I error inflation, would be to instead use (simple)
planned contrasts on the estimated values from the covariate (centred to
different values), using the neutral character responses as reference (i.e.
comparing responses to the feminine and masculine character vs the neutral).
In SPSS,
see https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/no/SSLVMB_24.0.0/spss/
advanced/syn_glm_repeated_measures_contrasts_wsfactor.html
The reported multiple comparisons are all Bonferroni corrected, and we
have now mentioned this explicitly in the paper (line 177).
<b>Page 6, line 192</b>. Here I would suggest centring lo low, mid, and high
age.
This procedure would be relevant for investigating the interaction effect
of age with character type on <U+0394>F in boys. However, as pointed out
earlier, although we originally reported participants’ age as year groups
in the Participants’ section, in all statistical analyses age is treated as a
continuous variable. Choosing three different cut-off ages for mean-
centering to low, mid and high would be somewhat artificial (e.g.
choosing Year 1&2, 3&4, 5&6). We preferred exploring this interaction by
running a simple regression to test whether the magnitude of
differences between feminine and gender-neutral characterisations and
masculine and gender-neutral characterisations changes with age. A
similar procedure was followed in Cartei and colleagues (2014).

Comments to the Author(s)
This is an interesting paper reporting a straightforward study that shows
further evidence that pre-pubertal children are aware of the stereotypes
associated with voice pitch. My only suggestion is to improve the figures.
Violin plots would be a much better way to present the data in the bar charts,
for example.
We created the violin plots, but we did not find that they improved the
readability of the results. Therefore, we added them as supplementary
material, Figure S3 (lines 178-9).
