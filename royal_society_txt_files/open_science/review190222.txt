Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
This is a revision of a previous submission.
Many of the comments for the previous review have been addressed, but not all.
This paper describes the radula of the land snail Cornu aspersum, and several different aspects of
the material and mechanical properties of the radula of this species as well as direct measures of
the forces applied by the radula when feeding.
The authors have added some information about the radula and work that has been done on the
form and function of the radula. But, the authors continue to call this a model system for looking
at the properties of the radula. It is not. First, heterobranchs (including the informal poly and
paraphyletic group pulmonates) have a very characteristic radular morphology, tooth size, etc.
that is not shared with the rest of gastropods, let alone the rest of the mollusca. It is extremely
different than most major taxa of gastropods. The heterobranchs are a derived group of
gastropods, and within the heterobranchs, terrestrial taxa tend to be derived. To date we do not
know if the mineralization and material properties of this species is shared with other
heterobranchs. So, it is a case study, and a good starting point for people to look at other species
in this group and then start comparing with other taxa. But, it is Not a model system for the
gastropod radula.
The inclusion of the table explaining which animals were used for each analysis really improves
the clarity of what exactly was done and some of the sample sizes referred to in the text.
However, multiple measures from the same individual are not independent. So in most cases,
the data as reported have extremely inflated sample sizes. The independent sample sizes are the
numbers of different individuals measured. Given that- it would be good to know how much
intraindividual variation there was for the different traits and metrics measured, and how that
contrasts with the interindividual measures. All data and graphs reported confound these two,
making it impossible to really understand what the data are. Given the small independent
sample sizes it may not be possible to do statistical analyses on the data. But, that is OK. There is
nothing wrong with making this a descriptive paper. We need such information before we can
start to compare among species and determine if there are real trends or differences among
species, among forms of the radula and among major groups of molluscs. But, we must have
clear information about how much of the variation is within versus between individuals.
EDAX was used to determine the mineral content of the radula, confirming older work (Sollas
1907) that Cornu aspersum has teeth that are mineralized with silica and calcium. It is not clear if
there was interindividual variation in mineralization as was found by Sollas. If not, fine. But,
this should be discussed. It would also be useful to compare the amount of silica found in these
teeth with other species of mollusc where mineralization has been quantified - particularly in the
Patellogastropoda, and if there are examples where it has not been found. For example, Mikovari
et al. (2015, J Shellfish Research) found that the keyhole limpet, Megathura crenulata, a
vetigastropod, does not have minerals in its radula. Many chitons have iron and calcium, but not
3
silica. Modern electronic databases now make it relatively easy to search much of the literature to
find this information. It would really help put this work in a bigger context.
The video clips in the supplementary information are very helpful. However, some the
description of radular movement cannot be seen in these clips. And, I do not see the difference in
how far the radula is extended from the mouth when food is available and when it is not.
Similarly interactions between the radula and the jaw cannot be seen, but are inferred.
Quantifying distances or areas might be more convincing. But, inferences are just that. Not facts.
I was hoping that the writing would be more idiomatic with the revision, but not so. So I am
including some suggested edits to help with this as well as for clarity.
This is not comprehensive, but should help the authors see what is needed.

of information are valuable. So reporting both is useful. It just cannot be misleading! Similarly,
all graphs need to be changed so that they reflect real sample sizes and real variance.

rage of examples could be given.
Lines 327-335 - Most work on mineral content of the radula has been studied in the Class
Polyplacophora and in the Class Gastropoda Patellogastropoda because they are known to
mineralize their radula. It is incorrect to assume that they all eat harder food than Cornu. That is
clearly not the case. Some do, some do not. I would be surprised if most chitons feed on
mineralized algae - certainly the majority of species that I know do not. Many eat fleshy algae
and microalgae, even though their teeth are mineralized. The same is true for true limpets. In
addition, many terrestrial plants have silica in their cell walls as a defense against herbivores, or
are heavily lignified. It is unclear what the natural range of food is for Cornu. And it is unclear
of relatives of Cornu also mineralize their teeth. This paragraph is thus misleading and not based
on the full range of information known for any of these taxa.
Line 343 - This new method to measure the forces produced by the radula…”
Lines 348-351 - radular replacement rates have been measured for a wide range of species, both
that mineralize their radula and those that do not. Comparing Cornu to chitons is like comparing
apples and oranges. Better comparisons would be with other gastropods, both those that
mineralize their teeth and those that do not. BUT, because there are No Data for Cornu all of this
is pure speculation not based on fact. One would expect the rate of replacement to reflect the
dynamic balance between the amount of time it takes to make a row of teeth and how fast the
teeth wear down when feeding. This has been published. If the authors have information that
suggests how fast the teeth would wear and become less useable, then they could estimate a
likely production rate to match that. But, it is all speculation, and comparisions with chitons
makes no sense.
All data figures need to be corrected to reflect real sample sizes and range of data separating
within individual variation from between individual variation.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Jake Socha):
To fill you in on the process, I determined that the transferred revision needed to be seen by one
of the previous reviewers (from the JRSI review). The reviewer has an overall positive impression
of the manuscript, deeming the data and study interesting and providing a useful
characterization for the field. However, there are still a number of issues that need to be
addressed if we are to accept the manuscript for publication. The major items concern the
statistical treatment of individuals and the framing of the study as a model system.

This ms is now much improved in terms of the clarity, particularly regarding sample sizes, and
repeated measures on the same animals.
There are a few places that still require more clarity. I have also made comments where the text
could be improved.
Line 45 - not clear what is being stated. This sentence needs rewording
Line48-49 pierced by abrasion

mineralized.
Line 92 - needs to be rewritten, is confusing
Line 99-100 - needs to be rewritten - not grammatically correct
Line 101 - radular teeth note, radula = singular, radulae - plural, radular = adj.
Line 107 - replace "pulmonates" with heterobranchs

Line 332 delete text after carrots. It is not known if these animals must get new silica from their
diet, if they have stores, or if they can recycle it from shed teeth. So, you do not know. All that is
known is that they were fed carrots and lettuce and cuttle bones.
Lines 352 - 358 - Radula production/replacement rates have been measured on a wide range of
species, including many species without mineralize teeth. Papers in this ms are in the references
that give these rates. Isarankura and Runham 1968 - a number of species
Runham and Isarankura also give a rate for _Helix_ - Malacologia Volume:5 Issue:1

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This is a revision of a previous submission.
Many of the comments for the previous review have been addressed, but not all.
This paper describes the radula of the land snail <i>Cornu aspersum</i>, and several different
aspects of the material and mechanical properties of the radula of this species as well as direct
measures of the forces applied by the radula when feeding.
The authors have added some information about the radula and work that has been done on the
orm and function of the radula. But, the authors continue to call this a model system for looking
at the properties of the radula. It is not. First, heterobranchs (including the informal poly and
paraphyletic group pulmonates) have a very characteristic radular morphology, tooth size, etc.
hat is not shared with the rest of gastropods, let alone the rest of the mollusca. It is extremely
different than most major taxa of gastropods. The heterobranchs are a derived group of
gastropods, and within the heterobranchs, terrestrial taxa tend to be derived. To date we do not
know if the mineralization and material properties of this species is shared with other
heterobranchs. So, it is a case study, and a good starting point for people to look at other species
n this group and then start comparing with other taxa. But, it is Not a model system for the
gastropod radula.
We are aware of the characteristic radular morphology of heterobranchs. We removed the term
“model” and instead state that this is a case study (line 131).
The inclusion of the table explaining which animals were used for each analysis really improves
he clarity of what exactly was done and some of the sample sizes referred to in the text.
However, multiple measures from the same individual are not independent. So in most cases,
he data as reported have extremely inflated sample sizes. The independent sample sizes are the
numbers of different individuals measured. Given that- it would be good to know how much
ntraindividual variation there was for the different traits and metrics measured, and how that
contrasts with the interindividual measures. All data and graphs reported confound these two,
making it impossible to really understand what the data are. Given the small independent
sample sizes it may not be possible to do statistical analyses on the data. But, that is OK. There
s nothing wrong with making this a descriptive paper. We need such information before we
can start to compare among species and determine if there are real trends or differences among
species, among forms of the radula and among major groups of molluscs. But, we must have
clear information about how much of the variation is within versus between individuals.
13 individual snails were measured (please see Tab. 1). We conducted 83 single experiments,
and several measurements of the same individual were not independent. In Fig. 2 we depict one
epresentative force measurement in one experiment, In Fig. 3 we show the summarized forces
n each direction of all experiments. We added another Figure, No. 4, with all forces for each
direction for each snail. The exerted forces vary greatly in each snail. Thus, we decided to
discuss the general trend between the different feeding motions and the maximum forces (max.
orces are also depicted in Supplementary Fig. 1). Sample sizes are added to the description of
Fig. 3. In line 307-312 we state that we cannot do correlation.
EDAX was used to determine the mineral content of the radula, confirming older work (Sollas
1907) that <i>Cornu aspersum</i> has teeth that are mineralized with silica and calcium. It is
not clear if there was interindividual variation in mineralization as was found by Sollas. If not,
ine. But, this should be discussed.
We are thankful for this comment, we think that due to our experimental environment, no Si
was eaten by our specimens, this is now discussed.
t would also be useful to compare the amount of silica found in these teeth with other species
of mollusc where mineralization has been quantified - particularly in the Patellogastropoda, and
f there are examples where it has not been found. For example, Mikovari et al. (2015, J
Shellfish Research) found that the keyhole limpet, Megathura crenulata, a vetigastropod, does
not have minerals in its radula. Many chitons have iron and calcium, but not silica. Modern
electronic databases now make it relatively easy to search much of the literature to find this
nformation. It would really help put this work in a bigger context.
We agree with the reviewer and are thankful for this comment. We compared the amounts of
Si and Ca and would, since the amounts are very small, rather call the radular teeth of our
specimens “marginally mineralized”. We included that into our discussion.
The video clips in the supplementary information are very helpful. However, some the
description of radular movement cannot be seen in these clips. And, I do not see the difference
n how far the radula is extended from the mouth when food is available and when it is not.
Similarly interactions between the radula and the jaw cannot be seen, but are inferred.
Quantifying distances or areas might be more convincing. But, inferences are just that. Not
acts.
The different motion patterns of the radula cannot be seen by just looking from one angle, so
all patterns can never been seen within one video sequence (the figures in the manuscript show
he idealized motion patterns based on the studies of multiple sequences). Interactions between
adula and jaw was only detected when the specimens grasped the glass capillary (this cannot
be seen in the videos due to the experimental setup) or while feeding lettuce. In the
Supplementary movie S1 (3:35-4:06 min) the movement without food can be seen and it looks
ike the edges are slightly folded up. We tried to clarify this in line 242-252.
was hoping that the writing would be more idiomatic with the revision, but not so. So I am
ncluding some suggested edits to help with this as well as for clarity.
This is not comprehensive, but should help the authors see what is needed.
Specific Comments:
Line 37 - rephrase - species of Mollusca
Changed accordingly.
Line 38 - delete adapted to ingesta - replace with primarily used for feeding
We left the previous version. Ingesta means: food and everything that is taken in while feeding
food, substrate and dirt). So we cannot exchange the word. It is also important for us to
highlight, that adaptations on the teeth to the feedings substrate or food had been recognized in
previous studies.
Line 40 - properties of the radular teeth of Cornu aspersum
Changed accordingly.
Line 41 - Delete model species
Changed accordingly.
Line 46 - elasticity in this species
Changed accordingly.
Line 47 - replace ingesta with feeding
We left the previous version. Please see above.
Line 50 - replace ingesta with feeding and end the sentence there
We left the previous version. Please see above.
Line 51 – Delete
We left the previous version. In our following manuscripts we plan to consider adaptations of
adulae to the feeding substrate in the framework of gastropod evolution. So, for us, this point
s of high importance.
Line 54 - recent species in the Class Gastropoda
Changed accordingly.
Line 55 - Taylor and Lewis is a popular book intended for the general public. Please use a
scientific reference from the primary literature - there are many to choose from.
Line 60 - Brusca and Brusca is a text book that translates information for students. Use primary
eferences. There are a lot to choose from.
Changed accordingly.
Line 78 - replace does not only comprise to not only includes
Changed accordingly.
Line 81 - chitinous and sometimes mineralized teeth. Radular teeth
Radula teeth and radular teeth are equally used in the literature
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847715300769,
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0047720672900180).
Line 84 - radulae have been categorized by the number, type and arrangement of teeth
Changed accordingly.
Line 93 - To date, the vast majority
Changed accordingly.
Line 95 - iron based biominerals and silica
Changed accordingly.
Line 103 – understudied
Changed accordingly.
Lines 107 - 114 - this is taxon specific and must be rewritten. Many if not most taxa do not feed
n this way
We clarified in the text, Mackenstedt and Märkel (2001) described the movement of some
errestrial “pulmonata”, but unfortunately without naming the species.
Line 118 - Feeding can include grasing on soft substrates, collecting microalgae,
Changed accordingly.
Line 121 - to the radula may be used (Markel, 1957). For example,
Changed accordingly.
Line 131 - We used the Mediterranean land snail....., previously known
Changed accordingly.
Line 134 - delete as a model species === it is not a model species. You cannot generalize from
his species to most gastropods let alone most molluscs, and, at present, we do not know if other
heterobranchs are similar or not.
Changed accordingly.
Line 186 - write out 13 -“thirteen”.
Changed accordingly.
Lines 206-207 - performed using a non-parametric Spearman test…
As an aside - because only a single snail could be evaluated - strong inference cannot be drawn
Changed accordingly. This is something we know and states in line 311-312.
Lines 208-210 - are correlations from a parametric Pearson correlation test? Please clarify
Changed accordingly.
Line 230 - replace 10 with Ten
Changed accordingly.
Line 238 - delete large
Changed accordingly.
Line 239 - of the whole area............ This area has a maximum of approximately 3300 teeth in
contact with a substrate when feeding.
Changed accordingly.
Lines 235 - 243 - sample sizes are needed, and it must be clear when numbers come from
multiple measures of the same animal and from averages of multiple animals.
Sample sizes are given in the materials & methods section and in Tab. 1.
Line 245 - replace glass with clear
Changed accordingly.
Line 251 - delete we were have seen that
Changed accordingly.
Line 252 - delete just
Changed accordingly.
Lines 255 - 274 - the sample sizes are extremely inflated. Independent samples are different
snails, not different observations within a snail. So, ranges within snails can be given. Snail
means would be needed to make statements about means for the species. But, both of these
ypes of information are valuable. So reporting both is useful. It just cannot be misleading!
Similarly, all graphs need to be changed so that they reflect real sample sizes and real variance.
13 individual snails were measured (please see Tab. 1) with 83 single experiments. The exerted
orces vary greatly in each snail and even within a single experiment (now, we included a new
Figure 4 to show all measured forces for each snail in each direction). So, we decided to discuss
he maximum forces and the general trend between the different feeding motions. Sample sizes
are added to the description of Fig. 3.
Line 287 - replace experiment with study
Changed accordingly.
Lines 291-295 - The comparison with the cockroach seems out of place. It would be expected
hat the mandibles of a cockroach would produce greater force than a snail radula - it is Much
arger. It does not seem to add to the discussion, unless other feeding forces have been measured
and a rage of examples could be given.
This is true, the comparison with the cockroach was removed.
Lines 327-335 - Most work on mineral content of the radula has been studied in the Class
Polyplacophora and in the Class Gastropoda Patellogastropoda because they are known to
mineralize their radula. It is incorrect to assume that they all eat harder food than Cornu. That
s clearly not the case. Some do, some do not. I would be surprised if most chitons feed on
mineralized algae - certainly the majority of species that I know do not. Many eat fleshy algae
and microalgae, even though their teeth are mineralized. The same is true for true limpets. In
addition, many terrestrial plants have silica in their cell walls as a defense against herbivores,
or are heavily lignified. It is unclear what the natural range of food is for Cornu. And it is
unclear of relatives of Cornu also mineralize their teeth. This paragraph is thus misleading and
not based on the full range of information known for any of these taxa.
For some Polyplacophora and Patellogastropoda we find in literature that they feed on solid
substrates or on hardened algae (Weaver et al., 2010; Lu and Barber, 2012; Grunenfelder et al.,
2014; Barber et al., 2015; Ukmar-Godec, 2017). We truly do not know the food range of Cornu
but they usually do not loosen food from a solid surface.
Line 343 - This new method to measure the forces produced by the radula…”
Changed accordingly.
Lines 348-351 - radular replacement rates have been measured for a wide range of species, both
hat mineralize their radula and those that do not. Comparing Cornu to chitons is like comparing
apples and oranges. Better comparisons would be with other gastropods, both those that
mineralize their teeth and those that do not. BUT, because there are No Data for Cornu all of
his is pure speculation not based on fact. One would expect the rate of replacement to reflect
he dynamic balance between the amounts of time it takes to make a row of teeth and how fast
he teeth wear down when feeding. This has been published. If the authors have information
hat suggests how fast the teeth would wear and become less useable, then they could estimate
a likely production rate to match that. But, it is all speculation, and comparisons with chitons
makes no sense.
Here we hypothesize how Cornu can loosen cuttlebone, even though this is harder than the
eeth. From a physician point of view this can be explained with high abrasion. So in this context
we would expect Cornu to replace teeth faster, but – since we do not have data – these are
hypothesizes and we state this in the discussion. We compare Cornu with Polyplacophora and
Patellogastropoda, because hardness and elasticity were previously studied in their radular teeth
Weaver et al., 2010; Lu and Barber, 2012; Grunenfelder et al., 2014; Barber et al., 2015;
Ukmar-Godec, 2017) and there is no data for Heterobranchia so far.
All data figures need to be corrected to reflect real sample sizes and range of data separating
within individual variation from between individual variation.
Changed accordingly.

Line 320 Class Polyplacophora as well as gastropods in the Patellogastropoda
t’s important for us to clarify the systematic position of the Polyplacophora and
Patellogastropoda with all the citing literature and to compare this with Cornu. We want to
show, that the vast majority of gastropods have not been analysed with nanoindentation and
were hence not able to compare our species with more closely related taxa. This is the reason
why we left it as previous.
