This article deals with molecular adsorption into various defects of (5,5) carbon nanotubes by a
tight-binding density functional theory method (DFTB-D). The method and the derived results
are timely important to the community. The significance is the ration of the unexpectedly high
energy of adsorption of the NH3 molecule found in experimental studies. The results are also
interesting because they are a good testing of applicability of DFTB-D approach in the considered
tasks. The paper meets the journal requirements and merits publication. However, this referee
has queries for consideration:
I am curious if the au7htors have found difference and any comments on:
discrimination of the electron lone pairs (H2O and NH3) from protons (CH4) interacting with the
C dangling bond electrons on the local density of states.
2. Proton interaction with the unpaired electrons of the defect sites

The manuscript discusses the calculation of binding energies of some small molecules to SWCNT
surfaces and surface defects within the DFTB method including empirical London dispersion

forces. The manuscript is well written, interesting and can be published with minor
modifications.
Specifically, the authors mention that research efforts into the physical adsorption of small
molecules such as CH4, H2O and NH3 on defective nanotubes are seldomly reported. However,
the authors might want to comment on a comparison of their study with experimental work by
Ulbricht et al. (Carbon 44 (2006) 2931-2942) which reports on experimental determinations of
binding energies of all of these molecules and several more on pristine sp2 hybridized graphite
(as reference material) as well as on the thermal desorption of these molecules from nanotube
samples which presumably also includes defects.
In addition, the authors should comment on how their calculations compare with existing
experimental adsorption data for small molecule adsorption on graphite which may be used as
benchmark for testing the utility of the London corrections.

Response to Reviewer’ comments on manuscript
label_version_2
RSOS-190727
We are very grateful to the Reviewers for their constructive comments which have
been used to improve our manuscript. Listed below are the changes made and
responses to the Reviewers’ comments.
The major modifications:
1. Line 12 of page 3, added “It should be notice that, for all the adsorbates, it is the
proton instead of the heavy atom (N or O) that is pointing to the CNTs. This is
because that their electrons are sp3 hybridized, indicating that electron lone pairs
exist in the “proton-free” directions. Such electron-negative lone pair would
repulse either with the lone pairs of the dangling C or the p electrons, causing
instability of the system, contrary to the electron-relative protons.”
2. Line 60 of page 4: added “To verify the differences of this phenomenon, further
electronic density and the local density of state (LDOS) analyses are carried out.
It turns out that not only the electron density of the H2O adsorption in the
intermolecular area are obvious larger than those NH3 and CH4, but its LDOS
also presents delocalization of the orbitals through the region. This could be
concluded that the interaction feature of this system is not simply van de Waals
intermolecular interaction. (detailed information is included in SI)”
3. Line 7 of page 5: added “Actually, the activation energy of desorption and the
binding energies for small molecules adsorbed on carbon based materials has
been systematically observed in the previous experimental researches48 The
binding energy of CH4 with SWCNT is of similar magnitude to that of the
physical adsorption cases above. This could also prove the reliability of our
results.”
4. Added the reference [Ulbricht H., et al. Carbon 2006, 44, 2931-2942.] as Ref.48.
5. In supporting information, we added a new part as:
Part 9. Electronic-based analysis of H2O, NH3 and CH4 adsorbed on the type “a” defected
CNT.
Fig. S12 The line electronic density of the H2O, NH3 and CH4 adsorbed on the
type “a” CNT. The horizontal axis “relative intermolecular distances” means the
geometrical position between the proton of adsorbates and the dangling C atom
on the CNT. Due to the fact that the distances between the proton and dangling
C atom are different, we normalized the distances into the same scales for
comparison.
Fig. S13 The LDOS of the H2O, NH3 and CH4 adsorbed on the type “a” CNT. The
horizontal axis is the energy scale of the orbitals, and the vertical axis means the
positions from the dangling carbon to the proton. The dangling carbon locates
on the origin.
6. In supporting information, we added Part 10 and Part11 providing the stable
structure data for “a” “b” “c” “d” defective and perfect nanotubes adsorbed with
small molecules calculated with DFTB-D in the manuscript.
For clarity, we have highlighted all the changes in blue in the main text and
supporting information.

Recommendation: The paper meets the journal requirements and merit publication.
This article deals with molecular adsorption into various defects of (5,5) carbon
nanotubes by a tight-binding density functional theory method (DFTB-D). The
method and the derived results are timely important to the community. The
significance is the ration of the unexpectedly high energy of adsorption of the NH3
molecule found in experimental studies. The results are also interesting because they
are a good testing of applicability of DFTB-D approach in the considered tasks. The
paper meets the journal requirements and merit publication. However, this referee has
queries for consideration
[Comment] I am curious if the authors have found difference and any comments on
discrimination of the electron lone pairs (H2O and NH3) from protons (CH4)
interacting with the C dangling bond electrons on the local density of states.
2. Proton interaction with the unpaired electrons of the defect sites.
[Response] Thanks for the constructive comment. However, although the previous
geometry optimization with different initial structures has been adopted, only those
results with O-H or N-H pointing to the dangling carbon atom on the CNT could be
obtained. The lone pairs of the O and N atom would repulse with that of the carbon
atom, indicating that such structures would not stably exist.
For exploring the cases of proton interacting with defect sites, we take those with
type “a” CNT as example, which contain relative stronger adsorption of H2O. Both
electronic density and the local density of state analyses are carried out. As shown in
Fig. R1, the electronic densities on the line of the proton on small molecules and the
dangling carbon atom on CNT. The result shows that the electronic density of H2O is
obvious larger than those of NH3 and CH4, and meanwhile the density of NH3 is
slightly larger than that of the CH4 in the intermolecular area. The extra-large density
for H2O cases corresponds to the result of the charge transfer in Fig. 4 in the main text,
indicating a relatively stronger interaction. Similar conclusions could be drawn from
the results of local density of states. In Fig. R2, the densities of H2O system orbitals
present a more delocalized feature, especially the orbital around -4 eV, whose density
cuts through the intermolecular area. Meanwhile, for the NH3 and CH4 cases, the
densities of the orbitals are rather localized at each side, corresponding to the
conclusion above.
Fig. R1 The line electronic density of the H2O, NH3 and CH4 adsorbed on the type
“a” CNT. The horizontal axis “relative intermolecular distances” means the
geometrical position between the proton of adsorbates and the dangling C atom on the
CNT. Due to the fact that the distances between the proton and dangling C atom are
different, we normalized the distances into the same scales for comparison.
Fig. R2 The LDOS of the H2O (a), NH3 (b) and CH4 (c) adsorbed on the type “a” CNT.
The horizontal axis is the energy scale of the orbitals, and the vertical axis means the
positions from the dangling carbon to the proton. The dangling carbon locates on the
origin.
For better illustrate these point, following discussions are added into the main
text and the supporting information as: It should be notice that, for all the adsorbates,
it is the proton instead of the heavy atom (N or O) that is pointing to the CNTs. This is
because that their electrons are sp3 hybridized, indicating that electron lone pairs exist
in the “proton-free” directions. Such electron-negative lone pair would repulse either
with the lone pairs of the dangling C or the p electrons, causing instability of the
system, contrary to the electron-relative protons.” in page 3;
“To verify the differences of this phenomenon, further electronic density and the
local density of state (LDOS) analyses are carried out. It turns out that not only the
electron density of the H2O adsorption in the intermolecular area are obvious larger
than those NH3 and CH4, but its LDOS also presents delocalization of the orbitals
through the region. This could be concluded that the interaction feature of this system
is not simply van de Waals intermolecular interaction.” in page 4.

[Comment1]
Specifically, the authors mention that research efforts into the physical adsorption of
small molecules such as CH4, H2O and NH3 on defective nanotubes are seldomly
reported. However, the authors might want to comment on a comparison of their
study with experimental work by Ulbricht et al. (Carbon 44 (2006) 2931-2942) which
reports on experimental determinations of binding energies of all of these molecules
and several more on pristine sp2 hybridized graphite (as reference material) as well as
on the thermal desorption of these molecules from nanotube samples which
presumably also includes defects.
[Response] Thank you for the comments and suggestions.
We have made the comparison of the experimental work done by the Ulbricht et
al. [Carbon 44 (2006) 2931-2942] which reported the interaction of 23 gases and
solvents with the basal plane highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) with
single-wall carbon nanotube samples studied using thermal desorption spectroscopy.
This article is necessary for the experimental support of our results, especially for the
physical adsorption discussions. The binding energy observed in the experiment is of
similar magnitude to those of our calculated results. Relative discussions are added in
page 5 as:
“Actually, the activation energy of desorption and the binding energies for small
molecules adsorbed on carbon-based materials has been systematically observed in
the previous experimental researches. [ref.48] The binding energy of small molecules
with SWCNT is of similar magnitude to that of the physical adsorption cases above.
This could also prove the reliability of our results.”
[Comment2] In addition, the authors should comment on how their calculations
compare with existing experimental adsorption data for small molecule adsorption on
graphite which may be used as benchmark for testing the utility of the London
corrections.
[Response] Thank you for the comments and suggestions.
As described in the experimental work by Ulbricht et al. [Carbon 44 (2006)
2931-2942]. The interaction of the small molecules with graphitic surfaces is
commonly thought to be prototypical of physical interactions. The binding energies of
the CH4, NH3, and H2O with the graphitic surface are 17KJ/mol, 25KJ/mol, and
46kJ/mol respectively which can be get in Fig.7 and Fig.8 The experiment data are
similar with 100meV around for CH4 and NH3, 321meV for H2O in the manuscript
for physical adsorption. The consistency between the experimental data with
manuscript can be used as benchmark for testing the utility of the London corrections.
Special thanks for these reviewers’ comments and suggestions.
