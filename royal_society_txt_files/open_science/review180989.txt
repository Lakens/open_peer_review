The manuscript on aqueous CSD of epitaxial KNN thin films brings new results, but it opens
more questions than it provides answers.
1. Use and role of KCl/NaCl flux
Regarding the use of KCl/NaCl flux, it is written in Experimental part that a KCl/NaCl (25
mol%) was added to selected precursor solutions… Please explain with more detail how the
precursor solution with KCl/NaCl flux was prepared, and what the exact formulation was. If the
chlorides were added to the aqueous solution, they should be dissolved, consequently the excess
of alkalines would be increased. Chloride ions should also be present in the solution, residues
could remain in the film. Many scenarios are possibles without knowiung the exact proceudre.
Are there any results that support the formation and the role of the KCl/NaCl flux upon RTA as
proposed in the Discussion?
Equations 2 – 5 are possible, but they would require at least some confirmation. Could any
surface sensitive technique help to detect the carbonate groups? Was anything tried? The authors
wrote that these reactions were proposed in ref. 25, but they were not confirmed neither in the
mentioned reference, nor in the present manuscript.
Does the presence of flux influence the thickness of the films ? The thicknesses of E-films are not
reported; is there any relation between E and ES groups of the films?
The Results include the XRD patterns of both groups of films (E, ES), but the TEM study was
performed only on the ES films. Was there any difference between the two groups – thickness,
microstructure, epitaxy (if evident), porosity distribution, etc. Please comment.
2. Thermal expansion of KNN
Phase transitions of KNN Cubic – tetragonal – orthorhombic are manifested by changes in cell
parameters, and also in thermal expansion, similar as in other ferroelectrics. So, please clarify the
statement that thermal expansion of KNN is almost independent on temperature. The studied
KNN films exhibit local ferroelectric repsonse, so they should undergo a sequence of phase
transitons upon cooling.
3. Heterogeneous vs. Homogeneous nucleation
In the 2nd paragraph of Dicussion the authors provide explanation for the epitaxial growth of
KNN films. They relate the low pyrolysis temperature (400 oC) with the induced heterogeneous
nucleation. So, if the pyrolysis temperature was higher was this not the case? 400 oC is not an
exceptionally low tempersture for pyrolysis. Furthermote the reference they are referring to (24,
Schwartz and Schneller) discusses PZT and (Ba,Sr)TIO3 thin films prepared from organic
precursors, and low / high temperature in such materials may not be directly transferred to
water-based CSD of KNN films.
The authors further write that in (100) and (110) films there is a competition between hetero- and
homogeneous nucleation. Is then the growth of the nucleated phase a problem? Is there any
difference in thicknesses of epi- and polycrystalline parts of respective films if the annealing
conditions are changed?
4. Secondary K2Nb4O11 (2,4-) phase
The authors write that the 2,4 –phase could only be seen by GIXRD. Does this mean that e.g. log
scale or extended step time of conventional XRD patterns revealed nothing? The GIXRD patterns
of individual samples still differ quite a lot.
3
The secondary 2,4-phase is discussed in Discussion, 3rd paragraph. It is written that the mass loss
was significant and that direct evaporation of alkalis can not explain such mass loss. Until this
paragraph mass loss has not been even mentioned. Please explain, what this mass loss means and
how it has been determined (if at all – it is a challenging task to do it in a film). How is it
confirmed that ' direct evaporation of K and Na from KNN … can not explain the mass loss
observed from these films.' Please explain and provide evidence.
The majority of alkali polyniobate phases is humidity sensitive. Was there any sign of humidity
sensitivty in the studied films? For example was there any difference in dielectric properties if
they were measured in vacuum or in air (this referes also to the comment no. 5)?
Was the 2,4 phase detected in any of the samples by SEM/TEM? A comment on detection of this
phase is defintely missing.
5. PFM, dielectric properties
PFM results are shown for both E and ES groups revealing that all films show local ferroelectric
response. However, macroscopic measurements are reported only for two of the ES films, so one
could assume that all other films were too leaky. Very high losses at low frequney could be
presumably related to interaction of the films with humidity.
Are different permittivities of KNN (100) and (110) films related to orientational dependence?
Based on the results of dielectric measurements it is difficult to accept the last phrase of the
Abstract, namely that 'The films demonstrated relatively high permittivty with low loss. This
phrase is much too general and even misleading, it should be modified to reflect the results more
precisely.

The formula of KNN in Summary, 2nd line, should be written as in the rest of the manuscript:
K0.5Na0.5NbO3.

The manuscript on aqueous CSD of epitaxial KNN thin films brings new
results, but it opens more questions than it provides answers.
1. Use and role of KCl/NaCl flux
Regarding the use of KCl/NaCl flux, it is written in Experimental part that a
KCl/NaCl (25 mol%) was added to selected precursor solutions… Please
explain with more detail how the precursor solution with KCl/NaCl flux was
prepared, and what the exact formulation was. If the chlorides were added to
the aqueous solution, they should be dissolved, consequently the excess of
alkalines would be increased. Chloride ions should also be present in the

without knowiung the exact proceudre.

TEM study was performed only on the ES films. Was there any difference

Authors comment:
The authors are grateful to the referee for several very interesting comments
here. A more detailed description about how the salts were added are included
in the revised manuscript. In addition, the amount of chlorides added is
clarified. The chlorides were dissolved in the aqueous precursor solution and
correctly the concentration of alkali in the solution increased. However, since
1:1 molar ratio mixture of NaCl/KCl has a melting temperature of 650 °C the
chloride mixture will form a molten flux during the heat treatment of the
films. The reason for a lower amount of the secondary phase in the films with
the salt flux is therefore proposed to be the reduced evaporation of volatile
alkali species dissolved in the flux and not the fact that there is a higher total
alkali concentration in the precursor solution. At the final temperature of
thermal treatment of the films, the chlorides have a significant vapor pressure
No chlorides were observed in the films during the TEM studies.
Unfortunately we were not able to directly observe the flux formation during
the heat treatment, the only indirect observation we have is the reduced
amount of secondary phases in the films with the salt added to the precursor
solution.
With respect to the formation of carbonates/hydroxides of the alkali metals we
have previously detected carbonate species in bulk KNN samples by FTIR
spectroscopy confirming our hypothesis (unpublished data).
Unfortunately we have only been able to study the ES-series films by TEM
due to budget reasons. Since the ES-series of films contained less secondary
phases we focused the present TEM study on them. We therefore have no data
on the thickness of the E-series of films and also limited other data.
2. Thermal expansion of KNN
Phase transitions of KNN Cubic – tetragonal – orthorhombic are manifested
by changes in cell parameters, and also in thermal expansion, similar as in
other ferroelectrics. So, please clarify the statement that thermal expansion of
KNN is almost independent on temperature. The studied KNN films exhibit
local ferroelectric repsonse, so they should undergo a sequence of phase
transitons upon cooling.
Authors comments:
The authors are grateful for this comment. There are variations in the lattice
parameter of KNN due to the phase transitions as described by the reviewer.
The most important point however is that the thermal expansion coefficient
for KNN is smaller than for the SrTiO3 substrate and the film will then during
cooling be forced into compression. The revised manuscript has been
modified by removing the sentence about the “almost constant thermal
expansion” as this is obviously wrong. More relevant references have been
included.
3. Heterogeneous vs. Homogeneous nucleation
In the 2nd paragraph of Dicussion the authors provide explanation for the
epitaxial growth of KNN films. They relate the low pyrolysis temperature
(400 oC) with the induced heterogeneous nucleation. So, if the pyrolysis
temperature was higher was this not the case? 400 oC is not an exceptionally
low tempersture for pyrolysis. Furthermote the reference they are referring to
(24, Schwartz and Schneller) discusses PZT and (Ba,Sr)TIO3 thin films
prepared from organic precursors, and low / high temperature in such
materials may not be directly transferred to water-based CSD of KNN films.
The authors further write that in (100) and (110) films there is a competition
between hetero- and homogeneous nucleation. Is then the growth of the
nucleated phase a problem? Is there any difference in thicknesses of epi- and
polycrystalline parts of respective films if the annealing conditions are
changed?
Authors comment:
Thanks to the referee for this comment which shows that we need to clarify
the text in the 2nd paragraph of the Discussion. The low and high pyrolysis
temperatures described are meant as relative values where low temperatures
are facilitating heterogeneous nucleation (REF Schwartz and Schneller) due to
lower activation energy and higher temperatures are favoring homogeneous
nucleation. In that respect it is not important which materials that are
discussed in the reference. The text in the 2nd paragraph of the Discussion has
been revised to clearify.
Regarding the (100) and (110) substrates we have also modified the text to
make it clear that both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation is taking
place giving the two different types of microstructures. We do unfortunately
not have any information about how the thickness of the epitaxial and
polycrystalline layers are changing with other processing parameters.
4. Secondary K2Nb4O11 (2,4-) phase
The authors write that the 2,4 –phase could only be seen by GIXRD. Does this
mean that e.g. log scale or extended step time of conventional XRD patterns
revealed nothing? The GIXRD patterns of individual samples still differ quite
a lot.
The secondary 2,4-phase is discussed in Discussion, 3rd paragraph. It is
written that the mass loss was significant and that direct evaporation of
alkalis can not explain such mass loss. Until this paragraph mass loss has not
been even mentioned. Please explain, what this mass loss means and how it
has been determined (if at all – it is a challenging task to do it in a film). How
is it confirmed that ' direct evaporation of K and Na from KNN … can not
explain the mass loss observed from these films.' Please explain and provide
evidence.
The majority of alkali polyniobate phases is humidity sensitive. Was there any
sign of humidity sensitivty in the studied films? For example was there any
difference in dielectric properties if they were measured in vacuum or in air
(this referes also to the comment no. 5)?
Was the 2,4 phase detected in any of the samples by SEM/TEM? A comment
on detection of this phase is defintely missing.
Authors comment:
The K2Nb4O11 secondary phase was observed as plate-like grains (few micron
in size) spread on the top of the polycrystalline layer by SEM during the FIB
preparation of the TEM samples. The secondary phase was also observed as a
thin plate-like grain in some of the TEM images of cross-sections as most of
the film surface was not covered by these grains. The fact that the secondary
phases are located as thin plate-like grains on the surface is the reason why it
is more visible in the GIXRD, than in normal XRD. A comment that the
secondary phase has been observed in SEM is included in the revised
manuscript.
The mass loss of the films was not measured directly, but it is related to the
totoal amount of secondary phase present in the films. This relation is clarified
in the revised version of the manuscript by rewriting this part. We are grateful
to the referee for pointing out this as we see it can be confusing.
The films were tested for stability by soaking in water and this harsh treatment
changed the film surface. However, exposure to ambient air was not observed
to change the properties of the films. With our set-up dielectric properties
were only measured in ambient air.
5. PFM, dielectric properties
PFM results are shown for both E and ES groups revealing that all films show
local ferroelectric response. However, macroscopic measurements are
reported only for two of the ES films, so one could assume that all other films
were too leaky. Very high losses at low frequney could be presumably related
to interaction of the films with humidity.
Are different permittivities of KNN (100) and (110) films related to
orientational dependence?
Based on the results of dielectric measurements it is difficult to accept the last
phrase of the Abstract, namely that 'The films demonstrated relatively high
permittivty with low loss. This phrase is much too general and even
misleading, it should be modified to reflect the results more precisely.
Authors comment:
The intension with these measurements was to show that the films are
ferroelectric. Unfortunately we measured the macroscopic dielectric properties
for only the two films presented and can therefore not provide data for the E-
series or any other films. The high losses at low frequency might be due to
humidity as proposed by the referee and a sentence about this is included in
the revised manuscript. This proposal is supported by the fact that the films
changes surface microstructure after a harsh treatment by soaking them in
water for 30 min. Since we only have the measurements on the two films, we
will not conclude that the different permittivities are related to the different
orientation of the substrates. The last sentence of the abstract has been
rephrased to: “The permittivity and loss tangent of the films with the salt flux
were 870 and 0.04 (100-orientation) and 2250 and 0.025 (110-orientation),
respectively, at 1 kHz.”.
