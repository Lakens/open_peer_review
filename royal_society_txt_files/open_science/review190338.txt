HDAC is an important epigenetic target in drug discovery and development. The authors
developed Ne-acetyl-lysine analogues with Zinc binding groups as HDAC inhibitors. The best
compound 18c had an IC50 value of 500 nM for HDACs. Besides, WB and MTS assay were used
to evaluate the antitumor activity of all synthetic compounds. This manuscript has provided an
effective strategy for developing novel HDAC inhibitors.
Minor comments:
1) the values of the anti-proliferative assay in Fig. 4 should be provided based on dose-dependent
curve-fitting.
2) in order to evaluate 18c toxicity, the authors need to determine the IC50s of 18c and SAHA
against both tumor cells and normal cells, then calculate and compare their selective index.

This manuscript described the design and synthesis of HDAC inhibitors by hybridizing acetyl-
lysine and zinc binding group. Their enzymatic and cellular activities were also characterized.
The most promising compound 18c had reasonable inhibition against HDACs. Interestingly, 18c
demonstrate the comparable antiproliferative activities against several cancer cell lines but the
less toxicity for normal cells than that of SAHA. Therefore, it is worthy of eventual publication in
Royal Society Open Science if the authors can address the following concerns:
1. Should add some discussion about whether the synthesized compounds intend to be pan- or
specific- HDAC inhibitors.
3
2. The cellular data is just described for the acetylation level of tubulin which is only relevant for
HDAC6. HDAC1-3 are involved in acetylation of H3, which is strongly suggested to be present in
the figure.
3. The authors should give dose-dependent curves in Fig. 4.
4. The authors should check English and careless typos in the text, and the format of the
structural formula in SI.

Ne-Acetyl-lysine analogs with Zinc binding groups as novel HDAC inhibitors
Fang Wang, et al
The manuscript describes the design, synthesis, and evaluation of a series of novel L-lysine
derivatives hybridized a zinc binding group as HDAC inhibitors. No matter their weaker potency
compared to that of SAHA against HDAC and cancer cell lines, the study is interesting and of
novelty, the inhibitory effect of compound 18 on HDAC and cancer cell lines also confirmed the
rationality of the design. However, a few issues still should be addressed before the manuscript
can be accepted for publication.
1. The expected proton and carbon number of most compounds differ greatly from those found in
the 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra. In addition, there are some unreasonable peaks such as 12.85 ppm
of compound 11 and 7.89 ppm of compound 18b carbon peak.
2. What is the purity of the test compound?
3. The structures of 14b, 14c, and 14n on Pages S4, S5, and S8 need to be redrawn.
4. The SD values of the IC50 of 11, 18b, 18c, and SAHA should be added to Data in Table 2.
5. Page 2, left column, lines 47, 52, and 54, change “treating trifluoroacetic acid with compound
7”, “the treatment of hydroxyl amine with compound 9”, “Treatment of hydroxyl amine with
compound 10” to “treating compound 7 with trifluoroacetic acid”, “the treatment of compound 9
with hydroxyl amine”, “Treatment of compound 10 with hydroxyl amine”.
6. On Page 3, left column, line 8, replace “the treatment of hydroxyl amine with intermediates

7. Page 3, left column, line 5, the sentence “which was under the ester……give compounds 16a-c”
need to be rewritten.
8. Page 2, left column, line 48, “Followed by….” is incorrect.
9. “lysine analogs” is incorrect and should be “lysine derivatives”.
10. Move some of the conclusions into the introduction to make the conclusions clear and concise.

Comments to the Author:
The authors have done a good job responding to the comments and concerns raised by the
previous review. However, there are still a few relatively minor items that need to be addressed
before I am comfortable recommending final acceptance.
(1) Overall the grammar of the manuscript could still be improved. The authors are strongly
encouraged to seek assistance in this area to that their message is not lost during final editing. In
particular, the paragraph at the top right of Page 2 needs to be edited for clarity and message.
(2) Please include copies of 1H and 13C NMR spectra in the supporting information.

Reponses to Reviewer 2’s comments
Reviewer 2 is also very positive about the manuscript. We thank the reviewer for the helpful
comments and careful reading of the manuscript. Our changes and/or responses are detailed below.
Comment 1: “Should add some discussion about whether the synthesized compounds intend to be pan- or
specific- HDAC inhibitors.”
Response: By using the substrates of corresponding subtypes of HDAC, we tested the inhibitory activity
at a final concentration 1µM of compounds 18c and SAHA, and the results showed that compound 18c
like SAHA is a pan-HDAC inhibitors, which is shown in the Table. S1 of Supporting Information.
Inhibitor* HDAC Inhibition (%)
HDAC<U+2160> HDAC<U+2161>a HDAC8
SAHA 87.05±2.193 15.51±3.084 41.19±0.180
18c 61.06±1.064 16.65±2.690 38.27±1.215
*1µM
Comment 2: “ The cellular data is just described for the acetylation level of tubulin which is only relevant
for HDAC6. HDAC1-3 are involved in acetylation of H3, which is strongly suggested to be present in the
figure. ?”
Response: Considering H3 and Tubulin are substrates commonly used for the cellular study of HDAC
inhibitors, we do have added their acetylation level of tubulin and H3 shown in the upper panel for each
cell lines in Figure 3.
Comment 3: “ The authors should give dose-dependent curves in Fig. 4.”
Response: The dose-dependent curve-fitting of anti-proliferation experiment has been replaced in Figure
4 showing as below:
Comment 4: “ The authors should check English and careless typos in the text, and the format of the
structural formula in SI. ”
Response: Thanks for the careful reading, we have double-checked although the text and SI and
corrected all typos.
Reponses to Reviewer 3’s comments
Reviewer 3 is in general enthusiastic about the manuscript with raising several concerns and pointing
out some typos. We thank the reviewer for the helpful comments and careful reading of the manuscript.
Our changes and/or responses are detailed below.
Comment 1: “The expected proton and carbon number of most compounds differ greatly from those
found in the 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra. there are some unreasonable peaks such as 12.85 ppm of
compound 11 and 7.89 ppm of compound 18b carbon peak.”
Response: Thanks for the careful reading, we have double-checked the proton and carbon numbers. The
reason is that some compounds contain some solvents or possess active protons (-COOH, -CONH-).
Therefore, we have marked the identical peaks of solvents, water or those active protons. Additionally,
some unreasonable peaks such as 12.85 ppm of compound 11 and 7.89 ppm of compound 18b carbon
peak are those peaks of petroleum ether. We have solved these problems.
Comment 2: “What is the purity of the test compound?”
Response: We are sorry for missing the purity. The purity of all tested compounds was over 95% by
HPLC. We have added the corresponding description in SI.
Comment 3: “The structures of 14b, 14c, and 14n on Pages S4, S5, and S8 need to be redrawn.”
Response: Thanks for the careful reading, we have corrected this typo with redrawing the structures of
14b, 14c, and 14n on Pages S4, S5, and S8.
Comment 4: “ The SD values of the IC50 of 11, 18b, 18c, and SAHA should be added to Data in Table
2.”
Response: Thanks for this kind remind, we have added the SD values of the IC50 of 11,18b and 18c into
Table 2.
Comment 5: “Page 2, left column, lines 47, 52, and 54, change “treating trifluoroacetic acid with
compound 7”, “the treatment of hydroxyl amine with compound 9”, “Treatment of hydroxyl amine with
compound 10” to “treating compound 7 with trifluoroacetic acid”, “the treatment of compound 9 with
hydroxyl amine”, “Treatment of compound 10 with hydroxyl amine”. ”
Response: Thanks for the careful reading, we have corrected these mistakes.
Comment 6: “On Page 3, left column, line 8, replace “the treatment of hydroxyl amine with intermediates
16b-c” with “the treatment of intermediates 16b-c with hydroxyl amine”.
Response: Thanks for the careful reading, we have corrected this typo.
Comment 7: “Page 3, left column, line 5, the sentence “which was under the ester……give compounds
16a-c” need to be rewritten. ”
Response: Thanks for the careful reading, we have rewritten the sentence as “which was hydrolyzed to
give compounds 16a-c.”
Comment 8: “Page 2, left column, line 48, “Followed by….” is incorrect. ”
Response: Thanks for the careful reading, “Followed by….” has been corrected to “ After”.
Comment 9: “lysine analogs” is incorrect and should be “lysine derivatives”.”
Response: Thanks for the careful reading, I have corrected this typo.
Comment 10: “Move some of the conclusions into the introduction to make the conclusions clear and
concise.”
Response: Thanks for the kind suggestion, we have moved and combined the first paragraph to the
introduction to make the conclusions clear and concise.
We thank all the reviewers again for careful reading of the manuscript and for their helpful
comments. We hope the revised manuscript have addressed all their concerns.
Sincerely,

Responses to Reviewer’s Comments
The reviewer is very positive about the manuscript. We thank the reviewer for the helpful comments
and careful reading of the manuscript. According to the Reviewers’ comments, we have done the point-to-
point response shown as below. Those corrections and modifications in text and SI have been highlighted
by blue color. Our changes and/or responses are detailed below.
Comment 1: “Overall the grammar of the manuscript could still be improved. The authors are strongly
encouraged to seek assistance in this area to that their message is not lost during final editing. In particular,
the paragraph at the top right of Page2 needs to be edited for clarity and message”
Response: Thank the reviewer’s careful reading. We have improved the grammar through the
manuscript. Especially, for the paragraph at the top right of Page2, “Given HDAC is one of attractive
drug targets found in recent years,……… have led to many successful examples.27-30” has been edited to
“Although considerable progress has been made in the development of HDAC inhibitors, clinically used
HDAC inhibitors still have some side effects, such as excessive toxicities, instability and off-target
effects.19-23 Therefore, the development of novel HDAC inhibitors are continuously needed to avoid side
effects and improve pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties.24-26 At present, there are few
HDAC inhibitors designed from Ne-acetyl lysine (HDAC substrate) while the designs of sirtuin inhibitors
by mimicking Ne-acyl lysine (sirtuin substrate) have led to many successful examples.27-30”
Comment 2: “ Please include copies of 1H and 13C NMR spectra in the supporting information. ”
Response: We have placed the copies of 1H and 13
C NMR spectra of all the compounds into the
supporting information (please see pages S16 - S47).
Other modifications
To make the interpretation clearer in Fig. 4, we have modified the “Log10C(Conc)” to “Log10
[Cmpd(uM)]”, and added the corresponding statement of “(Cmpd: tested compound 16c, 18c or SAHA)”
in Fig. 4.
We thank all the reviewers again for careful reading of the manuscript and for their helpful
comments. We hope the revised manuscript have addressed all their concerns.
Sincerely,
