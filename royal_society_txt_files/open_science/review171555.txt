Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The study of Nourani et al deals with an interesting question of how migrating birds migrate
over the ocean during migration in an island-rich region. Using Satellite telemetry and advanced
modelling the authors show that the birds move in an optimal route during most of their journey
and that their route selection is based on both geographic features (the existence of islands in the
area) and wind conditions.
I believe that this work is an important contribution to the bird migration literature and for
movement ecology in general due to several reasons: 1) The study deals with under-studied
migration system, 2) The methods are original and, to the best of my knowledge, have not yet
been applied in the study of bird migration, 3) The results are interesting and provide a
substantial contribution to the field, 4) The manuscript is generally written very well and the
content is very clear throughout the different sections of the manuscript. I attach an annotated
manuscript with some comments and corrections of typos. Specifically, I suggest the authors to
deal with the following issues:
1. Please provide additional information regarding the satellite tracking - which tags were used,
tag mass, bird body mass, operation scheme / frequency, data filtering etc. Also missing is
sample size and a table with the total number of positions from each bird. A related request that
deal with some of these issues is add to the main text the part of the Methods that is given as
supplementary material (ESM_S1).
2. Supplementary Material File S2: The type of data including the column headings are not
properly explained.
3. Line 99: Bird movement at which scale? between consecutive positions, between land masses
(starting point to island 1, island 1 to island 2...island n to end point)? or between the starting
point and the end point of the journey? Please explain your choice and justify it.
4. Data analysis: did the contribution of all the birds to the sample was equal and if not did you
use any way to correct for possible higher contribution of certain individuals to the sample (e.g.,
weight the data by the inverse frequency)?
5. Line 121: Please elaborate regarding the deviation. I am missing some data regarding this
deviation - how many km from the predicted path (deviation error distribution), did it differ
between different individuals, why points beyond the starting the end points of the route (i.e.,
within Japan and the Philippines land masses) were illustrated? How the deviation changes along
the route? It is indeed clear that the birds avoided Taiwan but other than that is the deviation
between the predicted and actual route similar in the starting and ending sections of the journey?
How the deviation vary along the route should be reported and possibly also illustrated in a
figure.
6. Line 125: Please add Table S3 from the supplementary material to the main text.
7. Line 132: Can you try focusing specifically on the section in which the birds avoided Taiwan -
did they benefited from exceptionally good tailwinds while flying above the ocean east of
3
Taiwan? Did a crosswind blew them away from Taiwan? Is there any other potential factor that
can be analyzed specifically for this section that may explain their avoidance from passing
through Taiwan?
8. Line 143: I am missing here reference to the study of Oriental Honey buzzards that also depart
from Japan over the sea (Nourani et al. 2016 Ibis) - it could make a nice comparison to highlight
similarities and differences in migration strategies.
I hope that these comments will be helpful in improving your work. You are welcome to contact
me if anything is unclear in my report.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Emily Shepard):
Firstly, please accept my apologies for the time it has taken to respond to you. An expert became
unable to provide a review, some time after initially accepting the invitation. The good news is
that your manuscript has now been reviewed by two referees (and I have read the study in some
detail myself) and both were enthusiastic about the study. There are relatively minor changes that
are needed before the paper is ready for publication. The short length of the current version
means that there is scope to flesh out the argument in places in line with comments from the
reviewers. I also have a few very minor comments in addition to those from the reviewers.
Abstract: the first line contradicts the information that follows, so I suggest changing it to indicate
that flapping flight is relatively costly for larger soaring birds.
P 3 line 31: it is not possible to say “exclusively” without supporting acceleration data, please
change this to “predominantly”
P 3 line 35: change wherefore to where
7
P 3 line 35: the adaptations have not been specified, you could link the tendency to soar to their
body size (and refer to Hedenstrom’s “Migration by soaring or flapping flight in birds” for
instance). In light of this it would also be relevant to give the body masses of these two raptors.
P 3 line 40: change expectation to exception
P 3 line 42-44: This sentence seems to be at odds with the information that follows. I suggest
either removing it or making it clear what exactly the outstanding questions are.
Methods: I suggest moving the information from S1 to the section on satellite telemetry.
P 5 line 83: please check the grammar

3 15 Abstract
4
5 16 Soaring raptors have limited ability to perform powered flight, hence their strong
6
7
17 reluctance to fly over water. As a result, all but one of the global raptor migration
8
9
10 18 flyways are largely over land. The East Asian oceanic flyway for raptors is the
11
12 19 exception. Raptor species utilizing this flyway migrate by island-hopping, flying over
13
14 20 open ocean for distances of up to 300 km between islands. We used satellite telemetry
15
16 21 data for grey-faced buzzards Butastur indicus, a species that dominates the southern
17
18
19 22 part of the flyway, to investigate the geographic and atmospheric factors responsible
20
21 23 for the suitability of this flyway for raptor migration. Using a combination of least-
22
23 24 cost path analysis and a step selection function, we found that the occurrence of
24
25 25 numerous islands, as well as suitable wind support along the oceanic flyway are
26
27
26 responsible for route selection in grey-faced buzzards. These results confirm the role
28
29
30 27 of islands, but also wind, in shaping the East Asian oceanic flyway of long-distance
31
32 28 raptor migration.

3 31 Introduction
4
5 32 Many raptor species accomplish their long-distance migrations exclusively by soaring
6
7
33 on thermals and orographic updrafts [1-3]. They are generally reluctant to fly over
8
9
10 34 water bodies, where thermals are weak or absent in most latitudinal zones and
11
12 35 wherefore powered flight is required [1-4]. Because of these adaptations, raptors
13
14 36 migrate along well-established flyways that occur mostly overland and
15
16 37 circumnavigate water bodies or converge on narrow land bridges or short water-
17
18
19 38 crossings where overwater flight is inevitable [1, 5, 6].
20
21
22 39 The East Asian oceanic flyway for raptors (hereafter the oceanic flyway) is an
23
24 40 expectation. This largely overwater flyway stretches from northeastern Siberia to
25
26 41 Southeast Asia and is dominated by the Chinese sparrowhawk Accipiter soloensis and
27
28 42 the grey-faced buzzard Butastur indicus [1, 7, 8]. It remains unclear what specific
29
30
43 geographic, atmospheric, and biotic characteristics make this flyway suitable for
31
32
33 44 raptor migration (but see [7, 8]). It is assumed that the numerous islands that occur
34
35 45 along this flyway provide an opportunity for migration by island-hopping. However,
36
37 46 the long distances of up to 300 km between the islands, which is more than any
38
39 47 distance covered by soaring raptors over water along any other flyway, indicate that
40
41
42 48 additional factors, such as atmospheric currents, must be facilitating raptor migration.
43
44
45 49 Water-crossing behavior in raptors around the world is attributed to wind support [9-
46
47 50 11]. In the oceanic flyway, sea thermals might also be responsible for long water-
48
49 51 crossings [3, 12] as the southern part of the flyway falls within in the trade-wind zone
50
51 52 (i.e. 5° to 30° north and south of the equator), where thermals develop over the sea
52
53
54 53 [13].

21 61 Various populations of grey-faced buzzards breed in different parts of Japan and

23 62 winter in Japan’s Ryukyu Islands or the Philippines [7]. We focused only on the
24
25
63 population that winters in the Philippines, as these individuals use a larger part of the
26
27
28 64 oceanic flyway and perform long water-crossings. Satellite-tracking data was
29
30 65 collected in 2009 for autumn migration of six grey-faced buzzards breeding in Japan’s
31
32 66 Kyushu Island (see S1) and wintering in the Philippines (Fig. 1). Data was recorded

40 69 By assuming that minimizing overwater flight results in less energetically costly
41
42 70 migration, we generated an optimal route to connect the breeding and wintering
43
44 71 grounds through the islands, while minimizing water-crossing. We used the inverse of
45
46 72 a distance to coast layer as a conductance surface to find the shortest path (i.e. the
47
48
73 least-cost path), in gdistance package [14] in R environment [15]. For each trajectory,
49
50
51 74 the last point in mainland Japan and the first point in the Philippines were considered
52
53 75 the starting and end points, respectively.

7
8 78 We modeled migratory route selection of the grey-faced buzzards using a step
9
10
79 selection function [16]. In this method, the straight-line segment connecting
11
12
13 80 successive tracking points is considered as one step (i.e. observed step) and a number
14
15 81 of alternative steps from the same starting point is generated. We compared the
16
17 82 observed and alternative steps based on a number of geographic and atmospheric
18
19 83 variables using a conditional logistic regression approach, which allows taking into
20
21
22 84 account stratification in the analysis [17].
23
24
25 85 To reduce autocorrelation, we made sure that the consecutive data points used for the
26
27 86 analysis were at least one hour apart. For each observed step (n = 61), we generated
28
29 87 100 random steps (see S2). Length and turning angle of random steps were drawn
30
31 88 from the frequency distribution of those of the observed steps.

34 89 Annotation of steps with environmental data
35
36
37 90 All observed and random steps were annotated using the Env-DATA track annotation
38
39
40 91 service in Movebank (https://www.movebank.org/), using bilinear interpolation.
41
42 92 Variables included distance to coast, eastward and northward components of the wind,
43
44 93 cloud cover, relative humidity to represent possibility of rain, and boundary layer
45
46 94 height as a proxy for convective conditions. Atmospheric data were obtained from
47
48
95 European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Because the flight
49
50
51 96 height of the birds was not known, pressure-level data were obtained at 900 mb level,
52
53 97 corresponding to the average boundary layer height over the study area (ca. 1000 m).
54
55 98 We calculated wind support and crosswind along each step, where wind support was

9
10
11 102 All variables were checked for collinearity (|r| > 0.7) before analysis. Conditional
12
13
14
103 logistic regression was carried out on scaled variables with the survival package [18]
15
16 104 in R environment [15]. Groups of matched observed and alternative steps were
17
18 105 entered as strata in the model.
19
20
21 106 We built models without interaction terms and with two-way interaction terms for
22
23 107 distance to coast and wind support and crosswind respectively. We used backward
24
25
108 stepwise model selection by removing variables that were non-significant in model
26
27
28 109 building. The minimum adequate model was considered as the model with the lowest
29
30 110 AIC (Akaike’s Information Criterion) [19]. We then evaluated the performance of the
31
32 111 best model by calculating the proportion of correct choices made by the model as a
33
34 112 consequence of the fitted effects of the variables used. To do this, we used a k-fold
35
36
37
113 cross-validation method suitable for the case-control design of the study [19, 20] with
38
39 114 100 repetitions. To determine variable importance, we used a randomization
40
41 115 procedure with ten permutations [21, 22].

45
46 117 The optimal route based on the least-coast path analysis connected Japan’s Kyushu
47
48
118 Island to the Philippines by passing through the Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan (Fig. 1).
49
50
51 119 This route deviated from the observed trajectories. Particularly, unlike what the
52
53 120 optimal route suggested, the tracked birds did not go through Taiwan to reach the
54
55 121 Philippines.

6
7
124 process. In the final model, with the lowest AIC with a delta AIC of 1.7 compared to
8
9
10 125 the next best models (Table 1; see table S3 for model comparison), distance to coast,
11
12 126 wind support, crosswind and the interaction between distance to coast and wind
13
14 127 support had a significant influence on route selection. Distance to coast was the most
15
16 128 important variable describing route selection of grey-faced buzzards (relative
17
18
19 129 importance: 0.44), followed by wind support (relative importance: 0.29) and
20
21 130 crosswind (relative importance: 0.04). Cross-validation indicated that the model was a
22
23 131 useful predictor of route selection in grey-faced buzzards (K-fold values ( ´ values
24
25 132 and ranges): observed, 0.40 (0.25-0.50) and expected by chance, 0.08 (0.00 - 0.17)).

28 133 Discussion
29
30
31
134 The oceanic flyway comprises numerous islands that, as our results suggest,
32
33 135 significantly contribute to its suitability for raptor migration. Migratory birds can use
34
35 136 prominent geographic formations such as islands as leading lines for navigation
36
37 137 purposes [1]. The role of islands in facilitating raptor water-crossing has been shown
38
39
138 for honey buzzards Pernis apivorus migrating over Central Mediterranean. Honey
40
41
42 139 buzzards crossing the Mediterranean between Italy and Tunisia use islands for
43
44 140 orientation, wind drift compensation, and as sources of thermal uplift [23, 24].
45
46 141 Moreover, Agostini et al. [23] suggest that breaking up a long sea-crossing into
47
48 142 smaller sections by exploiting islands reduces the risk of encountering unpredictable
49
50
51
143 weather changes that can interrupt non-stop flight over water.
52
53
54 144 The least-cost path that we constructed by minimizing water-crossing was not an
55
56 145 exact representation of the birds’ observed trajectories. Although the migratory routes
57
58 146 and flyways of soaring migrants commonly deviate from the shortest route to save
59
60 7
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 8 of 16
1
2
3 147 energy [25], the autumn trajectories of grey-faced buzzards followed a shorter and
4
5 148 more direct path than the least-cost route. This observed choice of route allowed the
6
7
149 birds to reduce their overall migration duration, but would expose them to long non-
8
9
10 150 stop overwater flight, e.g. by refraining from migrating via Taiwan. However, long
11
12 151 sea-crossing can be energetically less expensive under suitable wind conditions [24].
13
14 152 The high importance of wind support detected by our step selection function suggests
15
16 153 that this was probably true for grey-faced buzzards. Whether sea thermals also
17
18
19 154 contributed to reducing the costs of overwater flight remains unknown, as the coarse
20
21 155 resolution of our tracking data was not suitable for identifying the small-scale
22
23 156 response of the birds to updraft conditions.
24
25
26 157 Raptors using the oceanic flyway show exceptional migratory behavior and
27
28 158 adaptations, yet it is one of the least studied migration systems in the world. Our study
29
30
159 is a contribution to understanding the geographic and atmospheric conditions of the
31
32
33 160 flyway that make it profitable for raptors to fly over oceans for hundreds of kilometers.
34
35 161 Further studies using high-resolution tracking complemented with direct observations
36
37 162 are needed to better understand the influence of islands on migratory behavior of the
38
39 163 birds with respect to stop-over and refueling, flight type, and the use of wind and
40
41
42 164 thermals. Moreover, such studies can shed light on the role that sea thermals play in
43
44 165 raptor migration in the oceanic flyway.

11 Comments to Author(s):
12 I read this well-written paper with much interest. I liked the complementary empirical and modelling approaches
13
to the question, and think this is a very nice study, but unfortunately I think that it is too specialised for the
14
broad readership of Biology Letters. In my opinion it would be a good fit to a top-class ornithological journal
15
such as Journal of Avian Biology. I’m sorry for this disappointing response, and hope to read your work
16
published soon in another journal.
17
18
Comments from the Handling Editor:
19
I agree with the Board Member that this study will be very interesting to those who study bird migration but that

its general appeal may be more limited. I recommend publishing in journal dealing with avian biology. as an
21
alternative there is the option to transfer the submission to Royal Society Open Science

25 RE: I appreciate the positive comments from the board member and the Handling Editor. Although the
26 manuscript focuses on avian migration, it has the potential to appeal to a broader readership, as it brings into
27 focus the many research opportunities that exist in the study system, which can inspire not only ornithologists,
28 but also scientists interested in energetics, bio-meteorology, conservation biology, etc. I therefore take the
29 advice provided by the Handling Editor to transfer the submission to Royal Society Open Science.

Appendix B
This manuscript examines the migration path of buzzards using the East Asian oceanic
flyway. It is a concise, well-written paper that provides an interesting advance in the
understanding of factors affecting route choice, showing that birds do not always take the
route that minimises the distance between successive islands along their migration path.
I have very few changes to suggest. It would be worth considering the terminology that is
used in relation to what constitutes ‘least cost’, as the path that connects the islands (and is
taken as least cost) is not necessarily the cheapest route. It is certainly interesting to see
whether the actual path taken by birds differs from the model path, but what represents the
lowest cost path is probably a different question – and one that would be worth exploring
further in the discussion.

ociate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Emily Shepard):
y, please accept my apologies for the time it has taken to respond to you. An expert became unable to provide a review, some
after initially accepting the invitation. The good news is that your manuscript has now been reviewed by two referees (and I have
the study in some detail myself) and both were enthusiastic about the study. There are relatively minor changes that are needed
re the paper is ready for publication. The short length of the current version means that there is scope to flesh out the argument
aces in line with comments from the reviewers. I also have a few very minor comments in addition to those from the reviewers.
ract: the first line contradicts the information that follows, so I suggest changing it to indicate that flapping flight is relatively costly
rger soaring birds.
he first line of the abstract was modified.
ne 31: it is not possible to say “exclusively” without supporting acceleration data, please change this to “predominantly”
Exclusively” was changed to “predominantly”.
ne 35: change wherefore to where
hange was done.
ne 35: the adaptations have not been specified, you could link the tendency to soar to their body size (and refer to Hedenstrom’s
ration by soaring or flapping flight in birds” for instance). In light of this it would also be relevant to give the body masses of these
raptors.
reference to Hedenstrom’s paper was added. The birds dominating the southern portion of the oceanic flyway are small to mid-
raptor species.
ne 40: change expectation to exception
one
ine 42-44: This sentence seems to be at odds with the information that follows. I suggest either removing it or making it clear
exactly the outstanding questions are.
he sentence was removed.
ods: I suggest moving the information from S1 to the section on satellite telemetry.
he information given previously in ESM_1 is now included in the Methods section of the manuscript.
ne 83: please check the grammar
he sentence was edited.

he information given previously in ESM_1 is now included in the Methods section of the manuscript.

his data was provided as a supplementary material, which, as suggested by the associate editor and reviewer 1, have been moved

textbox was added in the excel file with explanations related to the input data.
99 bird movement at which scale? between consecutive positions, between land masses (starting point to island 1, island 1 to
d 2...island n to end point)? or between the starting point and the end point of the journey? Please explain your choice and justify
ovement direction was calculated between consecutive points. Values of variables used for step selection function are calculated
ach step, either at the endpoints or along the step. Because wind variables have both magnitude and direction, we calculated
along the step. To do this, we first calculated the heading from the start point to the end point of the step, then calculated
wind and tailwind using this heading. This has now been clarified in the manuscript lines 101-104.
- did the contribution of all the birds to the sample was equal and if not did you use any way to correct for possible higher
ribution of certain individuals to the sample (e.g., weight the data by the inverse frequency)?
he tracking data that we used was rather coarse in temporal resolution. Therefore, for each bird that migrated from Japan to the
ppines, we used all the points over water as well as the last point recorded over Japan and the first point over the Philippines. To
into account the differences in individuals, we included the mixed effect of individuals in the analysis, which was not found to be
ficant.
102 why did you chose this value? please justify
his value was not computed by statistical means. We considered a threshold of 0.7, a relatively high value, so that we could ensure
the variables used in the analysis were not correlated.
121 Please elaborate regarding the deviation. I am missing some data regarding this deviation - how many km from the predicted
, did it differ between different individuals, why points beyond the starting the end points of the route (i.e., within Japan and the
ppines land masses) were illustrated? How the deviation changes along the route? It is indeed clear that the birds avoided Taiwan
ther than that is the deviation between the predicted and actual route similar in the starting and ending sections of the journey?
the deviation vary along the route should be reported and possibly also illustrated in a figure.
will indeed be very interesting to know the detail of how the birds’ actual route deviated from the least-cost route. However, due
e very coarse temporal resolution and long gaps between consecutive points in our tracking data, interpreting the small-scale
acteristics of the route can be unrealistic. For this reason, in this manuscript we provide a general picture of the deviation between
eneral observed route and the generated optimal route. We believe that this species needs to be studied in more detail using
er resolution tracking devices. As we mention at the end of the conclusion, further studies using state-of-the-art devices are
ed to understand route characteristics and migratory behavior in smaller scale.
130 Please add here the table from the supplementary material ESM_S3
he table is now presented in the manuscript as Table 2.
132 Can you try focusing specifically on the section in which the birds avoided Taiwan - did they benefited from exceptionally
tailwinds while flying above the ocean east of Taiwan? Did a crosswind blew them away from Taiwan? Is there any other potential
r that can be analyzed specifically for this section that may explain their avoidance from passing through Taiwan?
nvestigating wind fields over the region in autumn do not suggest that the birds were blown away from Taiwan, though they have
fited from good tailwind. As mentioned above, it is unfortunately not possible to explain details of route choice, including the
dance of Taiwan by the migrating birds, using the current scale of the data.
143 I am missing here reference to the study of Oriental Honey buzzards that also depart from Japan over the sea - it could make
e comparison to highlight similarities and differences in migration strategies.
reference was added to the mentioned article (line 150).

We thank the reviewer for the positive comments. Concerning the terminology used in the paper, in order to reduce confusion,
ever we use the term “least-cost path”, we clarify that this is the least cost path generated through minimizing water-crossing.
