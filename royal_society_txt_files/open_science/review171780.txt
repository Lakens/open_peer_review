This study is a very important contribution to the field. The phylogeny of haemosporidian
parasites, including the origin of human malaria, has been debated for decades and almost all
possible topologies can be found in the literature. The present work contains by far the largest
study in terms of sequenced genes (21 loci) and density of taxa sampled, including
representatives of several previously not sequenced genera. The manuscript is easy to read and
the analyses are competently executed. I also found the discussion about the taxonomic
implications of Plasmodium being polyphyletic very carefully considered and balanced. I only
have a few minor points that will need some clarification before the manuscript can be published.
Lines 146-147 & 217-218. You attempted to sequence 21 loci but do not report the failure rate in
the main text. From suppl Fig 1 it looks like the missing data is unevenly distributed with many
isolates of Leucocytozoon, Parahaemoproteus and Polychromophilus without sequences for 50%
of the loci. Make this clear in the main text.
Line 146. All 21 loci are from the nuclear genome whereas most of the previous phylogenetic
analyses have been done on the genes in the mitochondria (and sometimes also the apicoplast). It
seems the authors have a not mentioned the reason to why they deliberately excluded genes from
the organelles.
Lines 156-161. Sample selection. The authors have decided not to include data from the genome
of Haemoproteus tartakovskyi and transcriptome of Plasmodium ashfordi (Bensch et al 2016,
GBE). Was this because these were incomplete, precluding extraction of sequences for the
selected 21 loci?
Line 192. The main phylogenetic analyses were conducted based on concatenated sequence data.
As it is well known (see e.g. Shen, Hittinger and Rokas, 2017, Nature Ecol & Evol), few genes in
large concatenated data sets can drive strong bootstrap support. It would therefore be of interest
to show the single gene tree statistics for each of the nodes. (I realized later that this cannot be
done due to the fairly large proportion of missing data. But perhaps worth saying this here
explicitly so the readers understand why you have not done single gene tree analyses).
Lines 249-252 & 444-449. The root taxon of the rest of the Haemosporida. Maybe emphasize even
stronger that the branching order of Leucocytozoon, Parahaemoproteus and Haemoproteus
remains ambiguous and that your main topology is in conflict with the recent complete mtDNA
phylogeny of Pacheco et al 2017 (MBE).

dominated by molecular barcoding, typically the cyt b gene. The permanent value of the data in
the present study would be much increased if the genbank accession numbers of the cyt b

This paper provides information and interesting speculations about possible phylogenetic
relationships among haemosporidian parasites. The authors discussed taxonomy of Plasmodium;
this is important for future research in malariology. The work includes much new DNA sequence
information. The methodology is mostly sound and, in the majority of its points, follows
established protocols and procedures. The phylogenetic analysis is good. However, this study
suffers from shortcomings. The main concerns are given below.
First, there is marked bias in haemosporidian taxa sampling, and this is the problem of the
majority of similar studies. DNA sequence information about representatives of entire family of
haemosporidians (Garniidae) is absent. The authors mentioned this only briefly (l. 577). Parasites
of some other haemosporidian genera/subgenera were also insufficiently sampled. For example,
only one species (Haemoproteus columbae) was incorporated in the analysis as a representative
of Haemoproteus. It is difficult to rely on such phylogenetic analysis, which is hardly acceptable
as a strong argument to reconstruct classification of entire order of apicomplexan parasites.
Second, information on life cycles of haemosporidians of the genera Nycteria, Polychromophilus
and Hepatocystis and some others came mainly from old studied, the majority of which have
never been tested. Presence of these parasites in the clade of Plasmodium spp. is unusual, but it
might be explained if they are mosquito transmitted in real life. These might be malaria parasites
with a restricted period of merogony, as is the case in some malaria parasites or reptiles.
Prominent research on life cycles of Nycteria, Polychromophilus and Hepatocystis has never been
performed since the 1960th. In other words, the available phylogenies call not only for taxonomic
reconstruction, but also for additional parasitology research aiming better understanding of life
cycles of these parasites. This is essential before doing basic changes in the parasite classifications.
Additionally, tropical bats often share the same ecological niches with sauropsids and primates,
so reports of the unusual Plasmodium-like parasite lineages in them might be a result of abortive
development of sauropsid/primate Plasmodium parasites in non-competent hosts (parasites do

not complete life cycle, but DNA template is present). General primers might preferably amplify
DNA of Plasmodium spp., but not Nycteria, Polychromophilus or Hepatocystis species, even if
gametocytes of these haemosporidians are visible in blood films. Application of parasite genera-
specific primers would be interesting in future studies.
I also question the use of consensus sequences, which came from co-infections (for example,
Haemoproteus antigonis and others). A big problem with that is the possibility to create chimeras
or artefacts (a problem of low quality of sequences).
As presented in the manuscript, the suggestions to create new genera of haemosporidians
(Auracytozoon, Ruminocystis) are premature and even invalid because description of the
parasites is absent.
The data of this study need more development and discussion, and the main conclusions are not
as obvious as the authors consider them.

The authors have responded satisfactorily, in my view, to the reviewer's comments. While one
reviewer had substantial concerns about the completeness of taxonomic sampling and robustness
of the results, I agree with the authors (in their response) that this is not sufficient reason at the
moment, to NOT do any analysis. I am therefore happy to recommend the paper be accepted as

ates of Leucocytozoon, Parahaemoproteus and Polychromophilus without sequences for 50%

have added this detail in the Results, lines 227-230 of the revised manuscript:
ataset completeness was uneven across samples and genera, varying from an average of 8 loci
sample in Polychromophilus (range: 5-11) to 17.5 loci per sample in Plasmodium (range: 6-
. However, with the exception of Polychromophilus and Nycteria all genera were represented
at least one sample with sequence data for 15 genes.”
have also added one additional phylogenetic analysis that accounts for heterogeneity in
sing data by including only the most complete (number of sequenced loci) samples for each
age. This topology was identical to the topology recovered from the full dataset, and has now

have expanded on our rationale for excluding mitochondrial and apicoplast loci from this
lysis in the Methods of the revised manuscript, lines 147-151:
e chose to sequence exclusively nuclear loci due to the unusual characteristics of
mosporidian mitochondrial genomes that may influence their utility for phylogenetic
lysis, namely the linearly concatenated structure that has been hypothesized to result in
certed evolution of this genome (Feagin 1994, McIntosh et al. 1998) and the recent finding of
e rearrangements and gene losses in some lineages (Karadjian et al. 2016).”
thermore, we would like to argue that by basing our phylogeny on a dataset that is non-
rlapping with previous studies, we are able to independently evaluate the congruence of

Haemoproteus tartakovskyi and transcriptome of Plasmodium ashfordi (Bensch et al 2016,

cted 21 loci?
regret that these taxa were not included in this study, as unfortunately all analyses were
pleted and this manuscript had undergone review elsewhere before we were aware of the
lic availability of these sequences. We have included a comment in the discussion regarding
availability and likely high value of these resources for future studies of haemosporidian
logenomics (lines 593-595 of the revised manuscript):
several genomic and transcriptomic datasets from avian haemosporidians have recently been
lished (Bensch et al. 2016, Videvall et al. 2017, Boehme et al. 2018), we anticipate that these
ources will be of high utility for future studies of haemosporidian phylogeny using genome-
e data.”

would like to note that variation among gene trees was taken into consideration through our
TRAL-II species tree analyses, which uses gene tree topologies to estimate a species tree. To

have made this change. In the Results we clarify that though the majority of phylogenetic
lyses recovered the Leucocytozoon-Parahaemoproteus–Haemoproteus clade as the root
on, four different analyses recovered Leucocytozoon at this position. Lines 261-264 of the

cocytozoon, Haemoproteus, and Parahaemoproteus as the root taxon sister to the rest of the

plementary Table 4).”
s is now reiterated in the Discussion (lines 457-465), including a reference to Pacheco et al.
17):
e majority of our analyses (12 of 17 analyses that were not misled by base composition)
ported an avian malaria clade containing Leucocytozoon, Haemoproteus, and
ahaemoproteus as sister to the rest of the malaria parasites, though in a minority of analyses

mosporidian phylogeny based on complete mtDNA genomes (Pachecho et al. 2017)
overed strong support for Leucocytozoon as sister to the rest of Haemosporida. As the pattern
ivergence among Leucocytozoon, Haemoproteus, and Parahaemoproteus was not consistent

omic sampling will be required to definitively resolve this relationship.”

y one species (Haemoproteus columbae) was incorporated in the analysis as a representative
Haemoproteus. It is difficult to rely on such phylogenetic analysis, which is hardly acceptable
strong argument to reconstruct classification of entire order of apicomplexan parasites.
ile we share the reviewer’s sentiment that the inclusion of other rare and poorly studied
mosporidian taxa such as Garniidae would be a welcome addition to this study, we feel that it
lear and implicit to the reader that we have presented this study as a major advancement in
understanding of haemosporidian systematics, and not the definitive answer (as all
logenies are hypotheses that can be tested with additional data). Furthermore, the status of
family remains uncertain, for it has never been included in any molecular systematic study.
e species, now called Plasmodium leucocytica, has been sometimes placed in that family - this
cies is included in our study and was found to be closely related to other squamate
smodium species. Importantly, the major finding of this study (polyphyly among
mosporidian genera) is only likely to increase with additional taxon sampling of rare and
rly studied lineages.
ddition, we disagree with the reviewer’s statement that this study “reconstructs the
sification of an entire order”. We suggested just two taxonomic revisions that involved
ving two distinct haemosporidian lineages to new genera (though as we note below, this
onomic revision has been removed from the revised manuscript). We were, in fact, very
servative with the proposed taxonomic changes and do not call for the revision of additional
lutionary lineages, instead suggesting an alternative approach that does not change current
sifications (lines 413-420 of the revised manuscript):
potentially unifying solution to the taxonomic conflict observed here is to encourage the use
he subgeneric names for these clades as much as possible, to reflect that they are distinct
ages and to take into consideration the evolutionary relationships. The issues of changing the
e of Plasmodium, particularly with respect to P. falciparum, was remarked upon by [13] who
ed that it was seen as “unwelcome” – even when the ICZN had sanctioned via a special ruling
Laverania in its place. As a consolation, though, the historic use of subgenera within the
emosporida has been common to reflect the distinctiveness of certain taxa and groups [13,
.”
ond, information on life cycles of haemosporidians of the genera Nycteria, Polychromophilus
Hepatocystis and some others came mainly from old studied, the majority of which have
er been tested. Presence of these parasites in the clade of Plasmodium spp. is unusual, but it
ht be explained if they are mosquito transmitted in real life. These might be malaria parasites
h a restricted period of merogony, as is the case in some malaria parasites or reptiles.
minent research on life cycles of Nycteria, Polychromophilus and Hepatocystis has never
n performed since the 1960th. In other words, the available phylogenies call not only for
onomic reconstruction, but also for additional parasitology research aiming better
erstanding of life cycles of these parasites. This is essential before doing basic changes in the
asite classifications.
agree with the reviewer that additional parasitological research on the life cycles of all
mosporidians would be valuable, though we disagree with the sentiment that all systematic
earch on haemosporidians should cease until additional parasitological research can be
formed. The information that is known to date is quite solid and several recent studies have
ngly confirmed findings on the blood stages and the vectors of the haemosporidian genera
concern the reviewer:
- Multiple recent studies have demonstrated that the bat haemosporidian genera (Nycteria,
Polychromophilus, and Hepatocystis) lack erythrocytic schizogony (e.g. Duval et al.
2007; Schaer et al. 2013, 2015, 2017; Megali et al. 2011; Witsenburg et al. 2012, 2015).
Several of these studies included large samples sizes, where blood smears were screened
and no merogony in erythrocytes were reported. In our opinion, for this reason alone
(lacking erythrocytic schizogony) changes in the parasite classifications can be justified.
- The vectors of the bat haemosporidians are also well established, and have been
definitively shown to not be mosquitoes (providing additional evidence for life history
divergence from Plasmodium).
o For instance, the vectors of Polychromophilus have been shown to be host
specific nycteribiid flies in several recent studies (e.g. Witsenburg et al. 2012,
2015; Megali et al., 2011; Obame-Njoghe et al., 2016).
o The vectors of Hepatocystis parasites in primates has been confirmed as
Culicoides adersi (Ceratopogonidae) (Garnham, 1961; Garnham, 1966) and
successfully tested experimentally in Australian flying foxes with an infection of
the potential invertebrate host Culicoides nubeculosus, which breeds below the
day-roosts of flying foxes in Australia (Landau et al., 1985).
o The vector for Nycteria parasites is indeed totally unknown and it can´t be
excluded at this point that these parasites are transmitted by mosquitoes, though
this in no way detracts from our phylogenetic results showing that Nycteria is a
divergent lineage nested within Plasmodium.
ditionally, tropical bats often share the same ecological niches with sauropsids and primates,
eports of the unusual Plasmodium-like parasite lineages in them might be a result of abortive
elopment of sauropsid/primate Plasmodium parasites in non-competent hosts (parasites do
complete life cycle, but DNA template is present). General primers might preferably amplify
A of Plasmodium spp., but not Nycteria, Polychromophilus or Hepatocystis species, even if
etocytes of these haemosporidians are visible in blood films. Application of parasite genera-
cific primers would be interesting in future studies.
carefully considered the possibility of amplifying and sequencing abortive infections, and
nt to lengths to avoid this. First, we only used samples that had a visible infection of a single
cies on blood films, and had no other taxon present. Therefore the possibility of preferentially
plifying a parasite that was not visible within a sample across all 21 loci is extremely unlikely.
referential amplification within a subset of loci were to occur, we would expect to see some
a exhibit highly divergent phylogenetic positions across different gene trees, though this was
observed.
ond, we would like to point out that accidental amplification of a non-target taxon (such as
smodium) would be expected to result in the observation that Nycteria, Polychromophilus,
Hepatocystis are nested within clades of (or are conspecific with) closely related
smodium species; rather, we observe that Nycteria, Polychromophilus, and Hepatocystis are
h highly divergent from their nearest Plasmodium relative. The patterns of sequence
ergence that we observed show clearly that we did not accidentally sequence a non-target
on in any instance.
so question the use of consensus sequences, which came from co-infections (for example,
emoproteus antigonis and others). A big problem with that is the possibility to create chimeras
rtefacts (a problem of low quality of sequences).
reviewer is incorrect on this point, as none of the samples used in this study came from co-
ctions, and we did not sequence Haemoproteus antigonis in this study. Furthermore, while
did include previously published sequences from H. antigonis in a supplementary analysis,
original study (Bertram et al.) that produced these sequences did not indicate that any came
m co-infections.
presented in the manuscript, the suggestions to create new genera of haemosporidians
racytozoon, Ruminocystis) are premature and even invalid because description of the
asites is absent.
the reviewer’s suggestion, we have removed the taxonomic revision of ungulate Plasmodium
Haemoproteus catharti and all mention of the generic names Auracytozoon and
minocystis from the revised manuscript.
data of this study need more development and discussion, and the main conclusions are not
bvious as the authors consider them.
find it difficult to respond to this concern, as no specific directions for further development
discussion are given. Additionally, it is not clear what conclusions are not obvious and why.
feel that our primary conclusion of the influence of codon-bias on the phylogenetic analyses
he malaria parasites and the widespread polyphyly of the widely-studied malaria parasite
us Plasmodium is very clearly demonstrated and supported by the 19 separate phylogenetic
lyses that we performed that all supported this conclusion (Supplementary Table 4
onstrates this point well).
