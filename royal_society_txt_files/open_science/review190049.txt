The present study investigates the relationship between spending on video game loot boxes
among both adults and a limited adolescent population. The paper investigates an important and
timely issue and follows many best practices in the research. The findings show that the
relationship between loot box spending and problem gambling observed by Zendle and Cairns
(2018) is replicable, and appears to be larger in a sample of adolescents. There is much to like
about this piece of research. The authors have preregistered the study, obtained a sizeable
sample, adjusted their p values for multiple comparisons appropriately, and attempted to answer
some important questions. For the most part, they have achieved this well. However, there are
some changes to the paper I would like to see implemented before the paper is published.
The first is the way that the authors discuss the adolescent population that responded to the
sample. Throughout the manuscript, the authors refer to the effects for the adolescent population,
however, they have not obtained a suitable sample to make such inferences. The actual
demographics for the current study are ages 16-18, which are late stage adolescents. While this is
likely due to ethical considerations it does limit the inferences we can make about the younger
adolescent population. Although theory would predict that younger adolescents would exhibit a
stronger relationship than older adolescents, it is difficult to make statements such as “problem
gambling amongst adolescents was more than twice as strong as the relationship observed in
adults”, when only older adolescents are sampled. I suggest that the authors carefully edit their
manuscript to make it clear that the effects they report are specifically for older adolescents.
The sample the authors have used for this study is also worthy of comment. Samples recruited
from Reddit are not exactly random samples of the population of interest, and there is now
considerable public interest and debate about the issue of loot boxes. Although the authors have
indicated some data cleaning has occurred, I would like to know more about this. For instance,
did the researchers employ any attention checks as are common when using online samples? Did
the authors screen for any trolling responses (e.g., Zendle and Cairns’ 2018 data contained a non-
trivial number of participants who reported Apache attack helicopter, a common internet meme
as their gender). Do the results hold up if such responses are removed? It would be nice to see
that the effects are present irrespective of analysis strategies. I would also like to see the authors
comment on the sample in the discussion section as one of the limitations of the present paper.
Another issue in the manuscript is the use of effect sizes and the way that the authors discuss
them. The authors use partial eta squared, which is not a particularly useful effect size for
interpreting the size of relationships and is notorious for being influenced by issues such as
sample size. It would be preferable if the authors could adopt a standardized effect size measure
throughout the manuscript to aid the reader in interpreting the size of the reported effects.
Additionally, there is a tendency for the authors to discuss effect sizes as a “number of times”
larger than other effect sizes. This is inadvisable as the effect size one uses will alter the
relationship between effect sizes. For instance it would be quite common for authors to report the
percentage of variance explained (r2) in study like this, and the relationship between two r2
scores will diverge more than their r scores. Similarly, orders of magnitude aren’t particularly
informative in any case, because an r of .02 is twice the size of an r of .01, yet both are utterly
meaningless. For these reasons, it would probably be better for the authors to interpret the
difference in effect sizes as not an order of magnitude, but simply as differences in the size of the
effect.

A very minor point, but page 19 has the word “7high” on it.
Overall, I believe the manuscript is worthwhile and with some relatively minor editing and
clarification should make a good addition to the literature.

label_comment_2
The current study is a preregistered survey design of loot-box spending and problematic
gambling in a large sample of adolescents. I thought the article had many positive qualities.
Contingent upon some revisions, I believe it would be acceptable for publication.
First the authors did a very good and comprehensive job with the literature. However, I thought
maybe it could be shortened a bit. I know they touch upon a lot of issues, but I might suggest
dialing back on policy issues in particular (and again in the discussion) and sticking to the facts
rather than prescriptions. Overall I think shortening the lit review by maybe 25% would help the
readability of the paper.
Naturally it would be inappropriate for me to suggest shortening the lit review without also
suggesting an addition. This is just a suggestion, but by focusing on problematic gambling, the
authors dodge the very contentious problematic gaming debate. Maybe that’s for the best, which
is why I say this is just a suggestion, although I suspect there are some who will use this article
anyway to make points about problematic gaming. I wonder if it’s worth a few sentences at least
to nip that particular issue in the bud. I kind of like the equating of loot boxes specifically to
pathological gambling but would hate for others to ignore the authors’ caution here. The authors
could point out this is a unique issue for some games, and should not be used to make assertions
about all games.
4
I think the article’s main weaknesses is the lack of reliability check items for careless or
mischievous responding. Something to consider in future research, but maybe just a note for
limitation for now.
The statistical analyses are all competently done as far as I can see. It’s great they preregistered
their design!
Last, I’d suggest dialing back the policy recommendations in the discussion. I generally don’t
advise making policy recommendations (which suggest causality) from any kind of correlational
data. Similarly I’d argue against using words like “harm”…try to keep the language conservative
and cautious and let the data speak for itself. I think too many media psychologists have
prematurely used the word “harm” in the past for that particular bell to have a remotely pleasant
ring anymore, however good-faith the authors here are using it.

R1 Comments
However, there are some changes to the paper I would like to see implemented before the paper is
published.
The first is the way that the authors discuss the adolescent population that responded to
the sample. Throughout the manuscript, the authors refer to the effects for the adolescent
population, however, they have not obtained a suitable sample to make such inferences.
The actual demographics for the current study are ages 16-18, which are late stage
adolescents. While this is likely due to ethical considerations it does limit the inferences
we can make about the younger adolescent population. Although theory would predict
that younger adolescents would exhibit a stronger relationship than older adolescents, it is
difficult to make statements such as “problem gambling amongst adolescents was more
than twice as strong as the relationship observed in adults”, when only older adolescents
are sampled. I suggest that the authors carefully edit their manuscript to make it clear that
the effects they report are specifically for older adolescents.
In line with R1’s suggestion, we have adjusted the wording of the manuscript to make it clear that
the sample under test here is specifically formed of older adolescents. We have also added to the
discussion a call for further research into other age groups (e.g. to investigate whether these effects
replicate with younger adolescents).
The sample the authors have used for this study is also worthy of comment. Samples
recruited from Reddit are not exactly random samples of the population of interest, and
there is now considerable public interest and debate about the issue of loot boxes.
Although the authors have indicated some data cleaning has occurred, I would like to
know more about this. For instance, did the researchers employ any attention checks as
are common when using online samples? Did the authors screen for any trolling responses
(e.g., Zendle and Cairns’ 2018 data contained a non-trivial number of participants who
reported Apache attack helicopter, a common internet meme as their gender). Do the
results hold up if such responses are removed? It would be nice to see that the effects are
present irrespective of analysis strategies. I would also like to see the authors comment on
the sample in the discussion section as one of the limitations of the present paper.
In line with R1’s suggestion, we have extended the discussion section of our manuscript to draw
attention to the limitations of a self-selected sample, and to call for further research that uses
representative samples of adolescents.
An overview of answers to gender questions within the sample revealed only 4 responses out of
1155 that might be considered non-serious: Two participants listed their gender as ‘Apache attack
helicopter’; one participant listed their gender as ‘dude’; one participant listed their gender as
‘dragon’. The analyses outlined above were re-run with these participants excluded from the
sample. There was no change in the significance of any statistical test with this reduced sample.
Another issue in the manuscript is the use of effect sizes and the way that the authors
discuss them. The authors use partial eta squared, which is not a particularly useful effect
size for interpreting the size of relationships and is notorious for being influenced by issues
such as sample size. It would be preferable if the authors could adopt a standardized effect
size measure throughout the manuscript to aid the reader in interpreting the size of the
reported effects. Additionally, there is a tendency for the authors to discuss effect sizes as
a “number of times” larger than other effect sizes. This is inadvisable as the effect size one
uses will alter the relationship between effect sizes. For instance it would be quite
common for authors to report the percentage of variance explained (r2) in study like this,
and the relationship between two r2 scores will diverge more than their r scores. Similarly,
orders of magnitude aren’t particularly informative in any case, because an r of .02 is twice
the size of an r of .01, yet both are utterly meaningless. For these reasons, it would
probably be better for the authors to interpret the difference in effect sizes as not an
order of magnitude, but simply as differences in the size of the effect.
In line with R1’s suggestions, we have made adjustments throughout the manuscript to our
discussion of variance-explained measures of effect size. More specifically, we have revised any
occasions where we refer to effect sizes as being ‘multipliers’ of other effect sizes and have instead,
as suggested, referred to differences between these effect sizes.
A very minor point, but page 19 has the word “7high” on it.
We have adjusted the manuscript to remove this error.
R2 Comments
First the authors did a very good and comprehensive job with the literature. However, I
thought maybe it could be shortened a bit. I know they touch upon a lot of issues, but I
might suggest dialing back on policy issues in particular (and again in the discussion) and
sticking to the facts rather than prescriptions. Overall I think shortening the lit review by
maybe 25% would help the readability of the paper.
In line with R2’s suggestion, we have contracted the literature review by shortening our summary of
policy implications. We have rephrased this content in the discussion in line with R2’s other
comments.
Naturally it would be inappropriate for me to suggest shortening the lit review without
also suggesting an addition. This is just a suggestion, but by focusing on problematic
gambling, the authors dodge the very contentious problematic gaming debate. Maybe
that’s for the best, which is why I say this is just a suggestion, although I suspect there are
some who will use this article anyway to make points about problematic gaming. I
wonder if it’s worth a few sentences at least to nip that particular issue in the bud. I kind
of like the equating of loot boxes specifically to pathological gambling but would hate for
others to ignore the authors’ caution here. The authors could point out this is a unique
issue for some games, and should not be used to make assertions about all games.
In line with R2’s suggestion, we have extended our discussion to incorporate a brief passage about
links between our research and disordered gaming.
I think the article’s main weaknesses is the lack of reliability check items for careless or
mischievous responding. Something to consider in future research, but maybe just a note
for limitation for now.
As suggested by R2, we have extended our manuscript to incorporate a discussion of this limitation.
Last, I’d suggest dialing back the policy recommendations in the discussion. I generally
don’t advise making policy recommendations (which suggest causality) from any kind of
correlational data. Similarly I’d argue against using words like “harm”…try to keep the
language conservative and cautious and let the data speak for itself. I think too many
media psychologists have prematurely used the word “harm” in the past for that
particular bell to have a remotely pleasant ring anymore, however good-faith the authors
here are using it.
In line with R2’s comments, we have revised the wording of our discussion. We have also nuanced
our discussion of policy.
