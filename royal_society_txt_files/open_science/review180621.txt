In the paper the authors report on their experiment examining the ecosystem engineering effects
of small digging mammals in Tasmania. The research is novel, well designed and analysed. The
paper is generally well written, and this is an important contribution to the field – though parts of
the discussion are a little speculative. There are three key aspects that I think require further
consideration/attention.
Major comments
(1) “Ecosystem engineering”. The title of the paper uses the word “ecosystem engineering”, yet it
is not defined or discussed in the body of the manuscript. There is body of literature on
ecosystem engineering that is highly relevant to their work. Most significantly, the seminal paper
on the subject by Jones et al. 1994 is not cited. I think the authors are missing an opportunity to
gain greater attention for their work. I suggest placing the study within the context of the field of
ecosystem engineering, and providing some reflection on how/why their results are more
broadly significant.
(2) Influence of population and climate variability. The authors cite a number of measures that
have a time as a component. This is interesting and useful, but of course these can change
through time in response to the population density of the digger and the availability of food that
is driven by climate. It is good that the study was conducted over a whole year, but that does not
capture impacts of inter-year variability. That’s fine, but it would be good to acknowledge this
and see a discussion of the potential impacts of population and climate variability on ecosystem
engineering effects. I also wonder – was there enough data to examine digging variability within
the year of study (i.e. seasonal)?
(3) Graphical representation of results. It would be good to see graphical representation of the
digging results. There is only one – Figure 1- that refers to diggings/ha. Could you use box plots
or similar to represent all the digging measures?
Minor comments/edits
Keywords. Should include “ecosystem engineering”
Introduction.
No mention or definition of “ecosystem engineering” or citation of Jones et al 1994. Needs some
discussion of the concept of ecosystem engineering.
Methods
Lines 121 – 122 Latin names already in earlier text – don’t need this twice.
Line 129 – typo “withon”.
Line 134 – “Marked”? How? Please explain in more detail how you determined re-digs.
Results
Line 213-215 How do you know they were re-excavated? As above – this needs to be explained.
3
Discussion
As above, the likely effect on population and climate variability on digging rates and effects
needs to be acknowledged and discussed.
Line 270 – 280 – Do any of these studies acknowledge/quantify the impact of population and
climate variability on digging rate and associated effects? Important to discuss.
Line 303 – 319 and 328 – 335. There is quite a bit of speculation beyond the data presented here.
Line 350 – 356 – This late in the manuscript to introduce new aspects, and it is also speculative.
Perhaps delete or integrate in the introduction to set the scene. The second last paragraph is
strong enough in its own right and is directly follows from the results you have found. You may
want to reword the final sentence of the manuscript (line 356-358) and integrate at the end of the
second last paragraph.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
General comments
The manuscript fits the scope of the journal and it is well written for a wide audience. The
research methods are appropriate to address the research questions. The authors addressed an
interesting question about the impact of digging mammals on soils in various habitat types.
Other than the issues raised in the comments below, the analysis is logical and clear and the
discussion relevant (although it could be more concise). I have several key comments:
Context-dependency: Although the context-dependency of digging mammals’ impact, is clearly
stated in the abstract, it is not discussed in the introduction. Comparison among habitats here
gives insights into context-dependency, but this paper could be of greater interest to a broad
audience if it compared its results with previous work on mammal diggings in different
environmental contexts using a comparative overview table that included values for volumes and
4
surface areas per species, spoil vs pit and per forest type. The study is particularly valuable in
being outside of a reintroduction context, as recognised by the authors.
Mammal densities: This information is critical for any comparisons with other sites. Can it be
provided?
Heterogeneity and a dynamic system: This receives a lot of attention in the first paragraph of the
discussion, but what part of the results supports this? It would also be good to see the evidence of
how dynamic the digging is, i.e., the heterogeneity over space and time. For example, the study
would be improved if the authors could provide maps of individual plots showing the dynamic
nature of pit digging. Can the data be analysed to, for example, test whether digging locations
are more dynamic in habitats with less ground cover?
Principal components rather than more biologically meaningful variables: I have some concerns
about the statistics used, namely the use of Eigenvectors instead of the original soil variables. A
more detailed study that is more comparable with previous work on digging mammals could be
achieved without the use of Eigenvectors and using original variables.
Minor suggestions
Abstract – The abstract should explain that most of the variables were not tested individually, but
Eigen vectors were used to study the effects of digging mammals. The abstract states that the
mammals had varying impacts depending on the habitat type, but the introduction did not
mention testing a range of habitat types.
Introduction
1) Line 63 has the wrong referencing style?
2) Line 78 needs a reference about the digging parameters (or is it personal observation?)
3) The last paragraph introduces the important hypothesises, but did not mention that the
measured soil characteristics will be compared in different forest types (along a productivity
gradient?).
Methods
1) Line 106 to 114: the introduced habitat types were not mentioned in the introduction, therefore
it is not clear why the study is replicated in these forest types and what is the expected outcome
of the comparison.
There is no mention of the plot setup and number of samples regarding each habitat/forest type.
If these habitat types are linked with varying productivity, the measure of productivity should be
described here.
2) Line 120, 121: the local mammal species densities should be mentioned here.
3) Line 129: there are some typos.
4) Line 128,129: the methods introduce various plot sizes, but it is not clear why various plot sizes
were used (it seems a bit ad hoc). It is not mentioned later on if these plots were all used in the
data analysis or pooled together. It is not clear whether the plots of different sizes were treated
the same way in the statistical analysis or if their size difference was taken into account.
5) Line 137: there is the first and last mention of remote cameras, but the setup design is not at all
described – needs more information of the remote camera setup (design, data analysis, etc.) or
reference to another study using those cameras
6) Line 149-152: digging types should be described on their own, not only in brackets after the
sampling design. A reference might be needed which describes diggings of different age.
It is unclear how the sampling was completed in the different sized plots – were 30 subsamples
taken also from 5 x 5 metre plots?
7) Data analysis:
Principal Component Analysis doesn’t count for any nestedness or pseudo-replication in the
data, therefore the Eigenvectors might have been distorted before applying them in the mixed
model. Spatially weighed PCA could be applied to account for the triplets from the same plots.
After having Eigenvectors in a linear mixed regression model, the results are fairly abstract and
hard to interpret as a lot of useful information is lost via standardizing the variables for the
Principal Component Analysis. Why not identify the most important values with a PCA and then
use the reduced original variables in the mixed models? It would tell more information about the
5
underlying mechanisms of soil processes – if the question is about soil characteristics, the models
should include original soil characteristics instead of standardized Eigenvectors. Soil conductivity
could tell about one soil process (soil salinity), organic carbon % could describe another soil
process (decomposition) and phosphorus about another one (soil parent material brought to the
surface), etc..
A PCA including the forest types and digging types would tell a more interesting story about the
direction of changing variables.
Line 171 – 177: what was the actual model? It is not clear if soil sample type was a fixed term
including the digging type as categories or were the digging types included separately in the
model? Also, were the habitat types included as one fixed term with three categories or were each
three habitats in the model? It is not clear from Figure 2 if a post-hoc test was used to compare
pits and spoils in the different habitat types or all the three habitat types were included as fixed
terms separately.
If all digging parameters were recorded according to the species, it would make more sense to
break down all the analysis to species level.
Results
There are good comparisons made about digging densities in different forest types and regarding
bettongs and echidnas. However it would be interesting to know if the digging intensity showed
seasonal variation.
Line 214: Instead of decay rate / ha / year, a more useful measure would be the actual time
period of how long it takes for a pit to refill (in years).
Effects of diggings on soil fertility, hardness and moisture: It would be interesting to show the
PCA plot to see how the variables cluster together. Including the forest types in the plot as a
covariate in order to investigate the directions of interactions would add a lot more useful
information.
Figures: the terms (on the y axis) are not very clear on Figure 2. Were the interactions tested post-
hoc? It is not straightforward where the undisturbed soil is plotted on the figures.
Discussion
Line 249: I thought mostly chemical variables were measured (18 chemical variables and 2
physical), therefore the digging mammal impact was on the soil chemical and not physical
properties. However the most important 12 variables were used as a single factor, there are still
12 original chemical variables tested.
Line 257: This ’56-year period’ should be mentioned in the Results section first together with the
calculation used to achieve this number.
Line 260,261: the fertility and moisture content of habitat (forest types?) are not mentioned in the
Methods or Results section, therefore this conclusion is unclear. It should have been described
how fertility and moisture content of the habitat types (the forest types?) were measured earlier
in the Methods.
Line 267: this needs references.
Line 298, 299: „Digging of foraging pits also mixes soil...” – this was not tested in the study,
therefore this statement cannot be made, unless it is referring to other studies (in that case a
reference is needed).
Line 303: reference needed.
Line 305: it should be mentioned in the Results section first.
Line 305 – 317: this has not been tested here and the section can probably be removed.
Line 322: Nutrient availability in soils were not explicitly tested in this study, only Eigenvectors
of the variables, therefore it could be a general indication of soil chemicals only. The study also
can’t tell much about the real differences between pits, spoils and undisturbed areas as all soil
variables were standardized in the PCA.
Line 325: as mentioned before, the study can’t tell much about the soil variable differences or
their effects as they were analysed as a single variable. To test the differences and the functional
roles of the soil chemicals, they should have been analysed separately.
6
Line 334,335: any evidence for this?
Line 337: needs a reference – has this been shown elsewhere.
Line 351,352: needs a reference.
Line 356: wrong referencing style?

Appendix A
Ecosystem engineering by digging mammals: effects on soil fertility and
condition in Tasmanian temperate woodland [Manuscript ID RSOS-180621]
Response to reviewers
We thank the two reviewers of this manuscript for their thoughtful and helpful
comments. Below, we detail our responses to their recommendations.
REVIEWER: 1
Major comments
(1) “Ecosystem engineering”. The title of the paper uses the word “ecosystem
engineering”, yet it is not defined or discussed in the body of the manuscript.
There is body of literature on ecosystem engineering that is highly relevant to
their work. Most significantly, the seminal paper on the subject by Jones et al.
1994 is not cited. I think the authors are missing an opportunity to gain greater
attention for their work. I suggest placing the study within the context of the
field of ecosystem engineering, and providing some reflection on how/why
their results are more broadly significant.
RESPONSE: this is an excellent point. We have restructured the first
paragraph so that it begins with a general introduction to ecosystem
engineering, citing Jones et al (1994), to provide a broader context for the
paper.
(2) Influence of population and climate variability. The authors cite a number
of measures that have a time as a component. This is interesting and useful,
but of course these can change through time in response to the population
density of the digger and the availability of food that is driven by climate. It is
good that the study was conducted over a whole year, but that does not
capture impacts of inter-year variability. That’s fine, but it would be good to
acknowledge this and see a discussion of the potential impacts of population
and climate variability on ecosystem engineering effects. I also wonder – was
there enough data to examine digging variability within the year of study (i.e.
seasonal)?
RESPONSE: we have added some information on the likelihood medium-
term temporal change in effects of digging by bettongs, which are likely to be
significant as the reviewer suggests, at Lines 302-308. Unfortunately, the
design of our study did not lend itself to study of seasonal variation, because
each season was sampled once only so variations are difficult to interpret in
relation to effects of season. We have therefore not added an analysis or
discussion of seasonality.
(3) Graphical representation of results. It would be good to see graphical
representation of the digging results. There is only one – Figure 1- that refers
to diggings/ha. Could you use box plots or similar to represent all the digging
measures?
RESPONSE: we are not quite sure which additional measurements could be
added. The current figure depicts effects of species and habitat on the density
of diggings, and this strikes as being useful. We have additional data on the
dimensions of diggings, but these are given quite comprehensively in the text
and do not lend themselves to simple graphical presentation. Therefore, we
have not added to the existing figure.
Minor comments/edits
Keywords. Should include “ecosystem engineering”
RESPONSE: because the term ‘ecosystem engineering’ is in the title, we
assume it need not be among the keywords as well.
Introduction.
No mention or definition of “ecosystem engineering” or citation of Jones et al
1994. Needs some discussion of the concept of ecosystem engineering.
RESPONSE: this has been added, as noted above.
Methods
Lines 121 – 122 Latin names already in earlier text – don’t need this twice.
RESPONSE: those latin binomials have been deleted.
Line 129 – typo “withon”.
RESPONSE: corrected.
Line 134 – “Marked”? How? Please explain in more detail how you
determined re-digs.
RESPONSE: at Lines 137-139 we explain in more detail how plots were
marked, and then at Lines 144-146 we extend this description to explain how
we could distinguish cases of re-excavation of old diggings, as follows:
“Precise identification, mapping and age-indexing of diggings allowed us to
identify the appearance of new diggings and to distinguish cases of re-
excavation of old diggings when plots were re-surveyed.”
Results
Line 213-215 How do you know they were re-excavated? As above – this
needs to be explained.
RESPONSE: this is now explained, as noted in the preceding response.
Discussion
As above, the likely effect on population and climate variability on digging
rates and effects needs to be acknowledged and discussed.
RESPONSE: this has now been done, as noted in an earlier response.
Line 270 – 280 – Do any of these studies acknowledge/quantify the impact of
population and climate variability on digging rate and associated effects?
Important to discuss.
RESPONSE: the studies cited had little to say on population and climate
variability, so we have not commented on these factors in our discussion of
those studies.
Line 303 – 319 and 328 – 335. There is quite a bit of speculation beyond the
data presented here.
RESPONSE: the comments at Lines 303-319 are not speculation, exactly, but
rather they are interpretations based on our observations in the field. These
observations relate phenomena that we did not quantify, so they do not appear
in the results, but we feel they are relevant to the topic of the paper so we have
retained them in the revised manuscript.
The comments at Lines 328-335 are more speculative, but they are an attempt
to propose an explanation for some of our quantitative observations, and we
believe this is appropriate in the Discussion (which, we feel, is not overly
speculative as a whole).
Line 350 – 356 – This late in the manuscript to introduce new aspects, and it
is also speculative. Perhaps delete or integrate in the introduction to set the
scene. The second last paragraph is strong enough in its own right and is
directly follows from the results you have found. You may want to reword the
final sentence of the manuscript (line 356-358) and integrate at the end of the
second last paragraph.
RESPONSE: we have followed this advice: what was the final short
paragraph in the original manuscript has been mostly deleted, and the
concluding remark on ecological restoration by reintroduction of ecosystem
engineers has been incorporating in the preceding paragraph, which is now the
final paragraph.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
I have several key comments:
Context-dependency: Although the context-dependency of digging mammals’
impact, is clearly stated in the abstract, it is not discussed in the introduction.
Comparison among habitats here gives insights into context-dependency, but
this paper could be of greater interest to a broad audience if it compared its
results with previous work on mammal diggings in different environmental
contexts using a comparative overview table that included values for volumes
and surface areas per species, spoil vs pit and per forest type. The study is
particularly valuable in being outside of a reintroduction context, as
recognised by the authors.
RESPONSE: these are useful suggestions. In the discussion we do already
make some comparisons of our results with effects of mammals in different
environments, but we have not developed this further in the present
manuscript in the way that the reviewer suggests. This is because one of us
(Johnson) is involved in a collaborative project with other workers in the field
that among other goals is producing such a comparative synthesis. We do not
want to pre-empt that in this paper, and in any case the larger collaborative
project will produce a more wide-ranging overview. Therefore, any attempt to
do something similar here would be quickly made redundant.
Mammal densities: This information is critical for any comparisons with other
sites. Can it be provided?
RESPONSE: a parallel study has produced an estimate of density of
eastern bettongs in this study area, and we provide that at Lines 124-127.
We do not have estimates of density for other species, as also noted at
Lines 124-127. Estimation of density for animal populations is challenging
and was beyond the scope of this study.
Heterogeneity and a dynamic system: This receives a lot of attention in the
first paragraph of the discussion, but what part of the results supports this? It
would also be good to see the evidence of how dynamic the digging is, i.e.,
the heterogeneity over space and time. For example, the study would be
improved if the authors could provide maps of individual plots showing the
dynamic nature of pit digging. Can the data be analysed to, for example, test
whether digging locations are more dynamic in habitats with less ground
cover?
RESPONSE: we have clarified this statement in the first paragraph of the
Discussion, to make it clear that the comment on dynamism is based on the
high rate of creation of new diggings, balancing the rate of disappearance by
in-filling of old diggings. The re-written text making this point is at Lines
267-269. We agree with the reviewer that it would be interesting to quantify
heterogeneity of digging and examine that factors related to heterogeneity at
various scales, but we feel that this would be beyond the scope of this paper.
Because of this we have reduced the emphasis on heterogeneity in this
paragraph by deleting two sentences from the original.
Principal components rather than more biologically meaningful variables: I
have some concerns about the statistics used, namely the use of Eigenvectors
instead of the original soil variables. A more detailed study that is more
comparable with previous work on digging mammals could be achieved
without the use of Eigenvectors and using original variables.
RESPONSE: we used PCA because the large number of soil variables that we
measured, and the strong correlations among many of them, meant that
univariate analyses based on the original variables would have been difficult
to interpret, and estimates of effect size and statistical significance potentially
misleading. Furthermore, soil features such as fertility are in fact compound
variables, reflecting the combined influence of many variables that can be
measured separately but which have their influence synergistically. For these
reasons we argue that our statistical approach is appropriate to the questions
that we address in our study.
Minor suggestions
Abstract – The abstract should explain that most of the variables were not
tested individually, but Eigen vectors were used to study the effects of digging
mammals. The abstract states that the mammals had varying impacts
depending on the habitat type, but the introduction did not mention testing a
range of habitat types.
RESPONSE: as it is written the abstract does not explain how soil fertility
was estimated, whether using original measured variables or eigen vectors.
We feel that explaining the approach would involve more technical detail than
is feasible for an abstract. As noted in response to an earlier comment, the
Introduction does now refer to testing a range of habitat types.
Introduction
1) Line 63 has the wrong referencing style?
RESPONSE: the referencing style has been corrected.
2) Line 78 needs a reference about the digging parameters (or is it personal
observation?)
RESPONSE: the remark on features of diggings are based on authors’
observations from this study, and are now identified as such at Line 80.
3) The last paragraph introduces the important hypothesises, but did not
mention that the measured soil characteristics will be compared in different
forest types (along a productivity gradient?).
RESPONSE: we have now added a sentence at Lines 83-85 stating that the
study spanned a gradient in soil fertility, allowing comparison of effects of
digging mammals at different points on that gradient.
Methods
1) Line 106 to 114: the introduced habitat types were not mentioned in the
introduction, therefore it is not clear why the study is replicated in these forest
types and what is the expected outcome of the comparison.
There is no mention of the plot setup and number of samples regarding each
habitat/forest type.
If these habitat types are linked with varying productivity, the measure of
productivity should be described here.
RESPONSE: as noted above, the Introduction now refers to the range of forest
types.
We now state the number of plots in each of the three habitat types, at Lines
133-135.
The habitat types varied in soil fertility and moisture availability, as measured
through the study and shown by data presented in Figure 2 (this is explained at
Lines 120-128).
2) Line 120, 121: the local mammal species densities should be mentioned
here.
RESPONSE: we comment on densities hereabouts, at Lines 124-127.
3) Line 129: there are some typos.
RESPONSE: these have been corrected.
4) Line 128,129: the methods introduce various plot sizes, but it is not clear
why various plot sizes were used (it seems a bit ad hoc). It is not mentioned
later on if these plots were all used in the data analysis or pooled together. It is
not clear whether the plots of different sizes were treated the same way in the
statistical analysis or if their size difference was taken into account.
RESPONSE: The plot size was reduced partway through the study because of
time constraints; because estimates of density and their variances were not
affected by plot size we treated all plots in the same way in analysis – this is
now explained at Lines 137-138.
5) Line 137: there is the first and last mention of remote cameras, but the
setup design is not at all described – needs more information of the remote
camera setup (design, data analysis, etc.) or reference to another study using
those cameras
6) Line 149-152: digging types should be described on their own, not only in
brackets after the sampling design. A reference might be needed which
describes diggings of different age.
It is unclear how the sampling was completed in the different sized plots –
were 30 subsamples taken also from 5 x 5 metre plots?
RESPONSE: we have re-written this passage of text to simplify and (we hope)
clarify it while removing the brackets; see Lines 161-163. The re-written text
also clarifies that all plots were treated in this way (these soil samples were
taken from outside each plot, so plot size did not affect the sampling stratgey).
7) Data analysis:
Principal Component Analysis doesn’t count for any nestedness or pseudo-
replication in the data, therefore the Eigenvectors might have been distorted
before applying them in the mixed model. Spatially weighed PCA could be
applied to account for the triplets from the same plots. After having
Eigenvectors in a linear mixed regression model, the results are fairly abstract
and hard to interpret as a lot of useful information is lost via standardizing the
variables for the Principal Component Analysis. Why not identify the most
important values with a PCA and then use the reduced original variables in the
mixed models? It would tell more information about the underlying
mechanisms of soil processes – if the question is about soil characteristics, the
models should include original soil characteristics instead of standardized
Eigenvectors. Soil conductivity could tell about one soil process (soil salinity),
organic carbon % could describe another soil process (decomposition) and
phosphorus about another one (soil parent material brought to the surface),
etc..
A PCA including the forest types and digging types would tell a more
interesting story about the direction of changing variables.
RESPONSE: we justified the use of PCA in response to an earlier comment.
The point on spatial effects of the triplets is accounted for in the mixed model,
in which the grouping of samples in triplets is accounted for by entering plot
ID as a random factor.
Line 171 – 177: what was the actual model? It is not clear if soil sample type
was a fixed term including the digging type as categories or were the digging
types included separately in the model? Also, were the habitat types included
as one fixed term with three categories or were each three habitats in the
model? It is not clear from Figure 2 if a post-hoc test was used to compare pits
and spoils in the different habitat types or all the three habitat types were
included as fixed terms separately.
RESPONSE: To address the reviewer’s requests, we have explicitly stated the
model structures on Lines 180-190 and Lines 196-198. The soil sample type
(digging treatment) was a fixed term with three categories (pit, spoil, beside).
Habitat was also a fixed term with three categories (E. amygdalina, E.
obliqua, E. tenuiramis). We did not use posthoc tests, as (1) we are not aware
of a Bayesian post-hoc equivalent for the package MCMCglmm, (2) the
coefficient plot approach we utilised is widely accepted in the literature, and
(3) the coefficients displayed are relative to E. amygdalina and undisturbed
topsoil (see Figure 2 legend).
If all digging parameters were recorded according to the species, it would
make more sense to break down all the analysis to species level.
Results
There are good comparisons made about digging densities in different forest
types and regarding bettongs and echidnas. However it would be interesting to
know if the digging intensity showed seasonal variation.
RESPONSE: we commented on seasonal variation in response to Reviewer 1;
the design of our study did not lend itself to study of seasonal variation,
because each season was sampled once only so variations are difficult to
interpret in relation to effects of season. We have therefore not added analysis
or discussion of seasonality.
Line 214: Instead of decay rate / ha / year, a more useful measure would be
the actual time period of how long it takes for a pit to refill (in years).
RESPONSE: unfortunately we could not estimate directly the time taken for
pots to refill.
Effects of diggings on soil fertility, hardness and moisture: It would be
interesting to show the PCA plot to see how the variables cluster together.
Including the forest types in the plot as a covariate in order to investigate the
directions of interactions would add a lot more useful information.
Figures: the terms (on the y axis) are not very clear on Figure 2. Were the
interactions tested post-hoc? It is not straightforward where the undisturbed
soil is plotted on the figures.
RESPONSE: as noted above, we did not perform post-hoc tests. In this plot
the effect coefficients for values of soil from ‘pit’ and ‘soil’ are expressed
relative to the values from undisturbed soil, as explained in the caption to the
figure.
Discussion
Line 249: I thought mostly chemical variables were measured (18 chemical
variables and 2 physical), therefore the digging mammal impact was on the
soil chemical and not physical properties. However the most important 12
variables were used as a single factor, there are still 12 original chemical
variables tested.
RESPONSE: we are not completely sure what is being related in this
comment – possibly, the fact that this line refers to physical effects on soil is
confusing. We meant physical to denote non-biological (i.e. including effects
on soil chemistry), rather than non-chemical. To avoind this confusion we
have removed the word ‘physical’ from Line 263.
Line 257: This ’56-year period’ should be mentioned in the Results section
first together with the calculation used to achieve this number.
RESPONSE: this was a simple ‘back-of-the-envelope’ calculation that may
not be robust, and we have therefore removed reference to it here, and also
from the abstract.
Line 260,261: the fertility and moisture content of habitat (forest types?) are
not mentioned in the Methods or Results section, therefore this conclusion is
unclear. It should have been described how fertility and moisture content of
the habitat types (the forest types?) were measured earlier in the Methods.
RESPONSE: the methods and results do explain how soil composition was
measured, and how these variables were analysed by PCA to yield a variable
describing soil fertility; measurement of soil moisture was described at Lines
172-174; differences in soil fertility and soil moisture were analysed in the
Results section and displayed in Figure 2.
Line 267: this needs references.
RESPONSE: the remainder of this paragraph goes on to detail that statement
with supporting references.
Line 298, 299: „Digging of foraging pits also mixes soil...” – this was not
tested in the study, therefore this statement cannot be made, unless it is
referring to other studies (in that case a reference is needed).
RESPONSE: we have provided two references in support of this statement
(Hayward et al 2016; Valentine et al 2018), at Line 318.
Line 303: reference needed.
Line 305: it should be mentioned in the Results section first.
RESPONSE: we are not certain what is being referred to here, so have not
revised the text in response.
Line 305 – 317: this has not been tested here and the section can probably be
removed.
RESPONSE: this section of text provides some interpretation of the
mechanisms underlying our results and consideration of their broader
significance. Because we feel that some speculation of this kind is appropriate
in a Discussion we have not removed this section.
Line 322: Nutrient availability in soils were not explicitly tested in this study,
only Eigenvectors of the variables, therefore it could be a general indication of
soil chemicals only. The study also can’t tell much about the real differences
between pits, spoils and undisturbed areas as all soil variables were
standardized in the PCA.
Line 325: as mentioned before, the study can’t tell much about the soil
variable differences or their effects as they were analysed as a single variable.
To test the differences and the functional roles of the soil chemicals, they
should have been analysed separately.
RESPONSE: in response to both sets of comments above, we refer again to
our argument that for statistical and functional reasons the intercorrelated
variables that describe variation in soil chemistry are best handled using a
multivariate method such as PCA than by univariate analyses.
Line 334,335: any evidence for this?
RESPONSE: this interpretation is speculation, so is not supported by
evidence. We clarify this by beginning the next sentence with the words “If
this speculation is correct…” at Line 353-354.
Line 337: needs a reference – has this been shown elsewhere.
RESPONSE: this comment is unreferenced because it does not describe a
phenomenon demonstrated in our study or in similar systems. As noted above,
we have clarified this by adding the words “If this speculation was correct, re-
excavation of diggings…” Line xx-xx.
Line 351,352: needs a reference.
RESPONSE: the paragraph in which these lines occur has been removed as
recommended by reviewer 1, so this recommendation is no longer relevant.
Line 356: wrong referencing style?
RESPONSE: the referencing style has been corrected.
