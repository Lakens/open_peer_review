This is a fascinating manuscript, that compares the d15N and d13C values of skin and fecal
samples from three species of Balaenoptera migrating past the Azores islands over several years.
The sample size is not large, particularly for blue whales, but large enough to support the
inferences that the authors make from their data and analyses. The important findings include
further support for the growing understanding that baleen whales feed far more on migration
than the “classical” model of baleen whale migration indicates; and – a particularly interesting
finding - that sei whales feed off Northwestern Africa in the winter.
I’m not an expert on isotope analyses, and so can’t speak to the details of those analyses,
although from my reading of that literature, this analysis seems appropriate. The discussion of
whale migration and movement ecology is well written, accurate and appropriate. This strikes
me as an important contribution to our understanding of baleen whales’ movement ecology, and
shows how stable isotopes can be used to improve understanding of the relationships between
baleen whales’ foraging ecology and movements.
My one very minor quibble is with the first sentence of the Conclusions. The authors state, “Our
work provides strong evidence that North Atlantic blue, fin and sei whales migrating through
central Atlantic waters feed during winter or early spring in tropical and subtropical waters, and
that this is a widespread strategy among migratory whales.” I’d suggest rewording to “Our
work provides strong evidence that North Atlantic blue, fin and sei whales migrating through
central Atlantic waters feed during winter or early spring in tropical and subtropical waters, and
that this strategy is more prevalent among migratory whales than is currently accepted”. Or
something along those lines. My point being that we don’t yet know that winter feeding is
widespread amongst migratory whales, so that sentence isn’t quite correct right now. I suspect
that the authors are right, and the strategy is widespread, and I look forward to seeing work
emulating their study, on whales in other ocean basins.
I have no real comments to make further, other than to congratulate the authors on a fine piece of
work.

REVIEW OF
Stable isotopes reveal supplemental feeding and differences in winter habitats in blue, fin and sei
whales migrating through the Azores,
This study investigate variability in isotope ratios from bulk skin tissue of blue, fin and sei whales
collected near the Azores from 2002 to 2014. Authors also analysed faeces samples that were
opportunistically collected during the same period of time. Prey data was obtained from
published work, but data regarding the date of collection is not included anywhere in the
manuscript or supplementary material. It is unknown if these prey data was collected within the
same season (s) and years that whales skin samples were collected or from a different period of
time. Authors used stable isotope analysis of C and N to understand some aspects of the feeding
ecology of these whale species, but introduction about the application of this technique in
cetaceans, and the meaning of d13C and d15N is poorly described in the introduction. There are
various studies that had used stable isotope analysis in skin tissues from whales to understand
variability in diet and habitat use by sex, feeding areas, maturity, etc. and identify migratory
species from resident animals. There are also studies that included analysis of feaces and prey
items. Introduce this information to the reader.
Author included only one paragraph describing isotope ratios, in particular, the spatial
variability in primary producer values, but authors cited only one publication which refers to
understand top predators movement (work of Graham et al. 2010). It seems that the authors are
not reading important literature in regards to the factors driving variability in isotope ratios in
plankton. At least, please cite the citations that Graham et al. 2010 included in their introduction
to explain spatial variation in baseline values.
It is not clear what are the main goals of this work, e.g. if authors are trying to understand the
contribution of prey items in the whales diet? Or if they are trying to understand the importance
of the Azores as a feeding area for these species? Or if they are trying to identify which are the
main feeding areas of migratory blue, sei and fin whales that are observed in the Azores? Or if
the goal is to understand migration patterns? And whether these migratory patterns may
contradict the classic migration routes for these species? Authors need to define clearly the
objectives of their work and state their hypotheses.
In the methods, analysis, I also recommend to include Bayesian mixing models that are
commonly used with stable isotope data. This analysis can help to ID the approximate feeding
areas of these cetaceans (and discriminate others), rather than just saying that a mean value of X
animal overlap with this other X mean value
Also, there are carbon and nitrogen isoscapes derived from zooplankton samples from the
Atlantic, the work of McMahon et al. 2013, cited in this paper. Although these isoscapes also
represent a snapshop within a specific period of time, authors can use this isoscape (in addition to
the other data they included in the table S2) as a baseline to ID the main feeding areas of
4
cetaceans and discriminate whether the waters near the Azores represent an important feeding
area for some species or not. However, data from this work are not included as reference of
potential prey of the current manuscript. I do not understand why would the authors exclude this
work that could be very helpful to understand habitat use of whales? if there is a good reason,
explain it briefly, it could be important.
Authors need to include collection date in Table 1, and annual sample size in the legend of figure
3.
Table S1: not integrated well in the analyses nor paper discussion, it seems to be just an isolated
table no connected to the manuscript.
Table S2: include collection date or at least collection year and season
Table S3, why blue whales were not included in the analyses?
Time series- Another important issue is the poorly discussed temporal variability in skin samples,
which were collected in different seasons and years. Author’s results, and figure 3 (that I think
they are very interesting) shows that there is a high to moderate temporal variation (and
significant differences between years) for both C or N in fin or sei whales, but these pattern was
not well discussed. Samples from blue whales are not shown, and I do recommend to include
these data in the graphs (despite that they were not significantly different and sample size was
small). I also recommend to explain this temporal variation at the very beginning of the
discussion (rather than discuss theses results at the end), please explain what does this isotopic
variation through time mean for each species? Are whale switching feeding areas through time?
And/OR Are whales preying on different items? AND/Or is there any changes in the baseline
values? Why blue whales is the exception? Please discuss these results and provide insights
before you show and discuss results from SEAc.
For SEAc analyses, you can include results showed in figure 2 and include it in figure 5 (instead
of just providing mean and SD values of those whales). This would be a stronger way to present
your data (and you can eliminate figure 2). More importantly, after showing and discussing
results of temporal variability in whale isotope ratios, authors could discuss that despite the
observed temporal variation in isotope ratios for Sei and fin whales, SEAc results suggest that
whales have different isotope niches during those 12 years. Then, you can discuss if these results
are associatef to differences in habitat or prey, or both.
Figure 5, because there is no date of collection of prey items, it is really hard to understand and
evaluate whether whales are feeding in prey from a given site and no from another site, because
the zooplankton isotope rations can vary largely through time. So, you need to show the
variability in zooplankton isotope ratios collected in different years and season (if they were
collected in different year and season) and could be included in the supplementary material, and
then make a case that despite this temporal variation, the spatial variability in isotope ratios is
still strong between feeding areas (as presumably shown in figure 5). Then, authors could use
Bayesian mixing models to ID the main areas where whales were feeding.
Results, please include subheadings, and follow the same order to discuss results. Discussion
section should not be an extension of results, please concise discussion. As it is, the discussion
sections are very confusing, and hard to follow.
The very first sentence of the discussion, authors claimed to be the first one measuring isotope
rations in some specific areas, why this claim is the highlight of your discussion? This is not really
interesting, it is more interesting to discuss better the main results of their study, and in relation
to their hypotheses that were largely missing in this manuscript.
Page 6, L10, authors need to provide the expected baseline isotope values for upwelling areas vs
nearshore areas, and oligotrophic areas in the Atlantic, and include labes in the figure 5 to ID
5
which prey values represent oligotrophic, nearshore and upwelling areas. Otherwise, your
discussion is very speculative.
General Evaluation: Because authors did not specify the goals of their work, it was really hard to
follow their manuscript, and understand why they are using some analyses instead of other ones,
and how one analyses connect with one specific goal. The reader has to guess most of the time.
Because there are many missing pieces of information in each section of the manuscript, the study
reads weak and discussion read very speculative.

Supplementary material from “Stable isotopes reveal winter feeding in different
habitats in blue, fin and sei whales migrating through the Azores”
Methods
Potential range and seasonal movements of whale species
The summer feeding range of North Atlantic blue whales extends from the Scotian Shelf to
Davis Strait in the west, and from Denmark Strait to Svalbard in the east [1]. Fin whales co-
occur with blue whales in most of this range but on the eastern Atlantic their feeding grounds
extend further south to the British islands, Bay of Biscay and Iberian coast [2]. Additionally,
there is evidence that part of the fin whale population wintering in the western Mediterranean
migrate towards the Atlantic during the summer months [3]. Satellite telemetry indicate that
blue and fin whales seen in the Azores migrate to central Atlantic waters, between Greenland
and Iceland [4]. A recent photo-identification match between the Azores and the Gulf of St.
Lawrence indicates that blue whales seen in the Azores may spent the previous summer in
either side of the North Atlantic basin [5]. All sei whales instrumented with satellite tags in
the Azores migrated to the Labrador Sea, off Canada [6,7]. Still, two individuals were
apparently heading east of Greenland when their signals were lost, suggesting individuals
may use feeding grounds on both sides of the Atlantic [7].
The wintering grounds of these species remain unknown. Fin whales were
acoustically detected along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (16°-50° N, 24°-50°W) from late autumn
through early spring, with higher detection rates north of 32°N during winter months [8].
Whaling records and historic and contemporary sightings of sei whales along the West
African coast (from Morocco down to Senegal) [9,10] and of blue whales between Cape
Verde and Mauritania in winter [10-12] suggest part of the population may winter off the
Northwest Africa coast.
Based on the above, we considered that blue and sei whales seen in the Azores may
summer in the Northeast Atlantic (NEA) and Northwest Atlantic (NWA), and spend the 3-4
months preceding sampling in lower-latitude pelagic waters (Azores (AZ), North Africa,-
NAF) or closer to the Northwest African coast (NAF-UPW). In the case of fin whales, we
also considered the Iberia (IB), Bay of Biscay (BB) and western Mediterranean (MED) as
plausible winter-spring habitats.

Stable isotopes reveal winter feeding in different habitats in blue, fin and sei whales
migrating through the Azores
This study examines winter feeding in three species of baleen whales by comparing carbon and nitrogen
isotope ratios in skin biopsy samples, which provide information over the past 2-3 mo of feeding behaviour.
This manuscript is generally very well written. The statistical analyses appear adequate, conclusions are
nuanced, literature cited is highly relevant, and caveats clearly identified. I consider my comments generally
minor, except for one point that require specific attention:
1) Lipids were extracted from samples using strong solvents to avoid biases of d13C. Given the
mixed results obtained in other studies about the effect of lipid-extraction on d15N values, there is
a need to provide a justification for using lipid-extracted samples for d15N analysis instead of
untreated samples.
Specific (minor) comments:
- There is a total mismatch between figure captions and contents.
- The paper says that samples were collected between 2002 and 2014 (first line in Methods), but the
figures (fig 2) present results only from 2005.
- p. 2, line 26: do you mean ‘that remain on the animal for the entire annual migratory cycle’.
- p. 2, line 46: should the term ‘type’ be changed to ‘pathways’?
- p. 2, line 49: d13C decline from northern to southern latitudes yes, but within each hemisphere (so it is
lower near the Equator and higher both toward the north and south poles.
- p.4, line 28: from Morocco to Senegal, not the Morocco... And please add a reference to fig. 1 here.
- p.4, line 37: ‘of whale sampling’ not of ‘whale samples’
- p.4, line 44: delete ‘were’
- p. 5, line 50: isotope or isotopic space?
- p.6, line 2: considerable not considerably. And should this be ‘within-region’ or ‘within-regional’?
- p.6, line 16: reword: ‘...mainly used food resources available in NAF and NAF-UPW during autumn, and
in the Azores during spring’.
- p. 6, Line 32: delete either ‘the’ or ‘these’.
- p.6, line 43: this sentence implies there you expected a sex difference in blue whales. Why? Another
sentence needs to be added to explain the expected difference in habitat use between males and
breeding females during winter.
- p.7, line 3: why is the Suess effect likely to be negligible? You have samples spanning over more than a
decade. What is the decadal change in d13C expected from Suess. Please add a sentence to support
your statement.
- p.7 line 50: ‘feeding’ not ‘feedings’ habits
- p.7 lines 54-56: not obvious from the figure S1 that copepods are at lower TP than krill. Also, krill
contains several species; might be true for Meganyctiphanes norvegica, but Thysanoessa species
might actually be isotopically similar to copepods. Need to beef up this argument if it is to be kept here.
- p.8, line 26: ‘compared to values from the Gulf of St. Lawrence’
- Figure 3 (with caption being fig.4) – julian day vs dC and DN in sei whale: the caption say top-bottom,
but they are left-right panels
- Supplementary material: a few typos in the text: first paragraph: may spend (not spent) the previous
summer on either side (not in either side).

Response to Referees
Reviewer #1 was happy with our previous revision.
Response to Reviewer #3
Reviewer#3: I consider my comments generally minor, except for one point that require
specific attention:
1) Lipids were extracted from samples using strong solvents to avoid biases of d13C. Given
the mixed results obtained in other studies about the effect of lipid-extraction on d15N
values, there is a need to provide a justification for using lipid-extracted samples for d15N
analysis instead of untreated samples.
R: We agree with the Reviewer that the issue of potential effects of lipid extraction on d15N
is far from being settled and included a few sentences in the Material and Methods section
(Page 3, Lines 33-43) introducing the problem and explaining why we had to analyse d15N
from lipid-extracted samples:
“Lipids are depleted in 13C and typically have d13C values that are more negative than those of
proteins and carbohydrates within an organism [29], which can introduce considerable bias in SIAs.
A common approach to deal with the potential lipid effect on d13C values, is to remove lipids from
tissues by chemical lipid extraction [32]. However, lipid extraction may also alter d15N values of
tissues, although the magnitude and direction of change is species and tissue dependent. In the case
of baleen whale skin, some studies reported a significant decline in d15N values after lipid extraction
[43], while other studies documented a significant increase or no change in d15N values for the same
whale species [54]. Similarly to what was observed in the muscle tissue of terrestrial mammals [55],
changes in d15N in baleen whale skin due to lipid extraction were generally small and within the
analytical precision typical of d15N measurements [43, 54]. Nonetheless, a way to avoid potential
effects on d15N is to measure d13C in lipid-extracted tissue and d15N in non-extracted tissue [54].
Obviously, this requires that a larger amount of sample is available to conduct separate analyses.
Unfortunately, this was not the case in the present study, where each skin sample was already split
for SIA and genetic analyses.”
Reviewer#3: Specific minor comments - the Reviewer noted several grammar errors
throughout the ms and made specific suggestions to correct them.
R: We adopted all the recommended changes and we thank the reviewer for taking his/her
time to revise the English of the ms, including of the Supplementary material.
Reviewer#3: The paper says that samples were collected between 2002 and 2014 (first line
in Methods), but the figures (fig 2) present results only from 2005.
R: We are thankful to the reviewer for pointing out this discrepancy. Figure 2 should show
only the years for which there were at least 2 skin samples analysed, which were the years
used in the inter-annual statistical analyses. However, when we added the plot for the blue
whales as recommended by Reviewer#2, we inadvertently included the year 2010, which had
only one sample.
Species plots in figure 2 were corrected to only include years with n=2 and we added a
sentence in the caption of the figure explaining this option.
Reviewer#3: p.6, line 43: this sentence implies there you expected a sex difference in blue
whales. Why? Another sentence needs to be added to explain the expected difference in
habitat use between males and breeding females during winter.
R: We wouldn’t expect sex differences in habitat use but we agree with the reviewer that the
way the sentence was written gave that impression. We reworded this sentence and the one
in Pg 7, line 37 to separate the discussion of temporal and sex differences in isotope values.
Reviewer#3: p.7, line 3: why is the Suess effect likely to be negligible? You have samples
spanning over more than a decade. What is the decadal change in d13C expected from Suess.
Please add a sentence to support your statement.
R: Fin whale samples used in statistical analyses spanned 6 years and the decline in d13C
over these 6 years was ~2‰, 80 times the highest estimates of the annual rate of change
attributed to the Suess effect. Following the reviewer recommendation, we added a sentence
in Pg 7, lines 6-10 supporting our argument:
“Similarly, the estimated rate of change in d13C of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the
North Atlantic attributable to the Suess effect (the decrease in the d13C values of
atmospheric CO2 from the combustion of fossil fuels) ranges between -0.007‰ per year in
polar regions and -0.025‰ per year in subtropical regions [69-71]. This value is too low
to account for the annual differences in fin whale d13C values.”
Reviewer#3: p.7 lines 54-56: not obvious from the figure S1 that copepods are at lower TP
than krill. Also, krill contains several species; might be true for Meganyctiphanes norvegica,
but Thysanoessa species might actually be isotopically similar to copepods. Need to beef up
this argument if it is to be kept here.
R: We agree that there are species-specific, spatial and temporal differences in d15N within
copepods and krill. On average, however, copepods tend to have lower d15N than krill
(Hansen et al., 2012; Agersted et al., 2014) and estimates of regional prey isotopic values
compiled from the literature agree with this (Table S2). Following the reviewer
recommendation, we reworded the sentence to put it more explicitly:
“A comparison of isotopic values of calanoid copepods and euphausiids compiled from the
literature shows that, with a single exception (NAF in autumn), mean d15N values of
copepods were consistently lower (by 0.2-1.42‰) than those of euphausiids sampled in the
same region and season. Thus, the higher reliance of sei whales on copepods would explain
their lower d15N values relative to fin and blue whales. “
