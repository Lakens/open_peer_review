This manuscript reports One-Step synthesis of OH-TiO2/TiOF2 nanohybrids and it’s enhanced
solar light photocatalytic performance. The work is interesting. So, I recommend it accepted for
publication after some revising. The main concerns are as follows:
1 More characterization including EDS, elemental mapping, TEM, XPS etc. should be added.
2 The suggested heterojunction photocatalytic mechanism lack direct experimental and literature
support
3 English expressions can be further improved.

This work reported one-step synthesis of OH-TiO2/TiOF2 hybrids with enhanced photoactivity
for dyes degradation. I recommend it for publication after addressing the following comments.
1. TEM should be added to give further microscopic information.
2. To understand why the hybrids shows enhanced photoactivity, other characterizations such
photoelectrochemical or photoluminesence spectra analysis should be added. for
example,authors can refer: Small 2017, 13, 1702253; Nanoscale, 2014, 6, 6335-6345

Appendix A
Dear Reviewer,
We have carefully revised our manuscript according to the comments point-by-point
and uploaded the revised version here. The changes are justified as following:
Comment 1: More characterization including EDS, elemental mapping, TEM, XPS etc.
should be added.
Response: We have added EDS(Figure 3(e) and corresponding text), elemental
mapping(Figure 3(f)-(h) and corresponding text), TEM(Figure 3(a)-(d) and
corresponding text), XPS(Figure 6 and corresponding text) in our revision.
Comment 2: The suggested heterojunction photocatalytic mechanism lack direct
experimental and literature support.
Response: We have added PL analysis and radical-scavenging experiments. The PL
analysis showed that under simulated solar light irradiation, on the interface of TiO2
and TiOF2, the electron–hole recombination is reduced. So theoretically, more h+
radicals can react with H2O or OH- to produce •OH, and more electrons can react with
the dissolved oxygen molecules for yielding superoxide radical anions (O2-•).
Furthermore, MB also can be decomposed by the holes directly. The radical-scavenging
experiments results showed that h+ was the main active species in the photocatalytic
process, •OH and O2•- radicals also played a role in the photooxidation of MB. The
order of importance of the active species is h+, •OH and O2•-.
Corresponding literature (references[38-42],[46-50]) have been added, too.
Comment 3: English expressions can be further improved.
Response: We have found English editing serves from to help us to improve English
language and style.
Comment 4: In introduction, some related references (Royal Soc. Open Sci. 2017, 4,
170834, Appl. Surf. Sci., 2017, 391, 12, Appl. Surf. Sci., 2017, 392, 658; Chin. J. Catal.
2017, 38, 270 can be referenced.
Response: The literature was all de added (references[4][5][6][7])
Thanks for reminding us. We have learned a lot through the paper submission and
manuscript revision.

Appendix B
Dear Reviewer,
We have carefully revised our manuscript according to the comments point-by-point
and uploaded the revised version here. The changes are justified as following:
Comment 1: TEM should be added to give further microscopic information.
Response: We have added TEM (Figure 3(a)-(d) and corresponding text) in our
revision.
Comment 2: To understand why the hybrids shows enhanced photoactivity, other
characterizations such photoelectrochemical or photoluminesence spectra analysis
should be added. for example, authors can refer: Small 2017, 13, 1702253;Nanoscale,
2014, 6, 6335-6345
Response: We have added PL analysis and radical-scavenging experiments. The PL
analysis showed that under simulated solar light irradiation, on the interface of TiO2
and TiOF2, the electron–hole recombination is reduced. So theoretically, more h+
radicals can react with H2O or OH- to produce •OH, and more electrons can react with
the dissolved oxygen molecules for yielding superoxide radical anions (O2-•). MB also
can be decomposed by the holes directly. Furthermore, the presence of OH bonds on
the surface of the photocatalyst (FT-IR analysis) and more oxygen vacancy (PL analysis)
also induce the production of more •OH with enhancement of the photocatalytic
performance. The radical-scavenging experiments results showed that h+ was the main
active species in the photocatalytic process, •OH and O2•- radicals also played a role
in the photooxidation of MB. The order of importance of the active species is h+, •OH
and O2•-.
The literature Small 2017, 13, 1702253 and Nanoscale, 2014, 6, 6335-6345 have also
been added(reference [43],[49])
Comment 3: Discussions are too few and authors are encouraged to discuss more
sufficiently.
Response: We have added discussions according to XRD, FT-IR ,UV–vis DRS, XPS
and PL analysis as following:
The electron–hole recombination of TiO2/TiOF2 is reduced, which is consistent with
PL analysis. Under simulated solar light irradiation, more h+ radicals can react with
H2O or OH- to produce •OH, while more electrons can react with the dissolved
oxygen molecules to yield superoxide radical anions (O2•-) [48,49]. MB also can be
decomposed by the holes directly [50]. Because the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 is
better than that of TiOF2, a larger ratio of TiO2/TiOF2 (S2 and OH-S0.5) results in
better photocatalytic activity. NaOH treatment can induce more F ions disconnected
from the surface of TiOF2, which means larger ratio of TiO2/TiOF2 (XRD results).
Furthermore, the presence of OH bonds on the surface of the photocatalyst (FT-IR
analysis) and more oxygen vacancy (XPS and PL analysis) also induce the production
of more •OH with enhancement of the photocatalytic performance. These can explain
why NaOH-treated nanohybrids showed higher performance than un-treated ones.
OH-S0.5 showed the best photocatalytic activity even better than S2 maybe attributed
to its lower recombination rate of electron–hole pairs to introduce more h+ and more
Ti4+ reduced into Ti3+, because its OH, SBET and absorption of light is not the largest
according to FT-IR analysis and UV–vis DRS analysis. So lower electron–hole pairs
recombination rate is the dominant factor that induce the enhancement of TiO2/TiOF2
nanohybrids. This accorded with the radical-scavenging experiments.
Comment 4: English expression can be improved.
Response: We have found English editing serves from to help us to improve English
language and style.
Comment 5: In reference parts, some style mistakes should be carefully checked and
revised.
Response: We have carefully checked the references and revised style mistakes as
much as we can.
Thanks for reminding us. We have learned a lot through the paper submission and
manuscript revision.
