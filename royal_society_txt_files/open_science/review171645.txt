Associate Editor Comments to Author:
I don’t think this manuscript is quite ready for submission yet:
1. The English needs to be edited. And anatomical terms should be defined, described or
diagrammed for a broader audience. For example, when I google “vascular lacunae”, I am not
directed to the trachea, but to an area where the femoral artery connects to the abdomen so a
diagram would be very useful. As would some description of the purported function of the
anotomical features described.
2. In the abstract, the stated results are that the blood spaces (or vascular lacunae) in the trachea
of the dolphin are 12 times larger than those in the cow. In the introduction, they cite other
papers that have already described the size of these spaces in cetaceans so I am not sure if this is
new information? If it is, that needs to be clarified. They go on to say they they would like to
investigate whether these large lacunae are an evolutionary adaptation for diving or allow for
physiological plasticity while diving.
3. In the results, they describe a valve-like structure in half a sentence. This finding, plus the large
lacunae, leads them to conclude that this is evidence of evolutionary adaptation over
physiological plasticity. It is not clear to me how they reach this conclusion. How much about
function can you imply from morphology? They say the mechanics of air flow and oxygen
exchange are beyond the scope of this paper, but has this been described elsewhere for terrestrial
3
species? Would it make for sense to compare these anatomical features in deep versus shallow
diving marine mammals?
4. Bascially, I think the manuscript feels incomplete and needs more work if their findings are
going to stand on their own and contribute to what we know about diving marine mammals.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
I commend the authors for performing a simple and concise investigation such as this. The
importance of comparative anatomy is often overlooked despite often being informative.
Additionally, these poorly studied species require as much attention as possible in order to
establish even the most basic of anatomy that is well known in terrestrial mammals. As such, this
work is important.
However, although the morphometric comparison seems appropriate, my concern is that the
conclusions might be premature and/or unsupported. While I believe it is important to provide
some speculative insights based on the results, I think a deeper literature review and explanation
4
is required in order to make the conclusions and physiologic suggestions more convincing. I
recognize that this was originally written as an abridged publication for submission elsewhere,
but believe that either speculation should be kept to a minimum or explained thoroughly. For
instance, I am not sure that a simple surface area comparison can so confidently
"disqualify...plastic adaptation", though perhaps an explanation of what the authors mean by
"plastic adaptation" may clarify this issue.
Additionally, some of the statements on physiological implications of the lacunae on diving seem
incorrect to me. Though I am not a physiologist, two specific comments and their subsequent
interpretations in the conclusions, drew my attention.
1) p7, lines 168-170: "a reduction in volume of the tracheal lumen results in increased pressure of
the gaseous medium found in the lumen (air), and induces progressive rigidity in the
cartilaginous walls"
This sentence (and the one previous to it) seem to suggest that the blood engorging the lacunae
would pressurize the luminal air. I believe this mechanism to be incorrect. Increasing pressures
during a dive should exert pressure on the air spaces and therefore result in reduction of air
volume (Boyle's Law). In this situation, I believe there are three possible structural options in
response to this volume change, namely a) the trachea can remain rigid and oppose the pressure
(like a submarine) but risk being damaged if overcome by pressure, b) the trachea can collapse to
accommodate the volume change, or c) liquid (i.e. blood) can enter the lumen to replace the
decreasing air volume. Since cetacean airways are relatively rigid (but not consistently across
species or across their length) but are not structurally designed to oppose the full diving pressure,
it is likely that a combination of a) and c) occur. Indeed similar function has been ascribed to the
accessory sinus system and associated pterygoid venous system in cetaceans (Costidis &
Rommel).
2) p8, lines 180-182: The explanation of the function of the venous valves seem incomplete and
possibly incorrect (though further explanation may clarify). The authors suggest that the
engorgement of the lacunae is induced by the venous valves they observed. In addition to being
significant because I believe these to be the first venous valves observed in cetaceans, (systemic
veins in cetaceans do not possess valves like terrestrial mammals), this would suggest that the
proximal veins of this system which are positioned in the trachea, have valves that impede the
flow of blood out of the pulmonary tree. My own research suggests that the main connections of
this venous system to systemic circulation is through a laryngeal/pharyngeal plexus. This would
require blood to flow from the lacunae in the distal bronchi/bronchioles rostrad to the trachea.
Valves in this location would seem counterproductive. Conversely, if the valves are oriented in
the opposite direction in such a way that impedes flow from cranial to caudal (true retrograde
flow), they would not accomplish what the authors suggest as "partial engorgement of the
vascular lacunae INDUCED by venous valves". I suggest the authors clarify the direction of the
valves, whether or not other valves were observed (since they seem to be so rare in cetaceans),
and how they reconcile the seemingly paradoxical issue of having reversed valves along the
major venous outflow tract. I would also suggest that the authors consider (as they allude to
somewhere), that the mechanism for engorgement is not due valves resulting in pressurization
but rather passive redistribution of blood due to changing ambient pressures, as occurs in human
divers in which a liter or more of blood is believed to redistribute to the veins of the thorax
during descent on a dive due to increasing ambient pressures.
I thank the authors for the opportunity to review this manuscript and hope that they find my
comments useful. While I recognize that the English in this manuscript is imperfect, it is adequate
and contains no egregious errors. I find it far superior to many manuscripts I have reviewed that
were generated by native English speakers. (Appendix B)

re: second submission, Manuscript ID RSOS-171317
Dear Editor,
we thank you and the Associate Editor for the careful revision of our manuscript entitled “Vascularization of
the trachea in the bottlenose dolphin: Comparison with bovine and evidence for evolutionary adaptations
to diving”. We believe that some of the points raised during the revision process could indeed lead to an
improvement of our research report and did our best to meet the criticisms.
The reply to each point are written in red and listed below following the same order in which they were
discussed in the editorial e-mail of September 15, 2017.
Comment from the Subject Editor
I take the comments of the AE seriously, and we will entertain a resubmission if they are strongly and
explicitly addressed. Thanks for choosing RSOS and we wish you luck with revising.
We thank both the Subject Editor and Associate Editor for their careful revision of our manuscript. A
detailed description of the changes introduced in the present revised version of the text can be found
below. However, we would like to emphasize that the manuscript was originally submitted to Biology
letters, and was therefore conceived and written in a very concise and abridged form. Obviously, we have
now expanded the text in all its sections and improved the depth of some of the basic concepts, although
this basically remains a short article.
Comments from the Associate Editor
I don’t think this manuscript is quite ready for submission yet:
1. The English needs to be edited. And anatomical terms should be defined, described or diagrammed for a
broader audience. For example, when I google “vascular lacunae”, I am not directed to the trachea, but to
an area where the femoral artery connects to the abdomen so a diagram would be very useful. As would
some description of the purported function of the anatomical features described.

We understand that the Associate Editor here refers to two separate issues: the use of the English language
and the use and nature of the anatomical nomenclature.
For the use of the English language, we have asked a professional to revise our text and the present version
has been modified according to her suggestions.
For the anatomical nomenclature, however, we respectfully disagree with the comment. Although we all
use Google for reference, this search method does not apply here. The term lacunae derives from the Latin
lacuna, ae, that means pool, lake, pod. The adjective vascular indicates that such a pool contains blood and
not lymph, liquor or other biological fluids. The use of anatomical terms in mammals is regulated by the
Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria (NAV, 5th edition, 2012), and in man by the Terminologia Anatomica (2011)
and formerly also by the now obsolete Nomina Anatomica (1989). Lacuna is listed under the heading
Termini Generales at page 2 of NAV (2012). Therefore, the words vascular lacunae correctly indicate a
series of lacunae of vascular nature. The Figure and descriptions in the text should be sufficient to avoid
confusion. However, to further clarify the issue, we have added a few explanatory words at line 50.
2. In the abstract, the stated results are that the blood spaces (or vascular lacunae) in the trachea of the
dolphin are 12 times larger than those in the cow. In the introduction, they cite other papers that have
already described the size of these spaces in cetaceans so I am not sure if this is new information? If it is,
that needs to be clarified. They go on to say they would like to investigate whether these large lacunae are
an evolutionary adaptation for diving or allow for physiological plasticity while diving.
Vascular lacunae were first described by our group in the trachea of the striped dolphin Stenella
coeruleoalba (Cozzi et al., 2005) and bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus (Bagnoli et al., 2011). They were
subsequently identified also in the trachea of the pigmy sperm whale Kogia breviceps (Davenport et al.,
2013). These reports described the presence of said structures, but a) did not quantify their size; and b) did
not compare their extension and capacity with those of any terrestrial mammal, including the closely
related terrestrial Cetartiodactyla. This is precisely the aim of the present work. To further clarify the
objective and purposes of the present article we modified the Abstract and Introduction to emphasize the
novel findings reported here.
3. In the results, they describe a valve-like structure in half a sentence. This finding, plus the large lacunae,
leads them to conclude that this is evidence of evolutionary adaptation over physiological plasticity. It is not
clear to me how they reach this conclusion. How much about function can you imply from morphology?
They say the mechanics of air flow and oxygen exchange are beyond the scope of this paper, but has this
been described elsewhere for terrestrial species? Would it make for sense to compare these anatomical
features in deep versus shallow diving marine mammals?
Thanks to this useful comment we were able to expand the Discussion. The presence and functional
significance of the valves are now discussed in more detail (see lines 161 and following).

4. Basically, I think the manuscript feels incomplete and needs more work if their findings are going to
stand on their own and contribute to what we know about diving marine mammals.
As we stated earlier in our Response to the Reviewers, the original manuscript was planned as a short
report. We hope that the present revised version will meet the standards indicated by the Associate Editor
for Royal Society Open Science.

Editorial Office
re: second submission, Manuscript ID RSOS-171645
Dear Editor,
we thank the Associate Editor and the Reviewer for the careful revision of our manuscript entitled
“Vascularization of the trachea in the bottlenose dolphin: Comparison with bovine and evidence for
evolutionary adaptations to diving”. We believe that some of the points raised during the revision process
could indeed lead to an improvement of our research report and did our best to meet the criticisms.
The reply to each point are written in red and listed below following the same order in which they were
discussed in the editorial e-mail of February 23, 2018.
General comments from Reviewer # 1
<U+F0B7> I commend the authors for performing a simple and concise investigation such as this. The
importance of comparative anatomy is often overlooked despite often being informative.
Additionally, these poorly studied species require as much attention as possible in order to
establish even the most basic of anatomy that is well known in terrestrial mammals. As such, this
work is important.
Thank you
<U+F0B7> However, although the morphometric comparison seems appropriate, my concern is that the
conclusions might be premature and/or unsupported. While I believe it is important to provide
some speculative insights based on the results, I think a deeper literature review and explanation is
required in order to make the conclusions and physiologic suggestions more convincing. I recognize
that this was originally written as an abridged publication for submission elsewhere, but believe
that either speculation should be kept to a minimum or explained thoroughly. For instance, I am
not sure that a simple surface area comparison can so confidently "disqualify...plastic adaptation",
though perhaps an explanation of what the authors mean by "plastic adaptation" may clarify this
issue.
We thank the Reviewer for the comments on our work. We have re-shaped the text in many parts to match
the criticisms. A detailed list of the changes is reported below under the heading “Specific comments from
the Reviewer # 1”. Since several specific comments contain and expand the observation reported above,
our changes were directed to answer both general and specific comments.
<U+F0B7> Additionally, some of the statements on physiological implications of the lacunae on diving seem
incorrect to me. Though I am not a physiologist, two specific comments and their subsequent
interpretations in the conclusions, drew my attention.
<U+F0B7> p7, lines 168-170: "a reduction in volume of the tracheal lumen results in increased pressure of the
gaseous medium found in the lumen (air), and induces progressive rigidity in the cartilaginous
DIPARTIMENTO DI BIOMEDICINA COMPARATA E

walls" This sentence (and the one previous to it) seem to suggest that the blood engorging the
lacunae would pressurize the luminal air. I believe this mechanism to be incorrect. Increasing
pressures during a dive should exert pressure on the air spaces and therefore result in reduction of
air volume (Boyle's Law). In this situation, I believe there are three possible structural options in
response to this volume change, namely a) the trachea can remain rigid and oppose the pressure
(like a submarine) but risk being damaged if overcome by pressure, b) the trachea can collapse to
accommodate the volume change, or c) liquid (i.e. blood) can enter the lumen to replace the
decreasing air volume. Since cetacean airways are relatively rigid (but not consistently across
species or across their length) but are not structurally designed to oppose the full diving pressure, it
is likely that a combination of a) and c) occur. Indeed similar function has been ascribed to the
accessory sinus system and associated pterygoid venous system in cetaceans (Costidis & Rommel).
We partially agree with the meaningful observation by the Reviewer. Increased external pressure
during descent results into an increase of intra-thoracic pressure (through a series of mechanisms
perhaps too long to recall here) and this increase exerts further pressure on the tracheal walls. The
dolphin trachea is more rigid than the human and does not fold upon itself (human: see Lindholm and
Nyren, Eur J Appl Physiol 2005 94, 646-651, check Figure 3c). In the dolphin, increased pressure induces
only partial loss of shape, due to higher rigidity of the walls, and the specific condition of high density of
the trapped air that behaves (somewhat) like a liquid (for demonstration see Bagnoli et al., , J
Biomechanics 2011 44, 1040-1045, Figure 5 where the dolphin and the goat tracheas are compared). In
the latter paper Bagnoli et al. at page 1044, based on extensive biomechanical lab tests, state that:
“contrarily to what is observed in terrestrial mammals, our evidences indicate that the tracheo-
bronchial tree of the bottlenose dolphin, short and quite uniform in structure and mechanical
properties, better resists external pressure because of the stiffer cartilage tissue”. So the dolphin
trachea does not collapse (Reviewer possibility b). The trachea, matter of fact, remains only partially
rigid, but is not damaged by external pressure (part of the Reviewer hypothesis a). The question of
liquid entering the trachea (Reviewer hypothesis c) is fascinating, and we considered it several times as
a potential real situation in cetaceans. Anecdotal evidence suggest that some high-profile human
breath-holding divers do indeed fill their air sinuses with water to avoid damage to the mucosa and
diminish the volume of air spaces to equalize during descent. However there is no published proof of
water filling the superior (= upper) airways of dolphins. In the already quoted Bagnoli paper,
bioengineering evidences indicate that at a certain pressure, and consequent density, air acquires some
of the properties of a liquid. We wouldn’t go further than that.
So we consider that the text contained factual information based on the existing literature. However,
since we always welcome a (partially) different and valuable opinion, we changed the text that in the
present version contains reference to the Costidis and Rommel J Morphol 277 (2016) article and the
situation of accessory sinus system, although the paper discusses a different family of cetaceans and
vascular structures of a different nature and rigidity. We also re-shaped the sentence so that “…induces
progressive rigidity in the cartilaginous walls" has been changed into “…increases the robustness of the
structure”, a literal quote from the cited Bagnoli et al paper.
<U+F0B7> 2) p8, lines 180-182: The explanation of the function of the venous valves seem incomplete and
possibly incorrect (though further explanation may clarify). The authors suggest that the
engorgement of the lacunae is induced by the venous valves they observed. In addition to being
significant because I believe these to be the first venous valves observed in cetaceans, (systemic
veins in cetaceans do not possess valves like terrestrial mammals), this would suggest that the
proximal veins of this system which are positioned in the trachea, have valves that impede the flow
DIPARTIMENTO DI BIOMEDICINA COMPARATA E

of blood out of the pulmonary tree. My own research suggests that the main connections of this
venous system to systemic circulation is through a laryngeal/pharyngeal plexus. This would require
blood to flow from the lacunae in the distal bronchi/bronchioles rostrad to the trachea. Valves in
this location would seem counterproductive. Conversely, if the valves are oriented in the opposite
direction in such a way that impedes flow from cranial to caudal (true retrograde flow), they would
not accomplish what the authors suggest as "partial engorgement of the vascular lacunae INDUCED
by venous valves". I suggest the authors clarify the direction of the valves, whether or not other
valves were observed (since they seem to be so rare in cetaceans), and how they reconcile the
seemingly paradoxical issue of having reversed valves along the major venous outflow tract. I
would also suggest that the authors consider (as they allude to somewhere), that the mechanism
for engorgement is not due valves resulting in pressurization but rather passive redistribution of
blood due to changing ambient pressures, as occurs in human divers in which a liter or more of
blood is believed to redistribute to the veins of the thorax during descent on a dive due to
increasing ambient pressures.
We are especially thankful to the Reviewer for this extremely interesting and pertinent comment. We
completely re-shaped the sentence and inserted some of the elements suggested by the Reviewer in
the present version of the text. We are unable to add any evidence on the direction of the flow, so
some of the questions raised remain open.
Specific comments from the Reviewer # 1
The comments of the Reviewer are contained in “sticky notes” attached to the pdf of the text. We
answered them in the order they appear in the manuscript. Please note that the line numbers reported
here refer to the former version of the manuscript, to which the “sticky notes” were attached.
<U+F0B7> Note to line 28
We substituted “corresponding” with “homologous”, as suggested, thank you
<U+F0B7> Note to line 33
We have re-shaped the Abstract following some of the suggestions detailed below
<U+F0B7> Note to line 42 (first note)
The Reviewer points out that the reduced length of the trachea is not an adaptation to aquatic life. We
added “following shortening of the neck” to better specify what we are referring to when discussing marine
Cetartiodactyla
<U+F0B7> Note to line 42 (second note)
The Reviewer is right! Excessive shortening of the text took out part of the explanation. We changed the
text adding precise details (after all the first modern description of the dolphin trachea and its lacunae has
been made by the AA. of the present manuscript).
<U+F0B7> Note to line 44
The text has been changed following the suggestions contained in the previous note, thank you

Tel. 049-8272600/2601 fax 049-8272604
We agree with the comment of the Reviewer, and in in fact several aspects of the morphology of the
respiratory apparatus of dolphins are closer to Perissodactyla than to terrestrial Cetartiodactyla (and that
applies to the placenta and female genital apparatus as well). We added a line
<U+F0B7> Note to line 47
We did as suggested, thank you
<U+F0B7> Note to line 49
We did as suggested, thank you
<U+F0B7> Note to line 51
The term “extensive” was added in response to a formed observation formulated during the revision of the
present paper. What we meant is that if there is a diffuse innervation, then there is a function for the
intramural neurons and nerves in the control of the vascular structure. We re-shaped the sentence and
removed references to a direct role in the filling of the lacunae, thus living it open as to the precise
mechanism at play. We are afraid that, given the available data, we cannot support any more advanced
hypothesis.
<U+F0B7> Note to line 56
We agree with the comment from the Reviewer. Here we are not talking about the lungs, but – as specified
in line 56 – we are describing a respiratory dead space. Absorption of inert gasses during breath-holding
descent should be continuous and physiologically parallel to increases of external pressure. During ascent,
the decrease of external pressure promotes liberation of inert gas into the venous blood. The problem
comes when nitrogen comes out faster that the ideal condition of equilibrium, and potential bubbles are
created either in the blood stream or within the tissues. In breath-holding dives, inert gasses cannot reach a
pressure higher than the one they had on the surface – and thus they constitute potentially no hazard. But
under conditions of extreme and fast diving (like in breath-holding human champion athletes performing
repetitive deep dives without the necessary surface interval), gas may be released either into the blood
stream or in crucial tissues faster than the ability to remove them. This is the base of decompression
sickness in apnea divers and may lead to CNS injuries. The wrong (now corrected) sentence originated from
cut-and-paste of two opposite periods.
<U+F0B7> Note to line 65
We understand the point, and re-shaped the last sentence, hopefully thus answering the query.
<U+F0B7> Note to line 86
We did as suggested, than you
<U+F0B7> Note to line 88
We are in difficulty here, as the sentence was added in response to a specific comment made by the initial
Reviewer of the article. In the present version we substituted “arteries” with “vessels”, hoping thus to solve
the conflict due to potentially contrasting comments.
<U+F0B7> Note to line 123
The whole subject is discussed in more detail (and with the proper quote) in lines 159 and following.

<U+F0B7> Note to line 124
The Reviewer is right, we meant “submucosa”, not “mucosa” and corrected accordingly.
<U+F0B7> Note to line 137 (first note)
The Reviewer is correct
<U+F0B7> Note to line 137 (second note)
We do not fully share the Reviewer’s opinion (when cervical vertebrae are fused there cannot be any
mobility). However, since suggestions are always welcome, we changed the text as suggested.
<U+F0B7> Note to line 141 (first note)
We corrected as suggested, thank you
<U+F0B7> Note to line 141 (second note)
We removed “and established” as suggested
<U+F0B7> Note to line 143
The reference to physiological plasticity is contained in the quoted reference ([10], Fahlman et al, J Exp Biol
2017, page 1763, second paragraph of the first column, where the concept is explained in same details. We
in fact agree with the Reviewer that such plasticity is an individual-specific modification, and added
“individual” to the text. We thought the concept was clear, but gladly welcome the suggestion.
<U+F0B7> Note to line 149
We do not fully understand the comment. What we meant is that since there is no muscle, the need for the
local blood supply should diminish, not increase. We added a sentence hoping that this is the expected
correction
<U+F0B7> Note to line 151
We rephrased the sentence
<U+F0B7> Note to line 153
We substituted disqualify ”with “strongly suggests”, as indicated by the Reviewer
<U+F0B7> Note to line 156
We substituted “an active” with “a passive”, as suggested by the useful comment of the Reviewer
<U+F0B7> Note to line 163
We do not fully understand the comment. We saw that some veins are connected to the vascular lacunae,
(see Figure 1f) and consider that they most likely either drain them or belong to the same network. We
believe that they are part of the same system. We re-shaped the sentence hoping to answer the query.
<U+F0B7> Note to line 164
We changed as suggested

<U+F0B7> Note to line 166
We removed “active”
<U+F0B7> Note to line 169
See the General comments for detailed explanation of the changes. We added a new sentence and
softened the tone
<U+F0B7> Note to line 171
We substituted “rich” with “elaborate” as suggested
<U+F0B7> Note to line 173
We substituted “collapse” with “compression”
<U+F0B7> Note to line 176
We changed as suggested
<U+F0B7> Note to line 180
Our previous (and widely reported) work demonstrated the hypothesis outlined here. However, we
softened the tone of the sentence as suggested
<U+F0B7> Note to line 188
We thank the Reviewer and removed “rapidly” as suggested, because indeed venous outflow is not fast.
Please see also the second general comment by the Reviewer. The whole sentence has been completely re-
shaped, modified and expanded to accommodate several elements contained in the observation of the
Reviewer.
We thank Reviewer # 1 for the thorough revision of our manuscript, and the many useful comments that
definitely improved the quality of our text.

sincerely yours
