This review is basically a list of cyclization reactions brought about by treating various
heteroatom-substituted compounds with MeOSO3CF3 in the presence of compounds containing
triple or double bonds.
The quality of the English is poor and I am sending as an attachment a scan of a partially
corrected copy (Appendix A).
My overall impression is that the presentation lacks much intellectual content--it is simply a list
illustrated by exemplary equations. I think the work is more appropriate for a journal that
specializes in heterocycles; the readers of such journals would have the motivation to examine the
document. As far as I can make out from the on-line information about the journal the present
type of review is outside the scope of the Royal Society Open Science Journal.

The manuscript is a brief review of the triflate (ROTf)-induced reactions of heteroatom reagents
and unsaturated substrates to afford cyclic compounds.
In general, it is poorly written and the standard of English is disappointing. There is no original
science in the paper, since it is a review - was it an invited review?
The literature coverage is not sufficiently comprehensive to be a full review.
Taking all these factors into account, I cannot recommend acceptance.

This review manuscript from Zou et al. gives an overview of the use of alkyltriflates for activation
of cationic pathways to promote a number of cascade processes. This mini-review covers a
number of transformations, which usually result in the formation of cyclic products, discussing
aspects of the substrate scope, giving examples and highlighting probable mechanistic pathways.
Unfortunately, the manuscript is lacking somewhat in the introductory content; the background
and prior art is not discussed in any great detail and the topic of the review is not surmised
particularly well. There are also numerous errors in the schemes as well as the text. The work
discussed within the review itself, albeit interesting, is also very niche. There are only a few
examples presented and only 11 papers cited, the vast majority of which are from the authors
own group. Hence, I do not find this work of sufficient value for publication in Royal Society
Open Science.

Comments to the Author:
It is clear from the referee reports that the authors' presentation in this invited review has missed
the mark. I agree with the referees that the language should be improved. However, I do disagree
with the manner in which some of the criticisms were presented (particularly Referee 1).
Nevertheless, the overall criticisms are valid.

As this was an invited review I would welcome a resubmission of a substantially revised
manuscript that takes into account the criticisms raised by all three referees. Also, I strongly
suggest modifying the text in such a way that it is more than just a list of what has been done. Are
there obvious deficiencies in the literature that could be addressed by future researchers? Are
there cases where these methods are dramatically better than alternatives? Where will we see the
next advances in this area?

should be improved. However, I do disagree with the manner in which some of
the criticisms were presented (particularly Referee 1). Nevertheless, the overall

Answer:
1. We reorganized the manuscript and addressed ROTf-induced
annulation as metal-free methods for synthesis of heterocycles.
In addition, a variety of relative literatures has been discussed
and reaction pathways have been described.
2. Transition-metal-catalyzed reactions are some of the most
attractive methodologies for synthesizing heterocycles, since a
transition-metal-catalyzed reaction can directly construct
complicated molecules from readily accessible starting
materials under mild conditions. Nevertheless, transition-metal-
catalyzed reactions are still limited in applications and confront
challenges to some extent, since transition-metals are expensive,
toxic, inconvenient for operation, and environment damage. In
this regard, ROTf-induced cyclization featuring metal-free,
easy to handle, and good selectivity provided a feasible approach
to diverse cyclic compounds. We mentioned them in the
introduction part.
3. Although ROTf-induced annulation as metal-free methods for
synthesis of heterocycles has been summarized, further
exploration is required for the utilization of functionalized
ROTf reagents and other heteroatom reagents such as
organoselenium, organophosphorus substrates for synthesis of
functionalized compounds. Furthermore, four-member ring
intermediates proposed to elucidate surprising rearrangements
still needs firm evidence. We mentioned them in the conclusion
and outlook’s part.

1. Summary
The development of metal-free organic reactions is one of the hotspots in the
synthesis of cyclic compounds. ROTf (alkyl trifluoromethanesulfonates), due to
their good electrophilicity are powerful alkylating reagents at heteroatom such as
nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus to induce an electrophilic center for
carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatom bond formation. Inspired by this chemistry, a
variety of researches concentrating on heterocycles synthesis has been carried out.
In this review, we mainly summarize the ROTf-induced annulation of heteroatom
reagents such as nitriles, carbodiimides, azobenzenes, isothiocyanates, aldehydes,
isocyanates, and phosphaalkene with themselves or alkynes to afford cyclic
compounds.

2. Introduction
Heterocycles are ubiquitous in natural products,
pharmaceuticals, organic materials, and numerous functional
molecules. Therefore, organic chemists have been making extensive
efforts to produce these heterocyclic compounds by developing new and
efficient synthetic transformations. Transition-metal-catalyzed
reactions are some of the most attractive methodologies for synthesizing
heterocycles, since a transition-metal-catalyzed reaction can directly
construct complicated molecules from readily accessible starting
materials under mild conditions.[1] Nevertheless, transition-metal-
catalyzed reactions are still limited in applications and confront
challenges to some extent, since transition-metals are expensive, toxic,
inconvenient for operation, and environment damage. In this regard, a
transition metal-free methodology for the construction of an important
heterocyclic compounds in drug discovery and material science has
attracted attention [2].
ROTf (alkyl trifluoromethanesulfonates) are powerful alkylating
reagents, which are frequently utilized in alkylation of nucleophiles [3].
Benefit from fluorine in –OTf to stabilize the negative charge, –OTf
possess excellent leaving ability, which make the ROTf much more
reactive as alkylation reagents than alkyl iodide and (MeO)2SO2. As
useful and versatile precursors in a variety of organic transformations,
many methods have been developed to prepare ROTf, such as reaction
of orthoformates and triflic anhydrides under solvent-free condition [4].

The intrinsic electrophilicity of ROTf is often used as alkylation
reagents for diverse substrates containing heteroatoms such as P [5], O
[6], N [7-9], S [10,11], Te [12], Ge [13], Bi [14], Si [15], and Se [16,17],
which straightforwardly afforded the corresponding alkylated products
with aid of base or stable triflates irreversibly that even could be applied
as ionic liquids [18,19]. Moreover, the resulting triflates could be further
transformed to other products by substitution [20] (Scheme 1, a). On the
other hand, unsaturated heteroatom-containing reagents, such as nitriles,
aldehydes, isocyanates, and isothiocyanates, could be captured by ROTf
to generate electrophiles bearing carbon cations [7,9,21], which could
be subsequently reacted with appropriate unsaturated substrates to
produce cyclic compounds by tandem electrophilic
reactions/cyclization (Scheme 1, b). ROTf-induced cyclization
featuring metal-free, easy to handle, and good selectivity provided a
feasible approach to diverse cyclic compounds. In this review, we
mainly focus on the ROTf-induced annulation of unsaturated
heteroatom reagents such as nitriles, carbodiimides, azobenzenes,
isothiocyanates, aldehydes, isocyanates, and phosphaalkene with
themselves or alkynes to afford cyclic compounds.

3.1 ROTf-induced annulation of nitriles
Nitriles as unsaturated heteroatom reagents could react with ROTf to
form N-alkylated nitriliums, which were well investigated by Booth [9]
in 1980. However, electrophilicity of N-alkylated nitriliums has rarely
been utilized in further reactions until recently. In 2014, our group [22]
reported MeOTf-induced carboannulation of arylnitriles and aromatic
alkynes to construct indenones 1 (Scheme 2). Triflate 3 was isolated
when 5-decyne was used indicating I-1 might be an intermediate in this
reaction. A range of functionalized indenone derivatives was obtained.
When ortho-substituted arylnitriles were utilized, indenone imine I-2
would further cyclize with another molecule of nitriliums to give
indeno[1,2-c]-isoquinolines 2 with construction of one carbocycle and

one heterocycle. Although transition-metal-catalyzed annulation of
benzimide or arylcarbonyl and arylnitrile with alkynes to formation of
indenones has been reported [23], this reaction reveals a simple reaction
process for the synthesis of indenones under metal-free.
Scheme 2. MeOTf-induced cyclization of arylnitriles and alkynes.

Arylnitriles and alkynes could be induced by MeOTf to afford
indenones via intermediate I-5. We envisioned the utilization of
alkylnitriles, which lack an aryl group for the ring closure, might lead
to a different way for ring formation. To our delight, reaction of
alkylnitriles, alkynes, and MeOTf indeed afforded tetrasubstituted NH-
pyrroles 4 with high regioselectivity. The structure includes one carbon
from ROTf to join the pyrroles [24] (Scheme 3). It is noteworthy that
the cyclized pyrrole captures another nitrilium leading to substituted 2-
acyl-NH-pyrroles after hydrolysis. When EtOTf was utilized instead of
MeOTf, the product 5 was obtained. This reaction provides a practical
and convenient method for the synthesis of multiply substituted 2-
acylpyrroles from readily available starting materials in a one-pot
reaction.

Furthermore, when 1,2-diphenylethyne and 1,2-di-p-tolylethyne
were employed to react with MeOTf and alkylnitriles at 130 oC , the
isoquinolines 6 were obtained in good yields via intermediate I-9. The
representative results are summarized in Scheme 4. In the cases, the
Friede-Crafts reaction is favour to give 6-membered products

diarylalkynes
3.2 ROTf-induced annulation of carbodiimides
More recently, ROTf-induced electrophilic cyclization was
extended to carbodiimides. Our group demonstrated an efficient ROTf-
triggered intermolecular cyclization of carbodiimides to afford a range
of 2-amino-4-imino-quinazolines 7, 2-aminoquinazolinones 8, and 2,4-
diaminoquinazolines 9, respectively, which are important motifs in
pharmaceuticals [25]. When N,N'-diarylcarbodiimides were employed,
the reaction proceeded smoothly to afford the corresponding 2-amino-
4-imino-quinazolines 7, which could be hydrolyzed to generate the
R. Soc. open sci.
R. Soc. open sci. article template
11
corresponding 2-aminoquinazolinones 8. The representative results are
shown in Scheme 5.
Scheme 5. R'OTf-induced cyclization of diarylcarbodiimides
To further extend the substrate scope, a combination of two
different carbodiimides has been achieved. A range of
diarylcarbodiimides and dialkylcarbodiimides was investigated under
the optimized the reaction condition. The representative results are
shown in Scheme 6. A plausible mechanism was proposed. First, the
carbodiimide is methylated by MeOTf and subsequently attacked by
another molecule of carbodiimide to give intermediate I-11. Then,
R. Soc. open sci.
intramolecular nucleophilic attack takes place to afford the four-
membered intermediate I-12, which generates carbenium I-13 after ring
opening via C-N bond cleavage. Finally, intramolecular Friedel-Crafts
annulation occurs to form the corresponding quinazolinone imine 7,
which could give 2,4-diamino-quinazoline 9 (R = alkyl group) and 2-
amino-quinazolinone 8 (R = aryl group) after hydrolysis. This
annulation reaction appears a general entry to the synthesis of 2-amino-
quinazolinones and 2,4-diamino-quinazolines in one-pot under metal-
free.

3.3 ROTf-induced annulation of azobenzenes
Apart from nitriles and carbodiimides, azobenzenes are also
significant nitrogen-containing compounds, which possess Lewis
alkalinity. In 2014, we demonstrated MeOTf-induced cyclization of
azobenzenes by N=N bond cleavage with aid of TCQ (tetrachloro-1,4-
benzoquinone) as oxidant to afford N-arylbenzimidazoles 10 [26]
(Scheme 7). When unsymmetrical azobenzenes were used, cyclization
tends to occur on the electron-rich anisolyl ring (10e-10g). EtOTf could
facilitate N=N bond cleavage as well to generate 2-
methylbenzimidazole 10h. Although the reaction mechanism is not
clear, a plausible mechanism is shown in Scheme 7. The carbon atom
from MeOTf inserts into the N=N bond and then cyclization to form N-
arylbenzimidazole. This is the first example of N=N bond cleavage by
a light main group element.

4. ROTf-induced annulation of sulfur-containing substrates with
alkynes
4.1 ROTf-induced annulation of arylisothiocyanates
R. Soc. open sci.
The isothiocyanates possess the chemical group –N=C=S, which
represents versatile reactivity in the synthesis of nitrogen- or sulfur-
containing heterocycles. Comparatively speaking, the sulfur atom is
strongly nucleophilic. Recently, we reported MeOTf as an electrophile
[27] to react with aryisothiocyanates and alkynes leading to diverse
highly substituted quinolones. The representative results are shown in
Scheme 8. A tandem electrophilic activation/cyclization via
intermediate I-18 is believed to be a possible process. This reaction
demonstrated superiority on substrate scope for isothiocyanates.
Furthermore, unsymmetrical alkynes such as terminal alkynes,
(bromoethynyl) benzenes, even alkynes containing ester group could be
applied in this reaction. In addition, alkyltriflates bearing C-C triple
bond gave polycyclic quinolines 11d via sequent cyclization process.
Great effort has been paid in transformation of thioalkoxyl group such
as oxidation, reduction, and cross-coupling reaction, which make this
method more powerful in organic synthesis [27]. This reaction
represents a concise, metal-free, and one-pot method for synthesis of
functionalized quinolines.

4.2 ROTf-induced annulation of alkylisothiocyanates
Substitution of arylisothiocyanates with alkylisothiocyanates
that lack an aryl group for the ring closure, might lead to a new reaction
mode. To our delight, the reaction proceeded well to afford indenone 12
after hydrolysis [28]. A range of arylalkynes could be employed in this
reaction. The representative results are summarized in Scheme 9. A
plausible mechanism is also described in Scheme 9. MeOTf as an
electrophile reacts with isothiocyanate to form methylthio-substituted
carbenium ion I-19, which followed the reaction with arylalkyne to
form intermediate I-20. Utilization of the arylisothiocyanate affords
R. Soc. open sci.
quinoline 11. Without aryl group in the alkylisothiocyanate, the
nucleophilicity-strong sulfur atom attacks carbenium of I-20 to form
four-membered thiete I-21, which could be followed by ring opening
with the C-S bond cleavage to form carbenium I-23 via intermediate I-
22. Finally, intramolecular Friedel-Crafts reaction of I-23 affords
indenone imine I-24, which undergoes hydrolysis to form indenone 12.
This reaction represents the first example of cleavage C-S bond in the
isothiocyanate for construction of the carbocyclic compound under
metal-free.

More recently, Li and co-workers [29] reported MeOTf-induced
intramolecular cyclization of isothiocyanates to afford 1-(methylthio)-
3,4-dihydroisoquinolines 13 (Scheme 10). The reaction may process by
a tandem electrophilic activation and intramolecular Friedel-Crafts
reaction.

isothiocyanates.
5. ROTf-induced annulation of oxygen-containing substrates
5.1 ROTf-induced annulation of aldehydes
Apart from S- and N-reagents that could react with ROTf
straightforwardly, O –reagents also demonstrated good affinity with
ROTf. As a part of ongoing projects on the alkyltriflate-triggered
annulation, a reaction of MeOTf, aldehydes, and arylalkynes was
investigated [30] and a variety of 2,3-disubstituted 1-indanones was
obtained. The representative results are shown in Scheme 11. It is
noteworthy that a catalytic amount of MeOTf was employed and the
reaction proceeded in satisfactory yield. Although the reaction
R. Soc. open sci.
R. Soc. open sci. article template
21
mechanism is not clean, a plausible mechanism is shown in the bottom
of Scheme 11. First, MeOTf as an electrophile reacts with aldehyde to
afford the oxonium I-25, which couples with alkyne to form the highly
active oxetenium intermediate I-26 via [2+2] cycloaddition. Then, the
intermediate I-26 undergoes spontaneous isomerization to form the 4p-
Nazarov intermediate I-27, followed by Nazarov cyclization to give 1-
indanone 14 and regeneration of MeOTf. This reaction provides a
practical and convenient method for the synthesis of 2,3-disubstituted
1-indanones from readily available starting materials via MeOTf-
induced catalysis.

5.2 ROTf-induced annulation of arylisocyanates
Isocyanate is the functional group with the formula R-N=C=O,
in which N and O may both be alkylated by ROTf. We investigated a

reaction of MeOTf, arylisocyanates, and arylalkynes [31]. Notably, a
range of 4-methoxyl-2,3-diarylquinolines 15 was obtained in good
yields and the representative results are shown in Scheme 12. Based on
the results, a tandem [2+2] cycloaddition and intramolecular Friedel-
Crafts reaction may be included in the reaction pathway. It is
noteworthy that this reaction has limitations with only diarylalkynes and
MeOTf for the construction of 4-methoxyl-2,3-diarylquinolines 15.
Scheme 12. MeOTf-induced cyclization of arylisocyanates and
arylalkynes.

Phenanthridinones are extensively found in natural products and
bioactive molecules. We envisioned that MeOTf-induced
intramolecular annulation of 2-phenyl aryllisocyanates would provide a
pathway for the synthesis of phenanthridinones. During the course of
our study on the CO2 chemistry [32], we found a one-pot method for the
synthesis of phenanthridinones [33] based on the MeOTf- and TBD-
mediated carbonylation of ortho-arylanilines with CO2. The
representative results and reaction pathway are shown in Scheme 13.
This reaction shows MeOTf-induced carbonylation reaction of o-
arylanilines applying CO2 as the ideal carbonyl source to synthesize
phenanthridinones containing a free (NH)-lactam motif under metal-
free conditions.

In 2006, Gates and co-workers [34] utilized the strong
electrophilicity of MeOTf in the synthesis of highly strained four-
membered phosphorus heterocycles with phosphaalkenes as precursor
(Scheme 14). The structure of the unprecedented diphosphetanium salt
17 was identified by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Although the
reaction mechanism is not clean, this reaction demonstrated a
convenient method for synthesis of highly strained phosphorus

heterocycles, which may be used as a propagating species in the cationic
polymerization of phosphaalkenes.

7. Conclusion and future outlook
ROTf has been a powerful reagent in organic synthesis featuring
efficient, metal-free, and easy of handing. A range of heteroatom-
containing unsaturated reagents such as nitriles, carbodiimides,
azobenzenes, isothiocyanates, aldehydes, isocyanates, and
phosphaalkene could be alkylated by the ROTf to generate reactive
intermediates, which are capable of capturing other electrophilic
substrates to afford cyclic compounds with a rational design. The
synthetic methodology to various carbocyclic and heterocyclic
compounds has been widely developed. Although ROTf has exhibited
great value for the synthesis of cyclic compounds, further exploration is
required for the utilization of functionalized ROTf reagents and other
heteroatom reagents such as organoselenium, organophosphorus
substrates for synthesis of functionalized compounds. Furthermore,
four-member ring intermediates proposed to elucidate surprising
rearrangements still needs firm evidence. We anticipate that ROTf can
be extended to more organic reactions in organic synthesis.

Comments to the Author(s)
This resubmitted manuscript is significantly improved from it's
previous form and the authors have addressed the majority of the
issues risen by the reviewers on the initial submission. I do think that
the document is somewhat lacking in the conclusions section, it would
be better to see more of a comparative summary which highlights the
benefits of these methodologies over the current state-of-the-art. Why
is this approach better? What unique reactivities are there? Does the
methodology provide access to unique architectures? Where will these
methodologies lead in the future?
As this is an invited review I am inclined to accept this minireview
with the caveat that the authors expand somewhat upon their closing
remarks.
Why is this approach better?
Answer:
Heterocycles are ubiquitous in natural products, pharmaceuticals,
organic materials, and numerous functional molecules. Therefore,
organic chemists have been making extensive efforts to produce these
heterocyclic compounds by developing new and efficient synthetic
transformations. Recently, transition-metal-catalyzed reactions are one
of the attractive methodologies for synthesizing heterocycles, however,
transition-metal-catalyzed reactions are still limited in applications and
confront challenges to some extent, since transition-metals are
expensive, toxic, inconvenient for operation, and environment damage.
In this regard, a transition metal-free methodology for the construction
of an important heterocyclic compounds in drug discovery and material
science has attracted attention. ROTf (alkyl trifluoromethanesulfonates)
are powerful alkylating reagents for diverse substrates containing
heteroatoms. The resulting triflates could be further transformed to other
products by substitution/addition/cyclization. In addition,construction
of heterocycles using ROTf is featuring efficient, metal-free, and easy
of handing. These points are mentioned in the introduction and
conclusion parts of revision
What unique reactivities are there?
Answer:
ROTf-induced cyclization featuring metal-free, easy to handle,
and good selectivity provided a feasible approach to diverse cyclic
compounds. These points are mentioned in the end of introduction
part.
Does the methodology provide access to unique architectures?
Answer:
ROTf-induced annulation could provide various 5- and 6-
membered heterocycles, most of them are important ubiquitous in
natural products, pharmaceuticals, organic materials. For example,
ROTf-triggered intermolecular cyclization of carbodiimides to provide
2-aminoquinazolinones and 2,4-diaminoquinazolines, which possess
vital pharmacological activity. One more example is that MeOTf-
induced direct cleavage of the N=N bond of azobenzenes leading to N-
arylbenzimidazoles. In this reaction, the methyl carbon atom inserts into
the N=N bond to form N-arylbenzimidazoles via cleavage of the N=N
bond and two sp3 C–H bonds as well as one sp2 C–H bond and
meanwhile formation of three C–N bonds without the assistance of any
metals or metalloids. The examples are mentioned in the text.
Where will these methodologies lead in the future?
Answer:
ROTf has been a powerful reagent in organic synthesis featuring
efficient, metal-free, and easy of handing.
Although ROTf has exhibited great value for the synthesis of cyclic
compounds, further exploration is required for the utilization of
functionalized ROTf reagents and other heteroatom reagents such as
organoselenium, organophosphorus substrates for synthesis of
functionalized compounds.
Among the utilization of carboncations, ROTf induced unsaturated
heteroatom-containing reagents to generate electrophiles bearing
carboncations, which could be involved new approaches in the synthesis
of heterocycles under mild and metal-free conditions.
ROTf-induced [2+2] cycloaddition to afford four-member ring
intermediates proposed to elucidate surprising rearrangements still
needs firm evidence.
These points are mentioned in the conclusion and future outlook
part.
