The study is a comparative set of experiments between a linear delta wing and a nonlinear wing
shape inspired by a swift. The experiments appear to be of high quality and properly performed,
and the article is well-written. The findings of this study are expected to be a valuable
contribution to the overall understanding of unsteady flight aerodynamics. However, some
recommendations and questions have been identified during the review of the manuscript.
Therefore, major revisions are recommended prior to recommending this manuscript for
publication.
General comments
================
For two-dimensional data the various vortex identification methods are essentially equivalent to
determine the presence of a vortex (Jeong and Hussain, 1995). It is recommended to provide the
rationale for reporting the results of two alternative vortex identification methods, and what
difference between the Q-criterion and the swirling strength might physically imply. There is
commentary of why vorticity and Q-criterion/swirling strength should both be assessed (Line
178), but clarification on the distinct interpretations of the Q-criterion and swirling strength
would be useful.
There is discussion in the Introduction of how some fliers have unsteady or steady leading edge
vortices. However, all of the results in this study seem to be based on averaged values. It is
recommended to add some details about the unsteady characteristics of the flow. For example,
does the reattachment point fluctuate? Is there any transition to turbulence in the separated shear
layer as the angle of attack increases? Do these characteristics change for the swift-like wing?
Although no surface pressure and no force measurements were performed, it is recommended to
consider either or both of the following points to help complete the description of total lift:
(i) Is it possible to extract estimates of the near-surface pressure distribution from the PIV data?
This information along with the integration of the vertical momentum transfer would help to
complete the description of the total lift (assuming that viscous stresses are small).
(ii) In the absence of pressure field calculations, it could alternatively be valuable to estimate
circulation of the identified vortices to give a quantitative description of vortex strength. This
calculation would also have obvious implications for total lift.
Minor comments
==============
Line 251: It is unclear how the vertical momentum distribution is calculated. What distance from
the surface is the velocity sampled? Please clarify.
Line 253: The velocity-squared momentum transfer term is not necessarily proportional to the
total lift. It is directly proportional to the lift due to momentum transfer, but the total lift depends
strongly on the surface pressure distribution. Information on the pressure distribution would be
required to determine the contribution of momentum transfer to the total lift. It is recommended
to limit the generalization to the total lift in the absence of pressure data.

Your effort is undermined somewhat by a general understanding that swift wings and an array of
wing shapes from other animals, all of which have curved leading edges, all generate LEV’s. It
would more substantially advance our understanding of the effects of leading edge geometry
upon LEV formation if your experimental design would have tested a broader range of variation
in curvature until significant differences were observed between curved and straight leading
edges. That written, your methods and analysis appear robust for the specific case you tested.
I encourage you to recast your presentation more clearly as a test of a hypothesis than as a
descriptive comparison. This applies to the abstract (lines 16-17) and later in the introduction and
conclusions.
Lines 22-23 (and conclusions). Your major conclusion is relatively weak, as we already
understand that a variety of animal wings can generate LEV’s.
Line 31: Delete either “aerodynamic forces such as” or “lift and drag” as what other aerodynamic
forces are there under consideration?
Line 34: LEV’s generate greater pressure differentials on the wings and whether this is
considered lift or drag is depended upon the angle of attack of the wing. My point is that LEV’s
are not a “free ride” in that they increase lift but also drag, and this inherent cost is worth
including in the introduction.

Line 64: This sentence should be recast in terms of advance ratio. When the wings are moving
faster than the forward speed of the animal, unsteady aerodynamic effects may dominate. The
flapping motions may be just as steady (or unsteady) in slow flight as during cruising flight.
Line 78: Define “strong” in quantitative terms.
Results: The beginning of the results (lines 166-179) is a restatement of the introduction and
methods. This should be deleted as it is redundant. Several subsections of the results begin with
a restatement of the introduction or methods (or in a couple of cases, conclusions). This includes
lines 189-193, 202-207, and 246-255. These cases should be deleted as they are redundant, or
components of them should be moved to the introduction or methods.

using PIV
Figure 2: This figure isn’t needed, as your setup is standard.

For two-dimensional data the various vortex identification methods are essentially equivalent
to determine the presence of a vortex (Jeong and Hussain, 1995). It is recommended to
provide the rationale for reporting the results of two alternative vortex identification
methods, and what difference between the Q-criterion and the swirling strength might
physically imply. There is commentary of why vorticity and Q-criterion/swirling strength
should both be assessed (Line 178), but clarification on the distinct interpretations of the Q-
criterion and swirling strength would be useful.
Thanks. There are several existing studies that examine this issue, so we have added a
comment and a reference for more information comparing between the swirling strength and
Q-criterion vortex identification methods.
L176-178: “Most differences between vortex identification methods applied in 2D boundary
layer flow are associated with the sensitivity of the methods to small-scale vortices30.”

There is discussion in the Introduction of how some fliers have unsteady or steady leading
edge vortices. However, all of the results in this study seem to be based on averaged values.
It is recommended to add some details about the unsteady characteristics of the flow. For
example, does the reattachment point fluctuate? Is there any transition to turbulence in the
separated shear layer as the angle of attack increases? Do these characteristics change for the
swift-like wing?
Thank-you. We agree that the term steady vs. unsteady may seem a bit misleading as the
flow at these Reynolds numbers is inherently unsteady. The term ‘steady’ refers to an
1
average LEV. Indeed, the reattachment point fluctuates; that is partly the reasoning for using
multiple identification schemes to quantify the location of the LEV in a statistical manner.
We assume that at these Reynolds numbers, the flow is turbulent, and there were no
transitional effects. Our general conclusion from this study is that the flow over non-linear
swept-back wings at this aspect ratio behave similarly to a linear one. Consequently, our
study is focused on steady LEVs (gliding mode of flight). We agree this was not necessarily
clearly communicated in the introduction during the discussion of unsteady versus steady
LEVs. We have clarified this in the revised manuscript in both the introduction and results
sections.
L66-68: “Steady refers to an LEV that remains stationary above the wing, similar to the
phenomenon found on delta wings, which is the focus of this study. This form of LEV can be
found both on owls’ wings 22 and on swept-back wings of gliding swifts 23.”
L166-170: “The flow over the wings in all configurations is inherently turbulent and these
analyses of the resulting LEVs represent ensemble averages of the vortex characteristics.
There are many different methods to determine whether or not an area of interest is
considered a vortex; thus, four main criteria were used to assess whether or not a particular
velocity field had a leading-edge vortex.”
Although no surface pressure and no force measurements were performed, it is recommended
to consider either or both of the following points to help complete the description of total lift:
(i) Is it possible to extract estimates of the near-surface pressure distribution from the PIV
data? This information along with the integration of the vertical momentum transfer would
help to complete the description of the total lift (assuming that viscous stresses are small).
(ii) In the absence of pressure field calculations, it could alternatively be valuable to estimate
circulation of the identified vortices to give a quantitative description of vortex strength. This
calculation would also have obvious implications for total lift.
We appreciate the suggestion. We cannot estimate the pressure over the surface in our
experimental setup because our upper flow boundary is a free surface. Following your second
suggestion, we have estimated the circulation over the wing at the leading edge region, and
summarized the results in a table added to the revised manuscript. The results are consistent
with the vertical momentum results and the general conclusions of the study.
L262-271: “The circulation of the flow associated with the LEV is estimated as <U+0001D6E4> =
!
<U+0001D714>! <U+0001D451><U+0001D434>, where the region, R, covered by the LEV is defined as the area below the wing
that yields swirling strengths greater than 2. The circulation is another contributor to the
overall lift. The circulation for each spanwise plane and angle of attack for both wings are
shown in Table 1. The circulation peaks at the mid-span of the wing for both sweep
geometries at a=20°, and also for the delta wing at a=30°. The circulations also increase
with the angle of attack suggesting more lift is needed at larger angles. The trends of
circulation for the delta and swift-like wing geometries were similar supporting similar LEV
characteristics. Collectively the vertical momentum and circulation, which are contributors
2
to lift, support that there is similar LEV formation for both linear and non-linear swept-back
leading-edge geometries.”

or comments
Line 251: It is unclear how the vertical momentum distribution is calculated. What distance
from the surface is the velocity sampled? Please clarify.
Thanks for pointing out the confusion. We have revised the explanation to include this
information.
L244-250: “To unambiguously identify negative vertical velocity, we consider vertical
displacements (from the PIV measurements) of at least 1.5 pixels in the downward direction
as indicative of negative velocities (i.e., v<-0.03 ms-1). At each position along the chord, the
mean of these negative vertical velocities over the region beneath the wing was computed
and squared to estimate the vertical momentum distribution over the chord per unit span
(<U+0001D70C><U+0001D463> ! ), where <U+0001D70C> = 1000 kg m-3, and is shown in Figure 7 for various planes and angles of
attack.”
Line 253: The velocity-squared momentum transfer term is not necessarily proportional to
the total lift. It is directly proportional to the lift due to momentum transfer, but the total lift
depends strongly on the surface pressure distribution. Information on the pressure
distribution would be required to determine the contribution of momentum transfer to the
total lift. It is recommended to limit the generalization to the total lift in the absence of
pressure data.

Thanks for this comment. We have rephrased this sentence to avoid this confusion.
L250-252: “This distribution integrated over the chord is proportional to the vertical forces
per unit span acting on the wing and is used to evaluate the similarity of the LEV as a
mechanism contributing to (total) lift generation for the delta and swift wings.”
Figures 4, 5 and 6: The gradient in the colormap appears to give only three steps in the
calculated vorticity contours. It is recommended to increase the resolution in the colormap to
give a better picture of the variation in vorticity.
Thanks. We have adjusted Figures 4, 5, and 6 to include 10 contour levels.
“Figure 4: Mean vorticity contours for the quarter plane of the delta wing at a = 0° (a), a = 20° (b),

nk you for reviewing the paper and for the constructive comments. We have chosen the swift
g as a case study because unlike other birds that generate LEV during flapping, the swift
erate LEV during gliding, too, which is an uncommon feature amongst birds (Videler et al.,
4). The choice of comparison to a delta wing is because this is a classical wing that is known
enerate an LEV and has been utilized widely in the aerospace industry. We have clarified this
onale in the revised manuscript in consideration of your comments, with specific changes
tified below.
cific Comments
I encourage you to recast your presentation more clearly as a test of a hypothesis than as a
descriptive comparison. This applies to the abstract (lines 16-17) and later in the
introduction and conclusions.
Thanks for your comment. We have revised our presentation, including the following
changes:
Line 16-21: “We hypothesize that non-linear swept-back wings generate a vortex in the
leading-edge region, which can augment the lift in a similar manner to linear swept-back
wings (i.e., delta wing) during gliding flight. Particle image velocimetry experiments were
performed in a water flume to compare flow over two wing geometries: one with a non-linear
sweep (swift-like wing) and one with a linear sweep (delta wing).”
Line 88-89: “The present study is an investigation of LEV formation comparing vortex
development over a non-linear swept-back wing (swift) to that over a linear swept-back wing
(delta).”
Line 297-299: “In all, these results reveal no major distinctions between the linear and non-
linear swept-back wings on LEV formation, indicating that non-linear swept-back wings in
addition to linear swept-back wings are capable of forming and maintaining a steady LEV.”
6
Lines 22-23 (and conclusions). Your major conclusion is relatively weak, as we already
understand that a variety of animal wings can generate LEV’s.
While animal wings (insects, birds, bats) commonly generate LEV during flapping flight this
is not the case during gilding flight; the case study herein. During gliding, the most well-
known case to exhibit an LEV is the swift (Videler et al., 2004), and there exists speculation
on LEV generation in owls during gilding as well (Kroger et al., 1972). Therefore, the
conclusion provided herein is more generic than just the swift as many birds have a non-
linear leading edge of their wing planform. We have revised the text you referenced to better
reflect our findings.
L24-25: “These similarities suggest that sweep geometries other than a linear sweep (i.e.,
delta wing) are capable of creating LEVs during gliding flight.”
Line 31: Delete either “aerodynamic forces such as” or “lift and drag” as what other
aerodynamic forces are there under consideration?
We have revised the sentence.
Line 33-34: “Aerodynamic forces play a major role for a given task with respect to flight
performance.”
Line 34: LEV’s generate greater pressure differentials on the wings and whether this is
considered lift or drag is depended upon the angle of attack of the wing. My point is that
LEV’s are not a “free ride” in that they increase lift but also drag, and this inherent cost is
worth including in the introduction.
We agree with the reviewer’s comment. We have added a sentence mentioning the drag
contribution of an LEV, and also added a reference regarding this point for the reader’s
information.
Line 45-46: “However, this lift comes at a cost and it is noteworthy that LEVs also increase
drag at all non-zero angles of attack 6.”

Line 64: This sentence should be recast in terms of advance ratio. When the wings are
moving faster than the forward speed of the animal, unsteady aerodynamic effects may
dominate. The flapping motions may be just as steady (or unsteady) in slow flight as during
cruising flight.

We apologize for the confusion. We agree with the reviewer that LEV formation over
flapping animal wings depends on the coupling between the flapping frequency and forward
speed as well as other conditions. However, we focus in this paper on gliding mode where no
flapping is considered. Therefore, to avoid confusion, we have removed this sentence.
Line 78: Define “strong” in quantitative terms.
Thanks. This word should not have been there – we have removed it from the sentence.
Line 78-80: “Swift wings are characterized by a non-linear sweep-back angle, which differs
from delta wings that have a linear sweep-back angle.”
Results: The beginning of the results (lines 166-179) is a restatement of the introduction and
methods. This should be deleted as it is redundant. Several subsections of the results begin
with a restatement of the introduction or methods (or in a couple of cases, conclusions). This
includes lines 189-193, 202-207, and 246-255. These cases should be deleted as they are
redundant, or components of them should be moved to the introduction or methods.
We appreciate the reviewer’s comment and have edited the noted sections to remove
repetition. Several lines were removed including 166-172 and 202-203. We have verified
that other information presented in these lines is the only place that information appears in
the manuscript. Thanks.

flow using PIV
Thanks for this suggestion. We have amended it.
“Figure 1: 3D CAD renderings of the delta (a) and swift-like (b) wings. These wing
models were created using a Mark Forged 3D printer with onyx fiber. Black lines on
wings show the PIV cross sections measured at 25%, 50%, and 75% of the span.”

Figure 2: This figure isn’t needed, as your setup is standard.
We agree that the PIV setup is standard, but the inverted nature of the wing is most easily
visualized with the inclusion of this figure. We therefore think the figure provides additional
clarification of the experimental setup.
Figures 7 and 8: Consider combining these, using two different line colors or solid versus
dashed. This would facilitate comparison of the two sets of results.
Thank you for this comment. We have combined the two figures into one and adjusted the
manuscript as necessary to reflect this change. The revised Figure 7 is included below.
