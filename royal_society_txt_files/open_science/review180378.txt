label_comment_1
This paper is a very nice contribution about sociosexual context of mouse USV production. The
revision is very nicely written and incorporated the comments in a way that addresses the
shortcoming of not being able to attribute call to individuals. This paper clearly shows that socio-
sexual context matters and the authors have put their results in a broad context with careful
consideration about what their results might mean. I have two general comments that would
further improve the readability; both have to do with terminology.
1. The paragraph that begins on line 60 is still marred by the use of phrase and phase. These two
words are similar in the english language and when a sentence reads "...phrase analysis
depending on phase..." as on line 65 it is really difficult to digest. I understand if the authors
want to keep this language but at the very least, define phase and phrase right away in the paper
before these terms are used. And, consider my next comment which would solve the problem.
2. Consider rethinking the use of phrase and syllable. I also have used these terms but have been
convinced to drop them in favor of bout and call, respectively. Phrase and syllable come from the
birdsong literature and are not appropriate for mammal vocalizations because of mechanistic
differences in production. Moreover, in an upcoming (2018) volume of Handbook of Ultrasonic
Vocalizations (which is a summary of both mouse and rat USV work to date) the standard
terminology is call and bout as opposed to syllable and phrase. It is an easy fix that would align
the terminology with other terms in mouse vocalization literature (especially the newer papers).
Fig 1 D would be about the 12 call types. Fig 1 C would be about bout of call types.
I found a couple of minor typos:
line 49 should read "influences"
line 52 should read "mouse vocalizations"
also I may have missed it but should there not be corresponding for the FF recordings around
line 122?

Major comments
1. The strongest contribution of the work relates to the description of changes in syllable structure
& proportion over the course of interactions coincident with different contexts—
approach/exploratory sniffing, territorial, & reproductive mounts. Such findings serve as an
important guide to the mouse USV field to standardize trial duration. Similar findings were
reported in their previous PLoS One paper.
2. As the authors acknowledge, one major shortcoming of the study is the inability to identify
which mouse produced vocalizations in paired intersexual contexts. A recent paper (citation 37
in text) has developed a protocol to facilitate this endeavor. In the meantime, I think it’s slightly
premature to speculate that the “male(s) mainly produced both phrase types” (L. 425), especially
since the authors acknowledge the importance of strain differences in USV production (e.g. L.
466, 521).
3. A similar and highly relevant study was recently published (link below) but not
cited/discussed in text. Comparing & contrasting your findings to this paper would help
strengthen the manuscript.

A. We agree with comment 1 and 2. We replaced the term “phrase” with “calling bout”, and
“syllable” with “call”.
Minor comment 1
I found a couple of minor typos:
line 49 should read "influences"
line 52 should read "mouse vocalizations"
A. We appreciate reviewer 1 pointing out my mistakes. We revised these terms.
Minor comment 2
also I may have missed it but should there not be corresponding for the FF recordings
around line 122?
A. These sentences in Methods are explanation for MM, MF, and FF contexts, but it might lead
readers confused. We revised them as follows;
Methods (line from 120 to 133 of “clear version of the manuscript”)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mouse vocalisations in MM, MF, and FF contexts were recorded using the same
paradigm. Animals were handled and habituated to the test cage for 10 minutes per day
during the dark cycle (14:00-20:00) for 5 consecutive days. Experimental males and
females were housed individually. Recordings in all contexts were conducted on 4
consecutive days for each context, once per day, during the dark cycle (14:00-20:00). The
MM and MF contexts involved the same group of male mice. The MM and MF
experiments were spaced at least three days apart, and the test order was
counter-balanced. To ensure that the male mice were sexually experienced prior to the
experiment, experimental males were housed with exposure females for 3 days and then
returned to individual housing 1 day before the recording test (MM and MF context).
Thus, the male mice underwent 5 days of cage habituation, 3 days of sexual exposure,
and 4 days of MM (or MF). Three days later, they underwent MF (or MM). The female
mice in FF contexts underwent the same series of manipulations, but did not undergo a
sexual exposure period (FF context). Instead, they continued to be housed individually
for the 3 days following cage habituation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Report of Reviewer 2
Major comment 1 and 2
1. The strongest contribution of the work relates to the description of changes in syllable
structure & proportion over the course of interactions coincident with different
contexts—approach/exploratory sniffing, territorial, & reproductive mounts. Such findings
serve as an important guide to the mouse USV field to standardize trial duration. Similar
findings were reported in their previous PLoS One paper.
2. As the authors acknowledge, one major shortcoming of the study is the inability to identify
which mouse produced vocalizations in paired intersexual contexts. A recent paper
(citation 37 in text) has developed a protocol to facilitate this endeavor. In the meantime, I
think it’s slightly premature to speculate that the “male(s) mainly produced both phrase types”
(L. 425), especially since the authors acknowledge the importance of strain differences in
USV production (e.g. L. 466, 521).
A. We agree with reviewer 2. We revised these sentences as follows;
Discussion (line from 411 to 432)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although we were not able to distinguish which of the two mice produced ultrasonic
sounds, identifying the individual emitters will contribute the understanding of
ultrasonic communication, especially in the male-female context. Previously,
vocalisations in male-female contexts were thought to be produced by male mice only,
but recent studies have shown that females also produce vocalisations. For example,
females have shown to produce ultrasonic vocalisations with a comparable quality and
quantity as males when encountering males but are separated such that they are
unable to make physical contact [16]. Another study using a microphone array in which
to locate the sound source found that females produced vocalisations when males
exhibit courtship behaviour in a socially interacting group [37]. Therefore, it is likely
that in our experiments both males and females produced ultrasonic sounds in the
opposite-sex context. In the same-sex context, males produced Simple calling bout,
whereas females produced Complex calling bout. These two types of calling bouts were
also recorded in male-female contexts, suggesting that, like in the same-sex contexts,
males and females produced Simple and Complex bouts, respectively. However, it is
possible that the male produced not only Simple but also Complex calling bouts in
male-female context. This possibility stems from previous studies showing that overall
vocal production does not change dramatically whether a male-female interaction
involves a vivid or anaesthetised female [2]. In addition, a study using microphone
array shows that males in a socially interacting group produce the majority of
vocalisations during courtship [37]. Male mice deficient for TRP2, which is known to be
related to the sensory activation in the vomeronasal organ, produce similar amount of
mounting and ultrasonic vocalisations towards males and females [38].

4. While I understand in principle the point of Fig. 6, the data itself is challenging to interpret.
Data in B (30 s) & C (10 min) appear similar.
A. As reviewer 2 commented, these figures might make readers confused. We changed these
figures as a “Figure 7”. We revised the explanation and added the statistical results in Discussion
as follows;
Discussion (line from 510 to 515)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For example, Figure 7 shows the mean call duration, which acoustic feature is often used to compare
the vocalisations in mice, in the first 60 seconds and 600 seconds of each context. Call duration in
each same-sex context was not different between first 60 seconds and 600 seconds (MM: <U+03C7>2 = 1.41,
df = 1, p = 0.23; FF: <U+03C7>2 = 0.99, df = 1, p = 0.32), whereas it was different in the male-female context
(<U+03C7>2 = 6.43, df = 1, p < 0.05).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor comment 1
Specify that rms refers to amplitude in all references to rms.
A. We changed “amplitude” to “rms” (line 439).
Minor comment 2
Source distance to the microphone can greatly influence amplitude values, especially at
high frequencies that mice produce. Can the authors specify the relationship between
sender position and amplitude values?
A. As reviewer 2 said, amplitude value can be affected by the distance between the microphone and
emitter. In this study, we could not specify the relationship between sender position and
amplitude values because we set only a single microphone positioned 30 cm above the floor of
the test cage for recording. The test cage is not so big and there were not much difference on
animal activities in the test cage between individuals, so we compared the RMS among 3
contexts through the 10 min recording. However, it needs other recording system (e.g.
microphone array system) to examine amplitude values in details.
