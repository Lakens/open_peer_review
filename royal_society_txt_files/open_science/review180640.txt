REFEREE REPORT
Title: On relativistic multipole moments of stationary spacetimes
Authors: F. Frutos-Alfaro and M. Soffel
The authors of this manuscript investigate the multipole structure of several well-known
stationary axially symmetric solutions of Einstein's field equations in empty space. It is
remarkable that the authors present all the main aspects and the explicit expressions of the
metrics they analyze. The main result of the paper is the derivation of the GH multipole moments
for the MN, QM and q-metrics. In addition, the static limiting case is compared with other known
static solutions. As far as I can see, the results are correct and the explicit form of the multipole
moments (up to the order 10) could be of importance for the description of the gravitational field
of deformed astrophysical objects. The authors also point out the limits of applicability of all sets
of multipoles.
The paper is in general well written and the results are important for theoretical astrophysics. I,
therefore, recommend accepting this paper for publication. However, I also suggest the authors
consider the following points in a revised version of their manuscript:
1. In Eq.(2.1) the constant sigma is given explicitly for the Kerr metric. Is this expression also valid
when higher multipoles are considered? I suggest the author comment on the value of sigma.
2. The form of the line element in prolate coordinates is not widely known and used. For clarity of
the presentation, I suggest the authors include after Eq.(2.4) the explicit form for the
Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, which are the simplest representatives of static and stationary
solutions, respectively.
3. Eq.(2.19) should be corrected.
4. For all three stationary metrics (MN, QM and q) it seems that there is a particular choice of the
parameters for which the quadrupole vanishes (M2=0). Is this a physically realistic choice? What
is the meaning of M2=0? The authors should comment this limiting value.
5. Physically, one would expect for astrophysical objects that a realistic rotation has the limit a<m
and the extreme value a=m corresponds to an extreme black hole. The authors should analyze all
the stationary moments in the limit of an "extreme object" (a=m) and verify if all the three cases
are equal and correspond to an extreme black hole.

Answers to the Referee
The paper is in general well written and the results are important for theoretical astrophysics. I,
therefore, recommend accepting this paper for publication. However, I also suggest the authors
consider the following points in a revised version of their manuscript:
1. In Eq.(2.1) the constant sigma is given explicitly for the Kerr metric. Is this expression also valid
when higher multipoles are considered? I suggest the author comment on the value of sigma.
Yes, you are right, we improved the text to avoid it. sigma appears by transforming from cylindrical to
these prolate coordinates.
2. The form of the line element in prolate coordinates is not widely known and used. For clarity of the
presentation, I suggest the authors include after Eq.(2.4) the explicit form for the Schwarzschild and
Kerr metrics, which are the simplest representatives of static and stationary solutions, respectively.
We added the metric potentials of the Kerr and Schwarzschild potentials in these prolate coordinates.
3. Eq.(2.19) should be corrected.
In this equation, I did not find an error, I revised the literature and it is correct.
Please, could you tell me where is the error?
4. For all three stationary metrics (MN, QM and q) it seems that there is a particular choice of the
parameters for which the quadrupole vanishes (M2=0). Is this a physically realistic choice? What is the
meaning of M2=0? The authors should comment this limiting value.
For most sufficiently massive astronomical bodies the shape (due to gravity and rotation) is
close to that of an oblate spheroid, whose even mass-moments, in the Newtonian limit, are
fully dertermined by the semi-major and minor-axes. For an ordinary star the various multipole
moments are not independent of each other but are determined by its mass, rate of rotation and
the local equation of state. This also holds in the relativistic case, e.g., for neutron stars. Even for
black holes, according to the no-hair conjecture all mass-moments are determined fully by the
values for mass and angular momemtum in the Kerr case. The situation where an object, e.g.,
has no mass quadrupole but other higher mass multipole moments is unphysical. This serves as
motivation to analyze the multipole structure of these three spacetimes, namely the MN, QM and
q-metrics.
We included this text in the Introduction.
5. Physically, one would expect for astrophysical objects that a realistic rotation has the limit a
The metrics are isometric for this limiting case (a = m). We wrote it in the paper.
Moreover, we analyzed the case for neutron stars according to the literature, please see equation
(3.8) and the text there (page 14)
