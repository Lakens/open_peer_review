General comments
The main limitation of this experiment is that the current procedure used to study drying
behaviour and related wetness perception of fabrics does not simulate real wear conditions. In
the current experiment the fabrics were pre-wetted and then applied on the dry skin, after the
pre-set dying states (corresponding to different time points) were reached. Since the evaporation
of physical wetness and different drying states were not reached when the fabric was in contact
with the skin, the authors are simply assessing wetness perception of fabrics containing different
amounts of water. In order words, the dynamic process of drying did not occur when the fabric
was on the skin, as such, over-time changes in fabric temperature due to evaporations, which can
also change based on the type of fibre used, and the related thermal sensations involved that
modulate wetness sensations, are neglected. The authors have acknowledged this limitation and
explained that the whole drying process of fabric was not performed on the forearm as this
would have resulted in a long exposure to wet stimulations. On the contrary, transient exposure
to wetness is crucial if the main aim is to study drying-induced changes in fabric physical
wetness and related perceptions. Using the current approach, the authors are simply reporting
statistical relationships between wetness perception and different degrees of wetness in fabrics.
In line whit this, the wetness factor is based on wetness perception ratings obtained when wet
cold fabrics are applied on the skin for a very short time. The ratings are not affected by over time
changes in fabric temperature due to evaporation occurring on the skin. As such I do not think
that the WF, using the current wetness perception ratings, is a valid parameter to use. The current
findings are not novel and the authors should speculate around the scientific merit of the current
study and how the findings could implement the current body on knowledge.
The introduction is very short and the authors should include up-to-date literature on the topic of
human wetness perception in relation to textile materials. The introduction is also mixed with
some info regarding method and methodology.
Results and discussion sections should be separated as well. At the moment the authors are
mixing the two together.
The paper is tackling a very specific topic related to textile moisture absorption, wetness
perception and discomfort. Perhaps the current research should be considered by a more
specialised journal in this area.
The authors should seek for support from an English speaker in order to improve the writing
style of the paper.
Specific comments
Page 3, line 5: This first sentence is not correct. The human skin has not hygroreceptor, however,
other body organs, such as the eyes, are provided with specific moisture receptors. Please
amended this sentence. Also, the authors are not providing the original reference. Please amend
this.
Page 3, line 5-7: Please refer to up-to-date literature on the modalities underlying sensations and
perceptions related to skin and clothing wetness.
Page 3, line 18: I think that ‘unflavoured’ is not the right term in this specific context. I would
rather use the term ‘uncomfortable’, for instance. Please amend.
Page 3, Line 21: The authors make an important observation regarding the sensations triggered
by the presence of wetness at the skin-clothing interface. However, it is not clear what the
implications are. Please, elaborate on the consequences and the impact that skin and clothing
wetness have on human thermal, wear and haptic discomfort with reference to the up-to-date
3
literature.
Page 3, line 24: Please reconsider the use of the term unflavoured.
Page 3, line 33-34: This statement is not strictly true. Niedermann and Rossi conducted a study
looking at the thermal sensation and wetness perception of fabrics made of different fibre type at
different drying state. Please refer to:
Niedermann R, Rossi RM (2012) Objective and subjective evaluation of the human thermal
sensation of wet fabrics. Textile Research Journal 82:374–384.
Page 3, line 33: Please consider the use of the term ‘participants’ rather than ‘subjects’, here and
throughout the manuscript.
Page 3, line 39-55 and page 4, line 3-40: In these two paragraphs the authors are reporting the
methodology and the methods adopted in the current research study. This information should
not be part of the introduction. Please modify.
Page 3, line 54: Please report in a figure the ratio scale used for the assessments of wetness
perception. Furthermore, provide a more in depth and clear rational for the use of such a ration
scale and why, in the current research approach, the ration scale is better than previously used
ordinal scales.
Page 5, line 14: Please provide details regarding range of travel, speed and pressure of the fabrics
moving across the skin.
Previous studies, included one from the first author of this paper (Tang et al. 201), have reported
the critical impact of fabric thickness on wetness perception. Later on, the impact of fabric
thickness (volume) on fabric moisture saturation and related wetness perception was
demonstrated (Raccuglia et al. 2017; Human wetness perception in relation to textile water
absorption parameters under static skin contact. Textile Research Journal 87:2449–2463. doi:
10.1177/0040517516671127); (Raccuglia et al. 2018, Clothing comfort during physical exercise –
Determining the critical factors. Applied Ergonomics 73:33–41. doi: 10.1016/j.apergo.2018.05.014).
These studies have indicated that wetness perceptions should be related to fabric saturation
values (amount of moisture per unit volume of fabric), rather than absolute moisture values.
Given the difference in fabric thickness between the currently used fabrics, the authors should
add fabric moisture values expressed in mg of water per unit volume of fabric. These values
should be than related to the wetness rating values obtained. This point should also be
highlighted and discussed in the introduction.
Page 7, line 32: Please clarify the use of ‘training fabrics’.
Page 7, line 55-56: 45 seconds of rest were given between different fabric applications. The skin
exposed to the wet stimulus was dried. However, did the authors ensure that the hydration state
and temperature of the skin returned to baseline? If so, could the author report how this was
done? If this has not been consider, please report why/if this could be a limiting factor.
Page 8, line 10: This is not clear. Why 40 pieces and 10 pieces of training fabrics? Table 1 only
reports specifications of 8 sample fabrics. Where are the specifications of the rest of the fabrics?
Page 8, line 14-19: Is it acceptable to reject from the group individuals that cannot discriminate
different degrees of wetness set by the authors? Although these participants are not sensitive
enough in discriminating between the set levels of physical wetness, they are still representative
of the population targeted. Could you please elaborate on this?
Method section: A quite crucial point which needs explanation is regarding the application and
drying procedure of the fabrics. The authors reported a very clear explanation of the wetting
procedure. However, it is not reported what happened to the fabric after being wetted. Was the
fabric always wetted with the maximum (1.4 grams) and then left to dry? After being wetted, was
the fabric immediately applied on the dry skin? Did the authors allow fabric drying when the
fabric was on the skin or was the fabric at different drying stages applied on the skin? Please
clarify.
Table 2: As the amount of water left in the fabrics due to drying was targeted at 0, 16,32,48,68
min. Table 2 should report the amount of water carried by the fabrics at these drying points.
Please, amend this table. Why is the X-intercept, i.e. the expected drying time, relevant in this
4
context?
Furthermore, the change in fabric water content from 0th should be reported, in order to identify
differences in water content between the fabric samples.
Figure 3: This figure contains a lot of information. It is not easy to identify different fabrics, so
please consider using different colours for different fabric and use the same colour for the related
fabric code reported on the x-axis. The meaning of the wetness rating on the y-axis is not clear;
please provide some references or descriptor. I.E. is 1000 good or bad for wetness, i.e. very dry or
very wet?
Figure 4: I believe that the data reported in figure 4 are from a potential ‘participant A’? Please,
specify. Additionally, why data from participants A, B and C are not reported in the same graph?
Please consider merging these two figures together. Also, in figure 5, the blue line only includes 4
data points rather than 5. Please check and correct. This graph should also include an example of
no change of drying-induced wetness sensation (r2 <0.50).
Page 12, line 8-10. The authors report that the constant wetness rating in category II is mainly due
to the fabric properties, given that the pre-screening test has indicated that the participants
included in the study can sense differences in wetness. In this regard, I have a number of
questions. First of all, could the author elaborate a bit more on the textile and fabric properties
which affect the constant wetness rating and are these related to drying time? Secondly, if the
constant wetness rating is actually due to fabric properties, is then correct to identify category II
as ‘subjects that cannot sense changes’? In fact, this no changes are due to the fabric and not to
the participants. Finally, the experimental fabrics were applied in dynamic contact with the skin;
as such the mechanical interaction between the two surfaces would have affected wetness
perception response. It has been demonstrated that wetness perception is related to stickiness
sensations of wet material, and stickiness sensation as well as wetness are modulated not only by
the amount of physical wetness present in the fabric but also by the surface texture properties of
the material (Raccuglia et al. 2017; Human wetness perception of fabrics under dynamic skin
contact. Textile Research Journal. doi: 10.1177/0040517517716905). For instance, very plain
smooth surfaces are perceived as more wet and stickier that rougher coarser materials,
independently of the level of physical wetness. Could this explain the highest wetness rating of
silk? Please discuss this and also include this up-to-date literature in the introduction.
Page 12, line 55: why wetness perception ratings have been log10 transformed. Please, provide
explanation in the manuscript.

Reviewer: 1
Comment 1: The main limitation of this experiment is that the current procedure
used to study drying behaviour and related wetness perception of fabrics does
not simulate real wear conditions. In the current experiment the fabrics were
pre-wetted and then applied on the dry skin, after the pre-set dying states
(corresponding to different time points) were reached. Since the evaporation of
physical wetness and different drying states were not reached when the fabric
was in contact with the skin, the authors are simply assessing wetness
perception of fabrics containing different amounts of water. In order words, the
dynamic process of drying did not occur when the fabric was on the skin, as
such, over-time changes in fabric temperature due to evaporations, which can
also change based on the type of fibre used, and the related thermal sensations
involved that modulate wetness sensations, are neglected. The authors have
acknowledged this limitation and explained that the whole drying process of
fabric was not performed on the forearm as this would have resulted in a long
exposure to wet stimulations. On the contrary, transient exposure to wetness
is crucial if the main aim is to study drying-induced changes in fabric physical
wetness and related perceptions. Using the current approach, the authors are
simply reporting statistical relationships between wetness perception and
different degrees of wetness in fabrics. In line whit this, the wetness factor is
based on wetness perception ratings obtained when wet cold fabrics are applied
on the skin for a very short time. The ratings are not affected by over time
changes in fabric temperature due to evaporation occurring on the skin. As such
I do not think that the WF, using the current wetness perception ratings, is a
valid parameter to use. The current findings are not novel and the authors should
speculate around the scientific merit of the current study and how the findings
could implement the current body on knowledge.
Reply: Thank you for reviewing and your comments can help us for improving
our works.
Comment 2: The introduction is very short and the authors should include up-
to-date literature on the topic of human wetness perception in relation to textile
materials. The introduction is also mixed with some info regarding method and
methodology.
Reply: Authors would like to thanks reviewer 1 for his/her valuable comments.
Introduction is extended with the relationship between wetness perception and
textiles. Information about experiment is moved to “Methods” section.
Comment 3: Results and discussion sections should be separated as well. At the
moment the authors are mixing the two together.
Reply: Discussion is separated from Results. Therefore, writing style of the
manuscript is improved.
Comment 4: The paper is tackling a very specific topic related to textile
moisture absorption, wetness perception and discomfort. Perhaps the current
research should be considered by a more specialised journal in this area.
Reply: Thank you for your comments for improving our works.
Comment 5: The authors should seek for support from an English speaker in
order to improve the writing style of the paper.
Reply: English was edited and the writing style of the manuscript is improved.
Comment 6: Page 3, line 5: This first sentence is not correct. The human skin
has not hygroreceptor, however, other body organs, such as the eyes, are
provided with specific moisture receptors. Please amended this sentence. Also,
the authors are not providing the original reference. Please amend this.
Reply: Revised manuscript and references were added (Section 1, paragraph 1)
“Human skin body has no hygroreceptor [1-3]”
Comment 7: Page 3, line 5-7: Please refer to up-to-date literature on the
modalities underlying sensations and perceptions related to skin and clothing
wetness.
Reply: Update references [4, 7, 8] are added. (Section 1, paragraph 1)
Comment 8: Page 3, line 18: I think that ‘unflavoured’ is not the right term in
this specific context. I would rather use the term ‘uncomfortable’, for instance.
Please amend.
Reply: “Unflavoured” was is replaced by “uncomfortable” in text. (Section 1,
paragraph 1)
Comment 9: Page 3, Line 21: The authors make an important observation
regarding the sensations triggered by the presence of wetness at the skin-
clothing interface. However, it is not clear what the implications are. Please,
elaborate on the consequences and the impact that skin and clothing wetness
have on human thermal, wear and haptic discomfort with reference to the up-
to-date literature.
Reply: Manuscript and references are updated as below (Section 1, paragraph
1):
“In such cases the wearer may experience uncomfortable post-exercise chill
sensation [12-15]. The shirt gives a wet sensation to the wearer for an extended
period of time before it turns dry. In addition to wet perception, water at skin-
fabric interface will increase friction or adhesion at the interface [16-19]. When
there is prolonged contact between skin and wetted fabric, skin injuries can be
induced [20, 21].”
Comment 10: Page 3, line 24: Please reconsider the use of the term unflavoured.
Reply: “Unflavoured” is replaced by “uncomfortable” in text. (Section 1,
paragraph 3)
Comment 11: Page 3, line 33-34: This statement is not strictly true. Niedermann
and Rossi conducted a study looking at the thermal sensation and wetness
perception of fabrics made of different fibre type at different drying state. Please
refer to:
Niedermann R, Rossi RM (2012) Objective and subjective evaluation of the
human thermal sensation of wet fabrics. Textile Research Journal 82:374–384.
Reply: Revised as per suggestion. Niedermann R, Rossi RM (2012) was cited
(Section 1, paragraph 3): “Up till now, there is almost no fabric based subjective
wetness assessment against drying time reported in the literature, except
Niedermann et al. investigated wet perception based on certain percent of time
to fully dry fabrics [24].”
Comment 12: Page 3, line 33: Please consider the use of the term ‘participants’
rather than ‘subjects’, here and throughout the manuscript.
Reply: “Subjects” was replaced by “participants” throughout the manuscript.
Comment 13; Page 3, line 39-55 and page 4, line 3-40: In these two paragraphs
the authors are reporting the methodology and the methods adopted in the
current research study. This information should not be part of the introduction.
Please modify.
Reply: These paragraphs were moved to Section 2: Methods. Thank you.
Comment 14: Page 3, line 54: Please report in a figure the ratio scale used for
the assessments of wetness perception. Furthermore, provide a more in depth
and clear rational for the use of such a ration scale and why, in the current
research approach, the ration scale is better than previously used ordinal scales.
Reply: The ratio is shown in figure 2 and the comparison between ratio and
ordinal scale is given in the manuscript (Section 2.3, paragraph 2):
“The ratio scale is visualised in figure 2…. Under this rating scale, participants
do not need to deal with the meaning of adjectives in ordinal point scale [31].
For example, wording slightly wet, barely wet, etc. were used in previous
studies [32, 33]. Therefore, participants can focus on comparing wet sensation
between sample and reference in current study. Moreover, in ordinal point scale,
participants may avoid the extremes [34]. Thus, the ratings are confined to the
middle of the scale [25, 34]. The ratio scale gives no boundary to participant’s
rating for comparing wetness perception, so the effect of central tendency in
ordinal scale may be suppressed.”
Comment 15: Page 5, line 14: Please provide details regarding range of travel,
speed and pressure of the fabrics moving across the skin.
Reply: “Amplitude of fabrics moving across the skin was 2.5 cm. The paddles
spent 1.5 seconds for one revolution. The highest point that paddles reached
and the highest point of forearm skin were set at the same height. This
controlled pressure applied onto skin. No vertical pressure was applied
externally onto fabrics.” (Section 2.1, paragraph 2) is inserted into manuscript.
Comment 16: Previous studies, included one from the first author of this paper
(Tang et al. 201), have reported the critical impact of fabric thickness on
wetness perception. Later on, the impact of fabric thickness (volume) on fabric
moisture saturation and related wetness perception was demonstrated
(Raccuglia et al. 2017; Human wetness perception in relation to textile water
absorption parameters under static skin contact. Textile Research Journal
87:2449–2463. doi: 10.1177/0040517516671127); (Raccuglia et al. 2018,
Clothing comfort during physical exercise – Determining the critical factors.
Applied Ergonomics 73:33–41. doi: 10.1016/j.apergo.2018.05.014). These
studies have indicated that wetness perceptions should be related to fabric
saturation values (amount of moisture per unit volume of fabric), rather than
absolute moisture values. Given the difference in fabric thickness between the
currently used fabrics, the authors should add fabric moisture values expressed
in mg of water per unit volume of fabric. These values should be than related
to the wetness rating values obtained. This point should also be highlighted and
discussed in the introduction.
Reply: Figure 8 is revised with suggested references, and its Figure caption is
changed to: “Wetness rating against amount of water per unit volume in fabric
of category (I) perception results, y-axis is in log scale.”

(Section 3.5, paragraph 1) “figure 8 shows a semi-log plot “wetness rating
against amount of water per unit volume” in fabric. This plot presents roughly
linear relationship on each of the fabric. Rate of change of wetness rating goes
high when amount of water per unit volume increases. The slope of P3M, SIL
and PET is slightly lower than other fabrics. The finding noted in figure 8
matches with previous studies [22, 23]. It indicated that wetness perception
relates to fabric saturation values.”
The effect of amount of water per unit volume is also discussion in the
“Introduction” with reference cited.
Comment 17: Page 7, line 32: Please clarify the use of ‘training fabrics’.
Reply: “These ten fabrics were presented to participants randomly for
familiarising wet perception rating scale. DToF of 32 minutes is at the middle
of the test protocol, so fabrics at DToF of 32 minutes are used. Moreover, PET-
00 and PET-64 covered a wide range of amount of water per unit volume, and
so wetness rating.” was put in revised manuscript (Section 2.3, paragraph 2).
Comment 18: Page 7, line 55-56: 45 seconds of rest were given between
different fabric applications. The skin exposed to the wet stimulus was dried.
However, did the authors ensure that the hydration state and temperature of the
skin returned to baseline? If so, could the author report how this was done? If
this has not been consider, please report why/if this could be a limiting factor.
Reply: “After training session of ten fabrics, skin wetness and temperature are
assumed to be in steady state.” was specified in limitation (Section 4.4,
paragraph 1).
Comment 19: Page 8, line 10: This is not clear. Why 40 pieces and 10 pieces of
training fabrics? Table 1 only reports specifications of 8 sample fabrics. Where
are the specifications of the rest of the fabrics?
Reply: That means 8 types of fabric x 5 DToF = 40, so we revised the
manuscript as below (Section 2.3, last paragraph)
“Therefore, each participant made assessment 50 times, including those 10
times under training. The number of test specimens was 40 pieces, plus 10
pieces of training fabrics for each participant.”
Comment 20: Page 8, line 14-19: Is it acceptable to reject from the group
individuals that cannot discriminate different degrees of wetness set by the
authors? Although these participants are not sensitive enough in discriminating
between the set levels of physical wetness, they are still representative of the
population targeted. Could you please elaborate on this?
Reply: More precise, it was a pre-screening test. Some more explanations are
given in manuscript (Section 2.4, paragraph 2):
“The three PET training fabrics mentioned in the last sub-section (PET-00, PET-
32 and PET-64) also acted as pre-screening fabrics for participants. PET-00 is
fully saturated with water, PET-64 is almost completely dried, and PET-32 is at
the midway. If the participant was unable to give wetness rating of these three
fabrics in descending (=) sequence, that participant would have unknown
difficulties for the wetness perception assessment. In order to reduce
uncertainty throughout this study, that participant was not invited rejected for
further analysis. Finally, one participant was not invited for remaining
assessment rejected under this pre-screening criterion. Pre-screening session
was also employed to check eligibility of participants in previous sensory tests
[32, 35].”
Comment 21: Method section: A quite crucial point which needs explanation is
regarding the application and drying procedure of the fabrics. The authors
reported a very clear explanation of the wetting procedure. However, it is not
reported what happened to the fabric after being wetted. Was the fabric always
wetted with the maximum (1.4 grams) and then left to dry? After being wetted,
was the fabric immediately applied on the dry skin? Did the authors allow fabric
drying when the fabric was on the skin or was the fabric at different drying
stages applied on the skin? Please clarify.
Reply: The wetting of fabrics depends on properties themselves, and then
fabrics dry on bench. Please see below revision for actions on fabrics after being
wetted (Section 2.2, paragraph 2):
“…This “stamping” method allows non-absorbed water to remain on the plastic
card. The residual water on plastic card was disregarded. The amount of
absorbed water by fabrics can be found in sub-section 3.1 (amount of water at
drying time zero minute in figure 3). … After stamping, the wetted specimens
were put for drying on a bench for 0, 16, 32, 48 or 64 minutes. Once the pre-set
drying time was up, the sample was delivered to participant’s forearm for
assessment. This is named as the Drying Time of Fabric (DToF).”’
Comment 22: Table 2: As the amount of water left in the fabrics due to drying
was targeted at 0, 16,32,48,68 min. Table 2 should report the amount of water
carried by the fabrics at these drying points. Please, amend this table. Why is
the X-intercept, i.e. the expected drying time, relevant in this context?
Furthermore, the change in fabric water content from 0th should be reported, in
order to identify differences in water content between the fabric samples.
Reply: We highly agree with Reviewer 1 previously suggested that “wetness
perceptions should be related to fabric saturation values (amount of moisture
per unit volume of fabric), rather than absolute moisture values”. So we propose
to show only the more important value i.e. amount of water per unit volume
(water content) in table 2. The less important value i.e. absolute amount of water
on fabric at 0, 16,32,48,68 min may be found in figure 3. Below information
are given in manuscript to further describe Table 2 (Section 3.1, paragraph 1):
“The x-intercept…time for fabric to be completely dried. The time for
completely dried reflects time span of wet perception. This is also a factor that
affects comfortability of fabrics in real use. As summarised in the Introduction,
amount of water per unit volume of fabric is crucial for wet sensation. Amount
of water per unit volume is also shown in Table 2. It is determined from absolute
amount of water in fabric, fabric thickness and sample area (144 cm2). The
amount of water per unit volume included the factor that of fabric thickness [22,
23] or water content [26].”
The concept related to amount of water per unit volume is also discussed in the
Introduction and the Discussion.
Comment 23: Figure 3: This figure contains a lot of information. It is not easy
to identify different fabrics, so please consider using different colours for
different fabric and use the same colour for the related fabric code reported on
the x-axis. The meaning of the wetness rating on the y-axis is not clear; please
provide some references or descriptor. I.E. is 1000 good or bad for wetness, i.e.
very dry or very wet?
Reply: Figure 4 (former figure 3) is revised with different colours, and the
Caption is given as below:
“Figure 4. Wetness (perception) rating of all assessed fabrics at various DToF
(20 participants). (e.g.: Label “RAY-16” on x-axis refers RAY with DToF of 16
minutes; Wetness rating of 1000 (percent) means specimen is 10 times wetter
than the reference; Wetness rating of 50 (percent) refers wetness of the
specimen was half of the reference.)”
Comment 24: Figure 4: I believe that the data reported in figure 4 are from a
potential ‘participant A’? Please, specify. Additionally, why data from
participants A, B and C are not reported in the same graph? Please consider
merging these two figures together. Also, in figure 5, the blue line only includes
4 data points rather than 5. Please check and correct. This graph should also
include an example of no change of drying-induced wetness sensation (r2
<0.50).
Reply: Figure 4 and 5 are put in the same graph (new number, Figure 5). There
are totally 15 data points and some of them are overlapped. Figure caption is
also revised.

Participant A sensed drop in wetness (R2 = 0.50 and a negative slope).
Participants B and C do not sense change in wetness (R2 < 0.50).
Comment 25: Page 12, line 8-10. The authors report that the constant wetness
rating in category II is mainly due to the fabric properties, given that the pre-
screening test has indicated that the participants included in the study can sense
differences in wetness. In this regard, I have a number of questions. First of all,
could the author elaborate a bit more on the textile and fabric properties which
affect the constant wetness rating and are these related to drying time?
Reply: Please see response below (Section 4.1.1, paragraph 1):
“Category (II) perception refers no sense on change in wetness of a fabric type
at different DToF. The no sense in wetness is understandable because the change
in fabric’s wetness level is too small. The wetness level can refer to the amount
of water per unit volume in fabric at different DToF (table 2). CnP, RAY, P3M
and WOL mainly fall into Category (II). Their wetness rating in Category (II)
is independent of the change of DToF (table 4). This is coherent with the
definition of Category (II) perception “no sense in change”. In addition, some
other fabrics’ results (e.g. SIL and PET) show that participants are sensitive to
wetness of fabric (sub-Section 3.8). This shows the number of data sets fall into
the categories is because of fabric properties, but not the sensitivity of
participants.”
Comment 26: Secondly, if the constant wetness rating is actually due to fabric
properties, is then correct to identify category II as ‘subjects that cannot sense
changes’? In fact, this no changes are due to the fabric and not to the
participants.
Reply: The definition of categories is revised to clarify their meanings in
manuscript (multi-locations): ‘Category (I): drop in fabric wetness can be
sensed by participant when the fabric is drying. Category (II): change in fabric
wetness cannot be sensed by participant when the fabric is drying.’
Comment 27: Finally, the experimental fabrics were applied in dynamic contact
with the skin; as such the mechanical interaction between the two surfaces
would have affected wetness perception response. It has been demonstrated that
wetness perception is related to stickiness sensations of wet material, and
stickiness sensation as well as wetness are modulated not only by the amount
of physical wetness present in the fabric but also by the surface texture
properties of the material (Raccuglia et al. 2017; Human wetness perception of
fabrics under dynamic skin contact. Textile Research Journal. doi:
10.1177/0040517517716905). For instance, very plain smooth surfaces are
perceived as more wet and stickier that rougher coarser materials,
independently of the level of physical wetness. Could this explain the highest
wetness rating of silk? Please discuss this and also include this up-to-date
literature in the introduction.
Reply: Thank you very for suggesting surface roughness of fabric as an
important factor that affect wet perception. We have also acknowledged
(Raccuglia et al. 2017; Human wetness perception of fabrics under dynamic
skin contact. Textile Research Journal. doi: 10.1177/0040517517716905) for
their contribution (in Introduction). However, all fabrics chose has small SMD
(around 2 to 5 µm, Table 2). The small range of SMD would be too small to
shown the effect of fabric roughness to wetness perception.
Comment 28: Page 12, line 55: why wetness perception ratings have been log10
transformed. Please, provide explanation in the manuscript.
Reply: In (Section 3.4, paragraph 1): “The log10 operation enables the
conduction of linear regression on the log (wetness rating) and DToF
relationship.” was provided in the manuscript.
Reviewer: 2
Comment 1: This paper carefully showed experimental data about subjective
wet perception assessment of fabrics with different drying time. The manuscript
is written with scientific care and the results have been discussed based on
thorough investigations of the data. But the results of figure 7 & 8 obtained need
cite reference in the explanation of other experiments to fortify the conclusions.
I recommend publication in this journal after minor revision.
Reply: Revised.
(Section 4.1.2, paragraph 1), “The trend of convergence in wetness rating can
be observed in figure 7. The similar wet perception when fabric dried out was
also observed in [24]
(Section 4.3, paragraph 1): “Under Category (I) perception, log (wetness rating)
has linear relationship with the amount of water per unit volume in fabric (figure
8). This agrees with the previous finding that wetness perceptions relate to
fabric saturation values [22, 23]. When amount water in fabric per unit volume
is below 150 mg/cm3, the wetness rating is almost independent with fabric type.
This also matches with conclusion drawn by Raccuglia et al. [22].”
