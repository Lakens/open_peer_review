There are issues with this manuscript as followed:
Comment 1) The major problem that I have with this study is the lack of control experiments for
the catalysis concepts.
In Table One, the author should conduct experiments with Silica alone and without the acidic
Silica to prove the activities of the catalyst. I think the author should conduct one reaction with
heat only as well cause I believe the reaction would process with heat in protonic polar solvents
such as ethanol
Comment 2) I don’t agree with the contention of page 3 “It is known that bioactive compounds
bearing imine group and variation in substitution are potential structural motifs because of
biological importance such as anticancer and antitubercular properties”. I think most of the cases,
imines are considered product and the major pharmacores are the structural motifs that are the
products of in vivo hydrolysis latter. This is very important issue that needs to be addressed.
This might be my only confusion but if I am then the readers might as well
Comment 3) I can not find any NMR spectra in the supporting information.
The proton and carbon spectra of the novel compound would be helpful for the researchers that
follow this research

This manuscript described to the synthesis of some biologically active Schiff bases using reusable
catalyst. As we know, Schiff bases are very important in organic chemistry due to its unique
structure, especially in the organometallic and medicinal chemistry. The results presented here
provide good references for both synthetic and medicinal chemists. I recommend this paper to be
published in Royal Society Open Science.
