The article titled" Development of Low Cost Non-Contact Structural Health Monitoring System
for Rotating Machinery" deals with detecting the damage in the machine parts, by capturing the
acoustic signals of the machine, while in operation. I have following concerns about this article:
1. The paper needs a proof-reading. The title itself needs reformating.
2. The discussed technique has been demonstrated for known defects. Its capability to detect
random defects is questionable.
3. This paper lacks novelty as similar work has been reported by a number of researchers.

I found the paper to be interesting and insightful. The manuscript is well written, and should be
of great interest to the readers.
In the paper entitled, ‘Development of Low Cost Non-Contact Structural Health Monitoring

non-contact data acquisition system for condition monitoring of rotating machinery. A GUI is
also developed to facilitate the user to implement the signal processing techniques in both real-

potential of this system for implementation in dynamic environment.

Dear Editors / Dear reviewers,
Thank you very much for your comments on my manuscript. I appreciate your very good assignment of
the reviewers who are high academic level experts in my research area. All of the reviewers’ comments
are very valuable and constructive for us to improve the level of my paper. I am now submitting the
revised manuscript to you via online submission system. We believe that the manuscript has been
mproved and hope it will be accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science.

for reviewer’s reference. It was concluded
from the results that the acoustic signal
amplitude was highest for 15 Hz, 25 Hz and
35 Hz rotational speeds than other rotational
speeds. Thus further experimentations were
conducted on 15 Hz, 25 Hz and 35 Hz
rotational speeds. Results for all the above
speeds have been compiled in the manuscript.

in the statistic way. Hz. The calculation for Gear Mesh Frequency
(GMF) was done and found to be 29*35=
1015 Hz. Taking into account the 5
harmonics, the maximum frequency of
interest comes out to be 1015*5= 5075 Hz.
Now according to nyquist theorem, the
sampling rate= 2 maximum frequency of
interest. So in our case sampling rate must be
2*5075= 10150 Hz. But we have chosen 12.5
kHz for the safer side.
<U+F0B7> A large amount of data (around 30000 data
points for each case) was collected for each
gear condition.
<U+F0B7> Increasing the sampling rate only increases
the frequency resolution.
<U+F0B7> 5 repetitions were conducted for each case in
order to get the average value.
We tried our best to improve the manuscript and made some changes in the manuscript. These
changes will not influence the content and framework of the paper. We appreciate for
Editors/Reviewers’ warm work earnestly, and hope that the correction will meet with approval.
Once again, thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.
