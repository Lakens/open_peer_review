This manuscript by Hodin et al is interesting – although it is an odd mix of developmental
biology and ecology with applications for biomechanics. As a result the text appears a bit too
broad for me. One is also left wondering what is the significance of the work especially as it
appears to involve a very low sample size – with regard to the independent source of data – the
parent or family. I would like to see the stats revisited. Because I am most concerned about the
methods and how the data were handled I will focus on that aspect – with a few comments
elsewhere.
1. Dendraster – crosses were set up with 2 females. Thus in my view here n=2 so that all
they can do is a t-test. Larvae are not independent data sources – they are nested in female. For
the other species n=4 so that is a bit better. Thus the conclusion on pg. 26 will need to be toned
down – unless they can avail of data from the literature to extend their inferences on application
of the phenomenon in disparate echinoids.
2. ANOVA is the statistic used, but the assimptions of ANOVA would have been violated.
ANOVA requires the data to be independent and with the degrees of freedom required only data
for the second species can be analysed df = 4-1. Also ANOVA requires data to be normal and
have homogeneity of variance.
3. What the authors might do is focus their study on the species for which they have the
most data S. purpuratus and use the one where n=2 as additional information. I can not see what
can be done with n=2.
4. The double rudiments were obtained from brood stock maintained in an artificial sea
water system. Artificial sea salts can be toxic or have negative affects on aspects of development
– especially skeleton formation. Have a read of a paper by Roberta Challener in an aquaculture
journal a couple of years ago.
5. Asymmetrical arm length of sea urchin larvae is a response variable often scored in
ecotoxicology studies – it would be interesting if the asymmetry in those studies was one sided. I
wonder if you might be able to tell from photos. These type of studies should be cited on pg 17 L
10.
6. There is considerable text on the potential biomechanical impacts of the asymmetry. One
wonders what is the magnitude of this asymmetry in the study species and if it is significant
ecologically. How much shorter are the arms – how many microns? Would one expect a small
difference to matter? The authors need to provide data on the magnitude of difference, range etc.
For the species that you nave n=4 does this differ between families?

GENERAL COMMENT
I) Change in arm length with age/size. Something seems decidedly odd about the graphs in
figures 2 - 5. Why does arm length not increase with increasing larval age/stage beyond day
25/stage C? Shouldn't all of these arms get longer as the larvae grow and increase in size? If
these numbers are correct, the authors should comment on this near absence of any increase in
arm length with age/size in the discussion.
====================================================
SPECIFIC COMMENTS (line numbers as assigned by MS Word, NOT assigned by the pdf)
Line 247- should be "two-tailed one-sample"
Line 631- As I noted in the earlier version, 'Previously undescribed' is not quite correct because,
as the authors note, such asymmetries have been described by Emlet 2009 and Collin 1997.
Fig. 3- The labeling of the lines for R and L, and the font colors, aren't consistent in these panels.
Presumably R is grey and dashed throughout but this is not so in Panels B and D.

ABSTRACT
4
5
6
7
Directional asymmetry in body form is a wide spread phenomenon in animals and plants
8
9 alike, and a functional understanding of such asymmetries can offer profound insights
10
11 into the ways in which ecology and development interface to drive evolution. Echinoids
12
13
14 (sea urchins, sand dollars and their kin) with planktotrophic development have a
15
16 bilaterally-symmetrical feeding pluteus larva that undergoes a dramatic metamorphosis
17
18 into a pentameral juvenile that enters the benthos at settlement. The earliest stage of
19
20
21 this transformation involves a directional asymmetry: the echinus rudiment will form the
22
23 oral field of the juvenile. Here we show for the first time in two echinoid species that the
24
25
larval body itself subsequently exhibits a corresponding directional asymmetry in the
26
27
28 length of the bilateral pairs of larval arms, with shorter arms on the rudiment (left) side.
29
30 We then demonstrate a mechanistic connection between the rudiment and arm length
31
32
33
asymmetries by examining rare, aberrant purple urchin larvae that have rudiments on
34
35 both the left and the right side. Our data suggest that this asymmetry is likely a broadly-
36
37 shared feature characterizing ontogeny in the class Echinoidea. We propose several
38
39
40 functional hypotheses –including developmental constraints and water column stability–
41
42 to account for this newly-identified asymmetry.

BACKGROUND
8
9 Many species of benthic invertebrates have a planktonic larval phase, which may
10
11 allow these taxa to exploit alternative resources across life history stages, increase their
12
13
14 dispersal ability and maintain connectivity among populations [1-3]. The echinoderms –
15
16 including sea urchins, sea stars and sea cucumbers– exhibit a wide variety of such
17
18 planktonic larval forms, both feeding and non-feeding [4-8]. These forms are the result
19
20
21 of evolutionary pressures which appear to shape larval morphology within the confines
22
23 of opposing functional constraints, in particular on feeding ability versus stability in the
24
25
water column [9, 10]. Specifically, feeding structures generally require large surface
26
27
28 area for particle capture, whereas stability, especially in turbulent waters, relies upon
29
30 minimal surface area [8].
31
32
33 Consistent with these proposed trade-offs are the derived, non-feeding larval
34
35
36 forms that have evolved independently and repeatedly across echinoderm taxa. Such
37
38 larvae avoid the aforementioned functional constraints on feeding versus stability, and
39
40 thus tend to be relatively simple in overall structure, with multiple ciliated bands circling
41
42
43 their spheroid bodies to facilitate movement [11]. By contrast, feeding larvae exhibit
44
45 more complex morphologies, and two classes of echinoderms –the ophiuroids (brittle
46
47 stars and basket stars) and the echinoids (sea urchins, sand dollars and kin)– have
48
49
50 independently evolved similar-looking pluteus larvae [12, 13], with 2-8 or more larval
51
52 arms supported by internal skeletal rods. These arms are used for feeding and
53
54
55
swimming, provide structural support, and might assist in passively orienting the larvae
56
57 and offering protection from predation [14-17]).

3
The diverse echinoderm larvae described above share one key developmental
4
5
6 feature: at a certain point in larval development, a directional asymmetry appears when
7
8 juvenile structures begin to form on the left side in the otherwise bilaterally-symmetrical
9
10
11
larva. In most echinoids with feeding larvae, this asymmetry is first visible as an
12
13 invagination of ectoderm on the left side called the "echinus rudiment", which ultimately
14
15 contacts a coelomic pouch, and they jointly transform into the oral portion of the
16
17
18 pentamerally-symmetrical juvenile [18-22]. The juvenile structures will continue to grow
19
20 and differentiate until the larva reaches competence, at which point if it subsequently
21
22 encounters suitable substrate, the larva will settle irreversibly on the benthos. The
23
24
25 relationship between the juvenile and the larva is in a sense parasitic as the juvenile
26
27 structures develop at the expense of larval growth [reviewed in 23].
28
29
30 The directionally-asymmetrical rudiment invagination is particularly well studied in
31
32
33
the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Aihara and Amemiya [21]
34
35 provided strong experimental evidence that the right side of the larva is largely
36
37 responsible for differentiating the L-R axis: laterally-bisected larvae (before rudiment
38
39
40 invagination) all regenerate and develop to competence, but the larvae developing from
41
42 the left halves rarely exhibited normal L-R patterning, whereas those from the right side
43
44 almost always developed normally. More targeted removals of portions of the right side
45
46
47 also resulted in larvae with abnormal L-R patterning.
48
49
50 Recent molecular evidence has further supported this scenario of right side
51
52 control of the L-R asymmetry. The identified genes that appear to regulate L-R
53
54
55
asymmetry in urchins encode two secreted growth factor-like proteins – Nodal and
56
57 Lefty– and the Pitx2 paired-class homeodomain protein, all three of which are

marker genes [25]. Additionally, a H,K-ATPase-like protein also appears to be
12
13 important, most likely via either H+ or K+ gradients that occur upstream of the
14
15 asymmetric gene expression of nodal, lefty and pitx2 [26].
16
17
18 Here we show that concomitant with this L-R asymmetry in rudiment formation is
19
20
21 an asymmetry of the larval arms in advanced echinoid pluteus larvae that has not
22
23 previously been described. We first document the asymmetry in two disparate echinoids
24
25
separated by 250 million years, suggesting that this asymmetry may be a common
26
27
28 feature among echinoids with feeding larvae. We further explore the phenomenon in S.
29
30 purpuratus to evaluate the possible connection between the rudiment and larval arm
31
32
33
asymmetries, and by examining aberrant larvae with rudiments on both the left and right
34
35 sides. We discuss our results in the context of several hypotheses concerning the
36
37 function of this newly-identified asymmetry in sea urchin plutei. In so doing, we highlight
38
39
40 the ways in which directional asymmetries offer a unique window into how ecology and
41
42 development work together to drive organismal evolution.

4
5
6 The adults were maintained at Friday Harbor Labs (FHL; Friday Harbor, WA, USA) in
7
8 flowing sea water in sand bins until spawning. On August 26, 2015, we spawned
9
10
11
several adults by intra-coelomic injection with 0.5M KCl. We set up crosses from two
12
13 females: one by standard methods [27] using sperm collected dry that same day from a
14
15 single spawning male, the second by aspirating off the eggs from the aboral surface of a
16
17
18 second female who began spawning after we returned her to an aquarium. This second
19
20 female's eggs were already fertilized, therefore we are unsure of the paternity in this
21
22 second cross (several males were also spawning in the aquarium at that time, including
23
24
25 the male from the first cross). Thus, the two crosses were either half sibs from different
26
27 mothers, non-sibs, or a mixture. We conducted fertilizations and all subsequent rearing
28
29
30
steps in 0.45 µm Millipore-filtered natural sea water (MFSW) at room temperature,
31
32 which varied between 19 and 22°C.
33
34
35 Sand dollar embryos had hatched by 1 day after fertilization, at which point we
36
37 set up one jar from each cross at approximately 1 larva/ml of MFSW, and fed them a
38
39
40 combination of Rhodomonas spp. (2500 cells/ml) and Dunaliella tertiolecta (3000
41
42 cells/ml), and kept them gently stirred using a gyratory shaker table. We changed their
43
44 water every 2 days by gentle reverse filtration of >95% of the water volume and gave
45
46
47 the larvae fresh MFSW and food. On day 3 (comparable to soft tissue stage iii from
48
49 [22]), we reduced the larval density to 1 larva/5 ml MFSW, and maintained them at that
50
51
density until day 9 (more or less equivalent to skeletogenic stage 10 from [22]) when we
52
53
54 conducted all larval arm measurements.

For the characterization of the corresponding arm-length asymmetries in purple
4
5
6 urchins as well as the ontogenetic characterizations and feeding trials, we used adult
7
8 Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Stimpson), collected at Slip Point (Clallam Bay, WA,
9
10
11
USA) and maintained in subtidal cages suspended off the floating docks at FHL, fed
12
13 throughout the year ad libitum with drift kelp (mainly blades of Nereocystis leutkeana).
14
15 We spawned 2 males and 2 females on March 27, 2015 at FHL, by intra-coelomic
16
17
18 injection with 0.5M KCl. We then set up the four pairwise fertilizations in MFSW using
19
20 standard methods [27] at 11°C. We transported embryos the next day to the University
21
22 of Washington (Seattle, WA, USA) and continued to maintain the cultures at 11°C. On
23
24
25 day 5, when the embryos had reached the late prism/early 4-arm larval stage, we set up
26
27 a single gallon jar in MFSW at approximately 1 larva/ml from equal proportions of the 4
28
29
fertilizations, fed them a combination of Dunaliella tertiolecta and Rhodomonas spp. as
30
31
32 described above, and over about an hour, warmed the culture to 15°C in a shaking
33
34 water bath, where we maintained all cultures for the remainder of the experiment. Every
35
36
37 two days, we cleaned the cultures and fed them as described above.
38
39
40 On day 15, most of the larvae had reached the rudiment invagination stage (soft
41
42 tissue stage i from [22]), at which point we reduced the larval density to approximately 1
43
44 larva/1.3 ml MFSW, and then to 1 larva/2 ml MFSW on day 17, with food at the same
45
46
47 concentration as previously. On day 20 (approximately soft tissue stage iv from [22]),
48
49 we individually selected 1000 of the optimally developing larvae, reduced the density to
50
51
1 larva/6 ml, and fed them as before. This stepwise reduction in density was an attempt
52
53
54 to limit bouts of asexual budding, which can be induced by sudden shifts in density

10
11 larvae into each of 6 jars with 500 ml MFSW (so still at 1 larva/6 ml) and randomly
12
13
14 assigned each jar to one of two treatments: 3 replicate jars of high food (full ration of
15
16 Dunaliella:Rhodomonas at 1:4 cells/µl) and 3 replicate jars of low food (25% ration at
17
18 0.25:1 cells/µl) for the remainder of the experiment. Approximately 50% of the larvae in
19
20
21 the high food treatment had reached metamorphic competence by day 42; the low food
22
23 larvae had not quite reached metamorphic competence by the time we concluded the
24

experiment on day 45.

29
For the "double rudiment" experiment we used purple urchins originally obtained
30
31 from The Cultured Abalone Ltd. (Goleta, California, USA) and that we have maintained
32
33 at the Hagen Aqualab at the University of Guelph (Guelph, Ontario) in an artificial
34
35
36 seawater system on an 8:16 hr light:dark photoperiod at approximately 12ºC and 34 ppt
37
38 salinity, fed ad libitum with rehydrated Kombu kelp (Laminaria spp.). Over the last
39
40 several years, we have repeatedly noted an unusually high proportion (approximately 2-
41
42
43 5%; data not shown) of offspring of these urchins that exhibit rudiments on both their
44
45 right and the left sides – so-called "double rudiments"– a phenomenon typically seen in
46
47 fewer than 1% of larvae [29]; our unpublished observations). In September 2013, we
48
49
50 obtained gametes from one male and one female adult S. purpuratus by intracoelomic
51
52 injection following protocols described above. After fertilization and hatching, we set up
53
54
55
cultures at an approximate density of 1 larva/2 ml of 0.45 µm Millipore filtered artificial
56
57 sea water (MFASW), agitated to prevent the larvae from settling out of the water

9
10
11
days post-fertilization. We then stage-matched equal numbers of these individuals to
12
13 randomly selected siblings with single rudiments, and assessed asymmetry as in the
14

21 Staging and Measurements
22
23
24 In FHL, we measured ten live 9-day old sand dollar larvae from each of the two
25
26 crosses, gently immobilized on slides under raised cover glass, using an Olympus BH-2
27
28
29 microscope. In Seattle, we staged and measured live purple urchin larvae, immobilized
30
31 as above, using a Leitz Wetzlar Ortholux microscope. For the purple urchins, we
32
33
34
employed the staging scheme as outlined in [22]. Note that we used stage bins (as
35
36 defined in the legend to Fig. 2) for the analyses of the urchin data in an attempt to
37
38 equalize the numbers of individuals within each bin for this dataset. In both FHL and
39
40
41 Seattle, we measured skeletal rod lengths on haphazardly-chosen larvae using a
42
43 calibrated ocular micrometer, and calculated the z-axis offset of each measured skeletal
44
45 rod using the gradated focus knob, which we had calibrated using a slide and cover
46
47
48 glass of known thickness (measured with a micron caliper).
49
50
51 To account for possible measurement error and/or bias in our measurements, we
52
53 used larvae fertilized and reared in Guelph as described above, but from an August 3,
54
55
56
2015 fertilization. On day 21, we packed and shipped overnight approximately 200 of

these live larvae to Seattle, in order to conduct the error measurements on the Leitz
4
5
6 microscope set-up used for the majority of our data (see above). The larvae arrived in
7
8 good condition on day 22 at approximately 13°C, and we conducted the error
9
10
11
measurements on that day as follows. We haphazardly chose 20 larvae and placed
12
13 them on individual microscope slides with raised cover glass as described above, and
14
15 then staged and measured each one as above. Then, a colleague uninvolved in the
16
17
18 study re-labeled all 20 slides and we re-measured each of the 20 larvae a second time;
19
20 thus, the second measurement on these same larvae was done “blind.” We calculated
21
22 measurement error using the difference between each of the paired measurements, and
23
24
25 used this error calculation to ensure that any reported differences in L-R asymmetry fell
26
27 outside of the experimentation error range (Supplementary material).
28
29
30 For the double rudiment experiment, we staged larvae under a Nikon Eclipse Ti
31
32
33
microscope, according to our published staging scheme (see Tables 1 and 2 in [22]),
34
35 and we made three-dimensional "z-stacks" (pictures taken at 10 µm steps through the
36
37 larvae) with a Nikon Digital sight DS-Fi1 camera. We then conducted measurements on
38
39
40 these z-stacks using a 3D measurement macro (calibrated to account for both the x-y
41
42 and z-y plane distances covered) using ImageJ software Fiji. We measured postoral
43
44 (PO), posterodorsal (PD) and anterolateral (ALA) arm lengths on the rudiment and non-
45
46
47 rudiment sides of the larvae.
48
49
50 As indicated in Figures 1A and 2C, the PO and PD rods are relatively straight, so
51
52 our calculation of these skeletal rod lengths were straight-forward. By contrast, the
53
54
55
preoral (PRO) and ALA rods are somewhat curved in both species. Our reported PRO
56
57 and ALA rod lengths represent the linear distance between the landmarks indicated in

12 Statistical Analysis

16

18
19
20 further specified in the Results section and Supplementary material. We considered
21
22 results “significant” if a was < 0.05. We report all results as ± one standard error unless
23
24
stated otherwise. We conducted our principle component (PC) analyses using SPSS
25
26
27 factor commands using regression analysis. PCs with eigenvectors >1 were extracted.

commands.

7
8
9 We measured all eight larval arms of D. excentricus 9 days post-fertilization at
10
11 ~20°C; we analyzed differences in arm lengths between the left and right side of the
12
13
14 larva (Fig. 1). We found that the postoral (PO) arms of D. excentricus larvae were
15
16 significantly shorter on the side of the juvenile rudiment (left side) compared to the right
17
18 side (F1,19=7.60, p<0.01). We did not find differences in arm length between the left and
19
20
21 right side of D. excentricus larvae for the other three pairs of arms [posterodorsal (PD:
22
23 F1,19=2.38, p=0.13); anterolateral (ALA: F1,19=0.06, p=0.81); and preoral (PRO:
24
25
F1,19=0.10, p=0.76); see Supplementary material for complete ANOVA results]. A
26
27
28 principle component (PC) analysis using all arm lengths extracted one PC that
29
30 explained 69% of the total variance in arm lengths (Supplementary material) but did not
31
32
33
show any difference between the left and right side of the larva (F1,20=1.51; p=0.23).
34
35 Note also that we setup two separate fertilizations (crosses) for this experiment and we
36
37 did not find a significant interaction between cross and side for any arm pairs (PO:
38
39
40 F1,1,19=0.29, p=0.59; ALA: F1,1,19=0.01, p=0.92; PD: F1,1,19=0.31, p=0.58; F1,1,19=0.01,
41
42 p=0.93). This indicates that asymmetry patterns are not different between the two
43

Larvae of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, show directional
4
5
6 asymmetry in larval arm growth that changes over ontogeny
7
8
9 To determine if the late-stage asymmetry we observed in sand dollar larvae is a
10
11 more widespread feature among echinoids, and to examine how any effect progresses
12
13
14 during ontogeny, we examined arm asymmetry in the purple sea urchin S. purpuratus at
15
16 four time points post-fertilization. We then analyzed arm length morphometrics as a
17
18 function of age (dPF) and binned stage (see Fig. 2 legend for details).
19
20
21 Based upon the sand dollar data and our preliminary observations on S.
22
23
24 purpuratus larvae, we expected asymmetry to first become manifest in later
25
26 development, after the juvenile rudiment begins to form. Therefore, our earliest
27
28
29
measurement date was on day 15, right around the time when we first observed
30
31 rudiment invagination (Fig. 2D). We made additional measurements during the growth
32
33 of the juvenile rudiment on days 25, 33 and finally on day 39 (Fig. 2E), at which point
34
35
36 the larvae were at or near competence to transform to the juvenile stage (not shown).
37
38
39 Three of the four arm pairs in S. purpuratus larvae showed directional asymmetry
40
41 across developmental ages (Fig. 2A; PO: F1,54=6.35, p=0.01; PD: F1,54=4.43, p=0.04;
42
43 ALA: F1,54=9.48, p<0.01), with shorter arms on the left (juvenile rudiment) side.
44
45
46 Furthermore, we found that asymmetry increases as a function of age for PO and PD, in
47
48 that these arm pairs show directional asymmetry starting on day 39 (Fig. 2A; PO:
49
50
F1,14=6.35, p=0.02; PD: F1,14=12.12, p<0.01). By contrast, ALA arms only showed
51
52
53 directional asymmetry on day 33 (Fig. 2A; F1,30=16.21, p<0.01).

When we grouped the larvae into binned stages (regardless of age; Fig. 2B), we
4
5
6 found evidence for arm pair asymmetry across stages in PO (F1,54=5.43, p=0.02); PD
7
8 (F1,54=3.94, p=0.05) and ALA arms ( F1,54=9.84, p<0.01). Specifically, we detected arm
9
10
11
asymmetries for ALA only at stage bin D (Fig. 2B; F1,13=7.56, p=0.01). and for PO and
12
13 PD only in stage bin F (Fig. 2B; PO: F1,14=4.70, p=0.04; PD: F1,14=10.45, p<0.01). We
14
15 summarize the ANOVA results in Supplementary material, where we also present the
16
17
18 results for a principle component (PC) analysis of arm lengths across age and stage for
19
20 S. purpuratus. As a whole, the results of the PC analysis are consistent with the
21
22 analysis of individual arms lengths described above.
23
24
25
Although it is not the focus of the current study, we undertook an analysis of
26
27
28 these data for the presence of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) as well. We see no
29
30 convincing evidence for FA in any of the stages that we examined (see Supplementary
31
32
33
material for details).
34
35
36 In sum, arm length asymmetry in S. purpuratus larvae increases with age and
37
38 stage in PO and PD arms, but the pattern is more complex with ALA arms.
39
40
41
42
43
44 Food does not affect larval arm asymmetry in S. purpuratus
45
46
47 One hypothesis that could explain the previously noted directional asymmetries
48
49 is that there is competition for limited resources or materials between the rudiment and
50
51
52 the nearby left arms. If so, we might expect to observe a more dramatic asymmetry in
53
54 larvae raised in food limited conditions, where such materials/resources would be in
55
56 reduced supply.

3
To test this hypothesis, we reared larvae under a high food ration for 25 days,
4
5
6 and then shifted a subset of the larvae into a reduced food ration (25% of the high food
7
8 ration) for the remainder of larval development. We then analyzed changes in arm size
9
10
11
as a function of age and stage for the low food- and high food-reared larvae.
12
13
14 Plasticity in larval arm growth overall as a function of food level has been well
15
16 demonstrated in S. purpuratus and numerous other echinoids [reviewed in 23]: in
17
18 general, larvae under low food conditions have longer arms relative to growth of juvenile
19
20
21 structures. In our dataset, we did not observe arm length plasticity (i.e., an effect of food
22
23 level) for any arms as a function of age (Fig. 3; PO: F1,89=3.52, p=0.06; ALA: F1,89=0.14,
24
25
p=0.71; PD: F1,89=2.86, p=0.09; PR: F1,89=0.01, p=0.92). We did however observe arm
26
27
28 length plasticity for all arm pairs as a function of binned stage (Fig. 4; PO: F1,89=21.19,
29
30 p<0.01; ALA: F1,89=3.85, p=0.05; PD: F1,89=11.97, p<0.01; PR: F1,89=5.62, p=0.02). We
31
32
33
summarize the ANOVA results from the food experiment in Supplementary material.
34
35
36 We then tested whether food environment would impact the extent of arm
37
38 asymmetry in S. purpuratus larvae. Statistically, such a food effect on arm length
39
40 asymmetry would manifest as a significant interaction between food treatment (high or
41
42
43 low) and side (L or R). We did not find evidence for a statistically significant interaction
44
45 between food treatment and directional asymmetry for any larval arms (i.e., a difference
46
47 in length between the left and right side) either by age or by stage (Figs. 3 and 4;
48

We analyzed aberrant larvae with naturally occurring double rudiments (i.e.,

9 larvae with “twin” juvenile rudiments developing simultaneously on the right and left
10
11 sides) to test the hypothesis that larval arm asymmetry is functionally linked to the
12
13
14 formation of the juvenile rudiment (Fig. 5A-E). In our double rudiment larvae, none of
15
16 the arm pairs showed signs of directional asymmetry (PO: F1,7=0.28, p=0.60; PD:
17
18 F1,7=1.17, p=0.30; ALA: F1,7=0.00, p=0.96), whereas their full siblings with single
19
20
21 rudiments showed directional asymmetry in PO arms (Fig. 5A; PO: F1,8=6.17, p=0.02;

31 DISCUSSION
32
33 Metamorphosis in extant echinoderms involves a transformation from a bilateral
34
35
36 larva to a pentameral adult [30, 31]. Because the common ancestor of echinoderms and
37
38 other deuterostomes is hypothesized to have had an adult with bilateral symmetry
39
40
41
[reviewed in 32], this bilateral-to-pentameral shift during echinoderm ontogeny is
42
43 considered key to understanding the evolution of this unique group [33-35].
44
45
46 In all living echinoderms with indirect development (sensu McEdward [6]), the
47
48 adult body plan develops in a curious fashion with respect to that of the larva, via a
49
50
51 directional asymmetry: the juvenile forms on the left side of the otherwise bilaterally
52
53 symmetrical larva [18-22]. Here we show for the first time that in two disparate
54
55 echinoids, a sea urchin and a sand dollar, a second directional asymmetry is apparent
56
57
58 during late larval development: the majority of the larval arms, which are supported by

calcium carbonate skeletal rods, are substantially (approximately 11%; see Figs. 1 and
4
5
6 2) shorter on the rudiment side of the larva.
7
8
9 Although asymmetries in larval arms have been noted previously in echinoid
10
11 larvae [36-38], ours is the first demonstration of such a unidirectional asymmetry in
12
13
14 multiple arms. As in the only other reported case of a directional asymmetry in
15
16 advanced pluteus larval arms [37, 38], we show evidence here for a link between
17
18 formation of the rudiment and the arm length asymmetry, with shorter larval arms
19
20
21 specifically on the rudiment (left) side. Our demonstration of this asymmetry in both an
22
23 irregular and a regular echinoid, as well as our casual observations of such
24
25
asymmetries in the larvae of several other echinoid taxa which we have reared (data not
26
27
28 shown), suggest to us that this directional asymmetry in arm length is likely a generic
29
30 feature of late-stage, echinoid larval development, and as such, it calls out for a
31
32
33
functional explanation.

38
39 Possible developmental mechanisms underlying larval arm asymmetry
40
41
42 The molecular and developmental mechanisms establishing rudiment formation
43
44 on the left side of the larva have been studied in some detail. Specifically, Nodal and
45
46 BMP signaling are the primary factors responsible for the development of the juvenile
47
48
49 rudiment on the left side of the sea urchin larva. Whereas BMP signaling on the left side
50
51 of the larva is required for the activation of other asymmetrically-expressed genes,
52
53
54
Nodal signal on the right side of the larva inhibits BMP signaling there, thus directing the

formation of the rudiment to the left side [24, 25, 39, 40]. Still, the consequences of this
4
5
6 asymmetry for development of the larval arms is unclear.
7
8
9 If the BMP-Nodal gene network is likewise involved in our reported arm length
10
11 asymmetries, then we would predict that the arm length asymmetries would first appear
12
13
14 at approximately the same developmental stage as rudiment formation begins. This is
15
16 not what we have observed. Indeed, at soft tissue stage iv [22] (stage bin A, day 25 in
17
18 this experiment) rudiment formation was already well underway and we did not observe
19
20
21 any directional asymmetries in arm length, which we first detected at skeletal stage 5-6
22
23 [22] (stage bin D, day 33 in this experiment; Figure 2).
24
25
26 These observations suggest that if the BMP-Nodal gene network that regulates
27
28
29
asymmetric rudiment formation is also involved in the directional arm asymmetry, then
30
31 its involvement in the latter is likely to be either indirect, or to involve subsequent
32
33 signaling steps. Still, our data reported here on double rudiments do suggest that there
34
35
36 is a mechanistic connection between rudiment asymmetry and the arm length
37
38 directional asymmetry, as also reported by Emlet [38] for the posterolateral arm length
39
40 asymmetry in the black sea urchin, Stomopneustes variolaris (Echinoidea:
41
42
43 Stomopneustidae). Evaluating the nature of this mechanistic connection could involve
44
45 examining arm asymmetries in the context of reduction-of-function manipulations (e.g.,
46
47 using morpholino oligonucleotides) directed against BMP or nodal signaling
48
49
50 components. Specifically, one could experimentally generate double rudiment larvae,
51
52 for example by inhibiting Nodal signaling [24], and test whether such a manipulation
53
54
55
results in loss of the directional asymmetry, as we saw in our naturally-occurring double
56
57 rudiment larvae. If BMP-Nodal signaling is indeed connected to the arm length

3
asymmetries, then it is possible that the expression of skeletal elongation genes such
4
5
6 as p58b and p16 [41, 42], and the skeletogenic gene network to which they belong [43],
7
8 may integrate with the BMP-nodal gene network in an as yet unrecognized fashion.

11
12
13
14 Functional implications of the asymmetry for larval biology
15
16
17 The antagonistic relationship between rudiment growth and arm length in feeding
18
19
20 pluteus larvae has been well-described in numerous taxa. Specifically, echinoid larvae
21
22 show adaptive phenotypic plasticity for arm growth relative to growth of the rudiment:
23
24
under high food conditions, arm length is reduced relative to rudiment growth; under low
25
26
27 food, arms grow longer and rudiment growth is delayed [9, 23, 44-62]. The adaptive
28
29 nature of this plasticity is indicated by the increased food capture efficiency in larvae
30
31
32
with longer arms [9].
33
34
35 Therefore, there is presumably a mechanistic connection between rudiment
36
37 growth and arm length, and it may be that this same antagonistic connection underlies
38
39 the late stage arm-length asymmetries reported here and by Yanagisawa [37] and
40
41
42 Emlet [38]. But why would such an antagonistic connection only manifest on the left side
43
44 of the larva during these late stages? Here we consider two functional hypotheses in
45
46 turn for our observed directional asymmetries in arm length. According to the
47
48
49 developmental constraint hypothesis, the asymmetries that we report here result from
50
51 some type of local developmental constraint or trade-off, in which the rudiment grows at
52
53
54
the expense of only the adjacent larval arms. Alternatively, the swimming stability

Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 20 of 41
MS: Hodin et al. Left-right asymmetry in larval sea urchins 25 February 2016
1
2
3
hypothesis predicts that this link is driven by selection on a specific, asymmetric larval
4
5
6 shape that facilitates stability or some other aspect of performance in the water column.
7
8
9 The developmental constraint hypothesis envisions a scenario where some
10
11 factor utilized in the construction of both the rudiment and the larval arms is in limited
12
13
14 supply. The increasing demands in the rapidly growing rudiment for this hypothesized
15
16 factor leaves less of it available for the growth of nearby larval arms, and the result is
17
18 shorter larval arms adjacent to the rudiment.
19
20
21 Although our experiments are not sufficient to falsify this hypothesis, our results
22
23
24 are not wholly consistent with it. On the one hand, the left larval arm that is most distant
25
26 from the rudiment –the left preoral (PRO) arm– shows no evidence for directional
27
28
29
asymmetry in either D. excentricus or S. purpuratus, thus offering some support for a
30
31 local constraint related to the rudiment. Furthermore, the constraint hypothesis would
32
33 predict that the local competition would become more pronounced as the rudiment
34
35
36 grows ever larger and more complex as ontogeny proceeds; our developmental time
37
38 series with S. purpuratus (see Figure 2) is more or less consistent with this prediction.
39
40 However, under a reduced food scenario, where arms grow longer and rudiment growth
41
42
43 is delayed, then the constraint hypothesis would seemingly predict an even more
44
45 dramatic asymmetry in such larvae. This is not what we observed; we saw no difference
46
47 in the observed asymmetry between food treatments.
48
49
50
Therefore, our data provide mixed support for the constraint hypothesis. Still
51
52
53 there is some precedence in other developing organisms for such a hypothesized local
54
55 competition for factors or resources. For example, the wing-reproduction tradeoff in
56
57
58
monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) has been proposed to be related to a position-

3
dependent mechanism, where juvenile hormone -produced in the brain- travels in the
4
5
6 hemolymph past the wings and through the thorax, ultimately reaching the gonads in
7
8 the posterior. Lessman and Herman [63] hypothesized that the highly active thorax
9
10
11
during long-distance flight acts like a gauntlet, breaking down active juvenile hormone
12
13 as it passes, leaving lower levels to arrive at the gonad, and therefore leading to
14
15 reduced gonadal growth during flight. A second proposed example is in horned beetles
16
17
18 (Onthophagus spp.) and other insects, where a factor such as insulin may be in limited
19
20 supply, and could account for the apparent trade-off in the sizes of adjacent structures
21
22 [64-66; but see 67].
23
24
25
In the urchin pluteus example, what could such a factor be? One appealing
26
27
28 possibility relates to the availability of calcium, which is used to construct both the
29
30 skeletal rods that support the larval arms and the diverse juvenile skeletal elements
31
32
33
forming in the rudiment at late larval stages; these processes may thus be in direct,
34
35 local competition. A simple experiment that would test for calcium limitation would be to
36
37 add additional calcium to the sea water in which the larvae are grown – if calcium within
38
39
40 the larvae at these late stages is normally in limited supply, then the asymmetry could
41
42 be attenuated or disappear if excess calcium is provided. Alternatively, one could block
43
44 calcium transport into the tissues of the rudiment through morpholino microinjection [68]
45
46
47 or treatment with chemical inhibitors, and test whether such treatments result in more
48
49 symmetrical larvae than in controls. Indirect evidence for this calcium limitation
50
51
hypothesis follows from the findings of Byrne et al. [69], who reported that Heliocidaris
52
53
54 tuberculata (Echinoidea: Echinometridae) larvae reared at low pH showed notable
55
56 asymmetries (presumably FA) at early larval stages.

3
A second intriguing possibility is that the local rudiment-arm length antagonism is
4
5
6 regulated by thyroid hormone (TH) signaling. Our previous studies [57] demonstrated
7
8 that TH treatment results in a phenotype similar to that previously described for low food
9
10
11
treatments, where juvenile structures grow faster, and larval arm growth is suppressed.
12
13 Experiments with TH synthesis inhibitors [32, 70-72] indicate that feeding larvae have
14
15 the capacity to produce TH internally, and our unpublished immuno-labeling
16
17
18 experiments indicate that the source for TH may be structures within the rudiment.
19
20 Therefore, if the rudiment is indeed the source for TH in plutei, and if TH levels correlate
21
22 negatively with arm growth, then one might expect arms near to the rudiment to be
23
24
25 shorter than ones more distant: this is precisely what we have observed here. A simple
26
27 test of this scenario would be to provide excess TH exogenously and see if the
28
29
30
observed asymmetries disappear.
31
32
33
Finally, additional support for biased L-R allocation of materials in pluteus larvae
34
35 comes from some intriguing observations on sea star bipinnaria larvae, whose feeding
36
37 larvae are considered homologous to echinoid plutei [73]. Circulation of fluid in the
38
39
40 blastocoel cavity of bipinnaria larvae has been described as largely unidirectional: from
41
42 the stomach, along the left side of the larva, and then around the mouth to the right side
43
44 of the larva [74; Jaeckle, pers. comm.]. Furthermore, coelomic fluid flow out of the left
45
46
47 hydrocoel via the pore canal and hydropore to the exterior of the larva [72] would tend
48
49 to draw blastocoelar fluid towards the left side [76], with the growing rudiment in later
50
51
stage larvae thus being a possible sink for blastocoelar substances. This biased
52
53
54 directional flow could therefore represent a mechanistic basis for uneven distribution of
55
56 blastocoelar substances, leading to the asymmetries that we report here.

3
As for the swimming stability hypothesis, it proposes that the asymmetry in larval
4
5
6 arms would provide a selective advantage to larvae, whereby asymmetrical larvae
7
8 would, for example, sink more slowly (and thus be retained in the water column more
9
10
11
efficiently) than symmetrical larvae. Such an asymmetry would be predictably directional
12
13 due to the substantial asymmetry in ballast provided by the rapidly growing and
14
15 calcifying rudiment, predominantly on the left side of the larva.
16
17
18 Indirect support for this hypothesis comes from several examples in the literature.
19
20
21 First, Collin [36] found evidence for fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in early, pre-rudiment
22
23 larval stages of the sand dollar D. excentricus. FA is widely viewed as a measure of
24
25
developmental stability and perturbations to the developmental process can have both
26
27
28 genetic and environmental causes [77]. Nevertheless, the apparent continuity between
29
30 FA in larval arms earlier in ontogeny [36], and then directional asymmetry (DA) later
31
32
33
(our data reported here) may indicate that the asymmetries themselves may be
34
35 functional throughout ontogeny. In this case, the forming rudiment in late stages (which
36
37 were beyond Collin's final time point in her data set) might impose additional constraints
38
39
40 that could lead to predictably shorter arms on the left.
41
42
43 Chan [78] reviewed a number of studies on pluteus larval morphology as it
44
45 relates to stability and swimming, under different flow regimes and through ontogeny.
46
47 The basic pattern that Chan reports is a slight tilt in the orientation of the larval body in
48
49
50 flow increases the chances that a larva can maintain upward swimming (and thus
51
52 presumably stay in surface waters), rather than being carried downward. In an
53
54
55
unpublished study, Miyashita (pers. comm.) discovered that modeled, asymmetrical D.

2
3
excentricus larvae at the 4-arm stage (pre-rudiment growth) are able to maintain upward
4
5
6 swimming more effectively than symmetrical ones.
7
8
9 The models that Chan and Miyashita employed were based upon those
10
11 developed by Clay and Grunbaum [10], again using the sand dollar D. excentricus, but
12
13
14 once again focusing on early (4 arm) larval stages before the development of the
15
16 rudiment. One important set of parameters in this model relate to the centers of gravity
17
18 and buoyancy, which would clearly change with the addition of two more pairs of larval
19
20
21 arms and an asymmetric, calcified rudiment, as seen in the stages that we examined.
22
23 Furthermore, drag on larvae increases with both arm length and arm number [15], which
24
25
would be predicted to impact the stability of larvae in different flow regimes [8].
26
27
28
29
Taken together, the studies to date suggest that larval shape, orientation and
30
31 asymmetries all can contribute to position in the water column, which can have
32
33 important consequences for dispersal, prey encounter and predator avoidance
34
35
36 throughout larval development, and encountering the substrate in late stage larvae
37
38 preparing to settle to the benthos. Nevertheless, it is difficult to extrapolate from the
39
40 previous modeling studies on much simpler larval morphologies to those in fully formed,
41
42
43 8-arm larvae with an asymmetrically growing and calcifying rudiment in realistic flow
44
45 conditions.
46
47
48 Our experiments reported here do not directly address the swimming stability
49
50
hypothesis. However, one intriguing observation is that the three arm pairs that protrude
51
52
53 the furthest from the larval midline –the postoral, posterodorsal and anterolateral arms–
54
55 are the three pairs that showed clear directional asymmetries in one or both species. By
56
57
58 contrast, the arm pair that runs closest to the midline –the preoral arms– showed no
59

2
3
signs of directional asymmetry in either species at any age or stage that we examined.
4
5
6 Likewise, the observations by Yanagisawa [37] and Emlet [38] of a dramatic asymmetry
7
8 in late stage larvae of the sea urchin Stomopneustes variolaris was specifically in a
9
10
11
unique pair of arms that project off the posterior end of those larvae, the posterolateral
12
13 arms. All of these observations suggest that asymmetric arm growth is not simply a
14
15 generic feature of late-stage pluteus larval arm growth common to all arms, and may
16
17
18 thus point towards a functional explanation such as envisioned by the swimming
19
20 stability hypothesis.
21
22
23 To adequately test this hypothesis experimentally, one would need to examine
24
25
larvae under realistic flow conditions, and see if the degree of asymmetry in late stage
26
27
28 larvae is related to their position in the water column. In addition, one could develop
29
30 more complex models of the pluteus larval form that would extend from the Clay &
31
32
33
Grunbaum [10] model, but include all four arm pairs and a growing and calcifying,
34
35 asymmetrical rudiment. The swimming stability hypothesis would predict that arm
36
37 asymmetries at these later stages would have clear consequences for position in the
38
39
40 water column and/or swimming ability.
41
42
43 Finally, we note that the developmental constraint and swimming stability
44
45 hypotheses are not the only two possible explanations for our observed asymmetries
46
47 (and these themselves are not necessarily mutually exclusive). For example, in recent
48
49
50 years it has become clear that asexual larval reproduction is widespread in echinoids
51
52 (which again, has been particularly well-documented in D. excentricus), and one
53
54
55
method of such asexual budding in sea stars [79, 80] – as yet undocumented in
56
57 echinoids [but see 28] – is a loss of the arm tips. It is possible that such budding occurs

preferentially on the left side of late-stage echinoid larvae, which would lead to a
4
5
6 directional asymmetry pattern such as we observed. Furthermore, Emlet [38] suggested
7
8 that the asymmetry in posterolateral arms in Stomopneustes variolaris may be an
9
10
11
adaptation for more effective settlement to the benthos: a long left posterolateral arm
12
13 could interfere with substrate contact. A similar mechanical interference scenario might
14
15 promote the evolution of shorter arms in late stages in other urchins as well, as we have
16
17
18 observed here.

22
23
24 CONCLUSIONS
25
26
27 We here identify and characterize the ontogeny of a directional asymmetry in
28
29 echinoid pluteus larvae that is visible at late stages, alongside the well-known
30
31
32
directional asymmetry in the growing juvenile rudiment. Our data from two disparate
33
34 echinoids, separated by approximately 250 million years of evolution, suggests that this
35
36 asymmetry, though previously undescribed, may in fact be a common feature of late
37
38
39 stage echinopluteus ontogeny. By examining rare, aberrant plutei with juvenile
40
41 rudiments on both the left and the right side, we show that the asymmetry is
42
43 mechanistically and/or functionally connected to rudiment development. We explore
44
45
46 several hypotheses to account for this asymmetry, focusing on two main hypotheses:
47
48 that the asymmetry aids in swimming stability in the water column or that the asymmetry
49
50
is a result of a developmental constraint on material deposition in arms versus the
51
52
53 rudiment.

One feature of echinoids that makes them such a valuable taxon for comparative
4
5
6 studies is their great morphological diversity in the context of a relatively robust
7
8 understanding of their phylogeny. As with adult features, sea urchin larvae also show
9
10
11
remarkable diversity: for example, in arm number, their lengths relative to the body and
12
13 their position [81]. Furthermore, there are many independently evolved instances of loss
14
15 of larval feeding, accompanied by partial to complete loss of these larval arms [82]. And
16
17
18 finally, functional and anatomical studies indicate that the similar larval morphology in
19

21
22 acquisition of the pluteus form [12, 13]. Such diversity in form, with independent
23
24
25 evolutionary events and an easily quantifiable morphology, provides ample material for
26
27 detailed comparative investigations into this directional asymmetry: a tractable aspect of
28
29
30
functional morphology that can be studied in the context of the multiple ecological
31
32 requirements facing feeding and dispersing larvae in the ocean.

GENERAL COMMENTS
I) Results and analyses. I am puzzled why the authors present and analyse the mean±SE
of the right and left sides of arms (Figs. 1-5), because this greatly reduces their ability to
detect left-right asymmetry. For example, some individual larvae of a given age/bin will
have longer arms than others in the same age/bin, which will increase the among-
individual variation for each side measurement, even though the right arm might
consistently be longer than the left in all of those individuals.
I suggest re-doing the graphs and analyses of DA using mean {(R-L)/[(R+L)/2]}
or it’s mathematical equivalent mean [ln(R) - ln(L)] = mean (ln(R/L)) [Appendix I of
Palmer & Strobeck 2003. Fluctuating asymmetry analyses revisited. In Developmental
Instability (DI): Causes and Consequences, M. Polak, ed. Oxford University Press,
Oxford. pp. 279-319]. Then, for each arm, the data will be actual mean asymmetry in
that arm rather than mean lengths of R and L. The statistical test for DA is then simple:
does the mean, signed asymmetry {mean (ln(R) - ln(L))} differ significantly from zero?
The difference ln(R) - ln(L) has the added desirable property that it expresses asymmetry
as a proportion of the mean (a value of 0.1 would mean that the difference between sides
is 10% of the mean arm length).
II) Figures. In the graphs (Fig. 2A, B; Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5), I suggest graphing on a
double-Y graph i) average arm length and ii) average asymmetry [mean (ln(R) - ln(L))]
for each time period or stage bin. This way readers can see how both arm length and arm
asymmetry differ or change over time.
III) Supplementary results. ALL references to the "Supplementary Material" should
refer to specific, numbered tables in the Supplementary Material file (see more detailed
comments under Supplementary Information file below).
III) Citations. Are all these citations needed? In several places where blocks of
citations that support a single point are only mentioned once, might a single citation work
to support the statement? For example, no less than 18(!) references [44-62] are cited
only once to support the point that arm lengths are plastic in response to food levels.
Maybe choose the one citation that is also cited elsewhere in the text.
Having said this, I'm a tad surprised the authors don't cite:
Eaves 2005. Potential for paired vestibules in plutei (Echinodermata, Echinoidea).
Invertebrate Biology 124(2): 174–184.
Eaves presents extensive data on the prevalence of right vestibules in both
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Dendraster excentricus larvae (see her Table 1
footnote).
Page -2-
====================================================
SPECIFIC COMMENTS (page/line)
2/9: 'profound' here seems rather over the top to me
2/23-27: 'For the first time' is not correct because, as the authors note later, such arm
asymmetries have been described by Emlet 2009 and Collin 1997.
2/32: If you believe Eaves 2005 (see above), right vestibules appear to be rather
common, they are just not as well developed as left ones in both species studied here.
3/21: 'which' is generally preceded by a comma, otherwise use 'that'
11/29-30: Levene’s test is used to test for differences in FA (a variance) among groups,
not to test for the presence of FA. The significance of FA relative to measurement
error is tested with an ANOVA on repeat measurements (see comments under
Supplementary Information file below). Also, here the authors should refer readers to
specific numbered tables in the Supplementary Info. file.
12/25: Refer readers to specific numbered tables in the Supplementary Info. file.
12/28: It's not clear to me why the authors do a PCA here. To test for the presence of
asymmetry for each arm the test would merely be: is the mean [ln(R) - ln(L)]
significantly different from zero. A simple ANOVA would test whether asymmetry
differed among arms: Factor 1= arm, Factor 2= Fertilization group, dependent= ln(R)
- ln(L) (see General Comments I).
13-14: I suggest presenting these results for S. purpuratus as a) mean arm length and b)
mean asymmetry [ln(R) - ln(L)], as a function of time or larval stage bin (see General
Comments I).
14/28-32: This statement cannot be correct. There is ALWAYS some fluctuating
asymmetry (random deviations from perfect symmetry, or random variation about
some average directional asymmetry). In some cases there may also be directional
asymmetry (DA; significant average deviation from symmetry).
15/35-50: This test would be much more straightforward if asymmetry is measured as
ln(R) - ln(L) (see General Comments I). Then a simple ANOVA would test for food
effects: Factor 1= arm number, Factor 2= food treatment, dependent= ln(R) - ln(L).
This ANOVA could also be done using age/larval stage bin as a third factor, to test for
age/stage dependence.
16/6-26: Again (see General Comments I), this is a weak test for differences in
asymmetry. I would suggest re-doing these analyses as a 1-factor ANOVA for each
arm using a more sensitive measure of asymmetry: Factor 1= normal v double
rudiment, dependent= ln(R) - ln(L).
Page -3-
17/11-21: Perhaps the authors should acknowledge that Collin 1997 reports "significant
right-bias directional asymmetry" in the posterodorsal arm rods of 8 day old Dendraster
larvae (her Table 3 statistical results support her statement in line 5 of her results
section).
17/42-19/8: This speculation about potential signaling pathways seems longer than needed.
I would suggest condensing it about half a page.
23/30: DA appearing later in development, and FA earlier, was also reported by Collin
1997 (her Table 3, and line 5 in her results section).
26/6-13: Emlet 2009 (p. 172) also notes that a larva with a right-side rudiment had
reversed larval arm asymmetry and one with no rudiment at all had symmetrical arms.
These observations seem important and worth mentioning here.
26/36: 'Previously undescribed' is not quite correct because, as the authors note, such
asymmetries have been described by Emlet 2009 and Collin 1997. Perhaps this could
be reworded.
27: Is this last paragraph needed? It does not seem to add much to the paper.
34/11: State that ‘colored lines’ indicate the linear measurements taken.
35/ Fig 5: Replace lengths of left and right arms with actual measures of asymmetry
(e.g., ln(R) - ln(L)) and average arm length (see General Comments I), or indicate in
the legend what the dark and light bars represent.
Results, general: Throughout, report results of the present study in past tense.
Figures, general: In both the PDF and on-line versions, I had difficulty viewing the
figures in the submitted MS; panel labels, and text that spanned outside a figure box,
did not show against the black background. The authors should be more careful to
proof their submitted MS for proper figure visibility.
Figure legends: In each legend, indicate a) that the bars are ±SE and b) what the sample
sizes were.
Fig. 1 legend: Panels A and B are reversed from what the legend says.
Supplementary Information file:
- A 93 page Supplementary Information file seems truly excessive and irresponsible
to me. The authors should be more judicious in their choice of tests and
presentation of statistical results. Mostly, these look like raw output files from a
shopping list of statistical tests. If the authors aren't willing to make the effort to
condense these results into sensible tables, why should the referees and readers
bother spending time trying to do so?
Page -4-
- ALL tables should be individually numbered and have legends, pages should be
numbered.
- Error analysis. The error analysis has not been done correctly to test for the
significance of FA or DA relative to measurement error. The design should be:
Factor 1= side, Factor 2= individual larva, dependent= repeated arm
measurements. When done this way 1) the significance of the sides x individuals
interaction term is a test of the size of FA relative to measurement error (i.e., did
the difference between sides in individuals exceed that expected given the
observed level of measurement error?) and 2) the F value of the ‘sides’ mean
square divided by the ‘sides x individuals’ mean square is a test of the
significance of DA.
This should be done on a trait-by-trait basis (it is important to test for the
significance of FA for each trait separately). The combined analysis (Table 2)
seems meaningless to me.
- If the measurements for the right side of one larva in the error analysis were missing
(Table 1), that individual should be excluded from the analysis.
- As a courtesy to readers, the order of traits in tables should be the same (e.g., Tables
4 & 5).

HODIN ET AL. RSOS-160139, RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
We thank both reviewers for their extremely helpful and insightful comments; in addressing them we
feel that the revised manuscript is greatly improved. In the sections below we list all of the relevant
comments of each of the two reviewers, indented and in italics. We respond in point-by-point fashion
in unindented, unitalicized text. We refer throughout the document below to Page and Line number
references in the revised version of our manuscript. Please note that our page number references are to
the numbers printed on the lower right of every page, not the page numbers as listed in the compiled
PDF in the upper left corner (“page x of y”).
(Please ignore the other stray numbers in the upper and lower left corners of alternating pages; this
must be a glitch in the page numbering program as it relates to header and footer text. We were unable
to delete these numbers without deleting the correct line numbers as well; our apologies).

REVIEWER 1
One is … left wondering what is the significance of the work especially as it appears to involve
a very low sample size – with regard to the independent source of data – the parent or family. I
would like to see the stats revisited. Because I am most concerned about the methods and how
the data were handled I will focus on that aspect – with a few comments elsewhere.
1. Dendraster – crosses were set up with 2 females. Thus in my view here n=2 so that all they
can do is a t-test. Larvae are not independent data sources – they are nested in female. For
the other species n=4 so that is a bit better. Thus the conclusion on pg. 26 will need to be
toned down – unless they can avail of data from the literature to extend their inferences on
application of the phenomenon in disparate echinoids.
We thank the reviewer for his/her careful attention to the manuscript and our experimental design. We
would note that in the Dendraster data set, we are reporting on our rearing under standard laboratory
conditions of a cohort of larvae (full-sib design), and performing morphometrics on a haphazardly
chosen subsample of these full-sib larvae. We note that both are standard procedure for larval
morphometrics (see for example papers by Drs. Richard Strathmann, Larry McEdward and Justin
McAlister as examples – in our reference list, references 48, 51, 54 and 61).
We have here added a second female to this design as a way of ensuring that the asymmetries that we
report are not simply due to an aberrant female or genotype, and we have demonstrated this statistically
(see Page 13 Lines 281-284 of the revised manuscript).
We do feel that the above rationale for our use of the second female was not clear in the manuscript as
originally submitted, and we apologize for that oversight. We have now clarified this point both in the
Methods (Page 6 Line 118-121) and the Results sections (Page 13 Lines 278-280).
2. ANOVA is the statistic used, but the assumptions of ANOVA would have been violated.
ANOVA requires the data to be independent and with the degrees of freedom required only data
1
for the second species can be analysed df = 4-1. Also ANOVA requires data to be normal and
have homogeneity of variance.
As explained above, the experimental design we used in this study is a full sib design with independent
culture vessels, and the large majority of studies on larval morphometrics have been performed this
way. While there are limitations of this design (for example, in the absence of multiple, independent
genetic crosses) it is the standard in the field, and is indeed suitable for ANOVA analysis, as the
references cited above confirm.
The reviewer is correct to point out that ANOVA requires normality of data, and we apologize for not
addressing this point in the methods as originally submitted. We have now clarified that all of our data
is normally distributed as confirmed by p-p and q-q plots (see Page 12 Line 250 in the revised
manuscript).
3. What the authors might do is focus their study on the species for which they have the most
data S. purpuratus and use the one where n=2 as additional information. I can not see what
can be done with n=2.
We agree with the reviewer that the purple urchin data is much stronger for a variety of reasons. This is
why we have limited our description of our Dendraster results to a single section in the results and one
figure. By contrast, we present our purple urchin data in 5 figures, encompassing three separate
experiments.
4. The double rudiments were obtained from brood stock maintained in an artificial sea water
system. Artificial sea salts can be toxic or have negative affects on aspects of development –
especially skeleton formation. Have a read of a paper by Roberta Challener in an aquaculture
journal a couple of years ago.
This is a valid concern of the reviewer. The artificial sea water (ASW) system in Guelph is a more
advanced mixture than some typical preparations (e.g., InstantOcean or simple seawater protocols like
MBL sea water), is well buffered, subject to regular chemical testing, and includes essential trace
compounds. If our ASW system were toxic to larvae, we would expect to see a range of abnormalities
in all of our rearings, and we have not observed this at all in many years (>8 years) of our use of this
system. Furthermore, we have recently published a paper in which we explicitly traced the progression
of larval development in purple urchins from fertilization through settlement with a detailed staging
scheme (see ref. 22 in our manuscript), comparing larvae reared in Guelph to those reared on natural
sea water in several different west coast locales. We observed no differences, indicating that our ASW-
reared larvae in Guelph develop normally all the way thru larval development.
Nevertheless, in order to address the concern of the reviewer, we have expanded our description in the
Methods of the conditions that are correlated with our observations of enhanced double rudiments in
Guelph. Briefly, we only observed it in a certain percentage of our rearings, and we stopped observing
it at all recently after we had some natural attrition of adults in our colony. These observations point to
the fact that the occasional enhanced proportion of double rudiment larvae in our cultures was
associated with a specific female and/or genotype, as we now explain on Page 8 Line 171 through Page
9 Line 183.

Finally, on the paper of Challener et al. mentioned by the reviewer, we believe that the reviewer is
referring to their paper on ocean acidification (OA) effects on urchin larvae using their artificial sea
water system (Journal of Applied Aquaculture, Volume 25, Issue 2, 2013, pp 154-175). The
“abnormalities” reported by Challener and colleagues were due to the change in sea water chemistry
associated with their future OA treatment (i.e., pH 7.8), not in their control treatment, which was ASW
with ambient ocean chemistry conditions (i.e., pH 8.2). As the authors state in their discussion (p167):
“Studies have shown that the use of synthetic sea salts, in general, does not impact early development
in echinoids (Hovanec et al. 2005) and the use of commercial artificial seawater has many benefits such
as cost and logistics, particularly for those facilities not located near the coast.”
5. Asymmetrical arm length of sea urchin larvae is a response variable often scored in
ecotoxicology studies – it would be interesting if the asymmetry in those studies was one sided.
I wonder if you might be able to tell from photos. These type of studies should be cited on pg
17 L 10.
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, but we would not feel comfortable drawing conclusions
from measurements taken on any such photos for several reasons, most notably that the sample sizes
would be too low, the length of the arms cannot be measured accurately enough in the X-Y plane from
such photos, and because we would have no information at all about the Z plane.
Nevertheless, we do find it quite striking that of the dozens of papers reporting detailed larval
morphometrics in echinoids, very few of them have even reported L-R measurements separately (we
cite all three of the exceptions of which we are aware). Indeed this striking gap in the literature is
exactly the reason why we wanted to be sure to cite all of the aforementioned echinoid larval
morphometrics papers that failed to measure left and right arms separately, as we see this as the most
likely explanation for why the striking asymmetries that we report here have not been previously noted.
See also our response to Reviewer 2 on this point (Response to Reviewer 2, General Comment IV,
below).
We thank the reviewer for pointing us to toxicological studies on asymmetry in urchins; we have
chosen two recent papers to highlight in our revised manuscript (see new References 80 and 81). We
found a slightly different location in the discussion to include these references than the the location
suggested by the reviewer; see Page 26 Lines 558-560.
6. There is considerable text on the potential biomechanical impacts of the asymmetry. One
wonders what is the magnitude of this asymmetry in the study species and if it is significant
ecologically. How much shorter are the arms – how many microns? Would one expect a small
difference to matter? The authors need to provide data on the magnitude of difference, range
etc. For the species that you nave n=4 does this differ between families?
We agree that we should have reported the magnitude of the asymmetry in explicit terms. As
suggested by Reviewer 2, we have now undertaken a new analysis of our data computing the ln(R/L)
value as an index of the magnitude of the asymmetry. In so doing, we see that the magnitude of
asymmetry in our larvae can get as high as a 20-25% difference between left and right [i.e., ln(R/L) =
0.25; see Figures 1-3]. We feel this difference is substantial, justifying our speculations on the
ecological/biomechanical implications of a directional asymmetry of this magnitude.
3
We also would like to note that we mixed the larvae from each of the four purple urchin fertilizations
precisely to create a larval cohort in which, if we saw a difference between left and right, we could
conclude that this was a general phenomenon, not limited to particular aberrant genotypes (n.b., this
“mixed parentage” design is the main alternative to the “full sib” design in the larval morphometrics
field ). In other words, our mixed parentage design supports our conclusion that the phenomenon is
likely general for the two widely divergent species we tested, and perhaps echinoids in general.
REVIEWER 2 – Dr. Rich Palmer
GENERAL COMMENTS
I) Results and analyses. I am puzzled why the authors present and analyse the mean±SE of the
right and left sides of arms (Figs. 1-5), because this greatly reduces their ability to detect left-
right asymmetry....
We absolutely agree with Dr. Palmer that our method of reporting the data as originally submitted was
inadequate. We have now completely reanalyzed the data along the lines that he suggested below, and
have, in the process, reworked every single one of our (now six) Figures. We believe that these
changes have dramatically improved the manuscript, even though it has only resulted in marginal
changes to our conclusions.
II) Figures. In the graphs (Fig. 2A, B; Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5), I suggest graphing on a double-Y
graph i) average arm length and ii) average asymmetry [mean (ln(R) - ln(L))] for each time
period or stage bin. This way readers can see how both arm length and arm asymmetry differ
or change over time.
We have followed this excellent suggestion (see our new Figures 2-5), as it much more clearly shows
the magnitude of the directional asymmetries that we have observed. Indeed we have now abandoned
our previous statistical analysis and (unless noted) have restricted our statistical analyses of L-R
differences to an analysis of the ln(R/L) index of asymmetry. We have decided to retain the left and
right arm lengths in the figures, and provide total arm length in separate figures for each of our datasets
(see Fig. 4 and supplemental figure S1).
III) Supplementary results. ALL references to the "Supplementary Material" should refer to
specific, numbered tables in the Supplementary Material file (see more detailed comments
under Supplementary Information file below).
We apologize for our unclear citations in the text to the supplementary material. We have rectified this
in the revised version, and note that our supplementary material is now much reduced as well (see
below).
4
IV) Citations. Are all these citations needed? In several places where blocks of citations
that support a single point are only mentioned once, might a single citation work to support the
statement? For example, no less than 18(!) references [44-62] are cited only once to support
the point that arm lengths are plastic in response to food levels. Maybe choose the one citation
that is also cited elsewhere in the text.
We understand that many journals limit numbers of references, and this is surely understandable in the
context of printed journals. Nevertheless, in the context of our online only journal submission here, we
would like to retain all of these references. In particular, Dr. Palmer pointed to our large number of
references in the echinoid larval morphometrics literature (now references 46-64 in the revised
version). As we stated in our response to Reviewer 1 (see our response to Reviewer 1, Comment 5,
above), we found it intriguing that the directional asymmetries that we report here have not been
previously noted. We can only conclude that this is due to the fact that, surprisingly, none of these 19
studies reported left and right side measurements separately (one reference had a note saying they did
not detect L-R differences as “data not shown”)! We felt that we needed to cite all 19 of these papers as
justification for the description of our findings as a “newly identified... asymmetry.”
Having said this, I'm a tad surprised the authors don't cite:
Eaves 2005. Potential for paired vestibules in plutei (Echinodermata, Echinoidea). Invertebrate
Biology 124(2): 174–184.
Eaves presents extensive data on the prevalence of right vestibules in both Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus and Dendraster excentricus larvae (see her Table 1 footnote).
We apologize for this oversight, and now cite Eaves 2005 (as our new reference 29) in the Methods
section, as part of our now-expanded account of our enhanced double rudiment cohorts in Guelph (see
Page 9 Line 176 in the revised manuscript, as well as our response to Reviewer 1, Comment 4, above).
SPECIFIC COMMENTS (page/line)
2/9: 'profound' here seems rather over the top to me
We have removed this word as suggested (now page 2 line 21).
2/23-27: 'For the first time' is not correct because, as the authors note later, such arm
asymmetries have been described by Emlet 2009 and Collin 1997.
We thank Dr. Palmer for noticing our misleading wording. We have now settled on modified wording
that we believe indicates the novelty of our observations while not understating the key observations of
Emlet, Yanisagawa and Collin in this context, and we now use this modified wording throughout the
manuscript (see, e.g., Page 2 Line 28, Page 5 Lines 93-95 and Page 19 Lines 404-409).
We note that the asymmetry reported by Emlet & Yanisagawa, while possibly related to our DA
observations herein, are on a unique set of larval arms (the extremely long posterolateral arms) that
project off of the posterior in Stomopneustes larvae. Indeed these arms are so unusually long that it led
Emlet to propose that the reduction in posterolateral arm length on the left side is an absolute functional
requirement for these unique larvae to be able to interact with the benthos at settlement! We discuss the
observations of Collin further below.
5
2/32: If you believe Eaves 2005 (see above), right vestibules appear to be rather common, they
are just not as well developed as left ones in both species studied here.
We agree with Eaves' observations (and we have repeatedly observed exactly what she reported), yet
we do not feel that it warrants a change in wording in our abstract, as even Eaves herself notes that
there is still a profound directional L-R asymmetry in rudiment invagination: the left side invagination
always happens first and it is always bigger and more developed than the right side invagination (with
the exception of the very rare situs inversus larvae, which we do not discuss in our manuscript), even in
double rudiment larvae.
We do nevertheless agree that Eaves observations are definitely worth mentioning in our paper, and as
indicated above, we now refer to Eaves 2005 in our methods section (new Ref. 29), alongside our
expanded account of our enhanced double rudiment larval cohorts.
11/29-30: Levene’s test is used to test for differences in FA (a variance) among groups, not to
test for the presence of FA. The significance of FA relative to measurement error is tested with
an ANOVA on repeat measurements (see comments under Supplementary Information file
below). Also, here the authors should refer readers to specific numbered tables in the
Supplementary Info. file.
We appreciate the clarification here. We did repeat the analysis of FA relative to measurement error
and report it in the revised version of the manuscript (see top of Page 16).
12/25: Refer readers to specific numbered tables in the Supplementary Info. file.
See our response to Dr. Palmer's General Comment III, above.
12/28: It's not clear to me why the authors do a PCA here. To test for the presence of
asymmetry for each arm the test would merely be: is the mean [ln(R) - ln(L)] significantly
different from zero. A simple ANOVA would test whether asymmetry differed among arms:
Factor 1= arm, Factor 2= Fertilization group, dependent= ln(R) - ln(L) (see General
Comments I).
We absolutely agree with Dr. Palmer's comment here. We have now removed the PCA from the
manuscript and replaced this analysis with the ANOVA as suggested. The conclusions have not
changed profoundly as a result, but it has yielded a few new insights.
13-14: I suggest presenting these results for S. purpuratus as a) mean arm length and b) mean
asymmetry [ln(R) - ln(L)], as a function of time or larval stage bin (see General Comments I).
See our response to Dr. Palmer's General Comment I, above.
14/28-32: This statement cannot be correct. There is ALWAYS some fluctuating asymmetry
(random deviations from perfect symmetry, or random variation about some average
directional asymmetry). In some cases there may also be directional asymmetry (DA;
significant average deviation from symmetry).
6
Via Dr. Palmer's review, we discovered that we had not done the FA test correctly. Once we repeated it
using the method suggested, we indeed found evidence for FA in urchin larval arms, and now report
this result as such (now top of Page 16).
15/35-50: This test would be much more straightforward if asymmetry is measured as ln(R) -
ln(L) (see General Comments I). Then a simple ANOV A would test for food effects: Factor 1=
arm number, Factor 2= food treatment, dependent= ln(R) - ln(L). This ANOVA could also be
done using age/larval stage bin as a third factor, to test for age/stage dependence.
16/6-26: Again (see General Comments I), this is a weak test for differences in asymmetry. I
would suggest re-doing these analyses as a 1-factor ANOVA for each arm using a more
sensitive measure of asymmetry: Factor 1= normal v double rudiment, dependent= ln(R) –
ln(L).
See our response to Dr. Palmer's General Comment I, above.
17/11-21: Perhaps the authors should acknowledge that Collin 1997 reports "significant right-
bias directional asymmetry" in the posterodorsal arm rods of 8 day old Dendraster larvae (her
Table 3 statistical results support her statement in line 5 of her results section).
Yes indeed, and we regret having failed to acknowledge this finding properly in our originally
submitted manuscript. We have rectified this in the revised version (see Page 19 Line 410-413, Page
22 Line 464 and top of Page 26).
We would note that the scope of asymmetry was still “subtle” (in the words of Dr. Collin) in her
singular day 8 posterodorsal observation, 4-5x lower in magnitude than the asymmetries that we
observed, and in only one arm as opposed to our observed DA in 2 pairs of arms in Dendraster (see our
new Fig. 1). We suspect that this difference may be due to Dr. Collin having stopped her experiment
on Day 8, and thus at an earlier stage than our observations on Day 11. But without representative
photos of her day 8 larvae (which were fed at much higher levels than we typically do), we are unsure
how advanced they were with respect to rudiment stage (i.e., how close they were to competence), thus
it is difficult to explicitly compare her results to ours in this context.
17/42-19/8: This speculation about potential signaling pathways seems longer than needed. I
would suggest condensing it about half a page.
We hope that our manuscript, if published, will interest a broad range of readers, but we suspect that
the urchin development community will find our observations particularly interesting, and will be keen
to know what the signaling mechanism might be. Therefore, we feel strongly about retaining the bulk
of this discussion on signaling pathways. Nevertheless, to accommodate the reviewers suggestion, we
have shortened this section by almost the amount suggested (now middle Page 20 – middle Page 21)
23/30: DA appearing later in development, and FA earlier, was also reported by Collin 1997
(her Table 3, and line 5 in her results section).
Indeed, and we have now modified this sentence to clarify this point (see Page 26, top).
7
26/6-13: Emlet 2009 (p. 172) also notes that a larva with a right-side rudiment had reversed
larval arm asymmetry and one with no rudiment at all had symmetrical arms. These
observations seem important and worth mentioning here.
We agree that these were key observations, and we have included them mention of them in the revised
manuscript on Page 21 Line 441.
26/36: 'Previously undescribed' is not quite correct because, as the authors note, such
asymmetries have been described by Emlet 2009 and Collin 1997. Perhaps this could be
reworded.
See our response to Dr. Palmer's second Specific Comment, above.
27: Is this last paragraph needed? It does not seem to add much to the paper.
We respectfully disagree with Dr. Palmer here. We feel that the broad readership of RSOS warrants
broad (while still relevant) conclusions. We believe our last paragraph is thus appropriate and would
like to retain it.
34/11: State that ‘colored lines’ indicate the linear measurements taken.
We have done as suggested, see new legend to Figure 1.
35/ Fig 5: Replace lengths of left and right arms with actual measures of asymmetry (e.g., ln(R)
- ln(L)) and average arm length (see General Comments I), or indicate in the legend what the
dark and light bars represent.
We have done as suggested, as we discussed above (Response to Dr. Palmer, General Comment II)
Results, general: Throughout, report results of the present study in past tense.
We have done as suggested.
Figures, general: In both the PDF and on-line versions, I had difficulty viewing the figures in
the submitted MS; panel labels, and text that spanned outside a figure box, did not show against
the black background. The authors should be more careful to proof their submitted MS for
proper figure visibility.
We did submit full, high quality, stand alone images with the first submission, and we have done so in
this submission as well. In the original submission, we must not have noticed that the figures rendered
poorly once uploaded. In the revised submission we have double-checked the quality of the uploaded
figures (both as standalone and in the PDF); the issues that Dr. Palmer described above should not be a
problem in this round.
Figure legends: In each legend, indicate a) that the bars are ±SE and b) what the sample sizes
were.
8
We now have made sure to reference the error bars and sample sizes in each figure legend.
Fig. 1 legend: Panels A and B are reversed from what the legend says.
We regret this error, which we rectified in the revised Figure 1.
Supplementary Information file:
A 93 page Supplementary Information file seems truly excessive and irresponsible to me. The
authors should be more judicious in their choice of tests and presentation of statistical results.
Mostly, these look like raw output files from a shopping list of statistical tests. If the authors
aren't willing to make the effort to condense these results into sensible tables, why should the
referees and readers bother spending time trying to do so?
We apologize for this extensive supplemental in the original submission, and thank Dr. Palmer for
taking the time to wade through our many statistical analyses. We were under the mistaken impression
that all such data needed to be included in the paper per journal requirements. We have since realized
that there is a separate repository for such data, and that this does not need to be included in the paper
per se, and explicitly shared with the reviewers. After submission of the original manuscript we
uploaded all the raw data to the repository (dryad) which greatly reduces the need for providing
supplementary information.
Dr. Palmer can rest assured that the revised supplemental (with a singular figure and brief legend) is
much more streamlined than in the previous submission. We have also now included two tables in the
manuscript that contain the key statistics all in one location. We hope that these changes will be seen
as satisfactory.
ALL tables should be individually numbered and have legends, pages should be numbered.
We have numbered all pages in the revised version; we have removed the tables from the supplement.
placed all ancillary data and analyses in the dryad repository, and now only have two tables, both in the
main text, with table legends.
Error analysis. The error analysis has not been done correctly to test for the significance of FA
or DA relative to measurement error. The design should be: Factor 1= side, Factor 2=
individual larva, dependent= repeated arm measurements. When done this way 1) the
significance of the sides x individuals interaction term is a test of the size of FA relative to
measurement error (i.e., did the difference between sides in individuals exceed that expected
given the observed level of measurement error?) and 2) the F value of the ‘sides’ mean square
divided by the ‘sides x individuals’ mean square is a test of the significance of DA.
This should be done on a trait-by-trait basis (it is important to test for the significance of FA for
each trait separately). The combined analysis (Table 2) seems meaningless to me.
If the measurements for the right side of one larva in the error analysis were missing (Table 1),
that individual should be excluded from the analysis.
We understand the shortcoming of our analysis and completely revised it according to the instructions
and the very useful excel spreadsheet provided on Dr. Palmers website.

ABSTRACT
4
5
6
7
Directional asymmetry in body form is a wide spread phenomenon in animals and plants
8
9 21 alike, and a functional understanding of such asymmetries can offer insights into the
10
11 ways in which ecology and development interface to drive evolution. Echinoids (sea
12
13
14 urchins, sand dollars and their kin) with planktotrophic development have a bilaterally-
15
16 24 symmetrical feeding pluteus larva that undergoes a dramatic metamorphosis into a
17
18 pentameral juvenile that enters the benthos at settlement. The earliest stage of this
19
20
21 transformation involves a directional asymmetry: the echinus rudiment will form the oral
22
23 27 field of the juvenile. Here we show for the first time in two echinoid species that the
24
25
there is a corresponding directional asymmetry in the overall shape of the larva: late
26
27
28 stage plutei have consistently shorter arms specifically on the rudiment (left) side. We
29
30 30 then demonstrate a mechanistic connection between the rudiment and arm length
31
32
33
asymmetries by examining rare, anomalous purple urchin larvae that have rudiments on
34
35 both the left and the right side. Our data suggest that this asymmetry is likely a broadly-
36
37 33 shared feature characterizing ontogeny in the class Echinoidea. We propose several
38
39
40 functional hypotheses –including developmental constraints and water column stability–
41
42 to account for this newly-identified asymmetry.

BACKGROUND
8
9 42 Many species of benthic invertebrates have a planktonic larval phase, which may
10
11 allow these taxa to exploit alternative resources across life history stages, increase their
12
13
14 dispersal ability and maintain connectivity among populations [1-3]. The echinoderms –
15
16 45 including sea urchins, sea stars and sea cucumbers– exhibit a wide variety of such
17
18 planktonic larval forms, both feeding and non-feeding [4-8]. These forms are the result
19
20
21 of evolutionary pressures that appear to shape larval morphology within the confines of
22
23 48 opposing functional constraints, in particular on feeding ability versus stability in the
24
25
water column [9, 10]. Specifically, feeding structures generally require large surface
26
27
28 area for particle capture, whereas stability, especially in turbulent waters, relies upon
29
30 51 minimal surface area [8].
31
32
33 Consistent with these proposed trade-offs are the derived, non-feeding larval
34
35
36 forms that have evolved independently and repeatedly across echinoderm taxa. Such
37
38 54 larvae avoid the aforementioned functional constraints on feeding versus stability, and
39
40 thus tend to be relatively simple in overall structure, with uniform ciliation or multiple
41
42
43 ciliated bands circling their spheroid bodies to facilitate movement [11]. By contrast,
44
45 57 feeding larvae exhibit more complex morphologies, and two classes of echinoderms –
46
47
the ophiuroids (brittle stars and basket stars) and the echinoids (sea urchins, sand
48
49
50 dollars and kin)– have independently evolved similar-looking pluteus larvae [12, 13],
51
52 60 with 2-8 or more larval arms supported by internal skeletal rods. These arms are used
53
54
55
for feeding and swimming, provide structural support, and might assist in passively
56
57 orienting the larvae and offering protection from predation [14-17]).

63 The diverse echinoderm larvae described above share one key developmental
4
5
6 feature: at a certain point in larval development, a directional asymmetry appears when
7
8 juvenile structures begin to form internally on the left side in the otherwise bilaterally-
9
10
11 66 symmetrical larva. In most echinoids with feeding larvae, this asymmetry is first visible
12
13 as an invagination of ectoderm on the left side called the "echinus rudiment", which
14
15 ultimately contacts a coelomic pouch, and they jointly transform into the oral portion of
16
17
18 69 the pentamerally-symmetrical juvenile [18-22]. The juvenile structures will continue to
19
20 grow and differentiate within the larva until it reaches metamorphic competence, at
21
22 which point if it subsequently encounters suitable substrate, the larva will settle
23
24
25 72 irreversibly on the benthos. The relationship between the juvenile and the larva is in a
26
27 sense parasitic as the juvenile structures develop at the expense of larval growth
28
29
30
[reviewed in 23].
31
32
33
75 The directionally-asymmetrical rudiment invagination is particularly well studied in
34
35 the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Aihara and Amemiya [21]
36
37 provided strong experimental evidence that the right side of the larva is largely
38
39
40 78 responsible for differentiating the L-R axis: laterally-bisected larvae (before rudiment
41
42 invagination) all regenerate and develop to competence, but the larvae developing from
43
44 the left halves rarely exhibited normal L-R patterning, whereas those from the right side
45
46
47 81 almost always developed normally. More targeted removals of portions of the right side
48
49 also resulted in larvae with abnormal L-R patterning.
50
51
52 Recent molecular evidence has further supported this scenario of right side
53
54
55
84 control of the L-R asymmetry. The identified genes that appear to regulate L-R
56
57 asymmetry in urchins encode two secreted growth factor-like proteins – Nodal and

Lefty– and the Pitx2 paired-class homeodomain protein, all three of which are
4
5
6 87 expressed primarily on the right side of the larva; their proper expression restricts
7
8 rudiment formation to the left side [24]. BMP (Bone Morphogenetic Protein) signaling is
9
10
11 then asymmetrically activated and is required for the development of left sided
12
13 90 structures and marker genes [25]. Additionally, a H,K-ATPase-like protein also appears
14
15 to be important, most likely via either H+ or K+ gradients that occur upstream of the
16
17
18 asymmetric gene expression of nodal, lefty and pitx2 [26].

23 a consistent asymmetry of the larval arms in advanced echinoid pluteus larvae, the
24
25
extent of which has not previously been described. We first document the asymmetry in
26
27
28 96 two disparate echinoids separated by 250 million years, suggesting that this asymmetry
29
30 may be a common feature among echinoids with feeding larvae. We further explore the
31
32
33
phenomenon in S. purpuratus to evaluate the possible connection between the rudiment
34
35 99 and larval arm asymmetries, and by examining anomalous larvae with rudiments on
36
37 both the left and right sides. We discuss our results in the context of several hypotheses
38
39
40 concerning the function of this newly-identified asymmetry in sea urchin plutei. In so
41
42 102 doing, we highlight the ways in which directional asymmetries offer a unique window
43
44 into how ecology and development work together to drive organismal evolution.

7
8
9 For the characterization of the arm-length asymmetries in Dendraster excentricus
10
11
108 (Eschcholtz) sand dollar larvae, we used adults collected at low tide (-0.25 meters) from
12
13
14 a large, intertidal population in East Sound (Orcas Island, WA, USA) on July 17, 2015.
15
16 The adults were maintained at Friday Harbor Labs (FHL; Friday Harbor, WA, USA) in
17
18
19
111 flowing sea water in sand bins until spawning. On August 26, 2015, we spawned
20
21 several adults by intra-coelomic injection with 0.5M KCl. We set up crosses from two
22
23 females: one by standard methods [27] using sperm collected dry that same day from a
24
25
26 114 single spawning male, the second by aspirating off the eggs from the aboral surface of a
27
28 second female who began spawning after we returned her to an aquarium. This second
29
30 female's eggs were already fertilized, therefore we are unsure of the paternity in this
31
32
33 117 second cross (several males were also spawning in the aquarium at that time, including
34
35 the male from the first cross). Thus, the two crosses were either half sibs from different
36
37
mothers, non-sibs, or a mixture, and we maintained them separately throughout to
38
39
40 120 ensure that any results we obtained could not be explained by the larvae having been
41
42 derived from an aberrant female. We conducted fertilizations and all subsequent rearing
43
44
45
steps in 0.45 µm Millipore-filtered natural sea water (MFSW) at room temperature,
46
47 123 which varied between 19 and 22°C.
48
49
50 Sand dollar embryos had hatched by 1 day after fertilization, at which point we
51
52 set up one jar from each cross at approximately 1 larva/ml of MFSW, and fed them a
53
54
55 126 combination of Rhodomonas spp. (2.5 cells/µl) and Dunaliella tertiolecta (3 cells/µl), and
56
57 kept them gently stirred using a gyratory shaker table. We changed their water every

two days by reverse filtration of >95% of the water volume and gave the larvae fresh
4
5
6 129 MFSW and food. On day 3 (comparable to soft tissue stage iii from [22]), we reduced
7
8 the larval density to 1 larva/5 ml MFSW, and maintained them at that density until day 9
9
10
11 (more or less equivalent to skeletogenic stage 10 from [22]) when we conducted all
12
13 132 larval arm measurements.
14
15
16 For the characterization of the corresponding arm-length asymmetries in purple
17
18 urchins as well as the ontogenetic characterizations and feeding trials, we used adult
19
20
21 135 Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Stimpson), collected at Slip Point (Clallam Bay, WA,
22
23 USA) and maintained in subtidal cages suspended off the floating docks at FHL, fed
24
25
throughout the year ad libitum with drift kelp (mainly blades of Nereocystis leutkeana).
26
27
28 138 We spawned 2 males and 2 females on March 27, 2015 at FHL, by intra-coelomic
29
30 injection with 0.5M KCl. We then set up the four pairwise fertilizations in MFSW using
31
32
33
standard methods [27] at 11°C. We transported embryos the next day to the University
34
35 141 of Washington (Seattle, WA, USA) and continued to maintain the cultures at 11°C. On
36
37 day 5, when the embryos had reached the late prism/early 4-arm larval stage, we set up
38
39
40 a single gallon jar in MFSW at approximately 1 larva/ml from equal proportions of the 4
41
42 144 fertilizations, fed them a combination of Dunaliella tertiolecta and Rhodomonas spp. as
43
44 described above, and over about an hour, warmed the culture to 15°C in a shaking
45
46
47 water bath, where we maintained all cultures for the remainder of the experiment. Every
48
49 147 two days, we cleaned the cultures and fed them as described above.
50
51
52 On day 15, most of the larvae had reached the rudiment invagination stage (soft
53
54
55
tissue stage i from [22]), at which point we reduced the larval density to approximately 1
56
57 150 larva/1.3 ml MFSW, and then to ~1 larva/2 ml MFSW on day 17, with food at the same

concentration as previously. On day 20 (approximately soft tissue stage iv from [22]),
4
5
6 we individually selected 1000 of the optimally developing larvae, only rejecting those
7
8 153 (<20% of the larvae) that appeared significantly smaller than the average larva. In so
9
10
11 doing, we reduced the density to 1 larva/6 ml, and fed them as before. This stepwise
12
13 reduction in density was an attempt to limit bouts of larval cloning, which can be induced
14
15 156 by sudden shifts in density (unpublished observations), and would be expected to
16
17
18 increase variability in arm length within cultures [28].
19
20
21 On day 25 (approximately skeletogenic stage 1 from [22]), we selected out 83
22
23 159 larvae into each of 6 jars with 500 ml MFSW (so still at 1 larva/6 ml) and randomly
24
25
assigned each jar to one of two treatments: 3 replicate jars of high food (full ration of
26
27
28 Dunaliella:Rhodomonas at 1:4 cells/µl) and 3 replicate jars of low food (25% ration at
29
30 162 0.25:1 cells/µl) for the remainder of the experiment. Approximately 50% of the larvae in
31
32
33
the high food treatment had reached metamorphic competence by day 42; the low food
34
35 larvae had not quite reached metamorphic competence by the time we concluded the
36
37 165 experiment on day 45.
38
39
40 For the "double rudiment" experiment we used purple urchins originally obtained
41
42
43 from The Cultured Abalone Ltd. (Goleta, California, USA) and that we have maintained
44
45 168 at the Hagen Aqualab at the University of Guelph (Guelph, Ontario) in an artificial
46
47
seawater system on an 8:16 hr light:dark photoperiod at approximately 12ºC and 34 ppt
48
49
50 salinity, fed ad libitum with rehydrated Kombu kelp (Laminaria spp.), repeatedly
51
52 171 spawning the same individuals as they become gravid again. Over the last several
53
54
55
years (2011-2013), we repeatedly noted an unusually high proportion (approximately 2-
56
57 5%; data not shown) of offspring of particular urchins from our Guelph colony that

174 exhibited rudiments on both their right and the left sides – so-called "double rudiments"
4
5
6 – a seeming hypertrophy of the small right side invagination typical of development in at
7
8 least some echinoids (including the two species we examined here; see [29]). Note that,
9
10
11 177 since the death of the particular adults from which we obtained offspring with enhanced
12
13 double rudiment occurrence, we have no longer observed this phenomenon in our
14
15 Guelph colony, despite having made no notable changes to our water or culturing
16
17
18 180 system. Therefore, we conclude that the double rudiment-enriched larval cohort that we
19
20 examined here derived from a specific maternal, paternal or genetic effect, and that we
21
22 typically (and since 2014, exclusively) have seen the phenomenon only at the expected
23
24
25 183 rate of fewer than 1% of larvae in a colony ([30]; our unpublished observations).
26
27
28 In September 2013, we obtained gametes from one male and one female adult
29
30 S. purpuratus by intracoelomic injection following protocols described above, whose
31
32
33
186 larvae later exhibited the enhanced double rudiment phenotype. After fertilization and
34
35 hatching, we set up cultures at an approximate density of 1 larva/2 ml of 0.45 µm
36
37 Millipore filtered artificial sea water (MFASW), agitated to prevent the larvae from
38
39
40 189 settling out of the water column. We transferred larvae three times per week to clean
41
42 beakers with new water and fed them with either Dunaliella tertiolecta or Rhodomonas
43
44 spp. at 12 cells/µl or 6 cells/µl respectively. In the third week of development, we
45
46
47 192 noticed that this larval cohort exhibited the enhanced double rudiment phenotype. At 21
48
49 days post-fertilization, we measured nine stage-matched (see below) single- and
50
51
52
double-rudiment sibling larvae, and assessed asymmetry as in the previous experiment.

3 Staging and Measurements
4
5
6 198 In FHL, we measured ten live 9-day old sand dollar larvae from each of the two
7
8
9 crosses, gently immobilized on slides under raised cover glass, using an Olympus BH-2
10
11 microscope. In Seattle, we staged and measured live purple urchin larvae, immobilized
12
13
201 as above, using a Leitz Wetzlar Ortholux microscope. For the purple urchins, we
14
15
16 employed the staging scheme as outlined in [22]. Note that we used stage bins (as
17
18 defined in the legend to Fig. 3) for the analyses of the urchin data in an attempt to
19
20
21
204 equalize the numbers of individuals within each bin for this dataset. In both FHL and
22
23 Seattle, we measured skeletal rod lengths on haphazardly-chosen larvae using a
24
25 calibrated ocular micrometer, and calculated the z-axis offset of each measured skeletal
26
27
28 207 rod using the gradated focus knob, which we had calibrated using a slide and cover
29
30 glass of known thickness (measured with a micron caliper).
31
32
33 To account for possible measurement error and/or bias in our measurements, we
34
35 210 used larvae fertilized and reared in Guelph as described above, but from an August 3,
36
37
38 2015 fertilization. On day 21, we packed and shipped overnight approximately 200 of
39
40 these live larvae to Seattle, to conduct the error measurements on the Leitz microscope
41
42
43
213 set-up used for the majority of our data (see above). The larvae arrived in good
44
45 condition on day 22 at approximately 13°C, and we conducted the error measurements
46
47 on that day as follows. We haphazardly chose 20 larvae and placed them on individual
48
49
50 216 microscope slides with raised cover glass as described above, and then staged and
51
52 measured each one as above. Then, a colleague uninvolved in the study re-labeled all
53
54 20 slides and we re-measured each of the 20 larvae a second time; thus, the second
55
56
57 219 measurement on these same larvae was done “blind.” We calculated measurement

error using the difference between each of the paired measurements, and used this
4
5
6 error calculation to ensure that any reported differences in L-R asymmetry fell outside of
7
8 222 the experimentation error range. We also used these data to assess fluctuating
9
10
11 asymmetry (FA) as further explained below.
12
13
14 For the double rudiment experiment, we staged larvae under a Nikon Eclipse Ti
15
16 225 microscope, according to our published staging scheme (see Tables 1 and 2 in [22]),
17
18 and we made three-dimensional "z-stacks" (pictures taken at 10 µm steps through the
19
20
21 larvae) with a Nikon Digital sight DS-Fi1 camera. We then conducted measurements on
22
23 228 these z-stacks using a 3D measurement macro (calibrated to account for both the x-y
24
25
and z-y plane distances covered) using ImageJ software Fiji. We measured left and
26
27
28 right postoral (PO), posterodorsal (PD) and anterolateral (ALA) arm lengths for each
29
30 231 larva.
31
32
33 As indicated in Figures 1B and 2E, the PO and PD rods are relatively straight, so
34
35
36 our calculation of these skeletal rod lengths were straight forward. By contrast, the
37
38 234 preoral (PRO) and ALA rods are somewhat curved in both species. Our reported PRO
39
40 and ALA rod lengths represent the linear distance between the landmarks indicated in
41
42
43 Figures 1B and 2E, and are thus are our best approximations of these rod lengths using
44
45 237 the methods we employed.
46
47
48
49
50
51 Statistical Analysis
52
53
54 240 We conducted all statistical tests using SPSS v23. We analyzed all
55
56
57 morphological comparisons using SPSS MANOVA, regression and one sample t-test

commands. We tested for directional asymmetry (DA) using the index of asymmetry
4
5
6 243 [ln(R)-ln(L)], which is equal to ln(R/L), and mathematically equivalent to the following
7
8 equation:
9
10
11 { [ (R-L) / [ (R+L)/2 ] }
12
13
14 246 where R and L are the lengths of the right and left arm respectively [31]. For each of our
15
16
17 structures measured at each time point, we then calculated the mean [ln(R/L)] and used
18
19 a two tailed one sample t-test to determine if this value was significantly different from
20
21 249 zero; a positive value indicates right-biased DA, a negative value indicates left biased
22
23
24 DA. We used q-q and p-p plots to test for normality throughout. We further tested for
25
26 age and stage effects on asymmetry using regression analysis. We tested for an effect
27
28
29
252 of food on asymmetryacross stages with a MANOVA using food level as a factor. We
30
31 tested for fluctuating asymmetry (FA) using methods outlined by Palmer and Strobeck
32
33 [31]. In all cases, we considered results “significant” if a was < 0.05. We report all
34
35
36 255 results as ± one standard error unless stated otherwise.

46

Larvae of the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus showed directional asymmetry in

5
6 264 larval arm growth
7
8
9 We measured all eight larval arms of D. excentricus 9 days post-fertilization at
10
11 ~20°C; we analyzed differences in arm lengths between the left and right side of the
12
13
14 267 larva (Fig. 1) using the index of asymmetry [ln(R/L)]. We found that the postoral (PO)
15
16 and posterodorsal (PD) arms of D. excentricus larvae were significantly shorter on the
17
18 side of the juvenile rudiment (left side) compared to the right side (PO: t=5.59, p<0.001;
19
20
21 270 PD: t=3.05, p<0.01; n=20). We did not find differences in arm length between the left
22
23 and right side of D. excentricus larvae for the other two pairs of arms [anterolateral
24
25
(ALA: t=0.86, p=0.4, n=20); and preoral (PRO: t =-0.89, p=0.4, n=20)]. We also
26
27
28 273 examined the index of asymmetry [ln(R/L)] for the sum of all four arm lengths
29
30 (PO+PD+ALA+PRO) on each side as an indication of the overall asymmetry of the
31
32
33
larva, and found that these larvae were indeed significantly asymmetric overall, with
34
35 276 shorter total arm length on the left (rudiment) side [ln(R/L)=0.043 + 0.008 (standard
36
37 error), t=5.40, p<0.001, n=20].
38
39
40 Note also that we set up fertilizations from two different females in this
41
42
43 279 experiment, and reared their offspring and analyzed them separately, to ensure that our
44
45 results were not an aberration associated with a maternal effect or a given genotype.
46
47
We did not find a significant interaction between cross and the index of asymmetry for
48
49
50 282 any arm pairs (PO: F1,19=0.71, p=0.41; ALA: F1,19=0.08, p=0.78; PD: F1,19=1.90, p=0.19;
51
52 F1,19=0.14, p=0.72), indicating that asymmetry patterns were not different between the
53
54
55
two crosses.

Larvae of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, showed directional
4
5
6 asymmetry (DA) in larval arm growth that changes through ontogeny
7
8
9 288 To determine if the late-stage directional asymmetries (DA) we observed in sand
10
11 dollar larvae are a more widespread feature among echinoids, and to examine whether
12
13
14 such an asymmetry progresses during ontogeny, we examined DA in the purple sea
15
16 291 urchin S. purpuratus at four time points post-fertilization (PF). We then analyzed arm
17
18 length morphometrics as a function of age and binned stage (see Fig. 3 legend for
19
20
21 details).
22
23
24 294 Based upon the sand dollar data and our preliminary observations on S.
25
26 purpuratus larvae, we expected DA to first become manifest in later development, after
27
28
29
the juvenile rudiment begins to form. Therefore, our earliest measurement date was on
30
31 297 day 15, right around the time when we first observed rudiment invagination (Fig. 2D).
32
33 We made additional measurements during the growth of the juvenile rudiment on days
34
35
36 25, 33 and finally on day 39 (Fig. 2E), at which point the larvae were at or near
37
38 300 competence to transform to the juvenile stage (not shown).
39
40
41 Directional asymmetry (DA) as a function of age are shown in Figure 2 and Table
42
43 1. Overall, we detected DA starting on day 33 in ALA arms, and in three of the four arm
44
45
46 303 pairs (PO, PD and ALA) on day 39; in each case, the arms were significantly shorter on
47
48 the left side. To see if DA in each of these arms pairs varied with age, we examined
49
50
51
linear regressions for the indices of asymmetry for each of the four sets of arms from
52
53 306 day 15 to 39: both the ALA and PD arms showed increasing DA with age (Table 1).

3
In order to more clearly examine if DA in purple urchin larvae is related to the
4
5
6 growth of the rudiment, we sorted all of the larvae (regardless of age) into one of 6
7
8 309 stage bins (A-F) defined by growth of skeletal structures in the rudiment (see the legend
9
10
11 to Figure 3 for details on how stage bins A-F correspond to the rudiment staging
12
13 scheme in [22]). As seen in Figure 3 and Table 2, we detected DA in ALA arms in stage
14
15 312 bins C, D and F, and in PO and PD arms only in stage bin F (the most advanced larvae
16
17
18 in our dataset). As with the age data, we examined linear regressions for the indices of
19
20 asymmetry for each of the four sets of arms to see if DA in each of these arms pairs
21
22 315 varied with stage. In this case, only the PD arms showed increasing DA with stage
23
24
25 (Table 2).
26
27
28 As different arms appear to show different levels of DA (Figs. 2, 3; Tables 1, 2)
29
30 318 we analyzed the index of asymmetry for the sum of all four arms) by both age (Fig. 4A,
31
32
33
Table 1) and stage (Fig. 4B, Table 2). With respect to age (Fig. 4A, Table 1), we
34
35 detected evidence for DA in total arm length on days 33 and 39. A regression analysis
36
37 321 showed a positive relationship between index of asymmetry for total arm length and age
38
39
40 (Table 1).
41
42
43 With respect to stage (Fig. 4B, Table 2), we detected evidence for DA in total arm
44
45 324 length in stage bins C, D and F. But in this case a regression analysis showed no

overall relationship between index of DA for total arm length and stage (Table 2). As
48
49
50 can be seen in Figure 4B, DA does not monotonically increase with stage; instead the
51
52 327 stage of peak DA for total arm length is stage bin C, which is the only stage at which our
53
54
55
ANOVA, after Bonferroni correction, detected a significantly higher DA than in any other
56
57 stage (stage bin C versus stage bin A: p=0.048).

330 Although it is not the focus of the current study, we undertook an analysis of
4
5
6 fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in comparison to measurement error. We performed this
7
8 analysis on a separate cohort of larvae 22 days after fertilization (all of which were in
9
10
11 333 stage bin A; see Fig. 3 legend). Using a mixed model as described by Palmer and
12
13 Strobeck [31], we found no evidence for directional asymmetry in PO, ALA and PD arm
14
15 lengths (PO: F1,37=0.06, p=0.80; ALA: F1,37=0.57, p=0.45; PD: F1,37=0.98, p=0.33); this
16
17
18 336 was expected for larvae in stage bin A (c.f., Fig. 3, Table 2). Nevertheless, FA was
19
20 significantly larger than measurement error (PO: F1,37=6.32, p<0.01; ALA: F1,37=3.87,
21
22 p<0.01; PD: F1,37=19.31, p<0.01) for all arm lengths among these larvae (note also that
23
24
25 339 these larvae only had 6 arms at the stage we examined them, thus we do not have PRO
26
27 data here). Although not entirely comparable, as these larvae were a separate cohort
28
29
30
from the main experiment outlined above, we note that the scope of our measurement
31
32 342 errors for PO, ALA and PD were 4-5x lower than the scope of L-R differences that are
33
34 seen in Figures 2 and 3.
35
36
37 In sum, we see clear evidence for DA in multiple arms through ontogeny,
38
39
40 345 whether viewed by age or stage. Arm length asymmetry in S. purpuratus larvae
41
42 increased with age and stage in ALA and PD arms, and total arm asymmetry (i.e.,
43
44 asymmetry in the arms as a whole) also increased with age. When analyzed by stage,
45
46
47 348 however, the pattern appears more complex: the greatest degree of total arm
48
49 asymmetry occurred in our stage bin C, which falls at about the midpoint of rudiment
50
51
52
development towards metamorphic competence.

Food did not affect larval arm asymmetry in S. purpuratus
4

6
7
354 One hypothesis that could explain the previously noted directional asymmetries
8
9 is that there is competition for limited resources or materials between the rudiment and
10
11 the nearby left arms. If so, we might expect to observe a more dramatic asymmetry in
12
13
14 357 larvae raised in food limited conditions, where such materials/resources would be in
15
16 reduced supply.
17
18
19 To test this hypothesis, we reared larvae under a high food ration for 25 days,
20
21 360 and then shifted a subset of the larvae into a reduced food ration (25% of the high food
22
23
24 ration) for the remainder of larval development. We then analyzed changes in arm
25
26 length as a function of age and stage for the low food- and high food-reared larvae.
27
28
29 363 Plasticity in larval arm growth overall as a function of food level has been well
30
31
32
demonstrated in S. purpuratus and numerous other echinoids [reviewed in 23]: in
33
34 general, larvae under low food conditions have longer arms relative to growth of juvenile
35
36 366 structures. We observed clear arm length plasticity for all arm pairs as a function of
37
38
39 binned stage (Fig. 5; PO: F1,89=21.19, p<0.01; ALA: F1,89=3.85, p=0.05; PD: F1,89=11.97,
40
41 p<0.01; PR: F1,89=5.62, p=0.02), as expected.
42
43
44 369 We then tested whether food environment would impact the extent of arm length
45
46
directional asymmetry (DA) in S. purpuratus larvae (Fig. 5). Statistically, such a food
47
48
49 effect on asymmetry would manifest as a significant interaction between food treatment
50
51 372 (high or low) and the index of DA [ln(R/L)]. Note that we only analyzed our data by
52
53
54
stage, as low and high food larvae developed on quite different trajectories towards
55
56 metamorphic competence (see Methods, above), and it seemed most sensible to

22
23
24 We analyzed anomalous larvae with naturally occurring double rudiments (i.e.,
25
26
27 384 larvae with “twin” juvenile rudiments developing simultaneously on the right and left
28
29 sides; Fig. 6B) to test the hypothesis that directional asymmetry (DA) in larval arms is
30
31
32
functionally linked to the formation of the juvenile rudiment (Figs. 3, 4B). As expected,
33
34 387 our single rudiment larvae (Fig. 6C) showed right-biased DA in both PO and PD arms,
35
36 with shorter arms on the left side (Fig. 6a; PO: t=2.68, p=0.028; ALA: t=1.90, p=0.093;
37
38
39 PD: t=2.95, p=0.018; n=8). By contrast, in our double rudiment larvae (Fig. 6B), the ALA
40
41 390 and PD arms did not show any evidence of DA (Fig. 6a; ALA: t=0.065, p=0.95; PD:
42
43 t=-1.08, p=0.32; n=9). In fact we detected a significant DA in the opposite direction in
44
45
46 the PO arms, which had slightly (~4.3%) longer arms on the left side (Fig. 6a; PO:
47
48 393 t=-3.377, p=0.012, n=9).

6 DISCUSSION
7
8 396 Metamorphosis in extant echinoderms involves a transformation from a bilateral
9
10
11 larva to a pentameral adult [32, 33]. Because the common ancestor of echinoderms and
12
13 other deuterostomes is hypothesized to have had an adult with bilateral symmetry
14
15
16
399 [reviewed in 34], this bilateral-to-pentameral shift during echinoderm ontogeny is
17
18 considered key to understanding the evolution of this unique group [35-37].
19
20
21 In all living echinoderms with indirect development (sensu McEdward [6]), the
22
23 402 adult body plan develops in a curious fashion with respect to that of the larva, via an
24
25
26 internal directional asymmetry: the juvenile forms on the left side of the otherwise
27
28 bilaterally symmetrical larva [18-22]. Here we show for the first time that in two disparate
29
30 405 echinoids, a sea urchin and a sand dollar, a second directional asymmetry is apparent
31
32
33 during late larval development, when the overall shape of the larva changes from more
34
35 or less bilaterally symmetric to directionally asymmetric during later stages: the majority
36
37
408 of the larval arms, which are supported by calcium carbonate skeletal rods, are
38
39
40 substantially (up to 25%; see Figs. 1 and 2) shorter on the rudiment side of the larva.
41
42
43 Although asymmetries in larval arms have been noted previously during normal
44
45 411 development in echinoid larvae [38-40], ours is the first demonstration of such a
46
47
48 unidirectional asymmetry in multiple arms, resulting in a consistent yet previously
49
50 undescribed shape change during late pluetus development. As in one other reported
51
52 414 case of a directional asymmetry in advanced pluteus larval arms [39, 40], we show
53
54
55 evidence here for a link between formation of the rudiment and the arm length
56
57 asymmetry, with shorter larval arms specifically on the rudiment (left) side. Our

417 demonstration of this asymmetry in both an irregular and a regular echinoid, as well as
4
5
6 our casual observations of such asymmetries in the larvae of several other echinoid
7
8 taxa which we have reared from several geographically-disparate locations (data not
9
10
11 420 shown), suggest to us that this directional asymmetry in arm length is likely a generic
12
13 feature of late-stage, echinoid larval development, and as such, it calls out for a
14
15 functional explanation.
16
17
18 423
19
20
21 Possible developmental mechanisms underlying larval arm asymmetry
22
23
24
Based on previous studies, Nodal and BMP signaling are the primary factors
25
26
27 426 responsible for the development of the juvenile rudiment on the left side of the sea
28
29 urchin larva, with Nodal expression on the right inhibiting BMP signaling there, and thus
30
31
32
directing BMP-activation of rudiment formation to the left side [24, 25, 41, 42]. Still, the
33
34 429 consequences of this asymmetry for development of the larval arms is unclear.
35
36
37 If the BMP-Nodal gene network is likewise involved in our reported arm length
38
39 asymmetries, then we would predict that the arm length asymmetries would coincide
40
41
42 432 with rudiment formation. This is not what we have observed. Indeed, at soft tissue stage
43
44 iv [22] (stage bin A, day 25 in this experiment) rudiment formation was already well
45
46
underway and we did not observe any directional asymmetries in arm length, which we
47
48
49 435 first detected at skeletal stage 3-4 [22] (stage bin C, ~day 31 in this experiment; Figures
50
51 2-4).
52
53
54 These observations suggest that if the BMP-Nodal gene network is involved in
55
56
57 438 the directional arm asymmetry, then this involvement is likely to be either indirect, or to

involve subsequent signaling steps. Still, our data reported here on double rudiments do
4
5
6 suggest that there is a mechanistic connection between rudiment asymmetry and the
7
8 441 arm length directional asymmetry, as also reported by Emlet [40] for the posterolateral
9
10
11
arm length asymmetry in the black sea urchin, Stomopneustes variolaris (Echinoidea:
12
13 Stomopneustidae). Evaluating the nature of this mechanistic connection could involve
14
15 444 examining arm asymmetries in the context of reduction-of-function manipulations (e.g.,
16
17
18 using morpholino oligonucleotides) directed against BMP or nodal signaling
19
20 components. Specifically, one could experimentally generate double rudiment larvae,
21
22 447 for example by inhibiting Nodal signaling [24], and test whether such a manipulation
23
24
25 results in loss of the directional asymmetry, as we saw in our naturally-occurring double
26
27 rudiment larvae. If BMP-Nodal signaling is indeed connected to the arm length
28
29
30
450 asymmetries, then it is possible that the expression of skeletal elongation genes such
31
32 as p58b and p16 [43, 44], and the skeletogenic gene network to which they belong [45],
33
34 may integrate with the BMP-nodal gene network in an as yet unrecognized fashion.

40 Functional implications of the asymmetry for larval biology
41
42
43 The antagonistic relationship between rudiment growth and arm length in feeding
44
45
46 456 pluteus larvae has been well-described in numerous taxa. Specifically, echinoid larvae
47
48 show adaptive phenotypic plasticity for arm growth relative to growth of the rudiment:
49
50
51
under high food conditions, arm length is reduced relative to rudiment growth; under low
52
53 459 food, arms grow longer and rudiment growth is delayed [9, 23, 46-64]. The adaptive
54
55 nature of this plasticity is indicated by the increased food capture efficiency in larvae
56
57
58 with longer arms [9].

3
462 Therefore, there is presumably a mechanistic connection between rudiment
4
5
6 growth and arm length, and it may be that this same antagonistic connection underlies
7
8 the late stage arm-length asymmetries reported here and by Collin [38], Yanagisawa
9
10
11 465 [39] and Emlet [40]. But why would such an antagonistic connection only manifest on
12
13 the left side of the larva during these late stages? Here we consider two functional
14
15 hypotheses in turn for our observed directional asymmetries in arm length. According to
16
17
18 468 the developmental constraint hypothesis, the asymmetries that we report here result
19
20 from some type of local developmental constraint or trade-off, in which the rudiment
21
22 grows at the expense of only the adjacent larval arms. Alternatively, the swimming
23
24
25 471 stability hypothesis predicts that this link is driven by selection on a specific, asymmetric
26
27 larval shape that facilitates stability or some other aspect of performance in the water
28
29
30
column.
31
32
33
474 The developmental constraint hypothesis envisions a scenario where some
34
35 factor utilized in the construction of both the rudiment and the larval arms is in limited
36
37 supply. The increasing demands in the rapidly growing rudiment for this hypothesized
38
39
40 477 factor leaves less of it available for the growth of nearby larval arms, and the result is
41
42 shorter larval arms adjacent to the rudiment.
43
44
45 Although our experiments are not sufficient to falsify this hypothesis, our results
46
47
480 are not wholly consistent with it. On the one hand, the left larval arm that is most distant
48
49
50 from the rudiment –the left preoral (PRO) arm– shows no evidence for directional
51
52 asymmetry in either D. excentricus or S. purpuratus, thus offering some support for a
53
54
55
483 local constraint related to the rudiment. Furthermore, the constraint hypothesis would
56
57 predict that the local competition would become more pronounced as the rudiment

grows ever larger and more complex as ontogeny proceeds; our developmental time
4
5
6 486 series with S. purpuratus (see Fig. 2, Table 1) is more or less consistent with this
7
8 prediction. However, when we analyzed our larvae grouped by rudiment development
9
10
11 stage (see Fig. 3, Table 2), we detected no increase in asymmetry at later stages.
12
13 489 Indeed, the stage with the most dramatic asymmetry was stage bin C, about mid-way
14
15 through rudiment development, where calcification of juvenile structures in the rudiment
16
17
18 is at an early stage [22]. Furthermore, under a reduced food scenario, where arms grow
19
20 492 longer and rudiment growth is delayed, the constraint hypothesis would seemingly
21
22 predict an even more dramatic asymmetry than in our well-fed larvae. This is not what
23
24
25 we observed; we saw no difference in the observed asymmetry between food
26
27 495 treatments.
28
29
30 Therefore, our data provide mixed support for the constraint hypothesis. Still
31
32
33
there is some precedence in other developing organisms for such a hypothesized local
34
35 498 competition for factors or resources. For example, the wing-reproduction tradeoff in
36
37 monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) has been proposed to be related to a position-
38
39
40 dependent mechanism, where juvenile hormone -produced in the brain- travels in the
41
42 501 hemolymph past the wings and through the thorax, ultimately reaching the gonads in
43
44 the posterior. Lessman and Herman [65] hypothesized that the highly active thorax
45
46
47 during long-distance flight acts like a gauntlet, breaking down active juvenile hormone
48
49 504 as it passes, leaving lower levels to arrive at the gonad, and therefore leading to
50
51
52
reduced gonadal growth during flight. A second proposed example is in horned beetles
53
54 (Onthophagus spp.) and other insects, where a factor such as insulin may be in limited

507 supply, and could account for the apparent trade-off in the sizes of adjacent structures
4
5
6 [66-68; but see 69].
7
8
9 In the urchin pluteus example, what could such a factor be? One appealing
10
11 510 possibility relates to the availability of calcium, which is used to construct both the
12
13
14 skeletal rods that support the larval arms and the diverse juvenile skeletal elements
15
16 forming in the rudiment at late larval stages; these processes may thus be in direct,
17
18 513 local competition. A simple experiment that would test for calcium limitation would be to
19
20
21 add additional calcium to the sea water in which the larvae are grown – if calcium within
22
23 the larvae at these late stages is normally in limited supply, then the asymmetry could
24
25
516 be attenuated or disappear if excess calcium is provided. Alternatively, one could block
26
27
28 calcium transport into the tissues of the rudiment through morpholino microinjection [70]
29
30 or treatment with chemical inhibitors, and test whether such treatments result in more
31
32
33
519 symmetrical larvae than in controls. Indirect evidence for this calcium limitation
34
35 hypothesis follows from the findings of Byrne et al. [71], who reported that Heliocidaris
36
37 tuberculata (Echinoidea: Echinometridae) larvae reared at low pH showed notable
38
39
40 522 asymmetries (presumably FA) at early larval stages.
41
42
43 A second intriguing possibility is that the local rudiment-arm length antagonism is
44
45 regulated by thyroid hormone (TH) signaling. Our previous studies [59] demonstrated
46
47
525 that TH treatment results in a phenotype similar to that previously described for low food
48
49
50 treatments, where juvenile structures grow faster, and larval arm growth is suppressed.
51
52 Experiments with TH synthesis inhibitors [34, 72-74] indicate that feeding larvae have
53
54
55
528 the capacity to produce TH internally, and our unpublished immuno-labeling
56
57 experiments indicate that the source for TH may be structures within the rudiment.

2
3
Therefore, if the rudiment is indeed the source for TH in plutei, and if TH levels correlate
4
5
6 531 negatively with arm growth, then one might expect arms near to the rudiment to be
7
8 shorter than ones more distant: this is precisely what we have observed here. A simple
9
10
11 test of this scenario would be to provide excess TH exogenously and see if the
12
13 534 observed asymmetries disappear.
14
15
16 Finally, additional support for biased L-R allocation of materials in pluteus larvae
17
18 comes from some intriguing observations on sea star bipinnaria larvae, whose feeding
19
20
21 537 larvae are considered homologous to echinoid plutei [75]. Circulation of fluid in the
22
23 blastocoel cavity of bipinnaria larvae has been described as largely unidirectional: from
24
25
the stomach, along the left side of the larva, and then around the mouth to the right side
26
27
28 540 of the larva [76; Jaeckle, pers. comm.]. Furthermore, coelomic fluid flow out of the left
29
30 hydrocoel via the pore canal and hydropore to the exterior of the larva [77] would tend
31
32
33
to draw blastocoelar fluid towards the left side [78], with the growing rudiment in later
34
35 543 stage larvae thus being a possible sink for blastocoelar substances. This biased
36
37 directional flow could therefore represent a mechanistic basis for uneven distribution of
38
39
40 blastocoelar substances, leading to the asymmetries that we report here.
41
42
43 546 The swimming stability hypothesis proposes that the asymmetry in larval arms
44
45 would provide a selective advantage to larvae, whereby asymmetrical larvae would, for
46
47
example, sink more slowly (and thus be retained in the water column more efficiently)
48
49
50 549 than symmetrical larvae. Such an asymmetry would be predictably directional due to the
51
52 substantial asymmetry in ballast provided by the rapidly growing and calcifying
53
54
55
rudiment, predominantly on the left side of the larva.

3
552 Indirect support for this hypothesis comes from several examples in the literature.
4
5
6 First, Collin [38] detected fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in early, pre-rudiment larval stages
7
8 of the sand dollar D. excentricus, and documented the first indication of a subtle
9
10
11 555 directional asymmetry [DA] in a single arm (posterodorsal; PD) during mid-late larval
12
13 development. FA is widely viewed as a measure of developmental stability and
14
15 perturbations to the developmental process, and can have both genetic and
16
17
18 558 environmental causes [79]. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated or suggested
19
20 an increase in FA or other asymmetries when sea urchin larvae or adults are exposed
21
22 to toxins [e.g., 80, 81]. Nevertheless, the apparent continuity between FA in larval arms
23
24
25 561 earlier in normal ontogeny [38], and then increasing DA later (38; our data reported
26
27 here) may indicate that the asymmetries themselves may be functional throughout
28
29
30
normal larval development. In this case, the forming rudiment in late stages might
31
32 564 impose additional constraints that could lead to predictably shorter arms on the left.
33
34
35 Chan [82] reviewed a number of studies on pluteus larval morphology as it
36
37 relates to stability and swimming, under different flow regimes and through ontogeny.
38
39
40 567 The basic pattern that Chan reports is a slight tilt in the orientation of the larval body in
41
42 flow increases the chances that a larva can maintain upward swimming (and thus
43
44 presumably stay in surface waters), rather than being carried downward. In an
45
46
47 570 unpublished study, Miyashita (pers. comm.) discovered that modeled, asymmetrical D.
48
49 excentricus larvae at the 4-arm stage (pre-rudiment growth) are able to maintain upward
50
51
52
swimming more effectively than symmetrical ones.
53
54
55
573 The models that Chan and Miyashita employed were based upon those
56
57 developed by Clay and Grunbaum [10], again using the sand dollar D. excentricus, but

once again focusing on early (4 arm) larval stages before the development of the
4
5
6 576 rudiment. One important set of parameters in this model relates to the center of gravity,
7
8 which would clearly change with the addition of an asymmetric, calcified rudiment, as
9
10
11 seen in the stages that we examined (though pluteus larvae are surprisingly more
12
13 579 buoyant as ontogeny proceeds; [83]). Furthermore, drag on larvae increases with both
14
15 arm length and arm number [15], which would be predicted to impact the stability of
16
17
18 larvae in different flow regimes [8].
19
20
21 582 Taken together, the studies to date suggest that larval shape, orientation and
22
23 asymmetries all can contribute to position in the water column, which can have
24
25
important consequences for dispersal or nearshore retention, prey encounter and
26
27
28 585 predator avoidance throughout larval development, and contacting the substrate in late
29
30 stage larvae preparing to settle to the benthos. Nevertheless, it is difficult to extrapolate
31
32
33
from the previous modeling studies on much simpler larval morphologies to those in
34
35 588 fully formed, 8-arm larvae with an asymmetrically growing and calcifying rudiment in
36
37 realistic flow conditions.
38
39
40 Our experiments reported here do not directly address the swimming stability
41
42
43 591 hypothesis. However, one intriguing observation is that the three arm pairs that protrude
44
45 the furthest from the larval midline –the postoral, posterodorsal and anterolateral arms–
46
47
are the three pairs that showed clear directional asymmetries in one or both species. By
48
49
50 594 contrast, the arm pair that runs closest to the midline –the preoral arms– showed no
51
52 signs of directional asymmetry in either species at any age or stage that we examined.
53
54
55
Likewise, the observations by Yanagisawa [39] and Emlet [40] of a dramatic asymmetry
56
57 597 in late stage larvae of the sea urchin Stomopneustes variolaris was specifically in a
58
59

2
3
unique pair of arms that project off the posterior end of those larvae, the posterolateral
4
5
6 arms. All of these observations suggest that asymmetric arm growth is not simply a
7
8 600 generic feature of late-stage pluteus larval arm growth common to all arms, and may
9
10
11 thus point towards a functional explanation such as envisioned by the swimming
12
13 stability hypothesis.
14
15
16 603 To adequately test this hypothesis experimentally, one would need to examine
17
18 larvae under realistic flow conditions, and see if the degree of asymmetry in late stage
19
20
21 larvae is related to their position in the water column. In addition, one could develop
22
23 606 more complex models of the pluteus larval form that would extend from the Clay &
24
25
Grunbaum [10] model, but include all four arm pairs and a growing and calcifying,
26
27
28 asymmetrical rudiment. The swimming stability hypothesis would predict that arm
29
30 609 asymmetries at these later stages would have clear consequences for position in the
31
32
33
water column and/or swimming ability.
34
35
36 Finally, we note that the developmental constraint and swimming stability
37
38 612 hypotheses are not the only two possible explanations for our observed asymmetries
39
40 (and these themselves are not necessarily mutually exclusive). For example, in recent
41
42
43 years it has become clear that asexual larval cloning is widespread in echinoids (which
44
45 615 again, has been particularly well-documented in D. excentricus), and one method of
46
47
such asexual cloning in larval sea stars [84, 85] – as yet undocumented in laval
48
49
50 echinoids [but see 28] – is budding of the arm tips. It is possible that such budding
51
52 618 occurs preferentially on the left side of late-stage echinoid larvae, which would lead to a
53
54
55
directional asymmetry pattern such as we observed. Furthermore, Emlet [40] suggested
56
57 that the asymmetry in posterolateral arms in Stomopneustes variolaris may be an

621 adaptation for more effective settlement to the benthos: a long left posterolateral arm
4
5
6 could interfere with substrate contact. A similar mechanical interference scenario might
7
8 promote the evolution of shorter arms in late stages in other urchins as well, as we have
9
10
11 624 observed here.

17 CONCLUSIONS
18
19
20 627 We here identify and characterize the ontogeny of a directional asymmetry in the
21
22 shape of echinoid pluteus larvae that is visible at late stages, alongside the well-known
23
24
internal directional asymmetry of the growing juvenile rudiment. Our data from two
25
26
27 630 disparate echinoids, separated by approximately 250 million years of evolution,
28
29 suggests that this asymmetry in overall larval shape, though previously undescribed,
30
31
32
may in fact be a common feature of late stage echinopluteus ontogeny. By examining
33
34 633 rare, anomalous plutei with juvenile rudiments on both the left and the right side, we
35
36 show that the asymmetry is mechanistically and/or functionally connected to rudiment
37
38
39 development. We explore several hypotheses to account for this asymmetry, focusing
40
41 636 on two main hypotheses: that the asymmetry aids in swimming stability in the water
42
43 column or that it is a result of a developmental constraint on material deposition in arms
44
45
46 versus the rudiment.
47
48
49 639 One feature of echinoids that makes them such a valuable taxon for comparative
50
51 studies is their great morphological diversity in the context of a relatively robust
52
53
54
understanding of their phylogeny. As with adult features, sea urchin larvae also show
55
56 642 remarkable diversity: for example, in arm number, their lengths relative to the body and

their position [86]. Furthermore, there are many independently evolved instances of loss
4
5
6 of larval feeding, accompanied by partial to complete loss of these larval arms [87]. And
7
8 645 finally, functional and anatomical studies indicate that the similar larval morphology in
9
10
11 the brittle stars (class Ophiuroidea) represents a completely independent evolutionary
12
13 acquisition of the pluteus form [12, 13]. Such diversity in form, with independent
14
15 648 evolutionary events and an easily quantifiable morphology, provides ample material for
16
17
18 detailed comparative investigations into this directional asymmetry: a tractable aspect of
19
20 functional morphology that can be studied in the context of the multiple ecological
21
22 651 requirements facing feeding and dispersing larvae in the ocean.

29 Figure 3: Directional asymmetry in purple urchin larvae as a function of juvenile rudiment stage. We
analyzed left-right asymmetry in developing purple urchin larval arms as a function of juvenile rudiment
30
stage for the (A) postoral, (B) anterolateral, (C) posterodorsal and (D) preoral arm pairs. We binned juvenile
31 rudiment stages after [22] as follows: Bin A - skeletogenic stage 0; Bin B – skeletogenic stages 1-2; Bin C –
32 skeletogenic stages 3-4; Bin D – skeletogenic stages 5-6; Bin E – skeletogenic stages 7-8; Bin F –
33 skeletogenic stages 9-10. Double axes and line colors as in Fig. 2. Abbreviations, asterisks and error bars as
34 in Fig. 1. See Table 2 for statistics.

44 Figure 5: Reduced larval food does not alter directional asymmetries in arm length across stages. (A-D) We
45 detected asymmetry in arm lengths with stage under both high food (HF; upper graphs in each panel) and
low food (LF; lower graphs) conditions in purple urchins, with no detectable differences in any arm pair
46
between high and low food (see the text). Double axes and line colors as in Fig. 2. Abbreviations, and error
47 bars as in Fig. 1. Stage bins as in Fig. 3. Numbers of larvae at each stage are as follows. Stage bin A: HF,
48 n=0; LF, n=4. Stage bin B: HF, n=3; LF, n=18. Stage bin C: HF, n=6; LF, n=9. Stage bin D: HF, n=13; LF,
49 n=17. Stage bin E: HF, n=8; LF, n=18. Stage bin F: HF, n=15; LF, n=8. Note that there were no HF larvae
50 in stage bin A, presumably due to their more rapid development than in the corresponding low food larval
51 cohort.

24 Figure 6: Larval arms of anomalous purple urchin larvae with double rudiments are more symmetrical. We
25 analyzed the index of arm length asymmetry (see Fig. 1 legend) in naturally occurring larvae with juvenile
rudiments on both the left and right sides (double rudiments; B), as compared to their full siblings with
26
single rudiments (C). Cartoons along bottom of figure indicate single and double rudiments. (A) Whereas
27 larvae with single rudiments (n=9 larvae) in this experiment showed right-biased directional asymmetry
28 (positive values) in postoral (PO) and posterodorsal (PD) arms (asterisks in right half of A), stage matched
29 larvae with double rudiments (n=8 larvae) did not show right-biased asymmetry in any of their arm pairs; in
30 fact PO arms in double rudiment larvae showed left biased asymmetry (negative values; asterisk in left half
31 of A). Scale bars in B.C: 150µm. Abbreviations, asterisks, error bars and orientation of larvae as in Fig. 1.

Appendix E
HODIN ET AL. RSOS-160139, FINAL RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS
We thank Reviewer 2 (Dr. Richard Palmer) for his final comments; once again, he has identified points
that, when we addressed them, improved the manuscript. We would also note that since Dr. Palmer
signed his review, we took the opportunity to contact him by email in the past week for clarification on
two of his recent points. We make reference to this email conversation below to indicate that we feel
we have now addressed these concerns in a manner satisfactory to Dr. Palmer. All told, we are now
confident that the manuscript is suitable for publication as now resubmitted.
In the sections below we list all of the most recent comments of Dr. Palmer, indented and in italics.
We respond in point-by-point fashion in unindented, unitalicized text. We refer throughout the
document below to Page and Line number references in the revised version of our manuscript. Please
note that our page number references are to the numbers printed on the lower right of every page, not
the page numbers as listed in the compiled PDF in the upper left corner (“page x of y”).
(Please ignore the other stray numbers in the upper and lower left corners of alternating pages; this
must be a glitch in the page numbering program as it relates to header and footer text. We were unable
to delete these numbers without deleting the correct line numbers as well; our apologies).
July 22, 2016
GENERAL COMMENT
Change in arm length with age/size. Something seems decidedly odd about the graphs in
figures 2 - 5. Why does arm length not increase with increasing larval age/stage beyond day
25/stage C? Shouldn't all of these arms get longer as the larvae grow and increase in size? If
these numbers are correct, the authors should comment on this near absence of any increase in
arm length with age/size in the discussion.
It does indeed seem odd that larvae should get smaller arms as they age, but under high food
conditions, this is exactly what is expected, and has in fact been observed multiple times in the
echinoid food plasticity literature. To accommodate Dr. Palmer's suggestion, we have added an
additional paragraph at the end of the feeding experiment section of the results on this point (see Page
18 Lines 380-387 in the revised manuscript).
====================================================
SPECIFIC COMMENTS
Line 247- should be "two-tailed one-sample"
We have made this change, as well as all of the other orthographic corrections/suggestions that Dr.
Palmer helpfully appended to the PDF file.
Line 631- As I noted in the earlier version, 'Previously undescribed' is not quite correct
because, as the authors note, such asymmetries have been described by Emlet 2009 and Collin
1997.
This is one of the two points that we referred to above where we, in the past week, contacted Dr.
Palmer directly for clarification. We have modified the wording in the sentence referenced above in a
way that Dr. Palmer agrees now highlights the uniqueness of our contribution. See Page 29 Line 638-
642 in the revised manuscript.
Fig. 3- The labeling of the lines for R and L, and the font colors, aren't consistent in these
panels. Presumably R is grey and dashed throughout but this is not so in Panels B and D.
We thank Dr. Palmer for noticing this regrettable error, which we have now rectified.
Tables 1 & 2 legends- Explain to what "regression analysis" refers.
We have now added a few words to the Table legends to clarify. Specifically we added the following
explanation to the legend in Table 1: “...our test to determine if DA changes as a function of age (days
PF) using a linear regression”, and in the legend to Table 2: “...our test to determine if DA changes as a
function of stage bin using a linear regression.”
ADDITIONAL COMMENT APPENDED TO THE PDF
Line 335- The df do not appear to be correct (and therefore the p values likely wrong) for the
test for DA. In the mixed model ANOVA, the mean squares of the term "sides" (DA) should be
tested over the mean squares of the interaction term "side x individual interaction" using the
appropriate df for both (the listed df appears to be that for the error term).
This was the second instance where we contacted Dr. Palmer directly in the past week for clarification,
and he recommended that we present all the ANOVA results in table form. To accommodate this
suggestion we have now added a supplemental table (Table S1) for the FA analysis containing all
required statistical parameters.
We did in fact report the incorrect degrees of freedom in our previously submitted version, and they are
now properly represented in the new version. We note that our new analysis did not result in any
change to our conclusion that there is FA in all three arms and no DA for any of the arms in the dataset
in question.
