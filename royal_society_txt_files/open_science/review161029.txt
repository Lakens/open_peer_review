The authors present an exciting study on a surprising observation. They provide a conclusive
proximal explanation for the obvious problem the Lema males have when developing a flagellum
exceeding the own body length. The experiments are designed, executed, analysed, and
interpreted in a spotless manner. I have only few minor remarks, which I have placed as
comments on the attached PDF. There is only one major suggestion I have to make: The whole
story the authors present would apper by far more plausible and convincing if the authors would
stress the ultimate explanation of sexual selection. Flagellum length is correlated with the length
of the spermathecal duct (as Yoko Matsumura knows very well). Thus, the primary evolutionary
driver for the elongation of the flagellum is certainly the elongation of the spermathecal duct. The
whole process is a wonderful example of runaway evolution (Fisher's Process). Therefore,
convergent evolution must be expected since the sole selective factors act within the species, i.e.
between the sexes. Such an evolutionary explanation (see Eberhard WG Sexual Selection and
Animal Genitalia, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass. - London 1985) would round up
the paper and make it definitely more attractive, as it would show its general importance.
My linguistic remarks on the PDF should be treated as suggestions only, as I am not a Native

What was known:
The male genitalia of these beetles contains a narrow, sclerite, the flagellum, that is sometimes
longer than the body and thus stored in the pocket at the tip of the male genitalia in a coiled
3
stage, stretching the wall of the pocket. This structure is everted during mating and inserted
inside the spermatheca of the female.
The flagellum does not receive any muscle attachments so its eversion and retraction is achieved
through the movement (retraction and eversion) of the pocket, which is moved by the
hemolymph pressure change. The movement of the flagellum is only possible because it is tightly
adjacent to the wall of the pocket. It has been observed by previous authors that males of the
studied species evert the male genitalia multiple times before mating.
What is new:
The authors observed that the freshly emerged males have the flagellum tightly coiled in the
middle of the pocket, not adjacent to its wall. The authors hypothesized that this is an inactive
flagellar stage that can not be used in successful mating, and that a subsequent behavior (multiple
eversiona and redrawal of the pocket) is required to partially (until it reaches the wall of the
pocket) uncoil the flagellum into an active position.
The authors defined the timing and the mechanism of the flagellum activation and demonstrated
that developmental constraints led to the evolution of this unique phenomena.
The manuscript describes an interesting hypothesis that is well supported by the data the authors
provide and well illustrated. However, I found the MS sometimes hard to understand and the
link to the null hypothesis of developmental constraint a bit overemphasized. Basically every
newly emerged insect suffers from space issues during the development that has to be
subsequently “fixed” by a various type of behaviours. Like every insects have to pump
hemolymph to the wings or the legs before they can fly or walk or unfold certain elongate
anatomical structures before the hardening of the cuticle.
The authors should follow their previously used terminology, e.g. use “pocket” instead of
“invaginated membrane” or “internal sac sclerite” instead of “sclerite” and most importantly
simplify their descriptions.
For instance, they should clearly describe in the Abstract the two stages of the flagellum: partially
uncoiled v.s. coiled instead of “functional position” and instead of referring as behavior they
should clearly describe what they observed: “eversion and withdrawal”. Also, I would simply
use “uncoiling” instead of repositioning throughout the paper and perhaps use an analogy of the
“main spring” in a clock to describe what is really happening during “repositioning”.
The authors mention that the pocket of the internal sac is “somehow” flattened laterally. It seems
to me that the flagellum is flattening the sac by stretching it out since it is still only partially
uncoiled.
The findings of this manuscript are simple and definitely worth to publish, and I think the
present form of the manuscript suffers from the author's desire to make it more complicated or
elaborate. I found the first part of the introduction a bit painful to read and understand and really
don’t think this paper needs any discussion about developmental constraints and null hypothesis
in any way.
I made several comments and suggestions in the manuscript that can be found as annotations in
the attached pdf file. (Appendix B)
This is a wonderful study that is based on series of really accurate, careful, time consuming and
smart observations. Please make it fully accessible and enjoyable for the reading audience by
delivering your findings on the most simple and understandable way!

This is an interesting paper, detailing how two species of beetle (focusing in particular on Lema
coronata) that have very elongated male genitalia require the males to evert the genitalia one or
more times prior to copulation in order for the structures to be properly organised internally to
allow (the presumed) correct deployment during mating. Comparisons are made with two
related species that have shorter flagellae and do not require this prior behaviour.
The experimental approach and the associated data and figures are nice and I think the basic
story is robust (although it is not clear from my reading whether or not the authors know for sure
that the correct alignment cannot occur during an initial copulation, as the experiment only
showed that the genitalia had to be everted, not that it couldn't do so inside a female - but
perhaps this has been shown before?). Below I will outline just a few suggestions to help tighten
up that aspect of the paper.
However, before then, I have two other, linked comments to make. First, the framing of the paper
in terms of developmental constraints seems unnecessary and potentially even detracts from the
more interesting part of the paper. It is certainly nice to record that these species with complex
genitalia seem to require to deploy that genitalia prior to mating, but the idea that motor patterns
more generally require "practise" beforehand is not new, and certainly not uncommon. Another
problem with the constraints literature - and indeed with this paper - is that, well, there is not
really much of a constraint after all. The development of a "null hypothesis" seemed a little bit
forced, and in general the whole framework did not add anything to me. I would recommend
removing all of this, and just get to the more interesting observations and experiments, stating
more matter-of-factly that long genitalia in this genus requires some form of practise or pre-
deployment.
Second, the phylogenetic component of the paper is currently unconvincing. Figure 8 is rather
cursory and the (undiscussed) paraphyletic nature of the genus is of some concern. With so few
species, not much inference can be drawn here, and the overall phylogenetic context is rather
thin. Again, I would recommend stepping back from any form of formal analysis, perhaps
suggesting an evolutionary pathway that is consistent with the data, but that does not seek to
"test" any developmental constraints hypotheses, as I do not think the data are sufficient to do so.
5
More generally, elongated genitalia exist outside of the Coleoptera (e.g. Heteroptera, Diptera etc)
so perhaps a more nuanced and less narrow discussion of the evolution of elongated genitalia
may be useful, including studies where experiments have been done?
In terms of the main part of the paper though, a few things could be clearer. First, the methods
section for 2.3 and 2.4 are not very clear. For 2.3, please provide a clearer picture of the
experimental procedure and set up, and just how many beetles are being observed, when, and
how data are combined (if they are combined). It then has to be clear how the statistics deal with
these observations (i.e. to control for multiple males per cell etc). For 2.4, again, it is not very clear
exactly what was done and when, especially in terms of how long animals were left before being
sacrificed and dissected.
Second, please explain what "effect size" you are using in the results.
Third, the readability of the results would be improved by stating the biology of the results first,
then all the stats (e.g. lines 214-216 moved to beginning of paragraph; likewise lines 251-252). I
like murder mysteries, but would rather know the answer first when reading papers, then get the
statistical justification.
In summary, I strongly recommend removing the emphasis on developmental constraints and
just tell a nice story about the beetles instead. The phylogenetic scope is not sufficient for a broad
test of any hypotheses about developmental constraints, and the introduction will probably put
off more people that it attracts.

Comments to the Author(s)

I thank the authors for the improvements made to the paper, and I think that for the most part it
is much more satisfactory than before. I have just a few further comments that the authors need
to consider.
First, this reviewer is aware of what an effect size is general terms, but the reviewer is also aware
that there are a variety of effect sizes that can be presented, from things like R^2, through to
standardised effect sizes such as Cohen’s or Hedges’ and so on. Again, I ask for clarity here. If we
consider their use in section 3.2, we need to know what kind or type of effect size is being
presented, to be able to interpret the results. It might be that the effect size presented is merely
the test statistic, but it might not be. Please let us know.
Ssecond, the sample sizes are still absent from the methods. These must be provided. From the
Suppl Info, it looks as though the sample sizes are quite small (e.g. N = 11 or 19, but even fewer
statistically independent cells, which must be taken into account using random effects).
Third, the Suppl Info is hard to follow, poorly formatted in places, and does not provide a clear
pathway to understand the statistical analyses and samples sizes. Please provide basic
information in a more straightforward manner.
Fourth, the statistical analysis in section 3.1 needs checking. Why are there three numerator
degrees of freedom when male age is the explanatory factor (presumably coded as a continuous
variable, as it certainly has a “direction”, and so there should be one numerator degree of
freedom), and why is the analysis for body size and elytra length given by only one statistical
tests, instead of two? Also, how was the ANOVA ran? As the two tests given have different
denominator degrees of freedom, were Type I sums of squares used and/or model
simplification? I would strongly recommend type III sums of squares. Finally, it is hard to link
the degress of freedom presented to the sample sizes presented in the SI.

The MS looks great, except the link to dryad (http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.887g1) did not
work for me, I guess it will be activated once the MS is published.

Comments to the Author(s)
I thank the authors for the improvements made to the paper, and I think that for the most part it
is much more satisfactory than before. I have just a few further comments that the authors need
to consider.

First, this reviewer is aware of what an effect size is general terms, but the reviewer is also aware
that there are a variety of effect sizes that can be presented, from things like R^2, through to
standardised effect sizes such as Cohen’s or Hedges’ and so on. Again, I ask for clarity here. If we
consider their use in section 3.2, we need to know what kind or type of effect size is being
presented, to be able to interpret the results. It might be that the effect size presented is merely
the test statistic, but it might not be. Please let us know.
Ssecond, the sample sizes are still absent from the methods. These must be provided. From the
Suppl Info, it looks as though the sample sizes are quite small (e.g. N = 11 or 19, but even fewer
statistically independent cells, which must be taken into account using random effects).
Third, the Suppl Info is hard to follow, poorly formatted in places, and does not provide a clear
pathway to understand the statistical analyses and samples sizes. Please provide basic
information in a more straightforward manner.
Fourth, the statistical analysis in section 3.1 needs checking. Why are there three numerator
degrees of freedom when male age is the explanatory factor (presumably coded as a continuous
variable, as it certainly has a “direction”, and so there should be one numerator degree of
freedom), and why is the analysis for body size and elytra length given by only one statistical
tests, instead of two? Also, how was the ANOVA ran? As the two tests given have different
denominator degrees of freedom, were Type I sums of squares used and/or model
simplification? I would strongly recommend type III sums of squares. Finally, it is hard to link
the degress of freedom presented to the sample sizes presented in the SI.

30 12 Abstract
31
32 13 Some species of criocerine beetles have a hyper-elongated part of the intromittent organ
33
34 14 called the flagellum. The flagellum is normally stored in a certain position in the
35
36 15 intromittent organ specialized for its storage, which presents a precise motion control
37
38 16 requirement for sperm transfer. However, the morphogenesis of the flagellum does not
39
40
41 17 generate the functional shape required for its insertion into the female spermathecal
42
43 18 duct. It is impossible for these beetles to generate a flagellum in the functional position,
44
45 19 despite this position being indispensable for copulation. After eclosion, males
46
47 20 repeatedly perform a behavior involving eversion and withdrawal of the intromittent
48
49 21 organ without mounting a female. Without this behavior, males cannot place the
50
51
22 flagellum in the functional position and be ready for mating. A closely related species
52
53
54 23 with a long flagellum also needs the same behavior to place the flagellum in the
55
56 24 functional position, but some other species with much shorter flagella can attain the

19 31 1. Introduction
20
21 32 Evolution involves modifications of descendants, which means that historical
22
23 33 trajectories characterize evolutionary directions [1-6]. Reductions in the likelihood of
24
25 34 specific phenotypic transformations, particularly because of intrinsic factors, are known
26
27
28
35 as developmental constraints [2, 7-9]. Although the term “constraints” carries mainly
29
30 36 negative connotations in the evolutionary sense, it is also a positive force in directing
31
32 37 progeny [2, 3, 5, 9]. In other words, developmental constraints canalize certain
33
34 38 phenotypic transformations from the ancestral state (developmental drive [6]).
35
36 39 Developmental constraints play a major role in determining the evolution of forms as
37
38 40 well as natural selection and genetic drift [2, 5, 7, 8]. Various studies have demonstrated
39
40
41 41 exemplars of stasis or diversification that can be associated with developmental
42
43 42 constraints [3-5, 8, 10-13]. However, few studies have shown how the evolution of new
44
45 43 character states generates developmental constraints and how these developmental
46
47 44 constraints affect further evolution of the characters [14]. Numerous other articles have
48
49 45 discussed “constraints” but usually have not established a well-defined null hypothesis
50
51
46 for developmental constraints, which obfuscates the meaning of developmental
52
53
54 47 constraints [7, 9]. In the present study, we investigated an exemplar case of
55
56 48 developmental constraints in the evolution of an extremely elongated intromittent organ

7

9
10 51 The main species of focus in the present study is Lema coronata, which has an
11
12 52 elongated element (known as a flagellum) as a part of the intromittent organ that is
13
14
53 approximately twice the length of the body (ca. 10.4 mm) and is very fragile (diameter
15
16
17 54 of the flagellum: ca. 2 µm) [15] (Fig. 1a). In most cases, the flagellum is stored in the
18
19 55 internal sac (Fig. 1a, red-colored structure), but during copulation the fragile flagellum
20
21 56 is precisely controlled and inserted into a female sperm receptacle organ, the
22
23 57 spermatheca [15]. During copulation, a membranous internal sac of the intromittent
24
25 58 organ is first evaginated from a median lobe and inserted into the female vagina, which
26
27
28
59 is called the bursa copulatrix [15] (Fig. 1b). The insertion and withdrawal of the
29
30 60 flagellum are accomplished quickly due to the very complex configuration of the
31
32 61 flagellum and the internal sac membrane, which has been observed only in species of
33
34 62 the subgenus Lema [16, 17]. An apical part of the internal sac membrane is invaginated
35
36 63 (Fig. 1c, d), the invaginated membrane of the internal sac is somehow flattened on the
37
38 64 sagittal plane (Fig. 1e), and the flagellum is slotted along the margin [16] (Fig. 1c, d).
39
40
41 65 Since the entire flagellum, which is twice as long as the body, is stored in the small
42
43 66 internal sac (Fig. 1a), the margin of the invaginated membrane is strongly stretched out
44
45 67 and has a waving appearance [16] (Figs. 1g, 2f dashed line). No muscles are directly
46
47 68 located on the flagellum [16]. However, due to the strict relationship between the
48
49 69 flagellum and invaginated membrane, the beetle can move and precisely control the
50
51
70 flagellum with the eversion of the invaginated membrane due to an increase in
52
53
54 71 hemolymph pressure [16] (Fig. 1f, h). Nevertheless, this strict relationship between the
55
56 72 invaginated membrane and flagellum is not established at all in newly emerged adults

6 73 (Figs. 1i, 2c). The flagellum is merely coiled in the invaginated membrane (Figs. 1a,
7
8 74 2c), and the configuration of the flagellum and invaginated membrane is completely
9
10 75 different from that of males during the reproductive season (compare Fig. 2c and 2f).
11
12 76 This means that males emerge before achieving the functional state of the flagellum and
13
14
77 invaginated membrane, which is critically important for their reproduction. This
15
16
17 78 observation led us hypothesize that males cannot achieve the complicated functional
18
19 79 state through morphogenesis alone. Therefore, the null hypothesis regarding
20
21 80 developmental constraints is that males can produce the coiled and functional states
22
23 81 equally.
24
25 82 To analyze the validity of the developmental constraint hypothesis and determine
26
27
28
83 what enables the species to acquire the hyper-elongated flagellum, we clarified the
29
30 84 following two aspects: (a) when the flagellar location changes (before or after sexual
31
32 85 maturation) and (b) how the rearrangement of the flagellum and the invaginated
33
34 86 membrane mechanically occurs in L. coronata. Based on our present observations and
35
36 87 reports of morphogenesis by Matsumura et al. [18], we discussed whether the formation
37
38 88 of the flagellum in the coiled state should be regarded as the result of developmental
39
40
41 89 constraints. In addition, the evolution of the characteristic evoking the flagellar
42
43 90 rearrangement was investigated based on a comparison with other Lema species with a
44
45 91 different flagellar length. Based on information from the associated molecular
46
47 92 phylogenetic tree [19], we propose an evolutionary history of the elongated flagellum.

6 97 adults were collected and placed in a plastic bag with their food plant Commelina
7
8 98 communis, and the bag was stored in an incubator (27 ± 0.5°C, 16 L/8 D; the light was
9
10 99 turned on at 9:00). The eggs laid were reared to adulthood, and the adults were used in
11
12 100 the following experiments. Every day (approximately 14:00 to 19:00), newly emerged
13
14
101 adult males were separated and kept together till further experiments (Fig. 2a). The
15
16
17 102 adults were fixed chronologically with a conventional freezer and were dissected to
18
19 103 determine the time at which the position of the flagellum was rearranged into a
20
21 104 functional state. The fixation schedule is presented in Fig. 2a with arrows.
22
23 105 2.2. Chronological changes in vas deferens and + testis weights. If the presumed
24
25 106 functional state of the flagellum is indispensable for the insertion of the flagellum, as
26
27
28
107 discussed in Matsumura and Yoshizawa [16] based on the morphology, it is reasonably
29
30 108 predicted that flagellar repositioning occurs prior to sexual maturity. Because the mature
31
32 109 sperm are stored in a seminal vesicle (part of the vas deferens) in insects [20], we
33
34 110 measured the dried weight of the vasa deferentia + testes of animals of different ages.
35
36 111 One-, 3- and 5-day-old virgin males and field-collected males in the reproductive season
37
38 112 that had presumably experienced multiple copulations were fixed using FAA fixative
39
40
41 113 (formaldehyde – acetic acid – ethanol solution) or 70% ethanol. Specimens were
42
43 114 preserved in 70% ethanol. One pair of vasa deferentia + testes for each individual was
44
45 115 dissected under an Olympus SZ60 stereomicroscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), dried in
46
47 116 an incubator and stored at 37°C for one night. The sample was then weighed with an
48
49 117 Ultramicro Balance SE-2 (Sartorius Japan K. K., Tokyo, Japan). The weight differences
50
51
118 between ages were assessed via an analysis of variance (ANOVA) using R 3.1.1 [21].

6 121 eversion and withdrawal, according to Matsumura and Yoshizawa [16]. Therefore, we
7
8 122 predicted that males would rearrange the flagellar position from the coiled state to the
9
10 123 functional state by moving the internal sac membrane. Notably, it was previously
11
12 124 demonstrated that Lema coronata males push the intromittent organ out of the abdomen
13
14
125 and evert the membrane without any females present [22]. As a first step in testing the
15
16
17 126 hypothesis regarding the flagellar arrangement, we quantified the movement of the
18
19 127 intromittent organ on the day of and one day prior to the rearrangement occurrence.
20
21 128 Repeated eversion of the intromittent organ was observed in 3- and 4-day-old
22
23 129 individuals when the flagellar position dramatically changed. Eleven (3-day-old) and 29
24
25 130 (4-day-old) individuals were observed; the same animal was never assessed on both
26
27
28
131 days.
29
30 132 One or two (in one case, three) males were placed in small cells (1.6 cm in diameter)
31
32 133 arranged in a plastic case (12.6×8.5 cm), and photographs of the beetles in the plastic
33
34 134 case were automatically captured at 10-sec intervals using a CX1 digital camera (Ricoh,
35
36 135 Japan). The males continuously everted their internal sac membranes for more than 10
37
38 136 sec without the presence of any females [22]. Therefore, our non-continuous
39
40
41 137 observation was sufficient to quantify the frequency of the behavior. The successive
42
43 138 pictures of the behavior thus reflect a series of the behavior, and the duration of the
44
45 139 behavior was calculated by regarding one photo, equal to 10 sec. Because the battery
46
47 140 life of the camera was three hours, the observations were fragmented. On average, each
48
49 141 cell was observed for 15.1 (3-day-old) and 15.4 (4-day-old) hours. Because the number
50
51
142 of beetles in a cell varied among cells and every beetle in a cell could not be
52
53
54 143 individually identified from the photos, we multiplied the duration of the observation of
55
56 144 each cell by the number of beetles in each cell and considered this value to be the

7
8 146 A statistical model to evaluate the effects of age on the frequency of the internal sac
9
10 147 eversion behavior was formulated as a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), which
11
12 148 enabled us to estimate parameters for both fixed effects (in this case, day-age effects)
13
14
149 and random effects (the variance between unobservable effects resulting from cell
15
16
17 150 differences). We assumed that the frequency was proportional to the observation time ×
18
19 151 the number of animals in each cell, so we set the product as an offset term of the
20
21 152 GLMM. The Poisson distribution was specified to represent the probability distribution
22
23 153 of the observed frequency of the behavior. The statistical model fittings were performed
24
25 154 using R 3.1.1 [21] equipped with the glmmML package [23].

28
155 2.4. Plugging the gateway of the intromittent organ. To assess our hypothesis that the
29
30 156 rearrangement of the flagellar position into the functional state is achieved by the
31
32 157 internal sac eversion behavior, the frequencies of flagellar rearrangement into the
33
34 158 functional state were compared among the following three treatment groups. In group I,
35
36 159 the gateway for the intromittent organ at the abdominal tip was plugged with
37
38 160 water-resistant glue (Alon Alpha EX, Komishi, Japan) (Fig. 5a, b). In group II, to create
39
40
41 161 a positive control to test the impacts of the super-glue treatment, we applied the super
42
43 162 glue to other body parts (Fig. 5c). Three males removed the glue from the gateway soon
44
45 163 after the treatment in group I; we treated these animals as members of group II. In group
46
47 164 III, the males were left intact as a negative control. The treatment was performed on
48
49 165 individuals one day prior to the rearrangement (at 22:00 to 23:00 on the 3rd day), and
50
51
166 fixation was performed at 24:00 on the day of rearrangement. The rearrangement
52
53
54 167 frequencies were compared between the treatments via the <U+03C7>2 test with R. 3.1.1 [21].

7
8 170 via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The alcohol-preserved specimens were
9
10 171 dehydrated through an ethyl alcohol/t-butyl alcohol series and were freeze-dried. Then,
11
12 172 the specimens were coated with palladium and observed using SEM (JSM-5610, JEOL,

15
16
17 174 2.6. Related species. To evaluate the uniqueness of the rearrangement of the flagellar
18
19 175 position and the behavior observed in L. coronata, we explored these features in three
20
21 176 closely related species [19]: Lema dilecta, L. diversa, and L. scutellaris. These three
22
23 177 species have similar body sizes but different flagellar lengths. L. coronata has a flagellar
24
25 178 length of 10.4 mm (ca. 1.9-fold its body length). L. dilecta has a flagellar length of 4.20
26
27
28
179 mm (ca. 1.1-fold), L. diversa has a flagellar length of 0.74 mm (ca. 0.15-fold), and L.
29
30 180 scutellaris has a flagellar length of 2.03 mm (ca. 0.40-fold) [24]. The data regarding L.
31
32 181 dilecta were reported as L. michioi [24]; however, L. michioi is a junior synonym of L.
33
34 182 dilecta [25].
35
36 183 We reared the animals using the method described above. Due to the difficulty in
37
38 184 rearing L. dilecta, we used L. diversa and L. scutellaris to evaluate behavioral
39
40
41 185 frequency. A total of 39 individuals in L. diversa and 43 individuals in L. scutellaris
42
43 186 were used, and all males were 4 days old. The average duration of observation for each
44
45 187 cell was 10.8 and 8.3 hours for L. diversa and L. scutellaris, respectively. To compare
46
47 188 differences in behavioral frequencies between these two species and L. coronata,
48
49 189 statistical models (GLMMs, described in subsection 2.4) were fitted to the data. Five
50
51
190 logical combinations of species differences were possible. We chose the best
52
53
54 191 combination in terms of goodness-of-prediction by evaluating the Akaike information
55
56 192 criterion (AIC).

11
12 196 3.1. Chronological changes in flagellar position and testis size in L. coronata.
13
14
197 Variable conditions of the flagellum in the invaginated membrane were observed (Fig.
15
16
17 198 2c-f). The flagellum was completely slotted in the waving invaginated membrane (Fig.
18
19 199 2f), which was the same condition observed in the males collected from the field during
20
21 200 the reproductive season. In other cases, the flagellum was completely coiled in the
22
23 201 invaginated membrane (Fig. 2c); a strict relationship between the invaginated
24
25 202 membrane and the flagellum was not observed. Additionally, intermediate states
26
27
28
203 between the two extreme conditions were observed. In some cases, the flagellum was
29
30 204 partly coiled, and the coils were partially loosened (Fig. 2d). In the other cases, the coils
31
32 205 were loosened, and the flagellum was partly grasped by the invaginated membrane (Fig.
33
34 206 2e).
35
36 207 The flagella of approximately all the males were completely coiled until the 3rd day
37
38 208 (Fig. 2b). The proportion of males exhibiting the functional state gradually increased
39
40
41 209 during the 4th day (Fig. 2b). The coiled state was not observed thereafter (Fig. 2b).
42
43 210 The vas deferens + testis size in males was significantly associated with male age
44
45 211 (ANOVA, F3, 16 = 10.9, P<0.001) but was not significantly influenced by body size or
46
47 212 elytral length (analysis of covariance [ANCOVA], F1, 15 = 0.304, P = 0.59) (Fig. 3). The
48
49 213 males collected in the field and assumed to have experienced copulation had heavier
50
51
214 vasa differentia + testes than other males (Fig. 3). Therefore, positional changes in the
52
53
54 215 flagellum were completed prior to increasing the weight of the vasa deferentia + testes,
55
56 216 which is an indication of sexual maturity.

6 217 3.2. Eversion and withdrawal of the internal sac in L. coronata. The males repeated
7
8 218 series of the behavior lasting 60.0 ± 20.8 sec (means ± standard deviation [SD]) (max.
9
10 219 90 sec, min. 30 sec, N = 6) in 3-day-old individuals (N = 11) and 73.8 sec ± 52.2 (means
11
12 220 ± SD) (max. 310 sec, min. 10 sec, N = 65) in 4-day-old individuals (N = 29). The
13
14
221 estimated effect size differentiating between the 3- and 4-day-olds was 1.40 (standard
15
16
17 222 error [SE] 0.427), for which the Wald P-value was 0.0011; the 4-day-old males
18
19 223 exhibited higher numbers of this behavior (Fig. 4). This was also the case for the
20
21 224 duration of the behavior (estimated effect size = 1.776, SE = 0.570, Wald P-value =
22
23 225 0.0019; the duration was estimated using the number of frames exhibiting the behavior).
24
25 226 3.3. Plugging the gateway of the intromittent organ in L. coronata. The proportion of
26
27
28
227 males with the functional flagellar position and nearly functional states was reduced in
29
30 228 group I (with the gateway of the intromittent organ plugged) (Fig. 5a, b) compared with
31
32 229 group II (the positive control super-glue-experienced males) (Fig. 5c) and group III (the
33
34 230 negative control intact males) (Fig. 5d). In contrast, no differences in frequency were
35
36 231 noted between groups II and III (Fisher’s exact test: d.f. = 1, P = 0.001, for I vs. II; d.f. =
37
38 232 1, P<0.0001, I vs. III; d.f. = 1, P = 0.260, II vs. III; P-value with Bonferroni correction
39
40
41 233 for multiple comparisons) (Fig. 5d).
42
43 234 3.4. Microstructure of the invaginated membrane in L. coronata. The inner surface
44
45 235 of the invaginated membrane was covered by fine isotropic wrinkles and spine-like
46
47 236 projections (Fig. 6). The wrinkles were arranged parallel to the flagellum, and the
48
49 237 projections were pointed toward the flagellum (Fig. 6a).
50
51
238 3.5. Flagellar position change and behavior in related species. The flagella of the
52
53
54 239 males at 24 hours after eclosion were simply coiled in the invaginated membrane in L.
55
56 240 dilecta (with a relatively long flagellum) and were slotted in the margin of the

6 241 invaginated membrane in the other species (L. diversa and L. scutellaris) with relatively
7
8 242 short flagella (Fig. 7a-d). Chronologically, the flagellar position in L. dilecta underwent
9
10 243 changes similar to those in L. coronata (Fig. 7e). L. diversa and L. scutellaris also
11
12 244 exhibited behavior similar to that in L. coronata. L. diversa and L. scutellaris exhibited
13
14
245 the behavior for 41.8 ± 14.9 sec (mean ± SD) (max. 70 sec, min. 20 sec, N = 33) and
15
16
17 246 44.6 ± 20.2 sec (mean ± SD) (max. 70 sec, min. 10 sec, N = 13), respectively. The
18
19 247 model assuming that all species were different was selected to be the best (AIC estimate
20
21 248 = 101.54). The remaining 4 AIC estimates were 112.95 (no species differences), 103.76
22
23 249 (L. coronata differed), 114.81 (L. diversa differed), and 104.45 (L. scutellaris differed).
24
25 250 The estimated effect sizes for between-species differences were -1.354 (SE 0.347) for L.
26
27
28
251 scutellaris and -0.617 (SE 0.273) for L. diversa. L. coronata exhibited increased
29
30 252 behavior frequency compared with the other species (Fig. 7f).
31
32 253
33
34 254 4. Discussion
35
36 255 The present study showed that the internal sac eversion behavior serves to rearrange the
37
38 256 coiled flagellum into the complicated functional state in L. coronata. The supporting
39
40
41 257 results showed that the internal sac eversion behavior increased on the day when the
42
43 258 rearrangement of the flagellar position occurred, i.e., 4 days after eclosion; the absence
44
45 259 of this behavior in 4-day-old adults due to plugging of the genital opening significantly
46
47 260 decreased the ratio of those in the functional state compared with the other treatments.
48
49 261 Although the frequency was relatively low, the internal sac eversion behavior was also
50
51
262 observed in 3-day-old adults, when approximately all individuals still had coiled
52
53
54 263 flagella. This finding suggests that one behavior alone cannot induce the rearrangement
55
56 264 of the flagellum. Males performed the behavior more than twice on average during the
57

5
6 265 4th day (we observed only 15 hours per individual on average), and many males on the
7
8 266 4th day exhibited intermediate states between the coiled and functional states. This
9
10 267 finding implies that repeated performance of the internal sac eversion behavior is
11
12 268 required for the rearrangement of the flagellum.
13
14
269 How is the flagellum rearranged only by the eversion and withdrawal of the internal
15
16
17 270 sac? It is conceivable that the spine-like projections on the invaginated membrane and
18
19 271 isotropic wrinkles might help the flagellar rearrangement by the repeated internal sac
20
21 272 eversion behavior. The arrangement of the isotropic wrinkles parallel to the outline of
22
23 273 the waving invaginated membrane (Fig. 6) would lead to a reduced sliding frictional
24
25 274 force of the flagellum contacting the invaginated membrane [26]. This phenomenon
26
27
28
275 could decrease the frictional force of the flagellum when it moves in parallel with the
29
30 276 waving margin and could make it easier for the flagellum to move toward the waving
31
32 277 margin. Additionally, the projections that are directed toward the outline of the waving
33
34 278 invaginated membrane could inhibit the flagellum from moving freely after it fits with
35
36 279 the outline. Notably, we have never observed the flagellum to slip from the outline in
37
38 280 the animals collected from the field during the reproductive season despite hundreds of
39
40
41 281 observations (YM, pers. obs.).
42
43 282 The flagellum is the only sperm-transferring organ of L. coronata [16], which means
44
45 283 that the acute control of flagellar penetration is essential for reproduction. In L.
46
47 284 coronata, the close relationship between the flagellum and invaginated membrane
48
49 285 enables males to insert and withdraw the long, fragile flagellum with no tangling and
50
51
286 minimal breakage during mating [16]. Nevertheless, the present study shows that males
52
53
54 287 emerge with the flagellum in the coiled state, and the positional change occurs prior to
55
56 288 sexual maturity. Therefore, it is unlikely that males can produce the coiled state with

5
6 289 equal ease of the functional state and that the coiled state has adaptive meaning (the null
7
8 290 hypothesis to test the developmental constraint hypothesis in the present study). Rather,
9
10 291 it is reasonable to assert that the formation of the functional state of the internal sac is
11
12 292 impossible. During morphogenesis, the flagellum and invaginated membrane grow
13
14
293 simultaneously, and the flagellum grows by extending a fine tube from its base [18].
15
16
17 294 The growing flagellum is sent into the growing invaginated membrane; the flagellum
18
19 295 thus has no choice but to being aligned in coils in the growing invaginated membrane.
20
21 296 Without the internal sac eversion behavior, the beetles cannot place the flagellum in the
22
23 297 functional state, and this functional state is not achieved by morphogenesis alone. These
24
25 298 observations strongly suggest the potential of a developmental constraint against the
26
27
28
299 evolution of the hyper-elongated flagellum.
29
30 300 The formation of the coiled flagellum would be correlated with the hyper-elongation
31
32 301 of the flagellum in the studied group, subgenus Lema. In the related species L. dilecta
33
34 302 (with a flagellar length approximately 1.1-fold its body length), newly emerged adults
35
36 303 also had coiled flagella (Fig. 7a). The flagellar position changed over time (Fig. 7e), and
37
38 304 the flagellum was stored in the waving invaginated membrane as in L. coronata. In
39
40
41 305 contrast, the flagellum was not coiled in the species with substantially shorter flagella
42
43 306 and simpler invaginated membranes (L. diversa ca. 0.15-fold the body length: Fig. 7c;
44
45 307 L. scutellaris ca. 0.40-fold: Fig. 7d), suggesting that these species complete the
46
47 308 morphogenesis of the invaginated membrane and flagellum into the functional state
48
49 309 without the internal sac eversion behavior.
50
51
310 Matsumura & Yoshizawa [17] concluded that the lack of storage space and handling
52
53
54 311 ability of the flagellum result in adaptive/functional constraints (Fig. 8a). The
55
56 312 intromittent organ is typically stored in a limited space of the abdominal cavity in the

6 313 Pterygota [20], which presents insects with challenges regarding the storage and
7
8 314 handling of the hyper-elongated structures during copulation [16, 27-31]. Therefore,
9
10 315 even if beetles can ontogenetically produce the elongated flagellum, the lack of storage
11
12 316 space and handling abilities of the precise movement may select against the elongated
13
14
317 flagellum. Matsumura & Yoshizawa [17] and Matsumura et al. [19] found that species
15
16
17 318 with a hyper-elongated flagellum evolved only from groups that had acquired the
18
19 319 invaginated membrane for storing the flagellum in the leaf beetle subfamily Criocerinae.
20
21 320 The acquisition of the invaginated membrane enabled the beetles to override the
22
23 321 adaptive constraint [17] (Fig. 8a). On the other hand, the present study shows that this
24
25 322 also caused a developmental constraint against hyper-elongation (Fig. 8a). Nevertheless,
26
27
28
323 the internal sac eversion behavior negates the potential developmental constraint by
29
30 324 rearranging the flagellum after eclosion. Considering the phylogenetic tree of these
31
32 325 beetles, the behavior is regarded as preadaptively acquired and enables the beetles to
33
34 326 acquire hyper-elongated flagella (Fig. 8b). The prevalence of the combination of the
35
36 327 behavior and the developmental constraint in the evolution of flagellar hyper-elongation
37
38 328 in insects is currently unknown. However, similar behavior was observed in the field in
39
40
41 329 the alticine leaf beetle Altica cyanea [32], and flagellar hyper-elongation is often
42
43 330 observed in leaf beetles [33, 34]. Moreover, similar behavior has also been reported in
44
45 331 female lucanid beetles [35]. These observations suggest that a similar phenomenon may
46
47 332 be found in other beetles in general, and the function of this behavior should be studied.
48
49 333 The present study clearly indicates that a careful comparative study can effectively
50
51
334 show how developmental constraints have appeared and have been eliminated in natural
52
53
54 335 histories.

30 12 Abstract
31
32 13 Some species of criocerine beetles have a hyper-elongated part of the intromittent organ
33
34 14 called the flagellum. The flagellum is normally stored in a certain position in the
35
36 15 intromittent organ specialized for its storage, which presents a precise motion control
37
38 16 requirement for sperm transfer. However, the morphogenesis of the flagellum does not
39
40
41 17 generate the functional shape required for its insertion into the female spermathecal
42
43 18 duct. It is impossible for these beetles to generate a flagellum in the functional position,
44
45 19 despite this position being indispensable for copulation. After eclosion, males
46
47 20 repeatedly perform a behavior involving eversion and withdrawal of the intromittent
48
49 21 organ without mounting a female. Without this behavior, males cannot place the
50
51
22 flagellum in the functional position and be ready for mating. A closely related species
52
53
54 23 with a long flagellum also needs the same behavior to place the flagellum in the
55
56 24 functional position, but some other species with much shorter flagella can attain the

19 31 1. Introduction
20
21 32 Evolution involves modifications of descendants, which means that historical
22
23 33 trajectories characterize evolutionary directions [1-6]. Reductions in the likelihood of
24
25 34 specific phenotypic transformations, particularly because of intrinsic factors, are known
26
27
28
35 as developmental constraints [2, 7-9]. Although the term “constraints” carries mainly
29
30 36 negative connotations in the evolutionary sense, it is also a positive force in directing
31
32 37 progeny [2, 3, 5, 9]. In other words, developmental constraints canalize certain
33
34 38 phenotypic transformations from the ancestral state (developmental drive [6]).
35
36 39 Developmental constraints play a major role in determining the evolution of forms as
37
38 40 well as natural selection and genetic drift [2, 5, 7, 8]. Various studies have demonstrated
39
40
41 41 exemplars of stasis or diversification that can be associated with developmental
42
43 42 constraints [3-5, 8, 10-13]. However, few studies have shown how the evolution of new
44
45 43 character states generates developmental constraints and how these developmental
46
47 44 constraints affect further evolution of the characters [14]. Numerous other articles have
48
49 45 discussed “constraints” but usually have not established a well-defined null hypothesis
50
51
46 for developmental constraints, which obfuscates the meaning of developmental
52
53
54 47 constraints [7, 9]. In the present study, we investigated an exemplar case of
55
56 48 developmental constraints in the evolution of an extremely elongated intromittent organ

7
8 50 developmental constraint.
9
10 51 The main species of focus in the present study is Lema coronata, which has an
11
12 52 elongated element (known as a flagellum) as a part of the intromittent organ that is
13
14
53 approximately twice the length of the body (ca. 10.4 mm) and is very fragile (diameter
15
16
17 54 of the flagellum: ca. 2 µm) [15] (Fig. 1a). In most cases, the flagellum is stored in the
18
19 55 internal sac (Fig. 1a, red-colored structure), but during copulation the fragile flagellum
20
21 56 is precisely controlled and inserted into a female sperm receptacle organ, the
22
23 57 spermatheca [15]. During copulation, a membranous internal sac of the intromittent
24
25 58 organ is first evaginated from a median lobe and inserted into the female vagina, which
26
27
28
59 is called the bursa copulatrix [15] (Fig. 1b). The insertion and withdrawal of the
29
30 60 flagellum are accomplished quickly due to the very complex configuration of the
31
32 61 flagellum and the internal sac membrane, which has been observed only in species of
33
34 62 the subgenus Lema [16, 17]. An apical part of the internal sac membrane is invaginated
35
36 63 (Fig. 1c, d), the invaginated membrane of the internal sac is somehow flattened on the
37
38 64 sagittal plane (Fig. 1e), and the flagellum is slotted along the margin [16] (Fig. 1c, d).
39
40
41 65 Since the entire flagellum, which is twice as long as the body, is stored in the small
42
43 66 internal sac (Fig. 1a), the margin of the invaginated membrane is strongly stretched out
44
45 67 and has a waving appearance [16] (Figs. 1g, 2f dashed line). No muscles are directly
46
47 68 located on the flagellum [16]. However, due to the strict relationship between the
48
49 69 flagellum and invaginated membrane, the beetle can move and precisely control the
50
51
70 flagellum with the eversion of the invaginated membrane due to an increase in
52
53
54 71 hemolymph pressure [16] (Fig. 1f, h). Nevertheless, this strict relationship between the
55
56 72 invaginated membrane and flagellum is not established at all in newly emerged adults

6 73 (Figs. 1i, 2c). The flagellum is merely coiled in the invaginated membrane (Figs. 1a,
7
8 74 2c), and the configuration of the flagellum and invaginated membrane is completely
9
10 75 different from that of males during the reproductive season (compare Fig. 2c and 2f).
11
12 76 This means that males emerge before achieving the functional state of the flagellum and
13
14
77 invaginated membrane, which is critically important for their reproduction. This
15
16
17 78 observation led us hypothesize that males cannot achieve the complicated functional
18
19 79 state through morphogenesis alone. Therefore, the null hypothesis regarding
20
21 80 developmental constraints is that males can produce the coiled and functional states
22
23 81 equally.
24
25 82 To analyze the validity of the developmental constraint hypothesis and determine
26
27
28
83 what enables the species to acquire the hyper-elongated flagellum, we clarified the
29
30 84 following two aspects: (a) when the flagellar location changes (before or after sexual
31
32 85 maturation) and (b) how the rearrangement of the flagellum and the invaginated
33
34 86 membrane mechanically occurs in L. coronata. Based on our present observations and
35
36 87 reports of morphogenesis by Matsumura et al. [18], we discussed whether the formation
37
38 88 of the flagellum in the coiled state should be regarded as the result of developmental
39
40
41 89 constraints. In addition, the evolution of the characteristic evoking the flagellar
42
43 90 rearrangement was investigated based on a comparison with other Lema species with a
44
45 91 different flagellar length. Based on information from the associated molecular
46
47 92 phylogenetic tree [19], we propose an evolutionary history of the elongated flagellum.

6 97 adults were collected and placed in a plastic bag with their food plant Commelina
7
8 98 communis, and the bag was stored in an incubator (27 ± 0.5°C, 16 L/8 D; the light was
9
10 99 turned on at 9:00). The eggs laid were reared to adulthood, and the adults were used in
11
12 100 the following experiments. Every day (approximately 14:00 to 19:00), newly emerged
13
14
101 adult males were separated and kept together till further experiments (Fig. 2a). The
15
16
17 102 adults were fixed chronologically with a conventional freezer and were dissected to
18
19 103 determine the time at which the position of the flagellum was rearranged into a
20
21 104 functional state. The fixation schedule is presented in Fig. 2a with arrows.
22
23 105 2.2. Chronological changes in vas deferens and + testis weights. If the presumed
24
25 106 functional state of the flagellum is indispensable for the insertion of the flagellum, as
26
27
28
107 discussed in Matsumura and Yoshizawa [16] based on the morphology, it is reasonably
29
30 108 predicted that flagellar repositioning occurs prior to sexual maturity. Because the mature
31
32 109 sperm are stored in a seminal vesicle (part of the vas deferens) in insects [20], we
33
34 110 measured the dried weight of the vasa deferentia + testes of animals of different ages.
35
36 111 One-, 3- and 5-day-old virgin males and field-collected males in the reproductive season
37
38 112 that had presumably experienced multiple copulations were fixed using FAA fixative
39
40
41 113 (formaldehyde – acetic acid – ethanol solution) or 70% ethanol. Specimens were
42
43 114 preserved in 70% ethanol. One pair of vasa deferentia + testes for each individual was
44
45 115 dissected under an Olympus SZ60 stereomicroscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), dried in
46
47 116 an incubator and stored at 37°C for one night. The sample was then weighed with an
48
49 117 Ultramicro Balance SE-2 (Sartorius Japan K. K., Tokyo, Japan). The weight differences
50
51
118 between ages were assessed via an analysis of variance (ANOVA) using R 3.1.1 [21].

55
56 120 withdrawing the flagellum are accomplished only through invaginated membrane

6 121 eversion and withdrawal, according to Matsumura and Yoshizawa [16]. Therefore, we
7
8 122 predicted that males would rearrange the flagellar position from the coiled state to the
9
10 123 functional state by moving the internal sac membrane. Notably, it was previously
11
12 124 demonstrated that Lema coronata males push the intromittent organ out of the abdomen
13
14
125 and evert the membrane without any females present [22]. As a first step in testing the
15
16
17 126 hypothesis regarding the flagellar arrangement, we quantified the movement of the
18
19 127 intromittent organ on the day of and one day prior to the rearrangement occurrence.
20
21 128 Repeated eversion of the intromittent organ was observed in 3- and 4-day-old
22
23 129 individuals when the flagellar position dramatically changed. Eleven (3-day-old) and 29
24
25 130 (4-day-old) individuals were observed; the same animal was never assessed on both
26
27
28
131 days.
29
30 132 One or two (in one case, three) males were placed in small cells (1.6 cm in diameter)
31
32 133 arranged in a plastic case (12.6×8.5 cm), and photographs of the beetles in the plastic
33
34 134 case were automatically captured at 10-sec intervals using a CX1 digital camera (Ricoh,
35
36 135 Japan). The males continuously everted their internal sac membranes for more than 10
37
38 136 sec without the presence of any females [22]. Therefore, our non-continuous
39
40
41 137 observation was sufficient to quantify the frequency of the behavior. The successive
42
43 138 pictures of the behavior thus reflect a series of the behavior, and the duration of the
44
45 139 behavior was calculated by regarding one photo, equal to 10 sec. Because the battery
46
47 140 life of the camera was three hours, the observations were fragmented. On average, each
48
49 141 cell was observed for 15.1 (3-day-old) and 15.4 (4-day-old) hours. Because the number
50
51
142 of beetles in a cell varied among cells and every beetle in a cell could not be
52
53
54 143 individually identified from the photos, we multiplied the duration of the observation of
55
56 144 each cell by the number of beetles in each cell and considered this value to be the

7
8 146 A statistical model to evaluate the effects of age on the frequency of the internal sac
9
10 147 eversion behavior was formulated as a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), which
11
12 148 enabled us to estimate parameters for both fixed effects (in this case, day-age effects)
13
14
149 and random effects (the variance between unobservable effects resulting from cell
15
16
17 150 differences). We assumed that the frequency was proportional to the observation time ×
18
19 151 the number of animals in each cell, so we set the product as an offset term of the
20
21 152 GLMM. The Poisson distribution was specified to represent the probability distribution
22
23 153 of the observed frequency of the behavior. The statistical model fittings were performed
24
25 154 using R 3.1.1 [21] equipped with the glmmML package [23].

27
28
155 2.4. Plugging the gateway of the intromittent organ. To assess our hypothesis that the
29
30 156 rearrangement of the flagellar position into the functional state is achieved by the
31
32 157 internal sac eversion behavior, the frequencies of flagellar rearrangement into the
33
34 158 functional state were compared among the following three treatment groups. In group I,
35
36 159 the gateway for the intromittent organ at the abdominal tip was plugged with
37
38 160 water-resistant glue (Alon Alpha EX, Komishi, Japan) (Fig. 5a, b). In group II, to create
39
40
41 161 a positive control to test the impacts of the super-glue treatment, we applied the super
42
43 162 glue to other body parts (Fig. 5c). Three males removed the glue from the gateway soon
44
45 163 after the treatment in group I; we treated these animals as members of group II. In group
46
47 164 III, the males were left intact as a negative control. The treatment was performed on
48
49 165 individuals one day prior to the rearrangement (at 22:00 to 23:00 on the 3rd day), and
50
51
166 fixation was performed at 24:00 on the day of rearrangement. The rearrangement
52
53
54 167 frequencies were compared between the treatments via the <U+03C7>2 test with R. 3.1.1 [21].

6 169 mechanism of the rearrangement of the flagellum, we scrutinized the surface structure
7
8 170 via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The alcohol-preserved specimens were
9
10 171 dehydrated through an ethyl alcohol/t-butyl alcohol series and were freeze-dried. Then,
11
12 172 the specimens were coated with palladium and observed using SEM (JSM-5610, JEOL,
13
14
173 Japan).
15
16
17 174 2.6. Related species. To evaluate the uniqueness of the rearrangement of the flagellar
18
19 175 position and the behavior observed in L. coronata, we explored these features in three
20
21 176 closely related species [19]: Lema dilecta, L. diversa, and L. scutellaris. These three
22
23 177 species have similar body sizes but different flagellar lengths. L. coronata has a flagellar
24
25 178 length of 10.4 mm (ca. 1.9-fold its body length). L. dilecta has a flagellar length of 4.20
26
27
28
179 mm (ca. 1.1-fold), L. diversa has a flagellar length of 0.74 mm (ca. 0.15-fold), and L.
29
30 180 scutellaris has a flagellar length of 2.03 mm (ca. 0.40-fold) [24]. The data regarding L.
31
32 181 dilecta were reported as L. michioi [24]; however, L. michioi is a junior synonym of L.
33
34 182 dilecta [25].
35
36 183 We reared the animals using the method described above. Due to the difficulty in
37
38 184 rearing L. dilecta, we used L. diversa and L. scutellaris to evaluate behavioral
39
40
41 185 frequency. A total of 39 individuals in L. diversa and 43 individuals in L. scutellaris
42
43 186 were used, and all males were 4 days old. The average duration of observation for each
44
45 187 cell was 10.8 and 8.3 hours for L. diversa and L. scutellaris, respectively. To compare
46
47 188 differences in behavioral frequencies between these two species and L. coronata,
48
49 189 statistical models (GLMMs, described in subsection 2.4) were fitted to the data. Five
50
51
190 logical combinations of species differences were possible. We chose the best
52
53
54 191 combination in terms of goodness-of-prediction by evaluating the Akaike information
55
56 192 criterion (AIC).

13
14
197 Variable conditions of the flagellum in the invaginated membrane were observed (Fig.
15
16
17 198 2c-f). The flagellum was completely slotted in the waving invaginated membrane (Fig.
18
19 199 2f), which was the same condition observed in the males collected from the field during
20
21 200 the reproductive season. In other cases, the flagellum was completely coiled in the
22
23 201 invaginated membrane (Fig. 2c); a strict relationship between the invaginated
24
25 202 membrane and the flagellum was not observed. Additionally, intermediate states
26
27
28
203 between the two extreme conditions were observed. In some cases, the flagellum was
29
30 204 partly coiled, and the coils were partially loosened (Fig. 2d). In the other cases, the coils
31
32 205 were loosened, and the flagellum was partly grasped by the invaginated membrane (Fig.
33
34 206 2e).
35
36 207 The flagella of approximately all the males were completely coiled until the 3rd day

38 208 (Fig. 2b). The proportion of males exhibiting the functional state gradually increased
39
40
41 209 during the 4th day (Fig. 2b). The coiled state was not observed thereafter (Fig. 2b).
42
43 210 The vas deferens + testis size in males was significantly associated with male age
44
45 211 (ANOVA, F3, 16 = 10.9, P<0.001) but was not significantly influenced by body size or
46
47 212 elytral length (analysis of covariance [ANCOVA], F1, 15 = 0.304, P = 0.59) (Fig. 3). The
48
49 213 males collected in the field and assumed to have experienced copulation had heavier
50
51
214 vasa differentia + testes than other males (Fig. 3). Therefore, positional changes in the
52
53
54 215 flagellum were completed prior to increasing the weight of the vasa deferentia + testes,
55
56 216 which is an indication of sexual maturity.

221 estimated effect size differentiating between the 3- and 4-day-olds was 1.40 (standard
15
16
17 222 error [SE] 0.427), for which the Wald P-value was 0.0011; the 4-day-old males
18
19 223 exhibited higher numbers of this behavior (Fig. 4). This was also the case for the
20
21 224 duration of the behavior (estimated effect size = 1.776, SE = 0.570, Wald P-value =
22
23 225 0.0019; the duration was estimated using the number of frames exhibiting the behavior).

9
10 243 changes similar to those in L. coronata (Fig. 7e). L. diversa and L. scutellaris also
11
12 244 exhibited behavior similar to that in L. coronata. L. diversa and L. scutellaris exhibited
13
14
245 the behavior for 41.8 ± 14.9 sec (mean ± SD) (max. 70 sec, min. 20 sec, N = 33) and
15
16
17 246 44.6 ± 20.2 sec (mean ± SD) (max. 70 sec, min. 10 sec, N = 13), respectively. The
18
19 247 model assuming that all species were different was selected to be the best (AIC estimate
20
21 248 = 101.54). The remaining 4 AIC estimates were 112.95 (no species differences), 103.76
22
23 249 (L. coronata differed), 114.81 (L. diversa differed), and 104.45 (L. scutellaris differed).
24
25 250 The estimated effect sizes for between-species differences were -1.354 (SE 0.347) for L.
26
27
28
251 scutellaris and -0.617 (SE 0.273) for L. diversa. L. coronata exhibited increased
29

31
32 253
33
34 254 4. Discussion
35
36 255 The present study showed that the internal sac eversion behavior serves to rearrange the
37
38 256 coiled flagellum into the complicated functional state in L. coronata. The supporting
39
40
41 257 results showed that the internal sac eversion behavior increased on the day when the
42
43 258 rearrangement of the flagellar position occurred, i.e., 4 days after eclosion; the absence
44
45 259 of this behavior in 4-day-old adults due to plugging of the genital opening significantly
46
47 260 decreased the ratio of those in the functional state compared with the other treatments.
48
49 261 Although the frequency was relatively low, the internal sac eversion behavior was also
50
51
262 observed in 3-day-old adults, when approximately all individuals still had coiled
52
53
54 263 flagella. This finding suggests that one behavior alone cannot induce the rearrangement
55
56 264 of the flagellum. Males performed the behavior more than twice on average during the
57

5
6 265 4th day (we observed only 15 hours per individual on average), and many males on the
7
8 266 4th day exhibited intermediate states between the coiled and functional states. This
9
10 267 finding implies that repeated performance of the internal sac eversion behavior is
11
12 268 required for the rearrangement of the flagellum.
13
14
269 How is the flagellum rearranged only by the eversion and withdrawal of the internal
15
16
17 270 sac? It is conceivable that the spine-like projections on the invaginated membrane and
18
19 271 isotropic wrinkles might help the flagellar rearrangement by the repeated internal sac
20
21 272 eversion behavior. The arrangement of the isotropic wrinkles parallel to the outline of
22
23 273 the waving invaginated membrane (Fig. 6) would lead to a reduced sliding frictional
24
25 274 force of the flagellum contacting the invaginated membrane [26]. This phenomenon
26
27
28
275 could decrease the frictional force of the flagellum when it moves in parallel with the
29
30 276 waving margin and could make it easier for the flagellum to move toward the waving
31
32 277 margin. Additionally, the projections that are directed toward the outline of the waving
33
34 278 invaginated membrane could inhibit the flagellum from moving freely after it fits with
35
36 279 the outline. Notably, we have never observed the flagellum to slip from the outline in
37
38 280 the animals collected from the field during the reproductive season despite hundreds of
39
40
41 281 observations (YM, pers. obs.).
42
43 282 The flagellum is the only sperm-transferring organ of L. coronata [16], which means
44
45 283 that the acute control of flagellar penetration is essential for reproduction. In L.
46
47 284 coronata, the close relationship between the flagellum and invaginated membrane
48
49 285 enables males to insert and withdraw the long, fragile flagellum with no tangling and
50
51
286 minimal breakage during mating [16]. Nevertheless, the present study shows that males
52
53
54 287 emerge with the flagellum in the coiled state, and the positional change occurs prior to
55
56 288 sexual maturity. Therefore, it is unlikely that males can produce the coiled state with

4
5
6 289 equal ease of the functional state and that the coiled state has adaptive meaning (the null
7
8 290 hypothesis to test the developmental constraint hypothesis in the present study). Rather,
9
10 291 it is reasonable to assert that the formation of the functional state of the internal sac is
11
12 292 impossible. During morphogenesis, the flagellum and invaginated membrane grow
13
14
293 simultaneously, and the flagellum grows by extending a fine tube from its base [18].
15
16
17 294 The growing flagellum is sent into the growing invaginated membrane; the flagellum
18
19 295 thus has no choice but to being aligned in coils in the growing invaginated membrane.
20
21 296 Without the internal sac eversion behavior, the beetles cannot place the flagellum in the
22
23 297 functional state, and this functional state is not achieved by morphogenesis alone. These
24
25 298 observations strongly suggest the potential of a developmental constraint against the
26
27
28
299 evolution of the hyper-elongated flagellum.
29
30 300 The formation of the coiled flagellum would be correlated with the hyper-elongation
31
32 301 of the flagellum in the studied group, subgenus Lema. In the related species L. dilecta
33
34 302 (with a flagellar length approximately 1.1-fold its body length), newly emerged adults
35
36 303 also had coiled flagella (Fig. 7a). The flagellar position changed over time (Fig. 7e), and
37
38 304 the flagellum was stored in the waving invaginated membrane as in L. coronata. In
39
40
41 305 contrast, the flagellum was not coiled in the species with substantially shorter flagella
42
43 306 and simpler invaginated membranes (L. diversa ca. 0.15-fold the body length: Fig. 7c;
44
45 307 L. scutellaris ca. 0.40-fold: Fig. 7d), suggesting that these species complete the
46
47 308 morphogenesis of the invaginated membrane and flagellum into the functional state
48
49 309 without the internal sac eversion behavior.
50
51
310 Matsumura & Yoshizawa [17] concluded that the lack of storage space and handling
52
53
54 311 ability of the flagellum result in adaptive/functional constraints (Fig. 8a). The
55
56 312 intromittent organ is typically stored in a limited space of the abdominal cavity in the

6 313 Pterygota [20], which presents insects with challenges regarding the storage and
7
8 314 handling of the hyper-elongated structures during copulation [16, 27-31]. Therefore,
9
10 315 even if beetles can ontogenetically produce the elongated flagellum, the lack of storage
11
12 316 space and handling abilities of the precise movement may select against the elongated
13
14
317 flagellum. Matsumura & Yoshizawa [17] and Matsumura et al. [19] found that species
15
16
17 318 with a hyper-elongated flagellum evolved only from groups that had acquired the
18
19 319 invaginated membrane for storing the flagellum in the leaf beetle subfamily Criocerinae.
20
21 320 The acquisition of the invaginated membrane enabled the beetles to override the
22
23 321 adaptive constraint [17] (Fig. 8a). On the other hand, the present study shows that this
24
25 322 also caused a developmental constraint against hyper-elongation (Fig. 8a). Nevertheless,
26
27
28
323 the internal sac eversion behavior negates the potential developmental constraint by
29
30 324 rearranging the flagellum after eclosion. Considering the phylogenetic tree of these
31
32 325 beetles, the behavior is regarded as preadaptively acquired and enables the beetles to
33
34 326 acquire hyper-elongated flagella (Fig. 8b). The prevalence of the combination of the
35
36 327 behavior and the developmental constraint in the evolution of flagellar hyper-elongation
37
38 328 in insects is currently unknown. However, similar behavior was observed in the field in
39
40
41 329 the alticine leaf beetle Altica cyanea [32], and flagellar hyper-elongation is often
42
43 330 observed in leaf beetles [33, 34]. Moreover, similar behavior has also been reported in
44
45 331 female lucanid beetles [35]. These observations suggest that a similar phenomenon may
46
47 332 be found in other beetles in general, and the function of this behavior should be studied.
48
49 333 The present study clearly indicates that a careful comparative study can effectively
50
51
334 show how developmental constraints have appeared and have been eliminated in natural
52
53
54 335 histories.

Appendix C
Reply to the editor and reviewers
We appreciate all of you for very careful reading and valuable comments. We have revised our
manuscript basically according to the comments. We believe that the manuscript was greatly
improved and hope it will convince all of you.
Minor corrections and revisions were made without highlight. Only major revisions were
summarized below. In a few cases we disagreed with your comments and mentioned below reasons
why we did not follow the comments.
Reply to the reviewer 1 (He waived anonymity, Prof. Dr. Michael Schmitt)
<U+F06C> According to his comment, I added the author names and years described the studied species
(lines 80, 157). It is taxonomic information and normally we do not refer the literature
information in references. Therefore we have not listed those literatures.
<U+F06C> His comment: “the whole process is a wonderful example of runaway evolution (Fisher's
Process). Therefore, convergent evolution must be expected since the sole selective factors act
within the species, i.e. between the sexes. Such an evolutionary explanation (see Eberhard WG
Sexual Selection and Animal Genitalia, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass. - London
1985) would round up the paper and make it definitely more attractive, as it would show its
general importance.”
<U+2192>We agree that selective force driving genital evolution is very attractive topic. However as far
as we know there are no experimental studies demonstrated/showed strong evidence supporting
the runaway hypothesis related to elongation of intromittent organs. Although as Eberhard
(1985) discussed the runaway hypothesis is attractive and likely one, there is no reason why we
mentioned this hypothesis in the paper. Moreover a theme of the present study is an origin of
such structures (evolutionary history), rather than how/why such structures are elongated
(selective force). Therefore we disagreed with this comment and had decided not to add the
runaway story.
Reply to the reviewer 2
<U+F06C> Reviewer 2 was sceptical about a necessity of the figure 1c. However we left it in the figure
plate 1, because we are pretty sure that understating the very complicated structures, which is
critically important for this paper, is very challenging without whole series of drawings.
<U+F06C> His/her comment: “The authors should follow their previously used terminology, e.g. use
“pocket” instead of “invaginated membrane” or “internal sac sclerite” instead of “sclerite” and
most importantly simplify their descriptions.”
<U+2192>According this comment we changed the terminology.
<U+F06C> His/her comment: “The authors mention that the pocket of the internal sac is “somehow”
flattened laterally. It seems to me that the flagellum is flattening the sac by stretching it out
since it is still only partially uncoiled.”
<U+2192>This is not true, and we found that our original description was misleading. Therefore we
added information (lines: 57-58).
<U+F06C> His/her comment in regards to the results 3.4 (projections on the pocket): “Are they oriented
posteriorly or anteriorly? Similar projections have been described in the internal surface of the
ovipositor that enhance the movement of the eggs. What is the function of these projections?
Would they be important for the positioning of the flagellum or are used for cleaning the
flagellum?”
<U+2192>The projections are arranged nearly anteriorly in the resting position. However we highlight
on the movement of the internal sac, and we do not think it is good idea to describe the
direction of the projections just according to the resting position. Moreover the projections
direct toward the fold of the pocket (Fig. 6a), therefore it is neither correct to mention that in
general they direct anteriorly.
We also do not think that the projection’s primarily function is just for the flagellum
uncoiling, because we have observed such membranous projection on the internal sacs in other
species as well (YM pers. observ.). However, hitherto the functional aspect of the projections
will be just speculation. Therefore we did not add further statement on projections’ functions.
<U+F06C> His/her comment on fig. 2: “I think, especially the last drawing is an oversimplyfication. The
flagellum is never uncoiled perfectly right? At least according to middle row of drawing it has
still some coils. Do you need the last row of this figure?”
<U+2192>The flagellum in the active state is completely uncoiled. In the middle figures in Fig. 2c-f, we
traced the flagella over the upper figures. The middle figure in 2f alone looks the flagellum
coiling, however comparing to other middle figs “the coiling” is obviously different. Then by
comparing the upper and middle figures, you can see that there are coils only in the states
shown in Fig. 2c-e and not in the Fig. 2f. The flagellum in the middle of the Fig. 2f is not
coiling, but rather slotted in the undulating pocket. Therefore with the 2D drawing the flagellum
looks convoluted.
The bottom figures show configurations of the internal sac in the different states. To show the
three dimensionally complicated configuration in the 2D drawings, we ignored mainly how it
looks like in reality as shown in the upper and middle figures. The undulation of the packet in
the active state is represented with the undulated line (Fig. 2e,f).
<U+F06C> His/her comment on testes + vasa differentia weight: “would mating (losing sperms) decrease
the size, mass of these structures?”
<U+2192>That is right. However we have not measured the weight of the testes + vasa differentia of
males just after copulation. It makes sense to predict the sexually matured males have much
sperm in general than males in a process to be matured.
Reply to the reviewer 3
<U+F06C> His/her comment: “It is not clear from my reading whether or not the authors know for sure that
the correct alignment cannot occur during an initial copulation, as the experiment only showed
that the genitalia had to be everted, not that it couldn't do so inside a female - but perhaps this
has been shown before?”
<U+2192>He/she is right. That is important, but that is not proofed yet. However from morphological
point view, it is highly unlikely that uncoiling occurs inside a female vagina. Because of tight fit
between the male and female genitalia during copulation, there is no space for coiled flagella to
be uncoiled without tangling. Moreover our results indirectly suggest that the flagellar
uncoiling must be occurred before sexual contact with a female, because the flagellar uncoiling
occurs before sexual maturation.
<U+F06C> His/her comment: “The phylogenetic component of the paper is currently unconvincing. Figure
8 is rather cursory and the (undiscussed) paraphyletic nature of the genus is of some concern.
With so few species, not much inference can be drawn here, and the overall phylogenetic
context is rather thin. Again, I would recommend stepping back from any form of formal
analysis, perhaps suggesting an evolutionary pathway that is consistent with the data, but that
does not seek to "test" any developmental constraints hypotheses, as I do not think the data are
sufficient to do so.”
<U+2192>We partly agreed and disagreed with his/her comment. We are convinced that we should
highlight our simple findings in the paper by omitting the complicated story related to
developmental constraint. Therefore we completely removed the words (developmental
constraint). However we still think that the evolutionary story, evolution of morphology and
behavior affects each other, is attractive and enough to present it in the paper. Because we have
a previously proposed molecular phylogenetic tree, we can discuss the evolutionary history of
the studied species. It is worthwhile to discuss it, although we have only a few species to
compare each other.
We could not understand why we need to concern “the (undiscussed) paraphyletic nature of
the genus”. If we should not discuss the evolutionary history based on a proposed hypothesis
used cladistic methods, nobody should not discuss evolutionary histories of organisms.
<U+F06C> His/her comment: “In terms of the main part of the paper though, a few things could be clearer.
First, the methods section for 2.3 and 2.4 are not very clear. For 2.3, please provide a clearer
picture of the experimental procedure and set up, and just how many beetles are being observed,
when, and how data are combined (if they are combined). It then has to be clear how the
statistics deal with these observations (i.e. to control for multiple males per cell etc). For 2.4,
again, it is not very clear exactly what was done and when, especially in terms of how long
animals were left before being sacrificed and dissected.”
<U+2192>We added detailed information in the text (lines 108-149) and the figure 4 to make the
method descriptions clearer.
<U+F06C> His/her comment: “ please explain what "effect size" you are using in the results.”
<U+2192>"effect size" is a common term in the field of statistics that is the estimate of focal parameter
used in the statistical model.
<U+F06C> His/her comment: “More generally, elongated genitalia exist outside of the Coleoptera (e.g.
Heteroptera, Diptera etc) so perhaps a more nuanced and less narrow discussion of the
evolution of elongated genitalia may be useful, including studies where experiments have been
done?”
<U+2192>Yes, that is right that there are many animals with elongated genitalia. Following his/her
comment we changed the end of the discussion and finalized with general discussion (lines
291-300).
<U+F06C> His/her comment: “Third, the readability of the results would be improved by stating the
biology of the results first, then all the stats (e.g. lines 214-216 moved to beginning of
paragraph; likewise lines 251-252). I like murder mysteries, but would rather know the answer
first when reading papers, then get the statistical justification.”
<U+2192>Following this comment we added summarized results in the beginning (lines 196-197,
216-217).
Reply to the reviewers 2 and 3 (common comments) regarding the story of developmental
constraints
<U+F06C> Reviewer 2: “I found the MS sometimes hard to understand and the link to the null hypothesis
of developmental constraint a bit overemphasized.”, “The findings of this manuscript are simple
and definitely worth to publish, and I think the present form of the manuscript suffers from the
author's desire to make it more complicated or elaborate. I found the first part of the
introduction a bit painful to read and understand and really don’t think this paper needs any
discussion about developmental constraints and null hypothesis in any way.”
Reviewer 3: “The framing of the paper in terms of developmental constraints seems
unnecessary and potentially even detracts from the more interesting part of the paper.”/
“Another problem with the sconstraints literature - and indeed with this paper - is that, well,
there is not really much of a constraint after all. The development of a "null hypothesis" seemed
a little bit forced, and in general the whole framework did not add anything to me. I would
recommend removing all of this, and just get to the more interesting observations and
experiments, stating more matter-of-factly that long genitalia in this genus requires some form
of practise or pre-deployment.”
<U+2192>Although still we believe that the developmental constraint story was important and makes
our manuscript more interesting for us, we also agreed with that the main finding should be
easily conveyed to readers and probably major readers of our paper would not predict the story
“developmental constraint” from genital evolution. Therefore we have completely removed
those words and made the manuscript simpler (especially the first paragraph of the introduction
and final paragraph of the discussion).

hor's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-161029.R1)
ly to the editors,
thank the editors (subject editor and editorial coordinator) and reviewers for your time and comments
ing us to improve our manuscript. The manuscript was revised based on the comments, and the
or revised points were summarized below.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ly to the reviewers,
thank you very much for your critical reading again and comment helping us to improve our
nuscript. The manuscript was revised based on the comments, and the major revised points were
marized below.
he reviewer 2 (R2):
commented that “the link to dryad (http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.887g1) did not work for me”.
s R2 guessed, the link will become available shortly after the publication appears, according to the
organized by Dryad. The link contains 13 files and more than 4GB data. We can send a part of the
a personally, in the case the R2 would like to see and the editor allows us to do so.
he reviewer 3 (R3):
commented that “First, this reviewer is aware of what an effect size is general terms, but the reviewer
so aware that there are a variety of effect sizes that can be presented, from things like R^2, through
tandardised effect sizes such as Cohen’s or Hedges’ and so on. Again, I ask for clarity here. If we
sider their use in section 3.2, we need to know what kind or type of effect size is being presented, to
able to interpret the results. It might be that the effect size presented is merely the test statistic, but it
ht not be. Please let us know.”
hank you for your kind and detailed comments. We understand that the term “effect size” is incorrect
epresent the estimates of coefficients in GLMM while “effects size” is mainly used in the context of
lysis of variance, ANOVA. We replace the term “effects size” appeared in Section 3.2 with “estimated
fficient” of GLMM (Lines: 213-217). We hope that this is acceptable for you.
commented that “Second, the sample sizes are still absent from the methods. These must be
vided. From the Suppl Info, it looks as though the sample sizes are quite small (e.g. N = 11 or 19, but
n fewer statistically independent cells, which must be taken into account using random effects).”
e added those information in the materials and methods (Lines 89-92, 101-102, 132-133, 154-156,
-177).
commented that “Third, the Suppl Info is hard to follow, poorly formatted in places, and does not
vide a clear pathway to understand the statistical analyses and samples sizes. Please provide basic
rmation in a more straightforward manner.”
e improved the formatting and added information how we proceed data and how each tables and
res are related each other in the captions to guide readers to see what we did (Supplementary
es).
commented that “Fourth, the statistical analysis in section 3.1 needs checking. Why are there three
erator degrees of freedom when male age is the explanatory factor (presumably coded as a
tinuous variable, as it certainly has a “direction”, and so there should be one numerator degree of
dom), and why is the analysis for body size and elytra length given by only one statistical tests,
ead of two? Also, how was the ANOVA ran? As the two tests given have different denominator
rees of freedom, were Type I sums of squares used and/or model simplification? I would strongly
mmend type III sums of squares. Finally, it is hard to link the degress of freedom presented to the
ple sizes presented in the SI.”
e used four different categories of male ages (1-day-old, 3-day-old, 5-day-old, and presumably after
ulation), and therefore we have three numerator degrees of freedom. In regards to the “body size
elytra length” problem, we used the elytra length as an indicator of body size. Therefore we
ormed only one ANOVA. We clearly mentioned this information and the number of samples treated
es 201-205).
