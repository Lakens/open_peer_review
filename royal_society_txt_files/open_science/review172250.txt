A well-presented and thorough paper on a very important subject. The variety of evidence is
very convincing on the nature of these biosedimentary structures as the trace fossil Arenicolites.
The manuscript is very clean, and the only suggested change I have found is in line 55 where I
would say "shows" rather than "show". This excellent manuscript is basically publishable as is.

27
28
29 The Cambrian radiation of complex animals includes a dramatic increase in the depth and intensity of
30 bioturbation in seafloor sediment known as the “agronomic revolution”. This bioturbation transition was
31 coupled with a shift in dominant trace fossil style from horizontal surficial traces in the late Precambrian to
32 vertically penetrative trace fossils in the Cambrian. Here we show the existence of the first vertically
33 penetrative trace fossils from the latest Ediacaran: dense occurrences of the U-shaped trace fossil Arenicolites
34 from late Precambrian marine carbonates of western Mongolia. Their Ediacaran age is established through
35 stable carbon isotope chemostratigraphy and their occurrence stratigraphically below the first appearance of
36 the trace fossil Treptichnus pedum. These Arenicolites are large in diameter, penetrate down to at least 4 cm into
37 the sediment, and were presumably formed by the activity of bilaterian animals. They are preserved
38 commonly as paired circular openings on bedding planes with tmaximum diameters ranging up to almost 1
39 cm, and as U- and J-shaped tubes in vertical sections of beds. Discovery of these complex penetrative trace
40 fossils demonstrates that the agronomic revolution started earlier than previously considered.

43 2. Introduction
44
45 The Precambrian–Cambrian transition is one of the most dramatic periods in the history of life because of the
46 rapid diversification of complex animal life, often called the “Cambrian Explosion.” This transition included
47 profound changes in animal behavior, including increased depth and intensity of burrowing in the seafloor
48 [1]. This increase in bioturbation created important changes in nature of marine substrates. In the final interval
49 of the Precambrian, the Ediacaran Period, benthic animals were adapted to living on, or under firm, microbial-
50
mat-bound seafloors. In the Cambrian, the infaunal activity of animals accelerated and substrates gradually
51
became more mixed, producing soft substrates with high water and oxygen content, as well as a surface mixed
52
layer [2]. This dramatic change is known as the “agronomic revolution” [1].
53
54
55 Alongside the general increase in bioturbation levels, the dominant style of trace fossil also changed from the

Ediacaran to the Cambrian. Ediacaran trace fossils are mostly horizontal (parallel to bedding), and there are
1 no vertical trace fossils that penetrate the sediment [3]. They are also generally small and their bilaterian origin
2 has been questioned [4]. Penetrative trace fossils become common in the Cambrian with the first stratigraphic
3 occurrence of the penetrative trace fossil Treptichnus pedum defining the Precambrian–Cambrian boundary [5],
4 which has a relatively wide environmental tolerance [6]. More diverse and deeply penetrative trace fossils
5 become dominant in Cambrian Stage 2 [7,8]. This change in the style of trace fossils is regarded as reflecting an
6 important evolutionary innovation in animal behaviour [9]. Here we report from western Mongolia the first
7 reliable occurrence of abundant penetrative trace fossils from the latest Ediacaran, indicating that this
8 evolutionary innovation took place earlier than previously thought, and providing trace fossil evidence for
9 Precambrian bilaterians with complex behavioural patterns.
10
11
12 3. Geologic Setting
13
14 Well-preserved and nearly continuous Ediacaran to Cambrian marine sedimentary rocks are exposed along
15 Bayan Gol Valley, Govi-Altay, western Mongolia (figure 1) [10,11]. Previous workers divided the beds of the
16 Bayan Gol Valley section into two formations; Tsagaan Oloom and Bayan Gol formations in ascending order,
17 and further subdivided them into numbered units [12] (figure 2). The base of the Bayan Gol Formation was
18 placed at the base of the Unit 18 [10,12]. Initial trace fossil studies placed the likely Precambrian–Cambrian
19 boundary near the base of the Bayan Gol Formation because of the first occurrence of the trace fossil
20 Treptichnus pedum at this level [e.g., 13]. Recently the stratigraphy of the upper part of the Tsagaan Oloom and
21
the Bayan Gol formations was revised, and the position of the Precambrian–Cambrian boundary was refined
22
as being in the uppermost part of the Zuun-Arts Formation (upper part of the former “Tsagaan Oloom
23
Formation”) because of the existence there of a remarkable negative excursion in the stable carbon isotope
24
25 profile interpreted as the BACE boundary excursion [11,14.15], as well as the existence of relatively positive
26 carbon isotope ratio values below the negative spike. The boundary of the two formations, i.e. the Zuun-Arts
27 and the Bayangol (former “Bayan Gol”) Formations, was revised to the lower portion [11,15]. A high-
28 resolution stable carbon isotope profile with a 2 m interval produced in this study confirms the presence of the
29 boundary excursion stratigraphically above the Arenicolites described here (figure 1). The integrated stable
30 carbon isotope profile of the Gobi-Altai section enables correlation with the stable carbon isotope profile of the
31 well-dated boundary section in Morocco. This regional correlation further confirms that the Precambrian–
32 Cambrian boundary can conclusively be placed in the uppermost Zuun-Arts Formation [16, 11] (figure 1).
33
34
35 4. Methods
36
37
Trace fossils were observed on 11 bedding planes, as well as in multiple vertical cross-sections, of bedded
38
39 limestones of the upper part of the Zuun-Arts Formation in the middle portion of the Bayan Gol Valley section
40 (figure 2). Several bedding plane samples were collected and returned to the laboratory. Isolated samples with
41 well-preserved trace fossils were also collected from float. The diameters of the circular trace cross-sections
42 were measured on six separate bedding planes to analyse their size distribution.
43
44
In order to confirm the 3-D structure of the burrows inside the samples, some blocks were serially dissected
45
46 perpendicular to bedding with a rock saw at an interval of 7 mm (1 mm was lost between each slab during
47 cutting). The surfaces were polished and scanned by digital scanner Canon MG7500. Scanned images of all
48 the surfaces were superimposed to reveal the position of burrows on each slab and then to clarify the entire
49 shape of the burrows. This technique was employed because our attempt to use CT-scan failed to reveal the
50 burrow structure, probably due to very minor difference of densities between the matrix and the material
51 inside the burrows.
52
53 Micrograph observations of vertical cross sections and horizontal cross sections were made from the sample
54 collected at 181.36 m above the base of Unit 8. These thin sections span the boundary of the burrow and the
55 matrix in order to determine if the boundary is clear and unlined, or if there is overgrowth of lining cements.
56
57 Samples from the trace-bearing carbonates were analyzed with a Rigaku Multiflex X-ray diffractometer (XRD)
58 at the Nagoya University Museum, Japan to determine mineral abundances and assess dolomitization levels.

2 Additional XRD analyses were made for the sample from 181.36 m, for the black limestone matrix and light
3 coloured material inside the burrow.

5 In order to confirm the stratigraphic location of the Precambrian–Cambrian boundary for this study, a stable C
6 isotope curve was created at a 2 m sample interval through the carbonate facies of units 8-16 of the Zuun-Arts
7 Formation and units 17-19 of the Bayangol Formation in Bayan Gol Valley (figure 1C). Carbon isotopic ratios
8 were measured with a ThermoFisher DeltaV Advantage mass spectrometer, coupled with a ThermoQuest
9
Kiel-III automated carbonate device, at the Institute of Geology and Paleontology, Graduate School of Science,
10
Tohoku University. The external precision determined by replicate analysis of the laboratory standard was

15 5. Results
16
17 Eleven beds of units 14 and 15 from the upper part of the Zuun-Arts Formation contain abundant trace fossils
18 on the bedding planes (figures 2, 3, 4), which are also visible on the sides (figure 5), and occasionally on the
19 bottoms of beds. These traces are circular to sub-circular openings on bedding surfaces that range in diameter
20 from less than 1 mm to greater than 1 cm (figure 3). Similar trace fossils are also found from bedding planes of
21 units 14 and 16. There are two modes in the diameters of openings on one of the bedding planes, but there is
22 no clear bimodal distribution on the other horizons examined in this way (Fig. 6). Many similar-sized
23
openings appear to be paired, consistent with U-shaped burrows. These paired openings also occur in pieces
24
of float adjacent to the outcrop (figure 4). Small concave arcuate traces occur on these bedding planes as well,
25
and they resemble the bases of U-shaped burrows from overlying beds that have eroded away (figure 3B, 3C).
26
The horizontal trace fossil Planolites is also preserved on these bedding planes.
27
28
29 Vertical exposures of some beds reveal that these circular openings are the tops of infilled vertical shafts
30
penetrating the limestone, which sometimes form J-shaped traces (figure 5). These tubes are unlined and lack
31
spreiten. Maximum depth of penetration of these tubes is about 4 cm. Considering compaction of the muddy
32
limestone, originally they probably extended deeper into the sediment. The tubes are infilled with light-
33
coloured sediment that differs from the matrix, indicating that the matrix was firm and the tubes were open at
34
35 the time of formation. The traces are dense enough to form a moderately intense ichnofabric in vertical
36 outcrop (ichnofabric index (ii) = 3 [17]). No full U-shaped burrows were observed in these vertical cross-
37 sections in the field. Sectioning one conspicuous J-shaped trace in the lab with a rock saw revealed its full U-
38 shaped morphology (figure 7).
39
40 In order to further reconstruct the 3-D morphology of burrows in one sample, the block was cut perpendicular
41 to bedding into seven parallel slabs. By stacking 13 scanned images of these vertical surfaces, internal
42 morphologies of two burrows were observed (figure 8). These two burrows are U-shaped, with irregular
43 boundaries. These burrows were likely originally more uniformly U-shaped, but presumably were
44 subsequently deformed, indicating weak strength of the burrow walls. The vertical shafts are also observed
45 penetrating the bases of several beds. Based on their morphological characteristics observed on bedding
46 planes (paired circular openings and arcuate traces) and on their vertical cross-sectional morphology (U-
47 shaped), these traces are interpreted as the penetrative burrow Arenicolites.
48
49
The limestones containing these Arenicolites show common evidence for synsedimentary soft-sediment
50
deformation. Beds are folded and contorted, including some of the trace-bearing beds, indicating slumping
51
(Figure 2). Flat-pebble conglomerates are common in the units where Arenicolites burrows are abundant
52
53 (Figure 2). They are often interpreted as evidence of shallow marine deposition above storm wave base.
54 However, the existence of large-scale, synsedimentarily deformed slump beds suggests a rather deep
55 continental slope setting. One locality near the Arenicolites horizons show a sudden lateral change of bed
56 forms from non-disturbed, intact bedded limestone to a slump bed with brecciated limestone slabs in muddy
57 matrix, suggesting that these slumps finally produced flat-pebble conglomerates from bedded limestones on
58 the slope.

1 Micrographs at the boundary of Arenicolites burrow walls and the matrix, as well as XRD analysis inside and
2 outside burrows, show a clear contrast of lithology, from a muddy microcrystalline calcite matrix to a light-
3 coloured carbonate with dolomite inside burrows (figure X). The boundary is sharp, smooth, and unlined.
4 There is no rim cement on the burrow wall. XRD analysis also shows that quartz was detected only from the
5 light-coloured infilling inside the burrow. The existence of quartz only inside the burrow and not the matrix
6 suggests that clastics were transported into the open burrows after the their abandonment by the trace makers.
7
8 The stable carbon isotope curve shows two negative excursions in the upper Zuun-Arts Formation (figure 1C).
9 This pattern with dual negative excursions is comparable to the results from Bayan Gol and other nearby
10 localities [11, 15]. Stratigraphic sections from Morocco show similar dual negative excursions at the top of the
11 Ediacaran [16] with slightly positive excursions below these negative spikes. The upper negative excursion in
12 this section, in Unit 17 near the top of the Zuun-Arts, is of greater magnitude and is identifiable as the
13 Precambrian–Cambrian boundary excursion (BACE excursion [14]) (figure 1C), and this negative excursion
14
can be correlated to the BACE boundary excursion [11,15]. Based on both the first occurrence of T. pedum and
15
this carbon isotope profile, the Arenicolites beds can be considered as located below the PC-C boundary. Even
16
if the lower negative excursion we detected near the boundary between units 15 and 16 marks the PC-C
17
18 boundary, the lowest horizon of Arenicolites is still below the boundary (figure 1B). These lines of evidence
19 indicate that these penetrative traces are located in the uppermost Ediacaran. Considering their co-occurrence
20 with Planolites, the absolute age of these Arenicolites can be constrained to ~555–541 Ma [9].
21
22
23 6. Discussion
24
25 Modern bilaterian animals with a variety of trophic modes make U-shaped burrows in sediment as semi-
26 permanent domiciles that are analogous to the trace fossil Arenicolites. Arenicolites is found throughout the
27
Phanerozoic, and it frequently occurs in trace fossil assemblages that show a preference for opportunistic
28
occupation of freshly disturbed sediment [18,19,20,21]. This also appears true of these Ediacaran Arenicolites,
29
as they are preserved in deformed continental slope deposits that were presumably freshly disturbed shortly
30
before trace maker inhabitation. While it is impossible to identify the phylum of these Arenicolites trace
31
32 makers, they were certainly bilaterian animals based on the complexity of the traces (which cannot have been
33 made by cnidarians or flatworms), and were likely vermiform in nature. Semi-permanent U-shaped burrows
34 are created to bring water into one opening for feeding and respiration and to expel waste products from the
35 other opening. This functionality only serves a trace-making animal with an anterior-posterior body axis and a
36 complete gut: both bilaterian-grade anatomical features. Some cnidarians, such as actinians, likely made
37 vertical burrows such as Bergaueria, Conichnus, and Dolopichnus, but these traces are simple vertical shafts,
38 lacking branching or U-shaped structures [22,23,24]. Recently discovered putative horizontal traces from the
39 Ediacaran of Mistaken Point are interpreted as being made by motile metazoans, probably cnidarians, not
40 bilaterian animals [25]. Jensen et al. stated that "producers other than bilaterians must be considered for
41 simple trace fossils, and perhaps also for short-branched forms" in the Neoproterozoic [3]. The complex U-
42 shape burrows observed in Unit 15 of the Zuun-Arts Formation cannot have been made by cnidarians, and
43 can safely be attributed to the activities of bilaterian animals. Therefore, the present discovery of Arenicolites
44 confirms that bilaterian animals existed in the latest Ediacaran, although many studies, including molecular
45 phylogenetics, suggests that bilaterians were present in the Ediacaran.
46
47
These penetrative trace fossils indicate that the agronomic revolution actually began in the latest Ediacaran in
48
at least one setting. This discovery of large-sized, penetrative trace fossils is contradictory to previous studies
49
50 showing that there were only small-sized penetrative traces starting in the earliest Cambrian (Fortunian) [7,8].
51 This finding exemplifies the sporadic and uneven development of intense bioturbation during the early
52 evolution of animals. The agronomic revolution did not proceed in a uniform pattern of increased
53 bioturbation levels across all depositional environments during the Cambrian radiation, but, rather, in a
54 patchwork of varying bioturbation levels across marine seafloors that lasted well into the early Paleozoic [26].
55 Paleoenvironments with Ediacaran-style substrates and associated benthic animal adaptations are found into
56 the middle Cambrian [27,28], and here we document a latest Ediacaran paleoenvironment with Cambrian-
57 style penetrative trace fossils and vertical ichnofabric development. In addition to the present discovery, there
58 are some records of three-dimensional trace fossils recorded from the terminal Ediacaran: large trace fossils

2 with spreiten [29], and treptichnid trace fossils [30], both from the late Ediacaran of Namibia, may also suggest
3 the existence of bilaterian animals.
4
5 Dolomitization can also create syndepositional deformation that can sometimes form abiogenic structures
6 resembling trace fossils [31]. However, the beds containing the vertical shafts correspond mostly to intervals
7 consisting of non-dolomitized limestones. The vertical shafts also have consistently circular bedding plane
8 cross sections and possess U-shaped vertical morphologies. On the upper bed surface, these circles, as well as
9
the longitudinal shafts, are mostly smooth in outline. These features can therefore be attributed to the
10
activities of benthic animals rather than dolomitization processes. There was evidently some deformation after
11
the formation of these burrows, altering some of the originally smooth walls into more irregular surfaces.
12
13
14 The maximum size of these Arenicolites (greater than 1 cm in tube diameter) means that the trace-makers were
15 relatively large compared to other Ediacaran, and even Fortunian, trace makers. These traces provide insight
16 into the early evolution of bilaterians. They mark an important milestone in early animal evolution because of
17 the behavior they represent: they are the earliest evidence for animals making semi-permanent domiciles in
18 sediment. The evolution of macrophagous predation was likely the selective pressure for these tracemakers to
19 build such semi-permanent infaunal structures. Furthermore, unlike a range of typical Ediacaran horizontal
20 trace fossils, many of which could have been formed by single-celled organisms such as protists [4], these
21 Arenicolites must have been formed by trace makers that used either peristaltic motion, which requires a
22 coelom as a hydrostatic skeleton, or excavating appendages. Non-bilaterian animals do not possess these
23 morphological characters and can therefore only create simple vertical shafts. The complexity and penetrative
24 nature of these trace fossils therefore provides convincing evidence for bilaterians in the latest Ediacaran just
25 below the Precambrian–Cambrian boundary.

7. Conclusions
30
31 Abundant penetrative trace fossils were discovered from 11 outcrop horizons of the late Ediacaran Zuun-Arts
32 Formation in Bayan Gol valley, western Mongolia, as well as from float. Cross-sectional analysis of these
33 traces shows that they penetrate at least 4 cm down from the surface, and form a U-shape. These trace fossils
34 can therefore be assigned to the ichnogenus Arenicolites. Carbon isotope data indicate that these Arenicolites
35 occur below a remarkable negative excursion assignable to the BACE event at the PC/C boundary and the first
36 occurrence of Treptichnus pedum is at a horizon at least 130 m above these Arenicolites. This chemostratigraphic
37 and biostratigraphic data shows that these trace fossils date to the late Ediacaran. Common distribution of
38 slump folds near these trace fossils suggest its deposition on the continental slope. These abundant, large-
39 sized, U-shape burrows show that the agronomic revolution started earlier than previously considered, and
40 that bilaterians were present in the late Ediacaran of western Mongolia.

19 Figure 5. Vertical cross section views of Arenicolites trace fossils from Unit 15 of Zuun-Arts Formation, Bayan
20 Gol Valley. All scale bars are 1 cm. A. Side of bed showing ichnofabric of vertical to sub-vertical traces
21 from vertical shafts of the U-shaped burrow and circular cross-sections of horizontal traces from base of
22 U-shaped burrow. B. Side of bed showing J-shaped cross-section of Arenicolites. Compression has made
23 trace more angular. C. Side of bed showing moderately dense ichnofabric (ii3) of vertical, sub-vertical,
24 and horizontal traces.

33 Figure 8. Two burrow morphologies reconstructed by superimposing thirteen images from slabbed surfaces of
34 a block. A: Seven parallel slabs were cut with a rock saw, thickness of each slab being 7 mm and the lost
35 interval between adjacent slabs being approximately 1 mm. B: Scanned images of thirteen surfaces.
36 Image of even numbers are horizontally inverted. C: Burrow shapes (red) from the thirteen superimposed
37 images. Both burrows show clear U-shaped morphology, with an irregular burrow wall, probably due to
38 later deformation. These burrow shapes are aligned horizontally but shown here vertically for
39 convenience. All scale bars are 2 cm.

41 Figure 9. Thin section micrographs (plane polarized) of Arenicolites burrows. A. Vertical view of a curved
42 burrow, from vertical shaft (upper) to horizontal tunnel (left). B. Horizontal view of a burrow with
43 circular outline. Both micrographs show micritic matrix and relatively coarse-grained carbonates in
44 burrows, with quartz grains of probable clastic origin. All scale bars are 1 mm.

P. 2, l. 6: important evolutionary innovation in animal behaviour --> important evolutionary
innovation in animal behaviour, with increased morphological diversity, expanded size range
and increased sediment penetration in the Cambrian
Also changed the order of the sentences before the one above, and renumbered the references 7-9.
P. 2, l. 24: a remarkable negative excursion --> a remarkable negative excursion with the minimum
value less than -5‰.
P. 2, l. 26: The boundary of the two formations, i.e. the Zuun-Arts and the Bayangol (former Bayan
Gol) Formations, was revised to the lower portion [11,15].--> The boundary of the two
formations, i.e. the Zuun-Arts and the Bayangol (former Bayan Gol) Formations, was recently
revised and moved to the lower horizon [11,15].
P. 2, l. 30: Gobi-Altai section --> Gobi-Altai succession
P. 2, l. 31: well-dated boundary section in Morocco --> well-dated boundary succession in Morocco
P. 2, l. 37: on 11 bedding planes --> on 11 bedding plane surfaces
P. 2, l. 47: Canon MG7500 --> (Canon MG7500)
P. 2, l. 49: CT-scan --> CT scanning
P. 3, l. 5: a stable C isotope curve --> a stable C isotope (d13C) curve
P. 3, l. 52: Figure 2 --> figure 2

P. 4, l. 45: add references [e.g., 26]
P. 5, l. 18: The evolution of macrophagous predation was likely the selective pressure for these
tracemakers to build such semi-permanent infaunal structures. --> The evolution of
macrophagous predation was likely the selective pressure for these tracemakers to build such
semi-permanent infaunal structures, as they would have provided safety from epibenthic
predators.
P. 5, l. 35: and the first occurrence of Treptichnus pedum is at a horizon at least 130 m above these
Arenicolites. --> , and below the first occurrence of Treptichnus pedum at a horizon at least 130

P. 7, l. 31: Morrocan --> Moroccan
Added lithologies and ages of the formations and groups in the figure 1-B, following suggestion by
the 1st reviewer, as:
Bayan Gol Fm: Siliciclastics and carbonates, early Cambrian; Zuun-Arts Fm: Carbonates with minor
siliciclastics, Ediacaran; Tsagaan Olom Gp: Zavkhan Fm: Diamictites and carbonates,
Cryogenian-Ediacaran; Zavkhan Fm: Felsic volcanics, Cryogenian.
The reviewer one asked the source of the data from Moroccan datings, but the figure caption said
that these came from the reference no. 16.
