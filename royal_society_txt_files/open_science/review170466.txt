This contribution describes the preparation of a series of acylhydrazone polymers through the
combination of a common dihydrazide with a series of dialdehydes and their application for the
sensing of different species. The results presented clearly illustrate the potential of these
polymeric structures for the development of sensing devices. However, the materials prepared,
according to the data here presented, are still quite far from their potential practical application
and much work is still needed before claiming they can be used for the sensing of a given species.
The authors need to make this clear in their discussion and conclusions. Thus, the conditions
used are quite far from real, practical condition (DMSO as the main solvent, which is not realistic
in particular for the biomedical application considered) and selectivity issues have not been
properly addressed. Overall, the manuscript contains valuable data and an interesting strategy in
this field and deserves being accepted for publication after some modifications.
Some additional comments:
1. The English language needs to be improved. Some illustrative examples have been
gathered below.
2. Line 29: 6-Mercaptopurine should be 6-mercaptopurine.
3. Responsive polymers should be added to the keywords.
4. Line 14: cor- responding should be corresponding.
5. Line 20: a combination of intrinsic recognition motif... should be: ....the combination of
the intrinsic recognition motifs..."
6. Line 42: For pyridine-2-carboxyaldehyde... should be "As pyridine-2-
carboxyaladehyde...."
7. Line 44: salicylalde- hyde should be salicylaldehyde.
8. Line 51: designed and outlined.... should be “designed as outlined...”.
9. 2.2. First paragraph, first line "common solvents, such as DMSO and DMF" should be
better to avoid the use of the adjective common for those solvents; just use "good solubility in
solvents such as...".
10. Below figure 2, line 23 "...which the aldehyde..." should be better "...for which the
aldehyde..."
11. Section 2.4, line 55: please revise the sentence "The results illustrate the less selectivity of
Cu2+" and explain better the experimental observation. The issue of selectivity needs to be better
addressed in the manuscript.
12. Section 2.5, first and second sentence. Please revise its grammar.
13. The contents of section 2.5 need to be revised. It is not easy, and most likely not correct,
to define the experimental results in terms of a cooperative effect. As the polymers studied are
acidic it was expected to find an effect associated to the basicity of the medium as this is most
likely the correct interpretation. The authors have studied the effect of the solvent but not the
effect of the pH of the medium. This should be the correct study to be carried out; in the absence
of such study, the data in this section are not very relevant.
14. The manuscript would benefit from including a short experimental section containing at
least the most essential elements for the synthesis of the polymers (general procedure)
15. In the title, the authors included the term dynamic. Although it is true that C=N bonds
represent some of the most used units in dynamic systems, the applications

Response to the Reviewer's comments
Response to Reviewer 1
Comment: This contribution describes the preparation of a series of acylhydrazone
polymers through the combination of a common dihydrazide with a series of
dialdehydes and their application for the sensing of different species. The results
presented clearly illustrate the potential of these polymeric structures for the
development of sensing devices. However, the materials prepared, according to the data
here presented, are still quite far from their potential practical application and much
work is still needed before claiming they can be used for the sensing of a given species.
The authors need to make this clear in their discussion and conclusions. Thus, the
conditions used are quite far from real, practical condition (DMSO as the main solvent,
which is not realistic in particular for the biomedical application considered) and
selectivity issues have not been properly addressed. Overall, the manuscript contains
valuable data and an interesting strategy in this field and deserves being accepted for
publication after some modifications.
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s kindly comment and suggestion on our
manuscript. We have clarified that the goal of the sensing study in the current work is
a proof of concept. We are currently working on increasing the solubility of polymers
for studies in aqueous solutions.
Comment 1: The English language needs to be improved. Some illustrative examples
have been gathered below.
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s kindly comment and suggestion on our manuscript.
According to reviewer’s recommendation, we have improved the English to make sure
our presentation as clear as possible in the revised manuscript.
Comment 2: Line 29: 6-Mercaptopurine should be 6-mercaptopurine.
Response: The mistake was corrected in the revised manuscript.
Comment 3: Responsive polymers should be added to the keywords.
Response: According to the reviewer’s suggestion, the keyword “responsive polymers”
was added to the modified version.
Comment 4: Line 14: cor-responding should be corresponding.
Response: It was updated in the revised manuscript.
Comment 5: Line 20: a combination of intrinsic recognition motif... should be: ....the
combination of the intrinsic recognition motifs..."
Comment 6: Line 42: For pyridine-2-carboxyaldehyde... should be "As pyridine-
2-carboxyaladehyde...."
Comment 7: Line 44: salicylalde- hyde should be salicylaldehyde.
Comment 8: Line 51: designed and outlined.... should be “designed as outlined...”.
Comment 9: 2.2. First paragraph, first line "common solvents, such as DMSO and
DMF" should be better to avoid the use of the adjective common for those solvents;
just use "good solubility in solvents such as...".
Comment 10: Below figure 2, line 23 "...which the aldehyde..." should be better
"...for which the aldehyde..."
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s comments and suggestions. According to
reviewer’s recommendation, these mistakes were corrected in the revised manuscript.
Comment 11: Section 2.4, line 55: please revise the sentence "The results illustrate the
less selectivity of Cu2+" and explain better the experimental observation. The issue of
selectivity needs to be better addressed in the manuscript.
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s comment and suggestion. According to reviewer’s
recommendation, we rewrote the section and now stated that “the discrimination
between Cu2+ and other metal ions became worse in relative to data in DMSO (Figure
3b)”.
Comment 12: Section 2.5, first and second sentences. Please revise its grammar.
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion. According to reviewer’s
recommendation, we have revised the grammar. The revised sentences: We next set out
to diversify the responsiveness of our systems. The NH within acylhydrazone group
and phenol OH are weakly acidic.
Comment 13: The contents of section 2.5 need to be revised. It is not easy, and most
likely not correct, to define the experimental results in terms of a cooperative effect. As
the polymers studied are acidic it was expected to find an effect associated to the
basicity of the medium as this is most likely the correct interpretation. The authors have
studied the effect of the solvent but not the effect of the pH of the medium. This should
be the correct study to be carried out; in the absence of such study, the data in this
section are not very relevant.
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s comment and suggestion.
The effect of pH of the medium was studied in our previous work (reference 48), and
it afforded similar results as weakly basic anions explored in the current work. We now
clarified this point in the revised manuscript.
Comment 14: The manuscript would benefit from including a short experimental
section containing at least the most essential elements for the synthesis of the polymers
(general procedure)
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion. We now included a short experimental
section, including the details for the synthesis of polymers.
Comment 15: In the title, the authors included the term dynamic. Although it is true
that C=N bonds represent some of the most used units in dynamic systems, the
applications
Response: Acylhydrazone as a dynamic covalent bond have been studied in a large
number of references, including our work (reference 48).
Response to Reviewer 2
Some application should be performed i.e. test strip etc. naked-eye colour change
picture should be included.
Response: Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion. The sensing can be performed in a
visualization manner, and the naked-eye color change picture was inserted in Figure 6
(b) in the revised manuscript.
