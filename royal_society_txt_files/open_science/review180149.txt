This paper describes the radiometric detection of Ni(II) and Fe(III) cations in different
environments. The authors have used two ligands DHQ and HQNM to test the complexation of
Ni and Fe and quantify their presence in various systems. The work is explained reasonably well,
but the language and typos need to be corrected before publication (as this article will be of
interest to the readership. Here are my particular suggestions and questions:
(1) Why not test DHQ for Fe and HQNM for Ni?
(2) For Figure 2, can the complexation of metal cations (other than iron) be significant despite a
small change in UV-Vis? Perhaps, a better experiment would be to do the titration of Fe in the
presence of another competing cation?
(3) Is the crystal structure in Scheme 3 is discussed in the manuscript?
(4) Any particular reason that the experiments were completed at pH = 7.4?
(5) Figure 3 has three structures but only two mentioned in the caption?
(6) How was the detection limit for Ni/Fe determined? (particular experimental conditions as this
will change with the amount of the receptor)

This manuscript reports on the behavior of three quinoxaline based derivatives for acting as an
active sensor for metal cations. I guess some paragraphs are missing between page 2 and 3.
Therefore, I suggest that the authors should look carefully into the whole manuscript, revise and
resubmit it. In addition, there are many English mistakes.

Reviewer’s question vs Answer
This paper describes the radiometric detection of Ni(II) and Fe(III) cations in different environments.
The authors have used two ligands DHQ and HQNM to test the complexation of Ni and Fe and
quantify their presence in various systems. The work is explained reasonably well, but the language
and typos need to be corrected before publication (as this article will be of interest to the
readership. Here are my particular suggestions and questions:
(1) Why not test DHQ for Fe and HQNM for Ni?
Thank you for the Comment. DHQ is mentioned as Fe(III) sensor and HQNM is for Ni(II). I think you
want to know the test result of DHQ vs Ni(II) and HQNM vs Fe(III). The corresponding UV-Vis spectra
have already given in the SI.
(2) For Figure 2, can the complexation of metal cations (other than iron) be significant despite a
small change in UV-Vis? Perhaps, a better experiment would be to do the titration of Fe in the
presence of another competing cation?
The Bar diagram has changed to Uv-vis spectral diagram to show the significant changes for Fe(III)
from other cations.
(3) Is the crystal structure in Scheme 3 is discussed in the manuscript?
The said crystal structure from my previous publication has been given to explain that there is a
prominent role of second quinoxaline nitrogen in complexation although there is no direct bond as
quinoline moiety does not serve as an effective nickel sensor. The lines from the manuscript are
described as ‘Surprisingly from the complex crystal structure of HQAP-Ni complex, we can not see
any direct bond with the second quinoxaline nitrogen to the nickel. But from that fact, we can say
that there must be some effect for the second quinoxaline nitrogen in HQAP-Ni complex so that it
will form and for quinoline moiety, it will not form at all’.
(4) Any particular reason that the experiments were completed at pH = 7.4?
Human Blood pH is somewhat in that level. So we are trying to develop a sensor in that pH level so
that it can be used in the biological system as well. Specially Fe(III) is very much essential for the
biological system, and it needs to be in required quantity always as it is mentioned in the manuscript
as “its deficiency or overload can cause various disorders and diseases such as anemia and
hemochromatosis.’
(5) Figure 3 has three structures but only two mentioned in the caption?
We are very sorry for the mistake. Now it has been corrected.
(6) How was the detection limit for Ni/Fe determined? (particular experimental conditions as this
will change with the amount of the receptor)
Detection limit for the Fe (III) ions can be calculated by the standard procedure as it was mentioned
in the supporting information. As HQNM has already published the detection limit calculation for
NI(II) has been given in the ref ( S. Goswami, S. Chakraborty, S. Paul, S. Halder, A. C. Maity,
Tetrahedron Letters, 2013, 54, 5075)

Thank you for the comments. We have checked the manuscript thoroughly and did some corrections
on page 2 and 3 writing pattern.
