The authors investigated the preparation of diethylenetriamine-functionalized GMA resin for the
sorption of As(V) from aqueous solutions. It is an interesting topic to the researchers in the
related areas. However I have a big doubt about the experimental results. The sorption capacity
reported in this study for As(V) (5.25 mmol g-1) was not reached before by amine modified GMA.
See for example on the highest sorption capacities in the literature “Journal of Hazardous
Materials 191 (2011) 1–7” so the highest recorded capacity for As(V) was 1.83 mmol g-1, which
present about 34.8% of the reported one in this paper.
Other comments are as follows:
1- Page 2, line 40. In order to better support the statement “Because the amino has strong
chelating properties for transition metal ions, the 61 adsorbent with amino functional groups has
been widely used for removing heavy metal ions in the solution: “Water Science and Technology
9 (2) (2009) 181-190.” “Carbohydrate Polymers 134 (2015) 190–204.” “Journal of hazardous
materials 342 (2018) 335-346”.
2- Monitoring the change in pH during the adsorption is very important.
3- How the studied different kinetic equations and the parameter values obtained can be used in
design calculations of large scale operation process? This is ignored!
4- Does all the data just measure once? You must repeat at least three times to ensure your data
valuable. And the standard deviation should be list in the diagram.
5- For all regression analysis: Only R2 is not sufficient to prove the fit quality. At least one error
analysis should be performed. R2 is coefficient of DETERMINATION.
6- In the manuscript, sorption mechanism has been mentioned here and there. It would be better
for the authors to give a summary of the mechanism of sorption of As(V) in appropriate section.
7- The thermodynamics of the sorption may be provided.
8- Some grammar errors should be carefully checked and revised. See for example page 6 As( ).

It’s quite a good job done by the author. but there are still some limitations I would like to
suggest the authors address. Here is some advice for authors
Comment 1 Although authors have quoted a large number of references, some of which are too
old, I think it is better to cite more recent references
Comment 2 referenceIt’s better if author could make further analysis to enrich
the“characterization”by using EDS,SEM and elemental analysis or any other way available.

Dear editor,
Thank you and the reviewers for the comments
concerning to our manuscript (RSOS-181013) and giving us
a chance to re-submit. According to your and the reviewers’
suggestions, we have significantly revised our manuscript.
The detail responses to the reviewer’s comments are as
follows:
To reviewer 1
Thank you for your suggestion. In this work,
considering that crosslinked polystyrene resin (PS) is a
versatile platform to prepare various adsorbents, we
attempted to take advantage of SI-ATRP to create a novel
diethylenetriamine-functionalized PS resin with high
capacity that is different from the reported adsorption resins
in the structure.
Q. 1. Page 2, line 40. In order to better support the statement
“Because the amino has strong chelating properties for
transition metal ions, the 61 adsorbent with amino functional
groups has been widely used for removing heavy metal ions
in the solution: “Water Science and Technology 9 (2) (2009)
181-190.” “Carbohydrate Polymers 134 (2015) 190–204.”
“Journal of hazardous materials 342 (2018) 335-346”.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion.We have read
above references carefully, and the references have been
cited in the revised manuscript.
Q. 2. Monitoring the change in pH during the adsorption is
very important.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We are sorry that
we didn’t monitor the change in pH during the adsorption.
But the effect of pH on the adsorption process was studied
and the optimum pH was obtained. All adsorption studies
were carried out at optimum pH.
Q. 3. How the studied different kinetic equations and the
parameter values obtained can be used in design calculations
of large scale operation process? This is ignored!
Response: Thank you for your advice. The pseudo-second
model includes all processes of adsorption, such as external
liquid film diffusion, surface adsorption, and intra-particle
diffusion, which more accurately reflect the adsorption
mechanism.So we only used the pseudo-second order
kinetics model to explain the kinetics modelling.
Q. 4. Does all the data just measure once? You must repeat
at least three times to ensure your data valuable. And the
standard deviation should be list in the diagram.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion.We repeated
many times to ensure our data valuable. The best results
were reported in this work.
Q. 5. For all regression analysis: Only R2 is not sufficient to
prove the fit quality. At least one error analysis should be
performed. R2 is coefficient of DETERMINATION.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. In this work, the
fitting effect of the model was judged according to the value
of R2.The larger the value of R2 was, the better the fitting
effect of the model was.
Q. 6. In the manuscript, sorption mechanism has been
mentioned here and there. It would be better for the authors
to give a summary of the mechanism of sorption of As(V) in
appropriate section.
Response: The revised manuscript has been modified.
Thank you very much.
Q. 7. The thermodynamics of the sorption may be provided.
Response: Thank you for your advise.We found that the
impact of temperature on the adsorption process was not
significant in our previous researches, so thermodynamics of
the sorption was not provided in this work.
Q. 8. Some grammar errors should be carefully checked and
revised. See for example page 6 As( ).
Response: We have been carefully checked the paper and
some grammar errors have been corrected in the revised
manuscript.
To reviewer 2
Q. 1. Although authors have quoted a large number of
references, some of which are too old, I think it is better to
cite more recent references.
Response: Thank you for your advise.The following
references have been cited in the revised manuscript .
1.Selective removal of Hg(II) with
polyacrylonitrile-2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole chelating resin: Batch
and column study, Chemical Engineering Journal, 2015, 259,257-265

adsorption properties and mechanism for separation and recovery of
Pt(IV) from aqueous solutions. Journal of Materials Chemistry A,
2014, (2): 5379-5386.
Q. 2. It’s better if author could make further analysis to
enrich the“characterization”by using EDS, SEM and
elemental analysis or any other way available.
Response: Thank you for your suggestion. X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy for the characterization of resins
has been provided in the revised manuscript .
