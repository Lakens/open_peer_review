Specific comments for the authors:
Cumulative line number is referred to
23: novel surroundings hasn’t really been addressed specifically in this paper, I would drop it
here, and in latter comments (line 138). Wouldn’t all lab experiments be novel surroundings,
unless you specifically are controlling how novel?
30: seems to me that the comma should be a semicolon, or start a new sentence there?
37: drop the “often”
38-40: redundant use of “conspecifics”. Could you drop some of them?
44: hyphenate “group-mates” ?
47: drop the word “group order” from the whole paper? It is not needed and leads to some
confusion later in the paper when it is not clear if group order is the same as polarization. Unless
you feel it is important to bring it up so it compares with other papers. But in that case you’ll
want to spend a few sentences saying what other measures of group order there are.
50: a reference at the end of the sentence would be good.
53: confusing commas at the end. Perhaps you could remove the last one?
53: I’m not convinced there is an obvious prediction on whether familiarity should lead to more
or less polarization. I would like you to convince me a bit here, either with other papers, or
philosophically. I could see familiar individuals being less polarized because they were
interacting more for dominance, or other reasons. Or, I could just as well justify that familiar
individuals would be more polarized because they are working together? Or, something about
parasite avoidance?
71: Never quite clear in the paper what your sample size of number of groups is. Please say it
explicitly here and in the figure legends. I’m deducing that you said 72 fish and that you used
them all once, so you had 9 groups of 4 fish in each of the two treatments?
88: should cite these free software products (VDub and IDtracker and nlme package).
98: you are doing repeated measures on two readings for each fish. Is that correct? You boiled
down the 5 min * 24 frames for each fish into one average. Or are you keeping the 120 readings
of each fish and doing repeated measure on that? It looks like that is what you said, but may
want to confirm this.
120: confusing syntax here “not maintain lowerNND”. Does that mean that it was higher, or just
not significant altogether?
126: Any way to put a significance value with those heat maps? Seems wishy-washy to just say
that there are slightly greater correlations in one area than the other. Also in line 149
“considerable differences”.
132: global search and replace “group order” for polarization ?
157: would be good to have a reference at the end of this sentence.
3
160: In discussion or intro it would be good to have a few statements about proximate causes of
unfamiliarity influencing NND and polarization? Could unfamiliarity lead to greater stress
levels (stress hormones) that cause a change in all of the behavioral measures you measured? It
doesn’t look like you tested whether these three factors are correlated, but it would be good to do
this, and easy (I took a second look and don’t see it).
Table 1: Group order = polarization. You haven’t put astericies (asterixes?) on all the P-values
that are below 0.05. An oversight, or is this because the multiple comparison criteria told you not
to?
226: Title needs to be converted to lower case.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
I have now finished reviewing the manuscript “Familiarity affects collective motion in shoals of
guppies Poecilia reticulata” (MS-RSOS-170312). The MS examines the effect of familiarity on
shoal cohesion and behaviour. Namely the authors compare group cohesion, mean speed, mean
distance to nearest neighbor between groups of familiar and unfamiliar female guppies. The MS
addresses a timely question on behavioural ecology, and its results are likely to generate interest
from a broad audience.
While the MS have many positive points, and deserves to be published, I believe there are still
some points that should be addressed before I can make any decision. Below is a list with major
and minor points I would like to see addressed in a revised version.
MAJOR POINTS
1 – The first major concern has to do with the definitions of collective motion, cohesive group
behaviour, polarization and correlation. Collective motion and cohesive group behaviour are
measures of similarity/dissimilarity within individuals in a group.
4
When individuals within a group have dissimilar/contrasting behavioural decisions we can say
that individuals display polarized behaviours (i.e. polarization == poles apart!), which indicates
lower group cohesion.
While the authors make this distinction clear in lines 30 to 34, in line 48 the authors wrote
“Individuals in highly-aligned, polarized groups…”.
In my naïve perspective it not clear how a group can be highly aligned and at the same time, be
polarized. Further, polarization can be defined as differences among individual behaviour within
a group (i.e. greater variance == high polarization, lower variance == lower polarization).
I am having some difficulty in understanding how high polarization enables better information
transfer between individuals in a social group. Further, at the beginning of the discussion (line
132 to line 134) the authors mention “…polarization, is greater in familiar shoals. Allied to this
result, the movements of fish in familiar shoals were more strongly correlated…” Again, it is not
clear to me how individuals in a group can have polarized behaviors/decisions. and at the same
time have a positive behavioural correlation.
To add to the confusion in line 138 “Polarization in familiar groups decreased markedly as the
fish habituated to the novel…”, which acknowledges that individual differences in familiar
groups were greater than among unfamiliar groups – this is in plain contradiction with the main
result!
There is great confusion throughout the MS in terms of what is polarization and what is group
alignment. It is therefore not clear what the main results are. The authors need to clarify their
results and interpretations.
2 – The second major concern has to do with the experimental protocol section. The text is
confusing and misleading at some stages.
There is the reference that familiarity in guppies is acquired after 12 days, however individuals in
the experiment were all collected from the same population (line 60-61 “collected from a feral
population near Darwin…”), hence it is fair to assume there was some level of familiarization
between individuals prior to the experiment. Also, it is said that after arrival at the laboratory
individuals were allocated to a stock tank for one week prior to the start of the experiment (line
62). Again, this time could have increased familiarity bonds between individuals. Sian Griffiths
study on time to acquired familiarity used mixed sex ratio guppies. Single sex tanks (as I assume
was the case here) could have enhanced familiarity, because females do not have to worry about
male sexual harassment. Minor points within this section include the use of tank size in liters,
which tell very little. Please provide tank dimensions in cm, or mm, but be consistent (eg. female
size was given in mm, but Perspex diameter of was given in cm). Finally, it would be nice to have
information about sampling size. There is no information on the total number of tanks per each
treatment.
3 – Third major concern has to do with the statistical analysis.
a) Why did you record the behaviour in two time frames? You need to justify the reason for
reducing 35/40 minutes of observation to two single points. We showed that despite early social
differences guppy behaviour homogenizes after 15 minutes. Why you did a second observation
after 30 minutes?
b) Also, it is not clear what was the timing of the second observation. There is also no
information about the duration of the two observations.
c) Another major problem in this section is to understand how you managed to tease apart
female guppies within the groups. Given that female guppies are extremely hard to distinguish
between them, I was wondering how did you ensure the focal female was the same at the first
and second sampling time?
d) Also, 1) mean speed of fish, 2) mean nearest neighbour distance and 3) mean polarisation
of the group based on individual were compared between familiar and unfamiliar groups.
However, this was not done, instead, you reduced group information to a single point (mean).
This is strange, especially if you used fish ID as random factor. There is no information about
how these response variables were recorded.
5
e) Speed and mean nearest neighbour distance were transformed. These transformations
seem odd. Why did you need to use two different transformations? It seems that you were trying
to find a transformation until the residuals fit the "normal" distribution. Need to provide a clear
justification for using sqrt and log transformation. What was the shape of the distribution, that
warranted the use of these specific transformations?
f) It was not clear what was done in lines 104-115, and more importantly why was this
done? What was your response variable here? How was the focal individual chosen? How many
times and for how long the correlation between speed and distance was recorded?
MINOR POINTS
L18-19 – This sentence is obvious. If collective movement behavior is the sum of behavioural
interactions, unsurprisingly any factor that affects the interaction will have a direct effect on the
collective movement.
L23-25 – This is part of major concern 1. I just don’t understand how polarize behaviour within a
group enhance the transmission of social information between the members of the group. By
definition polarization indicates extremes in positions, hence there is no way that dissimilarity
within the group promotes cohesion.
L35 – “Although many theoretical models…” it should have a reference at the end of the sentence
L39 – 41 – “For example, individuals of many social species behave preferentially to
conspecifics…” needs a reference at the end
L48 – “Individuals in highly-aligned, polarised groups…” This is simply not possible. Either a
group is polarized or aligned, these are two opposite states (see Wikipedia for definitions).
L52 – 53 – “we examined the effect of familiarity on nearest neighbour distance, as a measure of
cohesion, and speed.” There is something odd about this sentence.
L58 – “…females show strong association preferences for familiar individuals…” Needs a
reference to support this statement.
L62 – Please give dimensions
L67 – replace “aquarium” for tanks.
L67 – How was female body size measured?
L68 – Please provide dimension of tanks
L70-71 – Individuals were collected from the same site. Additionally, they were all held together
for one week after arrival at the laboratory – surely this must have affected familiarity.
L73 – You mentioned 6 tanks before
L76 – Every measure was given in mm, except this one. Please be consistent
L86 – Why two-time steps, and why did you choose 5 and 30 minutes?
L90-91 – How were these response variables recorded?
L92 – What do you mean by “level of polarization” and how did you measured it?
6
L95 - How did you record these variables? During how long (seconds, minutes)? Need to provide
more details about the methodology
L97 - is this individual ID or tank ID? If individual ID how did you recognize the 4 different
individuals? Also, if you used mean group speed, why using individual ID as random factor?
L97 – Given that females are extremely hard to tell apart how did you ensure that the same
female was recorded on time 1 and time 2?
L99 - These transformations seemed odd. Why did you use two different ones? It seems that you
were trying to find a transformation until the residuals fit the "normal" distribution. Need to
provide a clear justification for using sqrt and log transformation. What was the shape of the
distribution, that warranted the use of these specific transformations?
L101 – Are “error variances” the residuals?
L101 - This is new to me. Please explain what a box text is
L104 – Replace “between animals” with “within individuals in each group”
L105 - but isn't this the same as polarization? See lines 46-48
L109 - Why didn't you take into account this effect on the previous analysis? See lines 94-95
L110 – “Directional correlation” is your response variable?
L107- 115 – How did you select the focal individual? For how long was correlation direction
recorded? Did you recorded in the two time steps? If so, how did you ensure the same focal
individual was recorded on time 1 and time 2?
L107 – 115 – in the absence of males female guppies tend to shoal together (Jon Evans papers). It
is then interesting to know how did you select pairs of individuals if all females (four) were
swimming together?
L112- 115 - This is an extremely convoluted manner to say that you used correlation coefficient to
examine group differences
L119 - 121- does this mean that within individual group differences were greater among familiar
groups?
L119 – 121 - How could you know if the two females maintained their distance over time. Did
you tag each individual? How long did was the pairs behaviour recorded for?
L120 - what was your null hypothesis? I assume it was "no difference between groups". If so you
may have failed to detected a difference, or say that groups were different. This is not the same as
to say, "groups did no maintain significantly lower mean nearest..." Just because you did not see a
difference, does not mean there isn't one!
L121- How did you record swimming speed? Time/distance? Need to provide more information.
It is not clear to the reader how you did this.
L124 - Does this mean, + or -? You can have strong correlations of opposing directions. Need to
explain if this was a strong positive correlation or a negative
7
L127 - how can familiar groups be more polarized and at the same time more aligned with each
other? By definition, group polarization is the presence of contrasting behaviours/views among
individuals in a group.
L131 - This mean lower polarization? ie better group coordination in behavioural responses - as
defined on pages 26 and 30 of the introduction?
L132 - There is a fundamental problem with the definition of polarization.
L138 - 140- “Polarisation in the familiar groups decreased markedly as the fish habituated to the
novel conditions, so that there was little obvious difference between the treatments during the
second sampling period.” There is published evidence that differences in individual behaviour
decrease after 20 minutes. It is therefore not surprising that you detect a homogenization of
individual behaviour with and between groups after 30 minutes.
L140 – 142 - Your results cannot support such statement
L143 – How does this sentence “there was only a weak trend towards greater cohesion in familiar
groups” fit with
L133-134 “movements of fish in familiar shoals were more strongly correlated”
L135-136 “the alignment of fish was greater for a wide range of shoal-mate positions in familiar
shoals”,
L137-138 “fish in familiar shoals show greater co-ordination and more coherent behaviour across
the group than unfamiliar fish”? They seem contradictory.
L154 “… individuals tend to align more strongly with familiar than with unfamiliar”
L154 – “If individuals tend to align more strongly with familiar”, But on line 143 you said the
opposite "there was only a weak trend towards greater cohesion in familiar groups
Table 1 – What is mean group order? Polarization? If so keep the same terms throughout the text.
Avoids confusion.
Figure 1 – there is no need to repeat, “Mean (+ standard deviation)” for all variables. Also I
assume the stdev is plus and minus
Figure 2 and 3 are extremely difficult to comprehend
I hope these comments help improving the clarity of the study. The theme is interesting and the
results novel, hence the study deserves to be published. However, I also think there is still some
major points that need to be addressed before any decision is made.
Looking forward to read a revised version of the manuscript.
All the best

L52 – 53 – “we examined the effect of familiarity on nearest neighbour distance, as a measure of
cohesion, and speed.” There is something odd about this sentence.

L95 - How did you record these variables? During how long (seconds, minutes)? Need to provide
more details about the methodology
L97 - is this individual ID or tank ID? If individual ID how did you recognize the 4 different
individuals? Also, if you used mean group speed, why using individual ID as random factor?
L97 – Given that females are extremely hard to tell apart how did you ensure that the same
female was recorded on time 1 and time 2?
L99 - These transformations seemed odd. Why did you use two different ones? It seems that you
were trying to find a transformation until the residuals fit the "normal" distribution. Need to
provide a clear justification for using sqrt and log transformation. What was the shape of the
distribution, that warranted the use of these specific transformations?
L101 – Are “error variances” the residuals?
L101 - This is new to me. Please explain what a box text is
L104 – Replace “between animals” with “within individuals in each group”
L105 - but isn't this the same as polarization? See lines 46-48

L110 – “Directional correlation” is your response variable?
L107- 115 – How did you select the focal individual? For how long was correlation direction
recorded? Did you recorded in the two time steps? If so, how did you ensure the same focal
individual was recorded on time 1 and time 2?
L107 – 115 – in the absence of males female guppies tend to shoal together (Jon Evans papers). It
is then interesting to know how did you select pairs of individuals if all females (four) were
swimming together?
L112- 115 - This is an extremely convoluted manner to say that you used correlation coefficient to
examine group differences
L119 - 121- does this mean that within individual group differences were greater among familiar
groups?
L119 – 121 - How could you know if the two females maintained their distance over time. Did
you tag each individual? How long did was the pairs behaviour recorded for?
14
L120 - what was your null hypothesis? I assume it was "no difference between groups". If so you
may have failed to detected a difference, or say that groups were different. This is not the same as
to say, "groups did no maintain significantly lower mean nearest..." Just because you did not see a
difference, does not mean there isn't one!
L121- How did you record swimming speed? Time/distance? Need to provide more information.
It is not clear to the reader how you did this.
L124 - Does this mean, + or -? You can have strong correlations of opposing directions. Need to
explain if this was a strong positive correlation or a negative
L127 - how can familiar groups be more polarized and at the same time more aligned with each
other? By definition, group polarization is the presence of contrasting behaviours/views among
individuals in a group.
L131 - This mean lower polarization? ie better group coordination in behavioural responses - as
defined on pages 26 and 30 of the introduction?
L132 - There is a fundamental problem with the definition of polarization.
L138 - 140- “Polarisation in the familiar groups decreased markedly as the fish habituated to the
novel conditions, so that there was little obvious difference between the treatments during the
second sampling period.” There is published evidence that differences in individual behaviour
decrease after 20 minutes. It is therefore not surprising that you detect a homogenization of
individual behaviour with and between groups after 30 minutes.
L140 – 142 - Your results cannot support such statement
L143 – How does this sentence “there was only a weak trend towards greater cohesion in familiar
groups” fit with
L133-134 “movements of fish in familiar shoals were more strongly correlated”
L135-136 “the alignment of fish was greater for a wide range of shoal-mate positions in familiar
shoals”,
L137-138 “fish in familiar shoals show greater co-ordination and more coherent behaviour across
the group than unfamiliar fish”? They seem contradictory.
L154 “… individuals tend to align more strongly with familiar than with unfamiliar”
L154 – “If individuals tend to align more strongly with familiar”, But on line 143 you said the
opposite "there was only a weak trend towards greater cohesion in familiar groups
Table 1 – What is mean group order? Polarization? If so keep the same terms throughout the text.
Avoids confusion.
Figure 1 – there is no need to repeat, “Mean (+ standard deviation)” for all variables. Also I
assume the stdev is plus and minus
Figure 2 and 3 are extremely difficult to comprehend
I hope these comments help improving the clarity of the study. The theme is interesting and the
results novel, hence the study deserves to be published. However, I also think there is still some
major points that need to be addressed before any decision is made.
Looking forward to read a revised version of the manuscript.
All the best

Specific comments for the authors:
Cumulative line number is referred to
23: novel surroundings hasn’t really been addressed specifically in this paper, I would drop it here, and
in latter comments (line 138). Wouldn’t all lab experiments be novel surroundings, unless you
specifically are controlling how novel?
WE DID CONTROL HOW NOVEL, AND HAD TWO SAMPLING PERIODS, ONCE WHEN THE FISH WERE
FIRST INTRODUCED TO THE ARENA, WHEN I THINK IT’S REASONABLE TO SAY THE SURROUNDINGS
WERE NOVEL, AND ONCE AFTER A PERIOD OF HABITUATION.
30: seems to me that the comma should be a semicolon, or start a new sentence there?
CHANGED
37: drop the “often”
DONE
38-40: redundant use of “conspecifics”. Could you drop some of them?
DONE
44: hyphenate “group-mates” ?
DONE
47: drop the word “group order” from the whole paper? It is not needed and leads to some confusion
later in the paper when it is not clear if group order is the same as polarization. Unless you feel it is
important to bring it up so it compares with other papers. But in that case you’ll want to spend a few
sentences saying what other measures of group order there are.
GOOD IDEA – HAVE SIMPLIFIED TO JUST SAY ‘POLARISATION’
50: a reference at the end of the sentence would be good.
ADDED. ALSO, WE HAVE ADAPTED THE PHRASING
53: confusing commas at the end. Perhaps you could remove the last one?
REWORDED
53: I’m not convinced there is an obvious prediction on whether familiarity should lead to more or less
polarization. I would like you to convince me a bit here, either with other papers, or philosophically. I
could see familiar individuals being less polarized because they were interacting more for dominance, or
other reasons. Or, I could just as well justify that familiar individuals would be more polarized because
they are working together? Or, something about parasite avoidance?
GOOD POINT, AND WE AGREE, ALTHOUGH WE DIDN’T ACTUALLY MAKE A DIRECTIONAL PREDICTION –
WE SIMPLY ASSESSED WHETHER FAMILIARITY WOULD AFFECT COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOUR. IT COULD
HAVE AFFECTED IT IN EITHER DIRECTION.
71: Never quite clear in the paper what your sample size of number of groups is. Please say it explicitly
here and in the figure legends. I’m deducing that you said 72 fish and that you used them all once, so
you had 9 groups of 4 fish in each of the two treatments?
GOOD POINT, WE HAVE ADDED INFORMATION TO CLARIFY THE SAMPLE SIZES
88: should cite these free software products (VDub and IDtracker and nlme package). DONE
98: you are doing repeated measures on two readings for each fish. Is that correct? You boiled down the
5 min * 24 frames for each fish into one average. Or are you keeping the 120 readings of each fish and
doing repeated measure on that? It looks like that is what you said, but may want to confirm this.
FOR THE GROUP MEASURE OF POLARISATION, WE CALCULATED THIS AS A MEAN ACROSS EACH 5
MINUTE SAMPLING PERIOD FOR EACH GROUP. FOR THE INDIVIDUAL MEASURES, WE CALCULATED THE
MEDIAN SPEED AND THE MEAN NND FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL FISH IN EACH GROUP FOR EACH
SAMPLING PERIOD. AGAIN, WE HAVE ADAPTED THE TEXT TO CLARIFY THIS.
120: confusing syntax here “not maintain lowerNND”. Does that mean that it was higher, or just not
significant altogether?
REWORDED
126: Any way to put a significance value with those heat maps? Seems wishy-washy to just say that
there are slightly greater correlations in one area than the other. Also in line 149 “considerable
differences”.
THE HEATPLOTS SIMPLY OFFER A DIFFERENT – ARGUABLY MORE INFORMATIVE – MEANS OF
VISUALISING THE RESULTS.
132: global search and replace “group order” for polarization ?
GOOD IDEA. HAVE DONE THIS.
157: would be good to have a reference at the end of this sentence.
TRUE, BUT AT THIS STAGE IN THE DISCUSSION, WE ARE SPECULATING ABOUT THE POTENTIAL
IMPLICATIONS OF OUR FINDINGS.
160: In discussion or intro it would be good to have a few statements about proximate causes of
unfamiliarity influencing NND and polarization? Could unfamiliarity lead to greater stress levels (stress
hormones) that cause a change in all of the behavioral measures you measured? It doesn’t look like you
tested whether these three factors are correlated, but it would be good to do this, and easy (I took a
second look and don’t see it).
IT MAY LEAD TO AN ELEVATED STRESS RESPONSE IN THE FISH, AND THAT WOULD BE REALLY COOL
TO EXAMINE IN ITS OWN RIGHT. WE DIDN’T TEST WHETHER THE THREE MEASURES WERE
CORRELATED, PARTLY BECAUSE POLARISATION IS A GROUP-LEVEL MEASURE AND THE OTHER
METRICS ARE MEASURED AT THE LEVEL OF THE INDIVIDUAL, SO THEY’RE NOT DIRECTLY
COMPARABLE.
Table 1: Group order = polarization. You haven’t put astericies (asterixes?) on all the P-values that are
below 0.05. An oversight, or is this because the multiple comparison criteria told you not to? WE
REPORT THE P VALUES, BUT ONLY ADD ASTERICES (!) TO THOSE VALUES THAT CAN STILL BE
CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT FOLLOWING APPLICATION OF A BENJAMINI-HOCHBERG PROCEDURE.
226: Title needs to be converted to lower case.
DONE
Online supplemental index/materials: I did not check the formulae carefully.

label_comment_8
I have now finished reviewing the manuscript “Familiarity affects collective motion in shoals of guppies
Poecilia reticulata” (MS-RSOS-170312). The MS examines the effect of familiarity on shoal cohesion and
behaviour. Namely the authors compare group cohesion, mean speed, mean distance to nearest
neighbor between groups of familiar and unfamiliar female guppies. The MS addresses a timely question
on behavioural ecology, and its results are likely to generate interest from a broad audience.
While the MS have many positive points, and deserves to be published, I believe there are still some
points that should be addressed before I can make any decision. Below is a list with major and minor
points I would like to see addressed in a revised version.
THANKS FOR YOUR CONSTRUCTIVE AND HELPFUL COMMENTS, WE APPRECIATE THIS.
MAJOR POINTS
1 – The first major concern has to do with the definitions of collective motion, cohesive group behaviour,
polarization and correlation. Collective motion and cohesive group behaviour are measures of
similarity/dissimilarity within individuals in a group.
When individuals within a group have dissimilar/contrasting behavioural decisions we can say that
individuals display polarized behaviours (i.e. polarization == poles apart!), which indicates lower group
cohesion.
While the authors make this distinction clear in lines 30 to 34, in line 48 the authors wrote “Individuals
in highly-aligned, polarized groups…”.
In my naïve perspective it not clear how a group can be highly aligned and at the same time, be
polarized. Further, polarization can be defined as differences among individual behaviour within a group
(i.e. greater variance == high polarization, lower variance == lower polarization).
I am having some difficulty in understanding how high polarization enables better information transfer
between individuals in a social group. Further, at the beginning of the discussion (line 132 to line 134)
the authors mention “…polarization, is greater in familiar shoals. Allied to this result, the movements of
fish in familiar shoals were more strongly correlated…” Again, it is not clear to me how individuals in a
group can have polarized behaviors/decisions. and at the same time have a positive behavioural
correlation.
To add to the confusion in line 138 “Polarization in familiar groups decreased markedly as the fish
habituated to the novel…”, which acknowledges that individual differences in familiar groups were
greater than among unfamiliar groups – this is in plain contradiction with the main result!
There is great confusion throughout the MS in terms of what is polarization and what is group alignment.
It is therefore not clear what the main results are. The authors need to clarify their results and
interpretations.
WE CAN APPRECIATE WHERE THE CONFUSION ARISES AND THE SEMANTIC PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED
WITH THE TERM POLARISATION. HOWEVER, POLARISATION IN THE CONTEXT OF COLLECTIVE
MOVEMENT IS A MEASURE OF THE ALIGNMENT OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN A GROUP. WHEN A GROUP IS
SAID TO BE HIGHLY POLARISED, THIS MEANS THAT IT THE ANIMALS WITHIN THAT GROUP ARE
HIGHLY ALIGNED WITH ONE ANOTHER. WE HAVE ADAPTED THE TEXT IN THE MAIN MS, AND WE HAVE
ADDED A SECTION IN THE SI TO FULLY DESCRIBE THIS.
2 – The second major concern has to do with the experimental protocol section. The text is confusing
and misleading at some stages.
There is the reference that familiarity in guppies is acquired after 12 days, however individuals in the
experiment were all collected from the same population (line 60-61 “collected from a feral population
near Darwin…”), hence it is fair to assume there was some level of familiarization between individuals
prior to the experiment. Also, it is said that after arrival at the laboratory individuals were allocated to a
stock tank for one week prior to the start of the experiment (line 62). Again, this time could have
increased familiarity bonds between individuals. Sian Griffiths study on time to acquired familiarity used
mixed sex ratio guppies. Single sex tanks (as I assume was the case here) could have enhanced
familiarity, because females do not have to worry about male sexual harassment. Minor points within
this section include the use of tank size in liters, which tell very little. Please provide tank dimensions in
cm, or mm, but be consistent (eg. female size was given in mm, but Perspex diameter of was given in
cm). Finally, it would be nice to have information about sampling size. There is no information on the
total number of tanks per each treatment.
SIAN GRIFFITH’S EXPERIMENT USED ONLY FEMALE GUPPIES, WHICH IS PARTLY WHY WE CHOSE THIS
APPROACH.
WE CAN’T EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ANIMALS WERE SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR PRIOR TO
THEIR SEGREGATION INTO SEPARATE TANKS. HOWEVER, ANY RESIDUAL FAMILIARITY THIS WOULD
ACT TO MINIMISE ANY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR FAMILIARITY TREATMENTS, RATHER THAN TO
ENHANCE IT. THIS DEMONSTRATES THE ROBUSTNESS OF OUR FINDINGS. JUST AS FAMILIARITY
DEVELOPS OVER TIME, STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IT DECREASES OVER TIME WITHOUT
REINFORCEMENT. WE HAVE ADDED INFORMATION ON THIS TO THE METHODS.
I’D PREFER TO MAINTAIN REPORTING OF THE HOLDING TANKS IN TERMS OF VOLUME SINCE IT SEEMS
TO ME TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT METRIC.
3 – Third major concern has to do with the statistical analysis.
a) Why did you record the behaviour in two time frames? You need to justify the reason for reducing
35/40 minutes of observation to two single points. We showed that despite early social differences
guppy behaviour homogenizes after 15 minutes. Why you did a second observation after 30 minutes?
WE USED TWO SAMPLING PERIODS BECAUSE WE HYPOTHESISED THAT THE COLLECTIVE MOVEMENT
OF THE FISH WOULD CHANGE ACCORDING TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT IN THE ARENA, AS PER
YOUR STUDY, IN FACT. WE HAVE NOW CITED THIS.
b) Also, it is not clear what was the timing of the second observation. There is also no information about
the duration of the two observations.
THIS IS ALREADY DESCRIBED IN THE MS. WE HAVE REWORDED THIS SLIGHTLY TO MAKE IT CLEARER.
c) Another major problem in this section is to understand how you managed to tease apart female
guppies within the groups. Given that female guppies are extremely hard to distinguish between them, I
was wondering how did you ensure the focal female was the same at the first and second sampling
time?
GOOD POINT – ALL THIS FISH WERE INDIVIDUALLY MARKED – WE HAVE ADDED THIS DETAIL.
d) Also, 1) mean speed of fish, 2) mean nearest neighbour distance and 3) mean polarisation of the
group based on individual were compared between familiar and unfamiliar groups. However, this was
not done, instead, you reduced group information to a single point (mean). This is strange, especially if
you used fish ID as random factor. There is no information about how these response variables were
recorded.
NO, SPEED AND NND WERE INDIVIDUAL-BASED MEASURES. ALL OF THE FILMS WERE TRACKED AND
THE RESPONSE VARIABLES WERE CALCULATED FROM X,Y CO-ORDINATES (SEE ALSO SI).
e) Speed and mean nearest neighbour distance were transformed. These transformations seem odd.
Why did you need to use two different transformations? It seems that you were trying to find a
transformation until the residuals fit the "normal" distribution. Need to provide a clear justification for
using sqrt and log transformation. What was the shape of the distribution, that warranted the use of
these specific transformations?
SORRY – THIS WAS AN ERROR . SPEED AND NN DISTANCE WERE LOG TRANSFORMED TO MEET THE
BASIC ASSUMPTIONS OF NORMALITY, NOT SQRT TRANSFORMED. WE HAVE CORRECTED THE TEXT
ACCORDINGLY.
f) It was not clear what was done in lines 104-115, and more importantly why was this done? What was
your response variable here? How was the focal individual chosen? How many times and for how long
the correlation between speed and distance was recorded?
IN TERMS OF WHY THIS WAS DONE, THAT’S WHAT IS DESCRIBED IN THE FIRST LINE OF THE
PARAGRAPH – SPECIFICALLY THAT WE ARE MAKING A MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE FISH IN THE SHOALS. I’M NOT SURE WHERE THE CONFUSION ARISES
WITH THIS, BUT IF THE REFEREE COULD CLARIFY WHAT THE PARTICULAR ISSUES WITH THIS ARE,
THEN WE’D BE HAPPY TO RESPOND. IN TERMS OF HOW IT WAS DONE, THIS IS COVERED IN DETAIL IN
THE SI.
MINOR POINTS
L18-19 – This sentence is obvious. If collective movement behavior is the sum of behavioural
interactions, unsurprisingly any factor that affects the interaction will have a direct effect on the
collective movement.
IT MAY BE UNSURPRISING BUT IT IS NECESSARY TO DRAW A LINK BETWEEN THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE
INDIVIDUALS AND THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE GROUP AS A WHOLE.
L23-25 – This is part of major concern 1. I just don’t understand how polarize behaviour within a group
enhance the transmission of social information between the members of the group. By definition
polarization indicates extremes in positions, hence there is no way that dissimilarity within the group
promotes cohesion.
HOPEFULLY WE’VE CLARIFIED THIS MISUNDERSTANDING (SEE ABOVE)
L35 – “Although many theoretical models…” it should have a reference at the end of the sentence
DONE
L39 – 41 – “For example, individuals of many social species behave preferentially to conspecifics…”
needs a reference at the end
DONE
L48 – “Individuals in highly-aligned, polarised groups…” This is simply not possible. Either a group is
polarized or aligned, these are two opposite states (see Wikipedia for definitions).
THIS IS INCORRECT. SEE PREVIOUS COMMENTS
L52 – 53 – “we examined the effect of familiarity on nearest neighbour distance, as a measure of
cohesion, and speed.” There is something odd about this sentence.
CHANGED
L58 – “…females show strong association preferences for familiar individuals…” Needs a reference to
support this statement.
DONE
L62 – Please give dimensions
UNLESS THE EDITOR INSISTS, WE’D PREFER TO KEEP TO VOLUME.
L67 – replace “aquarium” for tanks.
DONE
L67 – How was female body size measured?
INFORMATION ADDED ON THIS
L68 – Please provide dimension of tanks
SEE ABOVE.
L70-71 – Individuals were collected from the same site. Additionally, they were all held together for one
week after arrival at the laboratory – surely this must have affected familiarity.
GUPPIES CAN DEVELOP FAMILIARITY PREFERENCES FOR UP 40 INDIVIDUALS, WHEREAS THERE WERE
MORE THAN THIS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, FAMILIARITY NEEDS REINFORCEMENT THROUGH REGULAR
INTERACTIONS TO BE MAINTAINED. FINALLY, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, ANY EFFECT OF FAMILIARITY
AMONG THE FISH OVER AND ABOVE THAT WHICH WAS DEVELOPED THROUGH OUR MANIPULATION
TREATMENTS WOULD ACT TO REDUCE THE DIFFERENCES THAT WE FOUND, NOT TO ENHANCE THEM.
L73 – You mentioned 6 tanks before
YES, WE HAD SIX TANKS.
L76 – Every measure was given in mm, except this one. Please be consistent
CHANGED
L86 – Why two-time steps, and why did you choose 5 and 30 minutes?
SEE ABOVE
L90-91 – How were these response variables recorded?
WE USED TRACKING SOFTWARE, WHICH PROVIDES X,Y CO-ORDINATES FOR EACH FISH.
L92 – What do you mean by “level of polarization” and how did you measured it?
I DON’T THINK WE USE THIS PHRASE. DETAILS OF HOW WE CALCUALTE POLARISATION ARE INCLUDED
IN THE SI.
L95 - How did you record these variables? During how long (seconds, minutes)? Need to provide more
details about the methodology
SEE ABOVE.
L97 - is this individual ID or tank ID? If individual ID how did you recognize the 4 different individuals?
Also, if you used mean group speed, why using individual ID as random factor?
WE HAVE ADDED TEXT THAT SHOULD CLARIFY THIS
L97 – Given that females are extremely hard to tell apart how did you ensure that the same female was
recorded on time 1 and time 2?
THEY WERE INDIVIDUALLY TAGGED – WE HAVE ADDED INFORMATION ON THIS.
L99 - These transformations seemed odd. Why did you use two different ones? It seems that you were
trying to find a transformation until the residuals fit the "normal" distribution. Need to provide a clear
justification for using sqrt and log transformation. What was the shape of the distribution, that
warranted the use of these specific transformations?
SEE ABOVE.
L101 – Are “error variances” the residuals?
NO. WE’RE SIMPLY TESTING AN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION OF ANOVA (AND SIMILAR LINEAR MODELS)
THAT VARIANCES ARE EQUAL ACROSS GROUPS/SAMPLES.
L101 - This is new to me. Please explain what a box text is
BOX’S TEST ASSESSES THE EQUALITY OF COVARIANCE MATRICES, IN OTHER WORDS TESTING THE
ASSUMPTION THAT THE DEPENDENT VARIABLES FOLLOW A MULTIVARIATE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION.
NONETHELESS, THIS IS PROBABLY EXCESSIVE FOR WHAT WE HAVE, SO WE HAVE REMOVED THIS IN
ANY CASE.
L104 – Replace “between animals” with “within individuals in each group”
INTERACTIONS OCCUR BETWEEN ANIMALS WITHIN GROUPS
L105 - but isn't this the same as polarization? See lines 46-48
BROADLY, YES. POLARISATION IN A GROUP LEVEL MEASURE OF THE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN GROUP
MEMBERS.
L109 - Why didn't you take into account this effect on the previous analysis? See lines 94-95
BECAUSE ONE IS A GROUP LEVEL MEASURE AND THE OTHER IS MEASURED BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS.
L110 – “Directional correlation” is your response variable?
YES.
L107- 115 – How did you select the focal individual? For how long was correlation direction recorded?
Did you recorded in the two time steps? If so, how did you ensure the same focal individual was
recorded on time 1 and time 2?
THE ANIMALS WERE TAGGED. SEE ABOVE.
L107 – 115 – in the absence of males female guppies tend to shoal together (Jon Evans papers). It is
then interesting to know how did you select pairs of individuals if all females (four) were swimming
together?
WE ANALYSED ALL POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS OF PAIRS TO PRODUCE THESE GRAPHS
L112- 115 - This is an extremely convoluted manner to say that you used correlation coefficient to
examine group differences
THIS ISN’T WHAT WE DID.
L119 - 121- does this mean that within individual group differences were greater among familiar
groups?
THANKS. WE HAVE REWORDED THIS TO MAKE IT CLEARER.
L119 – 121 - How could you know if the two females maintained their distance over time. Did you tag
each individual? How long did was the pairs behaviour recorded for?
SEE ABOVE FOR PREVIOUS ANSWERS. WE HAVE REWORDED THIS TO CLARIFY.
L120 - what was your null hypothesis? I assume it was "no difference between groups". If so you may
have failed to detected a difference, or say that groups were different. This is not the same as to say,
"groups did no maintain significantly lower mean nearest..." Just because you did not see a difference,
does not mean there isn't one!
WE HAVE REWORDED THIS SECTION, SEE ABOVE. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THE GROUPS.
L121- How did you record swimming speed? Time/distance? Need to provide more information. It is not
clear to the reader how you did this.
DONE
L124 - Does this mean, + or -? You can have strong correlations of opposing directions. Need to explain
if this was a strong positive correlation or a negative
DONE
L127 - how can familiar groups be more polarized and at the same time more aligned with each other?
By definition, group polarization is the presence of contrasting behaviours/views among individuals in a
group.
POLARISATION IS A MEASURE OF GROUP ALIGNMENT. INDIVIDUALS IN HIGHLY POLARISED GROUPS
ARE ALIGNED WITH ONE ANOTHER
L131 - This mean lower polarization? ie better group coordination in behavioural responses - as defined
on pages 26 and 30 of the introduction?
SEE PREVIOUS ANSWER
L132 - There is a fundamental problem with the definition of polarization.
THIS IS INCORRECT – SEE ABOVE.
L138 - 140- “Polarisation in the familiar groups decreased markedly as the fish habituated to the novel
conditions, so that there was little obvious difference between the treatments during the second
sampling period.” There is published evidence that differences in individual behaviour decrease after 20
minutes. It is therefore not surprising that you detect a homogenization of individual behaviour with and
between groups after 30 minutes.
L140 – 142 - Your results cannot support such statement
I THINK THIS IS LINKED TO THE MISINTERPRETATION OF THE TERM ‘POLARISATION’
L143 – How does this sentence “there was only a weak trend towards greater cohesion in familiar
groups” fit with
L133-134 “movements of fish in familiar shoals were more strongly correlated”
L135-136 “the alignment of fish was greater for a wide range of shoal-mate positions in familiar
shoals”,
L137-138 “fish in familiar shoals show greater co-ordination and more coherent behaviour across the
group than unfamiliar fish”? They seem contradictory.
L154 “… individuals tend to align more strongly with familiar than with unfamiliar”
L154 – “If individuals tend to align more strongly with familiar”, But on line 143 you said the opposite
"there was only a weak trend towards greater cohesion in familiar groups
YES, BUT ALIGNMENT IS DIFFERENT TO COHESION.
Table 1 – What is mean group order? Polarization? If so keep the same terms throughout the text.
Avoids confusion.
DONE
Figure 1 – there is no need to repeat, “Mean (+ standard deviation)” for all variables. Also I assume the
stdev is plus and minus
I CAN SEE THAT IT APPEARS REDUNDANT, BUT GIVEN THAT WE USE BOTH MEANS AND MEDIANS IN
THIS STUDY, I THINK IT’S BETTER TO KEEP IT THIS WAY
Figure 2 and 3 are extremely difficult to comprehend
FAIR ENOUGH, BUT THEY ARE FAIRLY STANDARD TYPES OF PLOTS FOR STUDIES OF COLLECTIVE
MOTION AND I’M NOT SURE HOW WE MIGHT SIMPLIFY THEM.
I hope these comments help improving the clarity of the study. The theme is interesting and the results
novel, hence the study deserves to be published. However, I also think there is still some major points
that need to be addressed before any decision is made.
Looking forward to read a revised version of the manuscript.
All the best
