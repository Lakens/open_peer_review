I find this an interesting paper and I agree that adapting this risk assessment approach to
spillover dynamics from livestock to wildlife could be useful to both researchers and managers.
The chosen case study is also very timely given recent mortality events in the saiga antelope,
which may be caused by infectious disease.
Below I indicate some areas of possible improvement, including where transparency could be
improved.
Line 46 – “The new species may be poorly adapted to the pathogen and lack immunity due to
having no previous exposure.” This statement conflates adaptation and immunity, please
separate. Moreover, being ‘poorly adapted’ as a host for a particular pathogen could make
animals less, rather than more susceptible.
47 – What was the mechanism of these outbreaks and how does it relate to the previous point?
3
77 – please give reference for the two components of risk: I have also seen definitions with the
three components hazard, exposure and severity.
101 – and vice versa
125 – confusing to label species A and B when later risk path steps are A, B, etc.
138 – add reference for Delphi method
149-153 – it is somewhat unclear how matrices are combined and values selected. Usually,
probabilities would be multiplied but here a qualitative not a quantitative approach is used and I
guess this is why lowest and highest values are selected when combining matrices. Nevertheless,
it would be helpful to point this out, and to make clear that (line 153) the lowest value from B1
and B2 is chosen and carried forward to B3. Moreover, why should the highest value in B3 be
selected for the final likelihood in step B, when the cells contain values that represent contact
scenarios that could occur concurrently? Is this a matter of focusing on the highest risk and
ignoring the others? This should be made explicit either way.
163 – mapping – I would expect some commentary here on the appropriate spatial scale to use
and at what spatial resolution the matrices should be applied. Is the whole risk assessment
duplicated for different parts of the range and then somehow combined, or are spatial
considerations channelled into one overarching set of risk matrices and pathway? I think the
former but it is not at all clear. Additionally, how are seasonal factors taken into account here,
including seasonal migration and climatic factors on pathogen transmission? These are picked
out as key difficulties in the intro and I do not see how they have been addressed in the mapping
section.
220-232 – again, specific data sources are mentioned but I do not see the results of these exercises,
or how they were converted into likelihoods, broken down anywhere, beyond listing expert-
specific matrices in the ESM. The authors are asking for a lot of trust from the reader on how
inputs to the risk model were derived. I appreciate that some fudge will be needed for a
qualitative model with diverse inputs. However, I fear that lack of transparency could undermine
the credibility of this approach, especially with managers unused to, and sceptical of modelling.
For this section I would like to see the results of literature review and expert elicitation laid bare,
e.g. in additional supplementary materials, to more fully support the judgements made on
likelihoods.
266 – There is a strong risk of circularity when comparing model predictions with observed
disease outbreaks – experts who are aware of past events of spill-over for particular pathogens
will perhaps return a higher likelihood for events in the risk pathway. This is difficult to avoid
(although sensitivity analysis might selectively remove different sources of information in turn to
assess how influential they are on the outcome), but should at least be acknowledged. Risk of
expert bias is mentioned around line 294, but not in relation to systematic bias. Both brucellosis
and FMD are high profile diseases and I would expect them to have been more studied (hence
higher chance of recorded spillover) and for experts to be more aware of them (hence higher
ascribed risks).
299 – I agree that an uncertainty analysis should be done, but in that case why are results
reported so sketchily here and not discussed with respect to the system in hand? There is an
uncertainty matrix in ESM but no specific discussion in the text.
Other parts of discussion – how does the assessment differ from previous work on FMDV
4
spillover risk to Saiga tatarica in Betpak-Dala (Morgan, Lundervold et al Biol Conserv 2006, 131,
244)? This is simply too pertinent to their ultimate high-risk disease not to demand comparison.
Figs:
Table of matrix B1 – why is the upper time limit 3 months? Some pathogens can persist in the
environment for much longer than this.
Risk diagram – why are distances of 80km and 15km chosen for camels and other livestock and
how does this relate to distances for the saiga?
Maps – study area boundary does not appear. Some discussion of what underpins the seasonality
of risk would also be useful in the text.
ESM – perhaps label the matrices as B1, B2 and B3 to tie in with methods section in text.

label_version_2
RSOS-170197
This manuscript describes a systematic way of thinking about the risks of
infections spreading between species here, specifically, for thinking about the
spread of infections concerning wildlife species.
Overall, the manuscript is, to my taste, rather repetitive and imprecise. For an
example of the imprecision, “infection” and “disease” are very largely used
interchangeably, when they are not, since one can be infected, but not have
disease. As another example, line 135 talks about “risk category”, but the
directly relevant Table 1 talks about “Likelihood Category” – are these the
same things? (In passing, the Tables aren’t clearly numbered.) Also, lines 76-
79 appear to define “risk management”, but then lines 81-83 do this again, but
differently. For an example of the repetitiveness, lines 67-74 largely repeats
what has been said before.
The meat of the idea presented in this manuscript begins on page 6 – this all
seems reasonable and correct, but it does seem rather intuitive to me. I would
suggest this paper to the authors, since it delves rather deeper into some of
the aspects the authors consider here; McCallum et al, (2017) Breaking beta:
deconstructing the parasite transmission function. Philosophical Transactions
of the Royal Society of London Series B, 372, 20160084. The authors’
framework is then applied to the case of saiga antelopes, which is then used
to produce qualitative predictions on the risk of the spread of certain infections
into saiga.
The text says (page 21) that what is presented here is a development of a pre-
existing approach, but it is not clear to me what is new or different in the current
work.
The format of the manuscript is rather odd. There is a “Main Text” with various
sections, but then a “Results” section on page 12, with a “Conclusion” a page
later.
Overall, the actual content of the paper is not unreasonable, but I don’t think
that it is a strong competitor for space in this journal, especially given the need
for greater attention to detail and the lack of clarity as I have highlighted.
Minor points
Line 46. What is the “new” species? Also, what is meant by “Lack of
immunity”?
Line 57. What is meant by “manifest hidden problems”, and if they are
manifest, then surely they are not hidden?
Line 58. To what does “This” refer? Ditto for line 88.
Line 87 refers to “risk assessment”, but shouldn’t this be risk “management”
to match the preceding text.
Line 88. I don’t know what “robust scientific instrument” means?
Line 127. I don’t understand “risk outcome (exposure)”.
Line 133. This says step 2, but shouldn’t it be step B?
Line 135. This says “risk”, but shouldn’t it say “likelihood”?
Lines 146 and 149. I’m unclear about the two matrices referred to here.
Line 235. I don’t understand “A single likelihood” here.
Line 274. Why just antibodies, since there are many other mechanisms of
immunity?
Line 277. “Health” monitoring isn’t quite the same as sero-surveys, for
analogous reason to my comment above about infection and disease.
In Table 1 (page 15) for the line “High”, in the right hand column, shouldn’t it
be “probable” rather than “a possibility”?
There are no Figure legends, so I’m rather unclear what was going on in some
of them.

This manuscript describes a systematic way of thinking about the risks of infections
spreading between species here, specifically, for thinking about the spread of infections
concerning wildlife species.
Overall, the manuscript is, to my taste, rather repetitive and imprecise.
Response:
Thank you for your suggestions. We have restructured and rewritten accordingly.
Specifically we have:
1. Focussed on the Betpak-dala saiga case study and removed the separate
description of the generic model framework, to eliminate repetition.
2. Edited the text to further eliminate repetition and improve precision.
3. Re-evaluated terminology and definitions to improve precision.
4. Re-structured to conform to the conventional structure: Introduction, Methods,
Results & Discussion.
For an example of the imprecision, “infection” and “disease” are very largely used interchangeably,
when they
are not, since one can be infected, but not have disease.
Response:
We use the word disease to describe symptoms resulting from infection (i.e. both infection
and symptoms must occur to produce disease). We are interested in both infection (which
can result in transmission even without disease) and disease, and do not intend to use these
terms interchangeably. For clarity, we have defined these terms in the manuscript and given
a reference for the definitions (Lines 182-4). We have also attempted to improve the precision
when using these terms, in numerous places in the manuscript (e.g. Line 62).
As another example, line 135
talks about “risk category”, but the directly relevant Table 1 talks about “Likelihood
Category” – are these the same things?
Response:
We have replaced the term “risk category” with “likelihood category” (Line 335).
(In passing, the Tables aren’t clearly numbered.)
Response: the table numbers (Table 1 and Table 2, also referred to as such in the text) and
titles are below each table. We have moved the tables and labels to the location in the text
where they are referred to, and added table captions at the end of the manuscript to expand
on the table labels.
Also, lines 76-79 appear to define “risk management”, but then lines 81-83 do this again,
but differently.
Response: these two explanations are not mutually exclusive. We have combined the two
sections and clarified how they link together. We have also added a reference. (Lines 102-6)
For an example of the repetitiveness, lines 67-74 largely repeats what has
been said before.
Response: the introduction has been re-structured and sections deleted to remove repetition.
The meat of the idea presented in this manuscript begins on page 6 – this all seems
reasonable and correct, but it does seem rather intuitive to me.
I would suggest this paper
to the authors, since it delves rather deeper into some of the aspects the authors consider
here; McCallum et al, (2017) Breaking beta: deconstructing the parasite transmission
function. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series B, 372,
20160084. The authors’ framework is then applied to the case of saiga antelopes, which is
then used to produce qualitative predictions on the risk of the spread of certain infections
into saiga.
The text says (page 21) that what is presented here is a development of a pre-existing
approach, but it is not clear to me what is new or different in the current work.
Response: Thank you for your suggestions. We have restructured this section to focus on
our case study, using the model framework. We feel that it is a strength of our approach that
it is intuitively correct, because risk assessment needs to be understood by researchers from
different disciplines for them to provide valid expert opinion and interpret results and by risk
managers who need to have confidence in the results to make risk management decisions.
We accept that we were not fully explicit about the novelty of our approach and have tried to
be clearer about the importance of different elements of the approach, in the introduction
(specifically lines 116-127), methods and discussion. We have read the suggested reference.
A key different between this paper and our approach (that we have attempted to make clearer
in the revised manuscript) is that we are dealing with a system with much more fundamental
epistemic uncertainties – in fact, we feel it would be unrealistic to attempt to quantify
transmission given the lack of knowledge of the system. Instead, our approach can be used
to rank potential risks when there are large knowledge gaps such as “is a pathogen present
in the country, let alone the specific geographical area that the species inhabits or the
species itself?” and “is the wildlife species likely to be susceptible to infection by the
pathogen, given that there are no published documents that can be used to directly confirm
or refute this.”
The format of the manuscript is rather odd. There is a “Main Text” with various sections,
but then a “Results” section on page 12, with a “Conclusion” a page later.
Response: Thank you for identifying this. We have addressed this comment by reverting to
“Introduction”, “Methods”, “Results” and “Discussion” sections.
Overall, the actual content of the paper is not unreasonable, but I don’t think that it is a
strong competitor for space in this journal, especially given the need for greater attention
to detail and the lack of clarity as I have highlighted.
Response:
Having addressed the attention to detail and lack of clarity, we feel that this paper is now a
strong competitor, firstly because management of critically endangered wildlife is of
importance to ecologists and the wider scientific community, but also because it provides a
framework for addressing risk questions where high levels of epistemic uncertainty,
stochasticity and natural variation are present. These issues are widely acknowledged in a
wide range of scientific policy fields, as well as management of critically endangered wildlife.
Minor points
Line 46. What is the “new” species? Also, what is meant by “Lack of immunity”?
Response: This section is now deleted.
Line 57. What is meant by “manifest hidden problems”, and if they are manifest, then
surely they are not hidden?
Response: This has been clarified as follows: “may be affected by hidden problems, such as
infertility,”
Line 58. To what does “This” refer? Ditto for line 88.
Response: This has been clarified as follows: “They may also spread infection further, which
is a problem for both wildlife conservationists and farmers”
Line 87 refers to “risk assessment”, but shouldn’t this be risk “management” to match the
preceding text.
Response: Risk, risk assessment and risk management have all been defined by other
authors. We have clarified the terms and given references (Lines 102-6)
Line 88. I don’t know what “robust scientific instrument” means?
Response: we have clarified as follows: “accepted as a valid scientific method to be used for
trade negotiations”
Line 127. I don’t understand “risk outcome (exposure)”.
Response: we have clarified as follows: “the outcome of interest (i.e. exposure of saiga to the
pathogen)”
Line 133. This says step 2, but shouldn’t it be step B?
Response: this has been corrected.
Line 135. This says “risk”, but shouldn’t it say “likelihood”?
Response: this has been corrected.
Lines 146 and 149. I’m unclear about the two matrices referred to here.
Response: the methods section has been re-written and this section should now be clearer
(Lines 219-247)
Line 235. I don’t understand “A single likelihood” here.
Response: this text has been deleted in the editing process.
Line 274. Why just antibodies, since there are many other mechanisms of immunity?
Response: the word “antibodies” has been replaced with “immunity”.
Line 277. “Health” monitoring isn’t quite the same as sero-surveys, for analogous reason
to my comment above about infection and disease.
Response: the clause (e.g. serosurveys) has been deleted
In Table 1 (page 15) for the line “High”, in the right hand column, shouldn’t it be “probable”
rather than “a possibility”?
Response: the wording is taken directly from the reference and is what was used to gather
expert opinion. We believe that it is comprehensible and it would be misleading to change it
after conducting the research.
There are no Figure legends, so I’m rather unclear what was going on in some of them.
Response: Apologies for this. The figure legends have been added to the manuscript.
Comments to the Author(s)
I find this an interesting paper and I agree that adapting this risk assessment approach to
spillover dynamics from livestock to wildlife could be useful to both researchers and managers.
The chosen case study is also very timely given recent mortality events in the saiga antelope,
which may be caused by infectious disease.
Response: thank you for your comments and suggestions. Taking into account all
reviewers comments, we have re-structured and edited the paper to improve clarity and
precision.
Below I indicate some areas of possible improvement, including where transparency could be
improved.
Line 46 – “The new species may be poorly adapted to the pathogen and lack immunity due to
having no previous exposure.” This statement conflates adaptation and immunity, please
separate. Moreover, being ‘poorly adapted’ as a host for a particular pathogen could make
animals less, rather than more susceptible.
Response: this section has been deleted in the re-write.
47 – What was the mechanism of these outbreaks and how does it relate to the previous
point?
Response: this section has been deleted in the re-write.
77 – please give reference for the two components of risk: I have also seen definitions with the
three components hazard, exposure and severity.
Response: amended as suggested (Line 100)
101 – and vice versa
Response: amended as suggested (Line 76)
125 – confusing to label species A and B when later risk path steps are A, B, etc.
Response: this wording has been deleted in the re-write.
138 – add reference for Delphi method
Response: the Delphi method is no longer mentioned as we re-wrote to focus only on
the methods specific to our case study.
149-153 – it is somewhat unclear how matrices are combined and values selected. Usually,
probabilities would be multiplied but here a qualitative not a quantitative approach is used and I
guess this is why lowest and highest values are selected when combining matrices.
Nevertheless, it would be helpful to point this out, and to make clear that (line 153) the lowest
value from B1 and B2 is chosen and carried forward to B3. Moreover, why should the highest
value in B3 be selected for the final likelihood in step B, when the cells contain values that
represent contact scenarios that could occur concurrently? Is this a matter of focusing on the
highest risk and ignoring the others? This should be made explicit either way.
Response: this section has been re-written (Lines 219-247) and now addresses these
questions.
163 – mapping – I would expect some commentary here on the appropriate spatial scale to
use and at what spatial resolution the matrices should be applied. Is the whole risk
assessment duplicated for different parts of the range and then somehow combined, or are
spatial considerations channelled into one overarching set of risk matrices and pathway? I
think the former but it is not at all clear. Additionally, how are seasonal factors taken into
account here, including seasonal migration and climatic factors on pathogen transmission?
These are picked out as key difficulties in the intro and I do not see how they have been
addressed in the mapping section.
Response: this section has been re-written (Lines 292-329) and now addresses these
questions. The likelihood pathways are firstly classified by likelihood separately for
each season. The maps of locations of both saiga and each livestock species are also
produced by season. The pathway likelihoods are then combined with the likelihood
maps using the combining rule (the lowest of the two likelihoods applies) to produce
final likelihood maps. The resolution of the final maps is dependent on the resolution of
the maps of locations of both saiga and each livestock species. Kernel smoothing was
used to eliminate hard boundaries between likelihood categories.
220-232 – again, specific data sources are mentioned but I do not see the results of these
exercises, or how they were converted into likelihoods, broken down anywhere, beyond listing
expert-specific matrices in the ESM. The authors are asking for a lot of trust from the reader on
how inputs to the risk model were derived. I appreciate that some fudge will be needed for a
qualitative model with diverse inputs. However, I fear that lack of transparency could
undermine the credibility of this approach, especially with managers unused to, and sceptical
of modelling. For this section I would like to see the results of literature review and expert
elicitation laid bare, e.g. in additional supplementary materials, to more fully support the
judgements made on likelihoods.
Response: This section has been re-written with more detail (Lines 249-262) and a
reference is given to the location in the ESM for each likelihood and uncertainty
classification (all of which are included in the ESM). We also amended the ESM by
adding labels to sections indicating likelihood steps by letter (A-C).
266 – There is a strong risk of circularity when comparing model predictions with observed
disease outbreaks – experts who are aware of past events of spill-over for particular
pathogens will perhaps return a higher likelihood for events in the risk pathway. This is difficult
to avoid (although sensitivity analysis might selectively remove different sources of information
in turn to assess how influential they are on the outcome), but should at least be
acknowledged. Risk of expert bias is mentioned around line 294, but not in relation to
systematic bias. Both brucellosis and FMD are high profile diseases and I would expect them
to have been more studied (hence higher chance of recorded spillover) and for experts to be
more aware of them (hence higher ascribed risks).
Response: Bias is now discussed in more detail (Lines 420-446).
299 – I agree that an uncertainty analysis should be done, but in that case why are results
reported so sketchily here and not discussed with respect to the system in hand? There is an
uncertainty matrix in ESM but no specific discussion in the text.
Response: Thank you for this comment. We have expanded our discussion of
uncertainty in the results (Lines 363-381) and discussion (Lines 439-446).
Other parts of discussion – how does the assessment differ from previous work on FMDV
spillover risk to Saiga tatarica in Betpak-Dala (Morgan, Lundervold et al Biol Conserv 2006,
131, 244)? This is simply too pertinent to their ultimate high-risk disease not to demand
comparison.
Response: We have now included this paper in our discussion (Line 395).
Figs:
Table of matrix B1 – why is the upper time limit 3 months? Some pathogens can persist in the
environment for much longer than this.
Response: An upper time limit of 3 months was chosen because each season (defined
as 3-month periods) was assessed separately. It is a limitation of this approach that a
pathogen that persists for longer than 3 months in the environment may still be spread
from livestock to saiga over a longer time period. However, we believe that in most
cases transmission would be less likely to occur after the pathogen has been present in
the environment for 3 months, firstly because the pathogen would be less likely to
survive, and secondly because saiga are less likely to be present in the same area as
livestock beyond 3 months (for climatic reasons). The discussion has been amended to
include this (Lines 452-463 )
Risk diagram – why are distances of 80km and 15km chosen for camels and other livestock
and how does this relate to distances for the saiga?
Response: These distances were chosen based on observations and first-hand
knowledge of the authors. They are the distances that livestock are expected to roam
during the day from the villages where their owners are. The saiga distributions are
estimated differently – from satellite collar data. This has been clarified (Lines 316-321).
Maps – study area boundary does not appear. Some discussion of what underpins the
seasonality of risk would also be useful in the text.
Response: to clarify the study area boundary, we have created a new map showing the
study area in context (now Figure 4). The methods have been clarified to explain the
effects of seasonality that are considered, specifically: (1) geolocations of saiga; (2)
geolocations of livestock and (3) likelihoods of pathogen excretion and survival in the
environment.
ESM – perhaps label the matrices as B1, B2 and B3 to tie in with methods section in text.
Response: Thank you for this helpful suggestion, which we have followed.
