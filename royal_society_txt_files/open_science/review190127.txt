The manuscript by Sun et al., describes an experiment where 40 mice divided into groups of ten
and then fed either control, 10%, 20%, or 30% A. adenophora in the form of a pelleted diet for 42
days. At the end of the study, the mice were sacrificed, spleens removed, and assays were
performed.
Comments:
Introduction
General comment: What motivated the investigators to test pyroptosis? More detail would be
helpful to understand why the work was performed. Perhaps this could be used to better
organize the introduction.
Line 32, what regions worldwide?
Line 33, what is a grave impact? More detail please.
Line 36-40, please provide more detail about each species and what pathology this plant causes.
Lines 64-65, Due to the lack of detail I cannot assess the validity of the statement “that it is
unclear whether the toxic effects of A. adenophora on splenocyte involve pyroptosis.”
Materials and methods
General comment, for the sake of the reader who isn’t an immunologist please try to limit your
use of abbreviations or at least define them. Maybe a sentence or two about what a technique
does. For example, what is cell quest software?
Line 79-81, How exactly was the plant material stored? Was a voucher specimen obtained and
deposited in a herbarium? How exactly was this plant material incorporated in to a pellet? Was
a chemical characterization of this plant material performed?
Line 152, what exactly is “mechanical method”?
Lines 154 – 158, The authors describe an ANOVA but no post-test. Why wasn’t a post-test used?
Results
The authors should consider combining the results and discussion section to guide the reader
through the data. This would allow for greater detail. For example, how exactly is NRRP3 an
immune system damage sensor?
The authors mention dose-dependency, a chemical characterization of the plant material and
specific concentrations of plant compounds would provide greater support to this statement.
Discussion
The authors set out to investigate if A. adenophora causes oxidative stress and pyroptosis. A
figure illustrating the pyroptocic pathway and a point by point discussion of this pathway with
regard to the experimental results would improve the discussion.

The authors present an interesting study of the spleen toxicity caused by Ageratina adenophora.
This work provided a new insight into the mechanism of the toxicity of A. adenophora in a mice
model. I agree to publish by Royal Society Open Science. But I have some comments:
1. Line 20: “Glutathione peroxidase” should be abbreviated to GPx. And abbreviations should be
unified in line 94, 162 and 218.
2. The manuscript has some grammatical issues, and the authors should correct and improve
them. The tenses of sentences should be consistent. Such as in lines 17-20, “the decrease…”
should be corrected as “decreased the …”
3. Lines 113: space should be between number and unit. Same errors should corrected in Figure 6.
4. Line 75: The source format of reagent is generally expressed as “city, province and country”,
however, the sentence of line 75 lacks “province”.
5. Line 123: replace “µl” with “µL”.
6. Lines 190-191: What are “20% and 30% groups”?
7. Line 212: Please correct the expression of this sentence.
8. Although the manuscript is generally written clearly. Pay attention to minor errors. For Figure
5 caption, some words misspelled, which is confusing to read.
9. In figure 3A, high resolution picture should be used so that the reader could see the data
clearly.
10. There are some unscientific expression. For instance, the “p” in line 199, 201 and 201 should be
expressed in italics. The whole Ms should be revised.
11. Please modify the format of references according to magazine’s requirements.

The article is very interesting, and demonstrates the mechanisms involving the toxic effects of
Ageratina adenofora in the spleen of treated mice. Some considerations should be examined.
In the abstract the authors stated that the data indicate that A. adenofora impairs spleen function,
however there is no evidences for this, despite the oxidative stress and pyroptosis. Maybe change
the word indicate by suggest.
Please confirm the age of mice - 48 weeks?

Dear editors,
Thank you for your kind comments on our manuscript entitled “Ageratina adenophora causes
spleen toxicity by inducing oxidative stress and pyroptosis in mice”. Those comments are all
valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our paper. We have studied the comments
carefully and have revised the manuscript according to the reviews’ comments and suggestions.
Revised portion are marked in red in the paper.

Reviewer 1:
Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript by Sun et al., describes an experiment where 40 mice divided into groups of ten
and then fed either control, 10%, 20%, or 30% A. adenophora in the form of a pelleted diet for 42
days. At the end of the study, the mice were sacrificed, spleens removed, and assays were
performed. Comments:
Introduction
General comment: What motivated the investigators to test pyroptosis? More detail would be
helpful to understand why the work was performed. Perhaps this could be used to better organize
the introduction.
Response: We have detailed our motives to test pyroptosis in lines 62-66: “However, apoptosis is
a form of cell death that avoid causing inflammation. This discrepancy might indicated a new cell
death involved in the process of inflammation caused by A. adenophora. Pyroptosis is a
pro-inflammatory form of regulated cell death, which regards as a general immune effector in in
multiple cells. Although several studies have investigate the mechanism of toxicity induced by A.
adenophora. The toxic effects of A. adenophora on splenocyte involve pyroptosis and oxidative
damage still unknown.”
Line 32, what regions worldwide?
Response: We have revised in lines 27-28:“Ageratina adenophora (A. adenophora), also known
as Eupatorium adenophorum, is a highly invasive weed species native to Mexico and Costa Rica,
and has successfully invaded habitats across Europe, Oceania and Asia”.
Line 33, what is a grave impact? More detail please.
Response: We have revised in lines 29-31: “The southwest provinces of China are one of the
worst affected regions, where A. adenophora reduces the biomass of other plants by altering the
soil microbial community in the invaded areas. The invasion of A. adenophora to grassland
indirectly leads to the reduction of the number of grazing animals and local plants, and the loss of
biodiversity.”
Line 36-40, please provide more detail about each species and what pathology this plant causes.
Response: We have revised in lines 31-43: “In addition, A. adenophora is highly toxic to animals
and affects multiple organs. For example, ingestion of this weed causes respiratory disease in
horses. Intragastric administration of the freeze-dried leaf powder or methanol extract of A.
adenophora resulted in multiple focal parenchymal necrosis and liver degeneration in mice. Rats
fed with chow containing 25% (w/w) freeze-dried A. adenophora leaf powder developed jaundice,
characterized by increased levels of plasma bilirubin, ALP, ALT and AST. Furthermore,
rumination suspension and photosensitization have been caused in cattle. The toxic effects of A.
adenophora ingestion on the liver, spleen and kidney of goat have also been demonstrated, with
dose-dependent apoptosis and autophagy seen in goat tissues. A study have demonstrated that A.
adenophora induced significant mice oxidative stress characterized by up-regulating mRNA levels
of antioxidants, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH).
Consistent with this, our previous study has approved that = 20% dose of A. adenophora
increased the liver weight and caused extensive inflammation, in addition to decreasing
antioxidant activity, increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) .”
Lines 64-65, Due to the lack of detail I cannot assess the validity of the statement “that it is
unclear whether the toxic effects of A. adenophora on splenocyte involve pyroptosis.”
Response: We have revised this statement in lines 62-66 to clarify the purpose to investigate
pyroptosis, which may be a new mechanism involved in the toxic effects caused by A. adenophora
Materials and methods
General comment, for the sake of the reader who isn’t an immunologist please try to limit your use
of abbreviations or at least define them. Maybe a sentence or two about what a technique does.
For example, what is cell quest software?
Response: In “Materials and methods” section, we have detailed the abbreviation of
immunological related factors. Moreover, additional explanations are given for the techniques
used in this study.
Line 79-81, How exactly was the plant material stored? Was a voucher specimen obtained and
deposited in a herbarium?
Response: We have revised in lines 81-83: “The collected leaves were cleaned, grounded and
screened to make dry power. The power was stored in shade condition with ambient temperature
at 20±2 <U+2103>.” A. adenophora specimen is not deposited in a herbarium but in our lab.
How exactly was this plant material incorporated in to a pellet?
Response: We have revised in lines 83-85: “For the preparation of 10%, 20% and 30% diet pellet,
A. adenophora and mice feed were homogenized in water solution by the ratio of 1:9, 1:8 and 1:7,
respectively. Then the diet was cast in the form of cylinders and dried at 27 <U+2103> for 48 h.”
Was a chemical characterization of this plant material performed?
Response: Plant material chemical characterization was not performed in this study. But the major
active compound related to A. adenophora was researched by our lab in previous study. The detail
information could be obtain from the papers entitled “Anti-NDV activity of
9-oxo10,11-dehydroageraphorone extracted from Eupatorium adenophorum Spreng in vitro”,
“Clinical efficacy of 9-oxo-10,11-dehydroageraphorone extracted from Eupatorium adenophorum
against Psoroptes cuniculi in rabbits” et al.
Line 152, what exactly is “mechanical method”?
Response: We have revised in line 132: “The spleen in each group was collected and ground into
power by liquid nitrogen in a mortar.”
Lines 154-158, The authors describe an ANOVA but no post-test. Why wasn’t a post-test used?
Response: It is helpful for understanding the results of this work by a post-test. And we have
revised in Figure1-4 and 7. In addition, the descriptions of result have been corrected in Figure
legends.
Results
The authors should consider combining the results and discussion section to guide the reader
through the data. This would allow for greater detail. For example, how exactly is NRRP3 an
immune system damage sensor?
Response: Lines 178-179, “To test the effects of A. adenophora on pyroptosis pathway in vivo,
we measured the protein levels of pyroptosis-related factors.” was added in the result section. And
we have detailed information in lines 218-223: “Inflammasomes are assembled by sensing a
variety of tissue injury signals. Diverse stimuli could promote the release of inflammatory
cytokines, including IL-1ß. NLRP3 is currently the best characterized one, which plays an
important role in the immune system as damage sensor. In addition, NLRP3 can also sense and be
activated by ROS produced in the cell. It is known that GSDMD is a key pyrotosis executor[48].
GSDMD can be cleaved into GSDMD-N and GADMD-C by caspase-1. GSDMD-N promotes cell
lysis and IL-1ß release through forming pores by binding to cell membrane. Inflammasomes are
assembled by sensing a variety of tissue injury signals. Diverse stimuli could promote the release
of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1ß. NLRP3 is currently the best characterized one, which
plays an important role in the immune system as damage sensor. In addition, NLRP3 can also
sense and be activated by ROS produced in the cell. It is known that GSDMD is a key pyrotosis
executor[48]. GSDMD can be cleaved into GSDMD-N and GADMD-C by caspase-1. GSDMD-N
promotes cell lysis and IL-1ß release through forming pores by binding to cell membrane.”
The authors mention dose-dependency, a chemical characterization of the plant material and
specific concentrations of plant compounds would provide greater support to this statement.
Response: A. adenophora was ground to uniform power and then homogenized with feed to
produce different levels of diet. The results showed that the degree of oxidative stress and
pyroptosis aggravated with the increased levels of A. adenophora-administration. Plant material
chemical characterization was not performed in this study, but could be found in our previous
studies related to study on the biological properties of active compounds from Ageratina
adenophora (Title: Euptox A induces G1 arrest and autophagy via p38 MAPK- and
PI3K/Akt/mTOR-mediated pathways in mouse splenocytes).
Discussion
The authors set out to investigate if A. adenophora causes oxidative stress and pyroptosis. A
figure illustrating the pyroptosic pathway and a point by point discussion of this pathway with
regard to the experimental results would improve the discussion.
Response: A schematic diagram of A. adenophora causes oxidative stress and pyroptosis (Figure
8) was added in this revised version manuscript. It will be helpful for understanding pyroptosic
pathway. And we have revised the discussion section in lines 218-223: “Inflammasomes are
assembled by sensing a variety of tissue injury signals. Diverse stimuli could promote the release
of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1ß. NLRP3 is currently the best characterized one, which
plays an important role in the immune system as damage sensor. In addition, NLRP3 can also

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors present an interesting study of the spleen toxicity caused by Ageratina adenophora.
This work provided a new insight into the mechanism of the toxicity of A. adenophora in a mice
model. I agree to publish by Royal Society Open Science. But I have some comments:
1. Line 20: “Glutathione peroxidase” should be abbreviated to GPx. And abbreviations should
be unified in line 94, 162 and 218.
Response: We have revised the abbreviation of “Glutathione peroxidase” in the manuscript in line
46, 96, 157, 165, 204-206, 534 and 539, respectively.
2. The manuscript has some grammatical issues, and the authors should correct and improve them.
The tenses of sentences should be consistent. Such as in lines 17-20, “the decrease…” should be
corrected as “decreased the …”
Response: We have performed an extensive editorial revision on the manuscript to enhance
expression, grammar constructions and word spelling. And we have revised the manuscript in
lines 17-19:“A. adenophora significantly increased the levels of reactive oxygen species, and
malondialdehyde, but decreased the antioxidants like catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione
and glutathione peroxidase.”
3. Lines 113: space should be between number and unit. Same errors should corrected in Figure 6.
Response: We have revised in lines 113 and Figure 6.
4. Line 75: The source format of reagent is generally expressed as “city, province and country”,
however, the sentence of line 75 lacks “province”.
Response: We have revised in line 76: “Biochemical assay kits were obtained from Nanjing
Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, Jiang Su, China).”
5. Line 123: replace “µl” with “µL”.
Response: We have replaced “µl” with “µL” in line 120:“In brief, 20 mg spleen tissue was lysised
on ice in 200 µL buffer for 30 min.”
6. Lines 190-191: What are “20% and 30% groups”?
Response: 20% and 30% groups represent group B and C, respectively. We have revised in lines
181-182: “At the same time, the protein level of NF-<U+03BA>B was higher in the group B and C than those
in the control group.”
7. Line 212: Please correct the expression of this sentence.
Response: We have revised the expression in lines 199-200: “In the present study, we found that A.
adenophora enhanced splenocyte ROS levels in a dose-dependent manner, which were coincided
with MDA levels.”
8. Although the manuscript is generally written clearly. Pay attention to minor errors. For Figure 5
caption, some words misspelled, which is confusing to read.
Response: We have revised the misspelled word “in sute” with “in situ” in lines 564-565:“In situ
IL-1ß expression in the control group (E), group A (F), group B (G), group C (H).”
9. In figure 3A, high resolution picture should be used so that the reader could see the data clearly.
Response: We have adjusted the figure 3A resolution to 600 dpi.
10. There are some unscientific expression. For instance, the “p” in line 199, 201 and 201 should
be expressed in italics. The whole Ms should be revised.
Response: We have corrected the “p” as “p” in the whole manuscript.
11. Please modify the format of references according to magazine’s requirements.
Response: For the reference format within the article, we are sorry for our incorrect citation format.
And in this revised version, we have corrected all the reference formats to meet the requirements of
Royal Society Open Science.
Special thanks to you for your good comments.

Comments to the Author(s)
The article is very interesting, and demonstrates the mechanisms involving the toxic effects of
Ageratina adenofora in the spleen of treated mice. Some considerations should be examined.
In the abstract the authors stated that the data indicate that A. adenofora impairs spleen function,
however there is no evidences for this, despite the oxidative stress and pyroptosis. Maybe change
the word indicate by suggest.
Response: Considering the reviewer’s suggestion, we have revised in lines 22-23:“These findings
suggest that A. adenophora impairs spleen function in mice through oxidative stress damage and
pyroptosis.”
Please confirm the age of mice - 48 weeks?
Response: We are very sorry for our incorrect writing “forty eight-week-old mice”. A total of 40
eight-week-old mice were used in this study. So we have revised in lines 87-88:“Forty 8-week-old
female Kunming mice purchased from Experimental Animal Corporation of Dossy Biological
Technology Company”
Thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.
Thanks again for the excellent and professional revision of our manuscript. Hopefully, we could
have our article been considered of publication in this journal. Should there been any other
corrections we could make, please feel free to contact us by email. My email is
