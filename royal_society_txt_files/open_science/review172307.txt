The study aims to make inferences about the feeding ecology of plesiosaurs based on osteological
range of motion of neck vertebrae. The authors used 3D models derived from CT scans to assess
range of motion in the plesiosaur Nichollssaura borealis. The functional morphology of the neck
in plesiosaurs is an interesting problem because no similar animals exist today. The methods
improve upon previous investigations by directly measuring three-dimensional ranges of motion.
I commend the authors for validating their methods using x-rays of an extant reptile, and for
their careful consideration of statistical methods. The study provides valuable information for
paleontologists and functional morphologists.
I have a few concerns about the methodology. The main concern relates to trials 1 and 2, the
rationale for them, and why the results are so different. I don't fully understand why the first trial
was conducted, and I am confused as to why it yielded different results from the second trial.
From the supplementary information, it is clear that there is as much difference between trials in
the same direction as there is between different directions. As I understand it, the procedure was
identical except that multiple vertebral segments were present in Maya in the first trial, which
was expected to increase error (page 6, lines 32- 39). What is the benefit of having this trial? And
why do you suppose the results of the two are so different? Did you consider estimating observer
error, perhaps by repeating the measurements several times?
My second concern is that the models underestimated dorsal mobility in the varanid. One would
expect a bones-only model to overestimate mobility, if anything. This is a very interesting result,
but I feel like it's kind of glossed over. How do you suppose it is possible for the vertebrae to
move beyond their supposed osteological limits? I would guess it has to do with more
complicated movements, specifically some combination of rotation and translation. Can you
replicate this behavior in silico? What implications might this have for your conclusions about
plesiosaur behavior?
I also have some questions about the rationale for the methods used:
1. Did the authors consider placing the center of rotation in a different location? Some references
have shown a more dorsally located center of rotation (e.g., Samagh et al. “New Method for
Determining Apparent Axial Center of Rotation of Lumbar and Thoracic Spine Segments.” The
Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development 48, no. 5 (2011): 587–96.
https://doi.org/10.1682/JRRD.2010.09.0168.). Please justify this choice.
2. "Maximum articulation is defined as the end of manipulation where bone-on-bone contact
between two cervical vertebrae has occurred." What about disarticulation of zygapophyseal
joints? Was there a minimum amount of zygapophyseal overlap maintained?
3. "This third trial allows us to bracket the possible range of motion of the neck of N. borealis
between zero intervertebral space and what is preserved." Isn't it possible that the soft tissue
shrank prior to fossilization, and that the space in life was larger than that preserved? I'd like to
see the results with more space added. Also, approximately how much were the vertebrae moved
between trials 2 and 3 (i.e., how much space was removed)? And what kind of articulation is
present between the centra - is it proceolous, amphiceolous, amphiplateous?
3
The results are well presented, but I'd like to see data on regional differences as well. These are
already included in the supplementary info, so it seems strange that they are not discussed at all.
I agree that trying to correlate regional morphology and RoM is beyond the scope of the paper,
but a graph or some quantitative description of how RoM varied regionally would be welcome.
For example, what was the range of values, and where were the minimum and maximum values
found? Even better, add a bar graph.
Also, please indicate which results are significantly different in the box plots, e.g. with an
asterisk, and in the tables for easy reference.
Data accessibility: The datasets are available, but what about the scans themselves? In the interest
of accessibility and reproducibility, it would be ideal to deposit the scans in an online repository
that supports 3D data.
Minor comments:
Page 5, lines 8-26: perhaps too much detail about standard procedures.
Please use past tense for methods throughout.
Data collection: angle measurements. This step seems unnecessary. Why not record angle
measurements directly in Maya?
Constraints on neck mobility: What were the constraints on neck mobility in the varanid?
Typos, etc. are noted directly on the attached PDF.
Please feel free to contact me for clarification of any of these comments.

Dear authors,
You present a manuscript on a very interesting topic and your specimen suits perfectly for this
approach. I don't know the details of your workflow, but it appears to me that the method you
used is unnecessary complicated and produces errors. Trial 2 is a better version of trial 1 but does
not result in a maximally rotated model, which you may like to present. I can just assume your
workflow but from my point of view it is possible to combine trials 1 and 2 into a single
experiment, which would result in precise data for the whole model at once with minimal error.
Please read authors like Gatesy for more information. Maybe your response will prove me wrong
and there is a good reason for going the complicated way, but it needs explanation. Please find a
pdf with some suggestions to improve your paper.
The language of the paper is good except for a few points. The style needs some improvement.

The manuscript is clearly written, and follows clear protocols. In addition to citing Molnar,
Pierce, and Wernburg's excellent precedents, cite the work of Snively et al (2013) and Samman
(2013) on dinosaurs. Also, cite Welles's 2D approximations of neck mobility in Hydrotherosaurus
(Welles 1943).
It's unclear why the supplemental figures aren't part of the main text; not a big issue.

The discussion would be a little stronger if you bring up protraction and retraction in a coronal
plane as a possible advantage of good intervertebral lateroflexion in Nichollssaura. The
preserved specimen shows the possibility. Cite Wernburg again and Auffenberg (1978) for this
type of action. You can also cite Snively et al. (2013 and 2014) for retraction and protraction in
theropod dinosaurs (in a sagittal plane).

Associate Editor: 1
Comments to the Author:
Firstly, let me apologise for the long delay in getting responses for this manuscript. It was very
hard to find suitable reviewers, so the net was widened, but by that point lots of reviews came in
at once, so four reviews have been received. The reviewers comments range from minor to major
revision, and my interpretation is more towards major. The topic of neck mobility is interesting,
but the specific question or hypothesis that this contribution is aiming to test needs specifically
articulating. This includes the rationale for trail 1 and trail 2 etc, which need to be defined from
the outset and given names that related to them (rather than 1 or 2). This will be important for the
discussion and figures as well because better articulation as to the specification, rationale and
names of the trials will make it easier to compare the results and infer their meaning. On a
general point, please make sure the format of your manuscript follows the author guidelines. If
these comments and those the four reviewers can be addressed, I would be happy to recommend
publication in RSOS.
Editor Comments:
The referees generally like the paper but have a variety of minor to major comments. In addition
to addressing these, I hope that the second and third authors will sit down with this manuscript
and read it carefully (out loud, if needed) to correct the spelling mistakes (several taxonomic
names) and to make the prose more clear in places. (Also, ROM is the standard abbreviation for
"range of motion," please.) The reference format needs to be fixed, and ref 6 has no title. Please
make sure that the presentation of the article is correct before resubmitting, and thanks for your
attention to this.

label_comment_5
In this revision, the authors have addressed most of the points I and the other reviewers raised. I
greatly appreciate the expanded explanation of methods and discussion of results and the use of
Dryad to make raw data accessible. Thank you for the graphs in supplementary information. It is
noisy, but there does seem to be a decrease in RoM moving posteriorly in S.6!
I have only one major concern remaining, and it is easy to address: Having read the justification
of trial 1 vs trial 2 (CNM vs. PCVM), I suggest removing trial 1. The goal “to assess the ROM and
simulate the life like movements of the complete neck” does not make sense in a 3D modeling
context as it is clear from the figures that only adjacent vertebrae interact with one another.
Therefore, we are left with a method that produces unnecessary errors, as stated by Reviewer 2.
Removing trial 1 will increase both the overall quality of the data and the clarity of the
methodology.
Secondarily, regarding the dorsal mobility of Varanus: I suspect that some sliding motion of the
IVJs is occurring. It seems unlikely that the preservation would affect the bones enough to
increase ROM. Of course, it is possible that the preservation degraded the soft tissue so much that
the joints disarticulated. However, as you say, movement in other directions seemed quite
reasonable. Therefore, I think that what you are observing in your intact specimens is a realistic
range of motion and that your Maya model did not pick it up because you did not allow
translation. This type of movement has been documented many times in vertebrae of various
taxa. Vertebral movement is complicated and you can’t model everything, but this limitation
should probably be acknowledged in the discussion.
Specific comments:

Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
In this revision, the authors have addressed most of the points I and the other reviewers raised. I
greatly appreciate the expanded explanation of methods and discussion of results and the use of
Dryad to make raw data accessible. Thank you for the graphs in supplementary information. It is
noisy, but there does seem to be a decrease in RoM moving posteriorly in S.6!
I have only one major concern remaining, and it is easy to address: Having read the justification
of trial 1 vs trial 2 (CNM vs. PCVM), I suggest removing trial 1. The goal “to assess the ROM and
simulate the life like movements of the complete neck” does not make sense in a 3D modeling
context as it is clear from the figures that only adjacent vertebrae interact with one another.
Therefore, we are left with a method that produces unnecessary errors, as stated by Reviewer 2.
Removing trial 1 will increase both the overall quality of the data and the clarity of the
methodology.
Secondarily, regarding the dorsal mobility of Varanus: I suspect that some sliding motion of the
IVJs is occurring. It seems unlikely that the preservation would affect the bones enough to
increase ROM. Of course, it is possible that the preservation degraded the soft tissue so much that
the joints disarticulated. However, as you say, movement in other directions seemed quite
reasonable. Therefore, I think that what you are observing in your intact specimens is a realistic
range of motion and that your Maya model did not pick it up because you did not allow
translation. This type of movement has been documented many times in vertebrae of various
taxa. Vertebral movement is complicated and you can’t model everything, but this limitation
should probably be acknowledged in the discussion.

22 Abstract:
23
24 The elongate necked aquatic plesiosaurs existed for a period of 135 million years during the
25
26 Mesozoic. The function of the elongate neck of plesiosaurs is a point of debate. Using computed
27 tomography (CT) and 3-dimensional (3D) modelling, the range of motion (r.o.m) of the plesiosaur
28 Nichollssaura borealis’ neck was assessed. To quantify the r.o.m, the intervertebral mobility was
29
30
measured along the cervical vertebral column by manipulating the 3D models in the dorso-ventral
31 and lateral directions in three trials. Trial 1 assessed intervertebral r.o.m of the entire cervical
32 column, the second assessed intervertebral r.o.m between pairs of cervical vertebrae, and the third
33
34
assessed r.o.m with reduced intervertebral spaces. Trials 1 and 2 showed that N. borealis had the
35 greatest mean intervertebral r.o.m in the lateral direction, trial 1: 13.51° (s=4.73°), trial 2: 12.92° (s=
36 5.2°). While in trial 3 the ventral r.o.m was non-significantly greater than lateral r.o.m, trial 3: 5.38°
37
(s=2.97°). Trial 1 and 2 show that there may be a preference toward lateral neck movements of
38
39 N.borealis, which could correspond to ecological function for prey capture. This study also shows
40 that 3D modelling is an effective tool for assessing function morphology for structures where no
41
good modern analogue exists.

44 Background:
45
46 Plesiosauria is a clade of extinct, globally distributed marine reptiles that persisted for a
47 period of 135 million years from the Triassic to the end Cretaceous [1, 2, 3, 4]. Plesiosauria is rooted
48
within the sauropterygian clade of reptiles, and may be a sister group to the lepidosaurs; however,
49
50 sauroptergyian taxonomic relationships to other groups remains unclear [1]. Four paddle-like
51 appendages, elongate necks, and streamlined bodies exemplify the plesiosaur body plan, which was
52
adapted for a completely aquatic lifestyle [1, 5, 6] There are two major taxonomic groups within
53
54 Plesiosauria, the Plesiosauroidea (plesiosaurs) and Pliosauridea (pliosaurs), which are distinguished

by their general body plan [7, 8]. Plesiosauroidea is comprised of four subgroups: the
1 Elasmosauridea, Leptocleididea, Cryptoclididea, and Microcleididea [4]. The Elasmosauridea and
2 Leptocleididea together form form their own clade - the Xenosparia [4]. This study focuses on a
3
4 leptocleidid plesiosaur, Nichollssaura borealis.
5
6 Plesiosaurs have an elongate neck and a small skull, whereas pliosaurs have a shorter neck
7 and a larger, robust skull [8]. The plesiosaurs have been hypothesized to be ambush predators,
8
whereas pliosaurs are thought to have been pursuit predators [8]. The elongate necks of plesiosaurs
9
10 evolved by the addition of cervical vertebrae; elasmosaurids are an extreme with up to 76 cervical
11 vertebrae and a 7-meter long neck [9, 10]. With a body plan adapted for a marine lifestyle, the
12 function of the elongate necks, and the niche these predators occupied, remain points of discussion
13
14 [1, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Understanding the range of motion of the plesiosaur neck may help inform
15 us how they were feeding by potentially defining the functional capabilities of the neck [12].
16
17 Zarnik [13], Evans [14], and Zammit et al. [15] previously quantified the function of the
18
plesiosaur neck by inferring the range of flexibility possible along the cervical vertebral column.
19
20 Zarnik [13] and Evans [14] used morphological measurements to determine how far each cervical
21 vertebra could move in relation to another. Zarnik [13] and Evans [14] measured the zygapophyseal
22
angles, neural spine height, and centrum dimensions of different plesiosaur cervical vertebrae to
23
24 inform their interpretations of the range of motion. Evans [14] calculated the possible range of
25 motion of the necks of two small plesiosaurs: Crytoclidus eurymerus and Muraenosaurus leedsii.
26 Evans’ [14] calculations relied on assumptions based on the relative position of the zygapophyses
27
28 during movement and took into account an estimation intervertebral spacing. However, both Zarnik
29 [13] and Evans [14] did not conduct any articulations because the cervical vertebrae columns from
30 the specimens used were incomplete, damaged, or distorted. Zammit et al. [15] created 2D models
31
32 based on the measurements of several nearly complete elasmosaurid plesiosaurs. The models were
33 constructed out of cardboard in dorsal and lateral views. According to the 2D model, the relative
34 flexibility decreased posteriorly along the column by 6 degrees dorsally, 2 degrees ventrally, 4
35
36 degrees laterally (trends across the various specimens. Zammit et al. [15] suggested that greater
37 range of neck flexibility in the ventral and lateral directions compared to the dorsal direction may be
38 common amongst plesiosaurs. However Evans [14] found the opposite case, where lateral range of
39
40 motion was greater than dorso-ventral.
41
42 These previous studies [13, 14, 15] lack a high level of precision because they are based on
43 approximations or 2D analogues. Their conclusions may be refined with3D modeling techniques
44 that are based on the preserved morphology. Stem tetrapods, turtle, and crocodilian vertebral
45
46 functions have been analyzed using 3D models produced from CT scan data [16, 17, 18]. In the case
47 of turtles and crocodilians, these 3D models have been combined with morphological studies to
48 assess the range of motion in the vertebral column during various movement patterns [17, 18]. CT
49
50 scans are compiled into 3D models that are manipulated on a computer to simulate the range of
51 motion of the structure [19]. Wernburg et al. [17] assessed the range of motion in turtle necks to
52 understand how they retract the necks into their shell. Those models were paired with fossil
53
54
specimens to look at how the articular facets, such as the zygapophyses, allow for extreme ranges
55 of motion such that the neck can be pulled into the shell in an “S” curve in some cases [17]. Molnar
56 et al. [18] calculated crocodilian vertebral column flexibility with 3D models built from CT scans of
57
both extinct and extant specimens. Crocodilian trunk flexibility was then tied to evolutionary

2 changes in the hypothesized habitats that both extant and extinct crocodilians may have lived in
3
[18]. In both cases, the 3D models allowed for very precise measurements of the range of motion of
4
5 the vertebral column. This study uses 3D modeling techniques to achieve similar precision for
6 plesiosaur necks using data from fossil material.

8 Materials and Methods:
9
10
Nichollssaura borealis (TMP 1994.122.0001):
11
12
13 An exemplar plesiosaur, Nichollssaura borealis (Figure 1), was selected to construct 3D
14 models rendered from CT scans (Figure 2) because of its availability and capability of fitting into a
15 medical CT scanner. N. borealis is an exceptionally preserved, fully articulated 260 cm long
16
17
leptocleidid plesiosaur that was excavated in 1994 from the Wabiska Member of the Clearwater
18 formation (Albian ~ 113 million years ago) near Fort McMurray, Alberta [20, 21]. The skull and all 24
19 cervical vertebrae are present, with some damage to a few of the posterior cervical vertebrae
20
caused during excavation (i.e. lost neural spines, missing cervical ribs, and severed centra). There is
21
22 a minimal amount of lateral deformation through the frontal plane of N. borealis that can be
23 observed in the CT scans. This minimal deformation was not corrected for in this study because of
24
the reconstruction estimation error that would be introduced to the morphology. There does not
25
26 appear to be any deformation from compressive forces in any plane. Because of this, and the
27 complete articulation of the cervical vertebral column, we assume that the length of the vertebral
28
column and intervertebral disc space approximates the life-like condition of N. borealis’s neck [18].
29
30
Computed Tomography: Mayfair Diagnostics Calgary:
31
32
33 The holotype and only specimen of N. borealis (Figure 1), TMP 1994.122.01, [20, 21] was CT
34 scanned to create 3D renders of the cervical vertebral column for a biomechanical model by R.
35 Myszkowski in Calgary, Alberta at Mayfair Diagnostics on a General Electric HD 705 64 slice CT
36
37
scanner. Two sets of CT scans were taken of N. borealis. The skull and vertebral column were
38 scanned at 120 kilovolts (kV) and 185 micro-amps (µA), 0.625mm slice thickness, and a 512x512
39 matrix resulting in a voxel size of 0.625mm x 0625mm x 1.25mm (a 512 matrix is the scan resolution
40
of the General Electric HD 705 64 slice CT scanner). We down sampled the scans of N. borealis in
41
42 ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012) from 1400 to 700 slices by removing every other slice, and cropped
43 to remove non-informative image data. We organized the slices into an image sequence using a
44
virtual stack.
45
46
47 3D Model Rendering: Amira 5.4:
48
49 Amira 5.4 (FEI, Oregon) is a 3D visualization package that allows for CT scan image
50 sequences to be rendered into 3D models. CT image sequences are loaded and transformed into 3D
51 exportable models. In order to generate a model consisting only of the morphology of interest, in
52
53 this case the cervical vertebral column, we created a “labelfield” using the label field module. Each
54 cervical vertebra is segmented into its own 3D model, referred to as a material. This is repeated
55 until the entire cervical vertebral column is segmented into 3D models.

Model Manipulations: Autodesk Maya:
1
2 The primary data collection for the range of motion studies was conducted in Autodesk
3 Maya (Autodesk, 2015), which is widely used in the video gaming and movie industries to
4
manipulate 3D models in virtual space. Autodesk Maya’s interface may be used to create short 3D
5
6 animations, or in this case, range of motion profiles.
7
8 To export the cervical vertebrae from Amira 5.4 (FEI, Oregon) to Autodesk Maya, each
9 cervical vertebra must be isolated from the rest of the vertebral column as its own file. This allows
10
11
the cervical vertebrae to be manipulated against each other, and the range of motion to be
12 measured. With the arithmetic module in Amira 5.4, a specific material in the cervical vertebral
13 column label field module may be selected, and re-segmented. A “material” represents the data
14
that will be used in the 3D rendering of each cervical vertebra. From the re-segmented CT scans a
15
16 new surface may be produced with the surface gen module, and the resulting model is saved as an
17 object file (.obj) for use in Autodesk Maya. This is repeated for each of the materials associated with
18
the cervical vertebrae.
19
20
21
In Autodesk Maya, a “new project” was created into which the .obj files were imported.
22 Each .obj file is imported individually. For trial 1 and 4 (specific explanations found below), all the
23 .obj files are imported (one at a time) to produce an entire cervical series that was then
24
manipulated (criteria below). For trials 2 and 3, only two .obj files are imported at any one time, and
25
26 at no point was an entire cervical column on screen.
27
28 A lateral, dorsal, and ventral range of motion profile was created for three trials. Trial 1
29 assessed whole neck mobility, trial two assessed mobility between two vertebrae at a time, and
30
31
trial three assessed reduced intervertebral space mobility. The lateral mobility profile corresponds
32 to movement in the frontal plane. The dorsal and ventral mobility profiles correspond to movement
33 in the sagittal plane. To denote the directionality of movement in the frontal plane the term
34
35
“lateral” will be used, and movement in the sagittal plane will be termed either “dorsal” or
36 “ventral”. Every cervical vertebra was manipulated with respect to the vertebra anterior to it in the
37 column. For all manipulations, the point of rotation was placed between the centra, specifically at
38
the central point of the intervertebral discs.
39
40
41 Manipulation of each cervical vertebra was conducted until maximum articulation was
42 reached. The maximum articulation is defined as the end of manipulation where bone-on-bone
43 contact between two cervical vertebrae has occurred. Bone on bone contact is assumed to occur
44
45
between the zygapophyses, centra, neural spines, or cervical ribs respectively. Bone-on-bone
46 contact would not occur in a living animal because of soft tissue structures. Bone-on-bone contact is
47 assumed as the point of maximum articulation to avoid estimation error associated with
48
reconstructing the thickness of the soft tissues (see discussion). This was repeated for all the
49
50 manipulations in this study.
51
52 Mobility profiles trial 1: mobility profiles of the entire vertebral column:
53
54 The plesiosaur cervical vertebral column was first manipulated into a “neutral” starting
55 position (Figure3a); this is not the osteological neutral pose (ONP) proposed by Stevens & Parrish
56
57 [12], because others have argued that it does not realistically or accurately reflect a resting position
58 of a neck [23, 24]. Instead, the neutral starting position for this analysis was a straightened neck

2 using the preserved intervertebral space, with the assumption that the preserved space remains
3
close to what present in life given the overall quality of the specimen [18, 25]. To do this, the entire
4
5 cervical vertebral column was uploaded into Autodesk Maya as .obj files, after which each mobility
6 profile was created.
7
8 From the neutral starting position the cervical vertebrae are manipulated into three mobility
9
profiles (Figure 3a). These are the lateral, dorsal, and ventral mobility profiles. In the ventral
10
11 mobility profile each vertebra is rotated “downward” with respect to the vertebra posterior to it
12 from the neutral starting position (Figure 3b). The ventral mobility profile assesses the osteological
13
maximum range of motion when N. borealis would have lowered its head with respect to the body.
14
15 The cervical vertebrae are also manipulated into a dorsal mobility profile where each vertebra is
16 rotated “upward” with respect to the vertebra posterior to it (Figure 3c). The dorsal mobility
17 profiles assesse the range of motion when N. borealis would have raised its head with respect to
18
19 the body. Finally, the cervical vertebral column is manipulated into a lateral mobility profile (Figure
20 3c). From the neutral starting position, each vertebra is rotated to the right with respect to the
21 vertebra subsequent to it until maximum articulation. The lateral mobility profile is only conducted
22
23 for the right side because the cervical ribs are fully preserved on all the cervical vertebrae on this
24 side, whereas several have been damaged or not preserved on the left side. The lateral mobility
25 profile assesses the osteological maximum range of motion when N. borealis turns its head to the
26
27 side with respect to its body (Figure 3d).

32 Trial 2 is conducted to replicate the results of trial 1; however, this time only two vertebrae
33 were manipulated on screen at a single time. This trial differs technically from trial 1 because the
34
35 manipulation tools are easier to manage in Autodesk Maya when just two vertebrae are on screen.
36 This streamlines the manipulation process and may reduce user error during manipulation. When
37 manipulating an entire vertebral column in Autodesk Maya, both user and observational errors may
38
39
result from having all the different models on screen at one time.
40
41 Each cervical vertebra .obj file is imported into the Autodesk Maya window one at a time.
42 Starting from the atlas-axis and C3, each pair of vertebrae would be uploaded such that only two
43 are on screen at a time. Once the manipulation between two vertebrae is complete, the most
44
45 anterior vertebra in the pair is removed, and the next most posterior vertebra in the column is
46 uploaded. For example: following the manipulation of the atlas-axis with C3, the atlas-axis is
47 removed leaving C3 on screen, and C4 is uploaded for a manipulation with C3. Each manipulation
48
49 begins from the neutral starting position; a dorsal, ventral, and lateral mobility profile was produced
50 for each pair of vertebrae (see supplemental figure S.1). After each manipulation a screen capture is
51 taken for range of motion measurements. Each vertebra is moved in relation to the vertebra
52
53
anterior to it until bone on bone contact occurred (maximum articulation), with the point of
54 rotation at the center of the intervertebral disc. This continues in sequence until the entire
55 vertebral column has been manipulated.

Mobility profiles trial 3: Minimum intervertebral space mobility profile between two
1 vertebrae:
2
3 To assess other possibilities for the range of motion by different intervertebral spacing we
4 conducted a third set of manipulations (See supplemental figure S.2). The intervertebral spacing is
5
6 reduced until the cervical vertebrae are in contact with one another at the centra. Although no
7 compression to the vertebral column is evident, it is possible that taphonomic and diagenetic
8 processes have altered the original intervertebral spaces at the millimeter scale. Zammit et al., [15]
9
10 showed that increases in the intervertebral spaces correlated to an increase in the range of motion
11 in the neck. This third trial allows us to bracket the possible range of motion of the neck of N.
12 borealis between zero intervertebral space and what is preserved (trials 1 and 2). From here the
13
14
cervical vertebrae were manipulated into the same three mobility profiles as in the previous trials
15 As per the method of trial 2, the vertebrae are manipulated two at a time, with one vertebra being
16 rotated with respect to another in the dorsal, ventral, and lateral directions.
17
18 Varanus dumerilii:
19
20 An extant varanid, Varanus dumerilii [22], was used to assess if the 3D models of N. borealis
21
22 present a realistic interpretation for the mobility of the neck. Varanus dumerilii was chosen because
23 of its relatively long neck among lepidosaurs and its availability. This specimen was fixed in 10%
24 buffered formalin, and then transferred to storage in 70% ethanol for use in another study in 2012.
25
26 The specimen measured approximately 26cm in length, and is a juvenile. The specimen was µCT
27 scanned, 3D modeled, and radiographed (a step not possible for N. borealis) to approximate the
28 range of motion with soft tissues taken into account. The varanid was modeled using the same
29
30 methods applied to N. borealis (see above). The varanid offered the ability to also model range of
31 motion with radiographs to assess the difference in the range of motion when musculature was also
32 considered. By having both metrics we can assess whether the 3D computer models (which lack
33
34
musculature) match the range of motion of an animal with musculature. Therefore, if those two
35 measurements are not significantly different, then the model being produced for a plesiosaur will
36 produce a valid approximation for the range of motion should the musculature also have been
37
present.
38
39
40 Mobility profile trial 4: Varanus dumerilii 3D model:
41
42 As in the range of motion manipulations conducted for N. borealis, the cervical vertebral
43 column of V. dumerilii is straightened into the neutral starting position (Figure 4a). The point of
44 rotation was at the intervertebral spaces, as in N. borealis, which follows previous studies [14, 15,
45
46 17, 18]. From the neutral starting position the neck is manipulated into dorsal, ventral, and lateral
47 mobility profiles until maximum articulation (Figure 4b, c, d). The procedure for manipulation is
48 identical to that conducted for N. borealis in trial 1.
49
50
Mobility profile trial 5: Radiographs of Varanus dumerilii:
51
52
To assess the maximum range of motion of an elongate reptilian neck when soft tissue is
53
54 present, a series of radiographs are taken of the specimen of V. dumerilii on a Kubtec Xpert 80-L
55 flatbed radiograph (Figure 5). The specimen was placed on the flatbed and positioned directly under
56
the emitter. Tape was used to hold the neck in the various positions because it is radio-transparent

2 (A.P Russell pers. comm., 2016). The range of motion manipulations for V. dumerilii follows the
3
methodology laid out by Wernburg et al. [17].
4
5
6
To assess the neck’s maximum range of motion three sets of radiographs were produced.
7 First, the neck is held in the neutral starting position - straight without flexion in any of the three
8 directions. For the neutral starting position, and dorsal and ventral range of motion profiles, V.
9
dumerilii is placed in left lateral recumbence. From there its neck is elevated (raising the head) to
10
11 the point at which it could no longer mechanically be moved without excessive force, and is held in
12 place with scotch tape. Similarly, the neck is depressed for the ventral range of motion. To assess
13
the lateral range of motion, V. dumerilii is placed in sternal recumbency on the radiograph platform.
14
15 The neck is then bent by hand to the right to the point where it could not mechanically be moved
16 without excessive force, and held in place with scotch tape. After each radiograph is taken, the
17 profile is changed.
18
19
A total of 32 radiographs are taken at 30kv and 910µA, of which approximately 12 are clear
20
21 enough for data collection (Figure 5). The radiographs are captured using the Kubtec Xpert imaging
22 software, and are saved in dicom format. The radiographs are converted from dicom to .jpeg format
23
by using the export function in the Kubtec Xpert 80L’s imaging software. The radiographs are then
24
25 exported for data collection.
26
27 Data collection:
28
29 Angle measurements for N. borealis:
30
31 Screen captures of each of the range of motion profiles are imported into Adobe Illustrator
32
33
(AI). For the dorsal and ventral mobility profiles, a straight line is drawn along the base of the
34 centrum of each of vertebra. The line is extended out beyond the length of the vertebra on which it
35 is drawn; as a result, a series of intersecting lines is created for each range of motion profile. For the
36
37
lateral range of motion profile the straight lines are placed along the sagittal plane in dorsal view of
38 each vertebra, and again, extended beyond the length of the vertebra on which it is placed resulting
39 in a series of intersecting lines.
40
41 Once the lines are fitted each screen capture is uploaded to ImageJ. Using the measurement
42
43 tool of ImageJ, the angle between the intersecting lines (see supplemental figure S.3) for each pair
44 of cervical vertebrae is recorded. Each angle (see supplemental figure S.3) is measured three times
45 and averaged for a final range of motion between two cervical vertebrae.
46
47 Angle measurements for Varanus dumerilii 3D model:
48
49
The data collection for Varanus dumerilii followed closely to that for N. borealis, differing
50
51 only in where the lines are placed. The base of the centra are not used because V. dumerilii
52 possesses because of the non-linear shape of the ventral keel of the cervical vertebra (see
53 supplemental figure S.4). Instead the lines are drawn through the lateral keel of cervical centra (see
54
55 supplemental figure S.4). This position gives equivalent results to measuring along the base of the
56 centrum; the only difference is that the lines have been moved upwards. Each line is extended out
57 beyond the vertebra on which it is drawn, resulting in a series of intersecting lines. The lateral angle
58

measurements follow the same method as for N. borealis. The angles of intersection are measured
1 in ImageJ (see supplemental figure S.4).
2
3 Angle measurements for Varanus dumerilii radiographs:
4
5 The radiographs are converted to .jpeg format and uploaded into Adobe Illustrator. In
6
7
Adobe Illustrator, lines are fitted following the lateral keel of the cervical centra, similar to the lines
8 fitted for the Autodesk Maya 3D model (above) of V. dumerilii (Figure 4 & supplemental figure S.4).
9 The lateral angle measurements follow the same method for N. borealis. The angles of intersection
10
11
are measured in ImageJ.
12
13 Statistical analysis methods:
14
15 Angles (and radians) cannot be analyzed using the same tests that are required for linear
16 measurements, such as morphological dimensions or count data. To assess whether there are
17 differences between the ranges of motion profiles circular statistics must be employed. Circular
18
19 (also called directional) statistical tests analyze datasets where each datum is measured as an angle
20 from a point on a circle. In this case, each datum is an angle of movement between two cervical
21 vertebrae, and is circular rather than a linear measurement.
22
23
The Watson-Williams test for equal means is used here to assess if the mean intervertebral
24
25 range of motion in one direction differs from that of another. The null hypothesis states that the
26 mean intervertebral range of motion in any direction is not different from any other.
27
28 First, the ranges of motion profiles for N. borealis are compared to one another (i.e., Trial 1:
29
lateral mobility vs. dorsal mobility; Trial 1: lateral mobility vs. ventral mobility; and Trial 1: dorsal
30
31 mobility vs. ventral mobility.). Second, N. borealis mobility profiles are compared between trials
32 (i.e., Trial 1: lateral mobility vs. Trial 2 lateral mobility; Trial 1: lateral mobility vs. Trial 3: lateral
33
mobility; and Trial 2: lateral mobility vs. Trial 3: lateral mobility).
34
35
36
To assess if the 3D models approximate the range of motion that is possible in a neck with
37 soft tissues Watson-Williams tests are conducted between the varanid Autodesk Maya trial (4) and
38 the varanid radiograph trial (5) range of motion (i.e., varanid radiograph lateral mobility profile vs.
39
varanid Autodesk Maya lateral mobility profile; varanid radiograph dorsal mobility profile vs.
40
41 varanid Autodesk Maya dorsal mobility profiles. All statistical tests are conducted in PAST Version 3.

11 Conclusions and Discussion:
12
13 The mean intervertebral mobility from trial 1 and trial 2 represent an osteological maximum
14 range of movement for the neck. This is because during manipulations of the vertebral column,
15
each vertebral pair was moved in relation to one another until bone-on-bone contact occurred. In
16
17 trial 1 the lateral mobility profile had the greatest mean intervertebral movement 13.51° (s=4.73°),
18 and although significantly less, the ventral mobility profile had the next greatest mobility at 7.777°
19
(s=2.55°). In trial 2 the mean intervertebral mobility profiles were not significantly different from
20
21 one another (See supplemental table S.1), but the mean intervertebral mobility of the lateral plane
22 was highest at 12.92° (s=5.20°). Additionally, the intervertebral mobility of the lateral planes in both
23 trial 1 and 2 do not significantly differ from one another. Since in both trials 1 and 2 the lateral
24
25 plane has higher mean mobility, there is support that the lateral mobility profile may be the
26 preferred plane of movement for the neck of N. borealis.
27
28 In trial 2 the mean intervertebral mobility of the dorsal and ventral planes was not
29
significantly different, but was significantly greater than the dorsal and ventral profiles of trial 1.
30
31 This shows that in trial 2 there is a greater overall mean intervertebral mobility for the neck. It could
32 also indicate that there is a greater amount of variability in the mean intervertebral mobility of the
33 dorsal and ventral mobility since the same differences are not observed when comparing lateral
34
35 mobility between trial 1 and 2.
36
37 In trial 3, we reduced the intervertebral space before conducting the range of motion
38 manipulations in Autodesk Maya. This simulated movement in the neck if the cervical vertebrae
39
were locked together in a much closer position than was preserved, and establishes the osteological
40
41 minimum range of motion. The mean intervertebral mobility of each of the three (lateral, dorsal,
42 and ventral) planes of movement did not differ from one another, and were significantly less than
43
their counter part mobility profiles from trial 1 and 2. This is in line with what one would expect to
44
45 see when the space for movement between two cervical vertebrae is reduced, or removed [15].
46
47 The neck mobility profiles presented in this study represent the osteological maximal (trial 1
48 & 2) and minimal (trial 3) ranges of motion for the neck of N. borealis. There is a preference for neck
49
movement in the lateral direction, up to a maximum mean intervertebral mobility of 13.51°
50
51 (s=4.73°) (trial 1), and a minimum mobility of 5.29° (s=3.8°) (trial 3). The mean intervertebral
52 mobility in the dorsal direction ranged from a maximum of 10.79° (s=4.15°) (trial 2), to a minimum
53
of 4.50° (s=2.84°) (trial 3), and in the ventral plane from a maximum of 11.51° (s=5.17°) (trial 2) to a
54
55 minimum of 5.38° (s=2.97°) (trial 3). The lateral mobility profile shows the greatest mean
56 intervertebral mobility, and greatest range between minimum and maximum mobility.

2 To assess whether the 3D models of N. borealis represent a biologically realistic system that
3
accurately estimates neck mobility, a range of motion study was conducted on an extant varanid.
4
5 First a 3D computer model of V. dumerilii was produced from CT scans, and manipulated into the
6 three mobility profiles in Autodesk Maya used for N. borealis. Then, a series of radiographs were
7 taken of manipulations of the same three mobility profiles of the V. dumerilii. A comparison of the
8
9 two data sets allowed for a direct comparison between mobility models both with and without soft
10 tissues contributions. There was no significant difference between the mean intervertebral mobility
11 in either the lateral or ventral plane between the 3D model and the radiographed manipulations.
12
13 However, the 3D model appeared to have significantly underestimated the mean intervertebral
14 dorsal mobility compared to the radiographs ((15.38° (s=3.07°). vs. 23.34° (s=5.25°)). This
15 underestimation may be caused by some aspect of the soft tissue morphology in V. dumerilii that
16
17 allows for more dorso-flexion, however it is difficult to be certain without further soft tissue
18 analysis. The difference in the dorsal mobility may also be caused by the fact that when
19 radiographed V. dumerilii had been preserved for some time. However, overall congruence
20
21 between 3D model and the radiograph manipulations of V. dumerilii suggest that this type of
22 biomechanical manipulation can accurately estimate neck mobility in a biological realistic manner
23 for a plesiosaur such as N. borealis.
24
25 Constraints on neck mobility:
26
27
Several constraints on mobility of the cervical vertebral column were observed during the 3D
28
29 manipulations. Since maximum articulation was reached when bone-on-bone contact occurred,
30 these different osteological points were considered to be constraints on movement. These points of
31 contact were different in each of the three movement directions. In the lateral mobility profile the
32
33 primary osteological constraints were the cervical ribs because they project laterally and may
34 contact one another during medio-lateral manipulations. In the dorsal mobility profile point of
35 bone-on-bone contact was between the pre- and postzygapophyses. In a living animal these
36
37 articulating surfaces would normally be encased in the zygapophyseal capsule. Changes in the
38 angulation of the zygapophyses can also affect the range of motion of the neck [14]. In the posterior
39 cervical vertebrae bone-on-bone contact between subsequent neural spines constrained movement
40
41 more so than the zygapophyses. The change in the point of bone-on-bone contact is likely
42 associated with the change in the proportions of the cervical vertebrae. Posteriorly along the
43 cervical vertebral column the neural spines become more posteriorly angled, and increased in
44
45 height. In the ventral mobility profile the anterior cervical vertebrae were constrained by the
46 ventral aspects of the centra. While in the posterior cervical vertebrae are constrained by the
47 ventral aspects of the centra and the longer cervical ribs.
48
49 It is important to determine osteological constraints of movement in order to determine the
50
51 maximum range of cervical movement. However, it should also be noted that soft tissue structures
52 such as zygapophyseal capsule, interspinous ligament, supraspinous ligament, intervertebral disc,
53 and cervical musculature may render the bone-on-bone maximum articulation point an
54
55 underestimation or over estimation. These structures aid in stabilizing the vertebral column during
56 movement, by establishing the limitations on where structures can move in relation to one another.
57 Therefore a future study could model and incorporate the contributions or constraints of soft
58
59
tissues structures in addition to the osteological constraints.
60 https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos R. Soc. open sci.
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 12 of 24
The osteological constraints may also result in regional neck mobility differences along the
1 cervical vertebral column. N. borealis is preserved with a great deal of lateral flexion in the anterior
2 cervical vertebrae (Figure 1). Figure 1 qualitatively shows that the lateral direction of movement is
3
4 greater than the dorso-ventral direction. However, when qualitatively comparing dorsal to ventral
5 mobility it is clear that there is a less uniform distribution to the mobility in the dorsal direction of
6 movement than the ventral direction of movement (Figure 1b & 1c). The dorsal mobility profile
7
8 appears to have a greater amount of mobility in the anterior cervical vertebrae than the posterior
9 (Figure 1c). Although this study did not directly assess regional differences in mobility in any specific
10 direction, given what can be observed in Figure 1, it would be an informative line of questioning to
11
12 explore. An analysis of how the changes in the cervical morphology relate to the modelled mobility
13 could help quantify regional mobility in the neck. For now, this work is outside the scope of this
14 publication, but may be a source of a future study.
15
16 Ecological Implications:
17
18
The elongate neck evolved early on in Plesiosauria, and was maintained for the entirety of
19
20 their 135 million year duration, during the Mesozoic [1, 2, 3, 4, 13, 14, 15]. The function of this
21 structure and its adaptive value has remained relatively unclear because of the lack of modern
22
analogues to compare plesiosaurs with [14, 15]. If the elongate neck remained in plesiosaurs for the
23
24 entirety of their evolutionary history then it may have conveyed an adaptive advantage, such as for
25 feeding [14, 26]. However, although feeding with an elongate neck may have been advantageous;
26 this may not be the driving force behind its initial evolution [27]. The elongate neck may have
27
28 evolved in earlier plesiosaur lineages for another reason (e.g., developmental constraints, or as
29 novel hydrodynamic adaptation), and was later co-opted for feeding.
30
31 This study, like previous studies, quantified the function of the elongate neck [13, 14, 15]. In
32
the previous by Zarnik [13] and Evans [14] the neck was found to be more laterally mobile than
33
34 dorso-ventrally. Evans [14] suggested that this was to facilitate a horizontal feeding pattern. Zammit
35 et al. [15] found in the hyper-elongate necked elasmosaurs that the neck was more dorso-ventrally
36
mobile, when compared to lateral mobility. These differences could be the result of the angulation
37
38 of the articular facets of the cervical vertebrae of the various groups [14]. For example, if the
39 zygapophyses are more vertically oriented then dorso-ventral mobility may be more prevalent.
40 Whereas, if the zygapophyses are more horizontally oriented then there may be more lateral
41
42 mobility. Evans [14] suggested that the zygapophyseal angle lead to the differences in neck
43 movement patterns in the specimens had modelled compared to those Zarnik [13] had studied.
44
45 This study found that N. borealis’ possessed a neck that was most mobile in the lateral
46
direction, compared to dorso-ventral. These findings corroborates what Evans [14] found in the
47
48 smaller plesiosaurs he studied (C. eurymerus and M. leedsii). N. borealis would have had a relatively
49 large feeding envelope in the lateral direction, which may have facilitated feeding in or along the
50 substrate of the seafloor [11, 14]. With wide sweeping motions N .borealis may have searched the
51
52 seafloor for invertebrates and fish that it may have been hunting, however no gut contents are
53 known from the specimen. However, gut contents from other specimens have previously shown to
54 contain invertebrates that potentially live in these areas [11]. Both this study and Evans [14] have
55
56 shown that preferences for lateral neck movement may be common in some plesiosaurs, and may
57 represent a specific feeding regime.

1
2 Feeding facilitated by lateral neck movement may have been confined to the smaller bodied
3
plesiosaurs [13, 14]. Zammit et al. [15] demonstrated that the larger elasmosaurs had greater
4
5 dorso-ventral movement, potentially representing a different feeding regime. Since the neck allows
6 the head to interact with the environment, it is reasonable to assume that different movement
7 patterns favoured by different groups of plesiosaurs reflects specializations to their particular
8
9 environments and ecologies. Therefore, understanding how the elongate necks move in different
10 plesiosaurs may reveal a variety of functional capabilities that could further inform interpretations
11 of plesiosaur ecology.

Summary and future directions:
14
15
16
The mobility profiles reflect a biologically realistic movement pattern for the neck of N.
17 borealis because of the agreement between the V. dumerilii datasets (trial 4 & 5). It was important
18 to establish the maxima and minima of neck movement because it enabled an estimation for the
19
range of motion for which the N. borealis could have moved its neck under different assumptions
20
21 and constraints. These assumptions include differences in intervertebral spacing that could result
22 from compression or expansion of cartilaginous components of the neck. However, the nature of
23
these soft tissue structures could not be assessed by this method for biomechanical study. This
24
25 work shows that 3D modeling from CT scans is a novel approach for studying the mobility of the
26 neck in the plesiosaur N. borealis. The variability in the dorsal and ventral mobility profiles shows
27
the need for a larger sample size to assess how the neck was moving in other plesiosaurs.
28
29
30
The approach presented here could be applied to other plesiosaur specimens, such as the
31 hyper-elongate necked elasmosaurids. Differences in mobility patterns between groups of
32 plesiosaurs may allow for inferences of ecological niches specializations, and why the elongate neck
33
persisted across the group for as long as it did. Ultimately, an increased sample size of plesiosaur
34
35 neck mobility will allow further understanding of the ecological and evolutionary history of the
36 group.

Dear Editor,
Please find attached our revision of our manuscript on the neck biomechanics of the
plesiosaur Nichollssaura. We have accommodated all of the reviewers comments,
details of which follow below in bold. We hope this addresses all of their concerns.

Comments to the Author:
The reviewers comments range from minor to major revision, and my interpretation
is more towards major. The topic of neck mobility is interesting, but the specific
question or hypothesis that this contribution is aiming to test needs specifically
articulating.
This has been completed.
This includes the rationale for trail 1 and trail 2 etc, which need to be defined from
the outset and given names that related to them (rather than 1 or 2).
Complete.
On a general point, please make sure the format of your manuscript follows the
author guidelines.
We have done this to the extent that was possible—the guidelines are pretty
sparse. We have thus copied the format seen in previously published papers.
If these comments and those the four reviewers can be addressed, I would be happy
to recommend publication in RSOS.
Editor Comments:
The referees generally like the paper but have a variety of minor to major
comments. In addition to addressing these, I hope that the second and third authors
will sit down with this manuscript and read it carefully (out loud, if needed) to
correct the spelling mistakes (several taxonomic names) and to make the prose
more clear in places.
These spellings have been corrected and several sentences rewritten for clarity.
(Also, ROM is the standard abbreviation for "range of motion," please.)
Complete.
The reference format needs to be fixed, and ref 6 has no title.
Fixed.
Please make sure that the presentation of the article is correct before resubmitting,
and thanks for your attention to this.
We assume this refers to the same formatting mentioned by the Associate Editor,
and this has been completed.

Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
I have a few concerns about the methodology. The main concern relates to trials 1
and 2, the rationale for them, and why the results are so different. I don't fully
understand why the first trial was conducted, and I am confused as to why it yielded
different results from the second trial. From the supplementary information, it is
clear that there is as much difference between trials in the same direction as there
is between different directions. As I understand it, the procedure was identical
except that multiple vertebral segments were present in Maya in the first trial,
which was expected to increase error (page 6, lines 32- 39). What is the benefit of
having this trial? And why do you suppose the results of the two are so different?
Did you consider estimating observer error, perhaps by repeating the
measurements several times?
The rationale for these different trials has been explicitly set forth in both the
methods and discussion sections. We discussed possible sources for error but did
not attempt to estimate this. We did multiple measurements for each angle
though and have added a column to the table for an estimate of the intra trial
measurement error, accessible via the online supplemental data.
My second concern is that the models underestimated dorsal mobility in the
varanid. One would expect a bones-only model to overestimate mobility, if
anything. This is a very interesting result, but I feel like it's kind of glossed over. How
do you suppose it is possible for the vertebrae to move beyond their supposed
osteological limits? I would guess it has to do with more complicated movements,
specifically some combination of rotation and translation. Can you replicate this
behavior in silico? What implications might this have for your conclusions about
plesiosaur behavior?
Discussion was added regarding the Varanus dorsal mobility. The specimen itself
was frozen and thawed, so there was some tissue degradation that might have
allowed for hyperflexion or disarticulation—although this was presumably
countered somewhat by formalin fixation. Developing further constraints for 3d
models in general using cadaveric material is a project that should be considered
for future work.
I also have some questions about the rationale for the methods used:
1. Did the authors consider placing the center of rotation in a different location?
Some references have shown a more dorsally located center of rotation (e.g.,
Samagh et al. “New Method for Determining Apparent Axial Center of Rotation of
Lumbar and Thoracic Spine Segments.” The Journal of Rehabilitation Research and
Development 48, no. 5 (2011): 587–96.
https://doi.org/10.1682/JRRD.2010.09.0168.). Please justify this choice.
Done. Other citations have placed the center of rotation elsewhere (see the
citations of reviewer 3 for example). We justified our selection but also suggest
this would be a subject for future work.
2. "Maximum articulation is defined as the end of manipulation where bone-on-
bone contact between two cervical vertebrae has occurred." What about
disarticulation of zygapophyseal joints? Was there a minimum amount of
zygapophyseal overlap maintained?
Changed to maximum displacement per another reviewer. No constraints were
placed on the zygapophyseal joints but we also observed no disarticulation at this
joint in any trial.
3. "This third trial allows us to bracket the possible range of motion of the neck of N.
borealis between zero intervertebral space and what is preserved." Isn't it possible
that the soft tissue shrank prior to fossilization, and that the space in life was larger
than that preserved? I'd like to see the results with more space added. Also,
approximately how much were the vertebrae moved between trials 2 and 3 (i.e.,
how much space was removed)? And what kind of articulation is present between
the centra - is it proceolous, amphiceolous, amphiplateous?
This was a point of some internal debate. This has been added to the discussion.
We did not increase the intervertebral spacing because we were at a loss for how
that might be done rigorously—the preserved intervertebral spacing is reasonable
compared with our extant specimens. Other authors, cited in the discussion, have
stated that in the absence of other deformation the preserved spacing can be used
as an approximation. Hopefully our choice is better justified.
The results are well presented, but I'd like to see data on regional differences as
well. These are already included in the supplementary info, so it seems strange that
they are not discussed at all. I agree that trying to correlate regional morphology
and ROM is beyond the scope of the paper, but a graph or some quantitative
description of how ROM varied regionally would be welcome. For example, what
was the range of values, and where were the minimum and maximum values found?
Even better, add a bar graph.
Added a paragraph and series of graphs to supplemental data. No clear trends
were seen.
Also, please indicate which results are significantly different in the box plots, e.g.
with an asterisk, and in the tables for easy reference.
Complete.
Data accessibility: The datasets are available, but what about the scans themselves?
In the interest of accessibility and reproducibility, it would be ideal to deposit the
scans in an online repository that supports 3D data.
Complete.
Minor comments:
Page 5, lines 8-26: perhaps too much detail about standard procedures.
Removed.
Please use past tense for methods throughout.
Complete.
Data collection: angle measurements. This step seems unnecessary. Why not record
angle measurements directly in Maya?
We were not aware this could be done at the time of data collection. Maya has a
large learning curve.
Constraints on neck mobility: What were the constraints on neck mobility in the
varanid?
Added to discussion.
Typos, etc. are noted directly on the attached PDF.
Fixed.
Please feel free to contact me for clarification of any of these comments.

Comments to the Author(s)
Dear authors,
you present a manuscript on a very interesting topic and your specimen suits
perfectly for this approach. I don't know the details of your workflow, but it appears
to me that the method you used is unnecessary complicated and produces errors.
Trial 2 is a better version of trial 1 but does not result in a maximally rotated model,
which you may like to present. I can just assume your workflow but from my point
of view it is possible to combine trials 1 and 2 into a single experiment, which would
result in precise data for the whole model at once with minimal error.
We clarified the difference between the two trials. As far as workflow is
concerned, the reviewer seems to have an expertise with Maya that surpasses our
own. Whereas this might be overly complicated, clunky even, we hope we are
getting reasonable approximations.
Please read authors like Gatesy for more information. Maybe your response will
prove me wrong and there is a good reason for going the complicated way, but it
needs explanation. Please find a pdf with some suggestions to improve your paper.
We are still hunting for the specific Gatesy citations—a more specific reference
would be helpful.
The language of the paper is good except for a few points. The style needs some
improvement. You will find comments in the pdf.
Complete.
Best regards

The manuscript is clearly written, and follows clear protocols. In addition to citing
Molnar, Pierce, and Wernburg's excellent precedents, cite the work of Snively et al
(2013) and Samman (2013) on dinosaurs. Also, cite Welles's 2D approximations of
neck mobility in Hydrotherosaurus (Welles 1943).
Added.
It's unclear why the supplemental figures aren't part of the main text; not a big
issue.
The discussion would be a little stronger if you bring up protraction and retraction in
a coronal plane as a possible advantage of good intervertebral lateroflexion in
Nichollssaura. The preserved specimen shows the possibility. Cite Wernburg again
and Auffenberg (1978) for this type of action. You can also cite Snively et al. (2013
and 2014) for retraction and protraction in theropod dinosaurs (in a sagittal plane).

Comments to the Author(s)
A useful study of a classic but little-studied problem using techniques that weren't
available to us 25 years ago. The changes I recommend are mainly clarifications,
some incorrect or wrongly spelt clade names, and a style issue where the
methodology should be reported in the past tense.

Reviewer #1:
I have only one major concern remaining, and it is easy to address:
Having read the justification of trial 1 vs trial 2 (CNM vs. PCVM), I
suggest removing trial 1. The goal “to assess the ROM and simulate
the life like movements of the complete neck” does not make sense in
a 3D modeling context as it is clear from the figures that only adjacent
vertebrae interact with one another. Therefore, we are left with a
method that produces unnecessary errors, as stated by Reviewer 2.
Removing trial 1 will increase both the overall quality of the data and
the clarity of the methodology.
We have gone through the text and removed the first trial (CNM).
We agree that its removal makes the methodology, and overall
story of the paper far clearer and more useful overall.
Secondarily, regarding the dorsal mobility of Varanus: I suspect that
some sliding motion of the IVJs is occurring. It seems unlikely that the
preservation would affect the bones enough to increase ROM. Of
course, it is possible that the preservation degraded the soft tissue so
much that the joints disarticulated. However, as you say, movement in
other directions seemed quite reasonable. Therefore, I think that what
you are observing in your intact specimens is a realistic range of
motion and that your Maya model did not pick it up because you did
not allow translation. This type of movement has been documented
many times in vertebrae of various taxa. Vertebral movement is
complicated and you can’t model everything, but this limitation should
probably be acknowledged in the discussion.
We have acknowledged this, and added it into the discussion.
