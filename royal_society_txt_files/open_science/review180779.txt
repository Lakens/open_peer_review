The paper presents a comprehensive laboratory testing and investigation on the mechanical and material
behavior of dolomitic marbles under the loading of heating-cooling cycles. The paper is well written and
presents a good piece of work for the literature on this important material (dolomitic marble) which has
been widely used in buildings and constructions for many years. I would like to recommend it for
publication.

In this paper, the authors conducted an experimental study to investigate thermally-induced deterioration
behaviour of two dolomitic marbles under heating-cooling cycles. The results of the study can be used to
guide the selection and protection of marbles in construction industry.
Overall, this paper is very interesting and well prepared. After some revisions, it can be accepted for
publication in Royal Society Open Science. Some problems of this paper are given as follows:
1. It was stated that the thermally-induced micro cracks on the surface should be responsible for the weight
loss marbles. To verify the statement, please provide the surface morphology of the samples after a certain
of heating-cooling cycles.
2. The thermal expansion coefficients and strength of the materials should be provided.
3. Please explain why the abundance of Quartz mineral leads to the pronounced deterioration of Hanbaiyu
Marble. Moreover, please demonstrate the effect of Quartz mineral on the compressive strength of marbles.

Summary:
In this article, the authors subject samples of two dolomitic marbles from the Beijing area to numerous
thermal cycles, with the aim of understanding the decay of the samples due to thermal degradation. The
authors subject these samples to thermal cycles that are realistic of the thermal cycles the actual stones
would be exposed to (-20 to 60 C). They fully characterize the dolomitic marbles beforehand and measure
degradation via mass loss, ultrasonic pulse velocity and and 3d micro topography. Additionally some
destructive tests were carried out to determine the loss of compressive strength during the cycling. Up to
1000 cycles were carried out. The authors observe that mass loss can be recorded in the dolomitic marbles,
as well as a degradation in ultrasonic pulse velocity. The authors also record a change in the micro
topography. Finally, the authors demonstrate a significant degradation in compressive strength. The
behaviors were similar across the two dolomitic marble types, but one variation (Hanbaiyu) degraded more
significantly, and this was attributed to the higher level of quartz in the rock microstructure.
Review:
This study seems to be well performed, with adequate controls on all influencing factors, and the reviewer
agrees with the conclusions. It is not an incredibly groundbreaking piece of work, but it is a solid scientific
piece of work and deserves publication to add to the literature in this field. The reviewer especially finds
the focus on thermal cycles in a real world relevant temperature range to be particularly compelling for this
study.
The reviewer's only real concern has to do with the claim that the source of the degradation is the
anisotropic thermal expansion behavior of the crystal, rather than the thermal gradients in the samples
themselves, that is the source of the degradation. A measurement of porosity after the cycling would help to
bolster this claim - especially if the microstructural change is not restricted to the surface, where the thermal
gradients are the highest. However, I think the evidence the authors present is compelling enough, and do
not recommend any changes to the manuscript. It would maybe be a good idea to use another method
besides mercury intrusion to check the porosity as well, as MIP generally requires the breakup of the rock
into many smaller pieces, and this creates more surface area. The porosity of this rock is most likely
restricted to the surface as well. However, this is also not required to be changed in the manuscript.

Responses to Reviewer #2:
Comment 1: It was stated that the thermally-induced micro cracks on the surface should be
responsible for the weight loss marbles. To verify the statement, please provide the surface
morphology of the samples after a certain of heating-cooling cycles.
Response 1:
The authors appreciate your insightful suggestion to verify the statement of “the
thermally-induced micro cracks on the surface should be responsible for the weight loss
marbles”. Following your suggestion, the authors have added two more Micro-topography
pictures of sample surfaces after 600 heating-cooling cycles in Fig. 8.
Comment 2: The thermal expansion coefficients and strength of the materials should be
provided.
Response 2:
According to your suggestions, we’ve added one table (Table 1) which gives the Linear
thermal expansion coefficients of compositional minerals (e.g., Calcite, Dolomite, and,
Quartz). As for the thermal expansion coefficients of the marble specimens, we are unable to
perform a measurement in a short time period. However, this is such a good suggestion that
we would like to include it in a future study.
According to your suggestions, we have also added the uniaxial compressive strength of
the materials in Table 2.
Comment 3: Please explain why the abundance of Quartz mineral leads to the pronounced
deterioration of Hanbaiyu Marble. Moreover, please demonstrate the effect of Quartz mineral
on the compressive strength of marbles.
Response 3:
As is shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1, the quartz crystal has a larger linear thermal
expansion coefficient along the direction perpendicular to the c-axis than that of the direction
parallel with the c-axis. The anisotropic thermal expansive behaviour of quartz crystal is very
different with that of dolomite crystal, which will increase the chance of bringing thermally-
2
induced irreversible strains. Thereby, due to the abundance in quartz mineral, it is expected
that Hanbaiyu marble is more easily involved in thermally-induced deterioration behaviour
when compared with Qingbaishi marble (Highlighted in 5.1).
As is highlighted in 5.3, the effect of Quartz mineral on the compressive strength of
marbles is demonstrated by their reduction in comprehensive strengths. After 1000 thermal
cycles, the uniaxial compressive strengths of QM and HM reduce by 45% and 52%,
respectively. The inclusion of quartz mineral in dolomitic marble should have promoted the
thermally-induced deterioration behaviour in HM samples.
Responses to Reviewer #3:

This study seems to be well performed, with adequate controls on all influencing factors,
and the reviewer agrees with the conclusions. It is not an incredibly groundbreaking piece of
work, but it is a solid scientific piece of work and deserves publication to add to the literature

of this rock is most likely restricted to the surface as well. However, this is also not required
to be changed in the manuscript.
Response:
The authors appreciate your positive comments and insightful suggestions. The authors’
choice of heating rate is based on other researchers’ work to ensure the thermal equilibration
and reduce the effect of thermal shock. Relevant citation has been added in Section 4. Your
suggestions of measuring the porosity of samples after the cycling in different methods and
3
concern about the degradation sauces are constructive. The authors appreciate your
suggestions sincerely and intend to conduct more elaborate research on this specific topic in
future studies.
“A heating rate of 2°C/min and a cooling rate of 1°C/min were provided, respectively,
to ensure the the thermal equilibration of samples [14].”
