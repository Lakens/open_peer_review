The use of a LIDAR system for the monitoring of flying animals is used in this very interesting
contribution. I am not commenting on the system’s performances because I am not a LIDAR
expert, but I find that the perspective of using such a system for ecological and behavioural
studies of flying animals is exciting. The study is the first ever, to my best knowledge, to use such
an approach. Of course, there are significant limitations, such as the impossibility of telling apart
bats from birds, but the authors discuss this and I think that the ground surveys and field
observation the authors carried out did the job of eliminating all source of ambiguity. I found the
ms clear and well written, and I only have minor comments, as detailed below.
Specific comments:
Abstract, Lines 21-23 “A comparable…” this sentence is unclear, probably a few words are
missing
P. 3. Line 21 “and which are included in this study”. Please delete. It is misplaced here.
P.3 lines 32-34. In the introduction, the antipredatory hypothesis is presented as a fact explaining
why bats are nocturnal. It is not, unfortunately, yet an excellent model – I agree. A couple of more
studies that may help support this point:
Mikula, P., Morelli, F., Lucan, R. K., Jones, D. N. and Tryjanowski, P. (2016), Bats as prey of
diurnal birds: a global perspective. Mammal Review, 46: 160–174.
Russo D., Maglio G., Rainho A., Meyer C.F. & Palmeirim J. (2010). Out of the dark: diurnal
activity in the bat Hipposideros ruber on São Tomé island (West Africa). Mammalian Biology 76:
701-708.
Page 4, lines 9-14. I think the study would benefit from the formulation of specific hypotheses
and predictions rather than questions, as done here. I think the authors may easily do that based
on their data.
P. 5, lines 5-9. Is there any risk that traps attracted insects influencing LIDAR data? The authors
might argue that the traps were set far enough from the LIDAR scene so any influence was
negligible, but then one might wonder whether the trapping was still representative of what was
happening on the LIDAR scene. Please address this point either in the M&M or in the discussion.
P. 8 line 46: “suite”. Not sure this is the appropriate word here.
P. 11 line 50. Is that a shift? "Shift" indicates displacement, but based on these observations, one
can only speak of separation and say that a divide exists between activity peaks of insects and
bats. This divide is likely the result of a shift.

The authors state that their main aim was to perform "an evaluation of the performance of the
new Lidar system under real field conditions, to illustrate its possibilities and constraints" In this
sense, this paper does a good job and I find the possibilities exciting. However, I have several
suggestions how to improve the manuscript.
Because the main aim is to present the method and analyze its potential, I would like the authors
to invest more efforts in explaining how it works for non-experts. I am not familiar with Lidar,
and I was missing some technical information in order to understand how the system works. For
example, when the authors refer to a 1kHz sampling rate, is this how often the information from
a single beam is collected (i.e., a beam is emitted every 1ms) or is this the rate with which the
signal is sampled? If it is the latter, how often is a beam emitted and how often is a 360 degrees
scan completed? I Also, how does occlusion work? i.e., if there is a large object at angle theta at
10m, can you see anything behind it?
I am also not sure what does this mean: "The total air volume covered by the laser beam in our
experiment was ca 2.5 m3" The authors say that the system provides information from up to ca.
500m, so the volume covered by it is much larger than 2.5m3. Is this the instantaneous beam? It
would probably be more informative to know what are the beam's angles.
What about altitude limit? Does the system only allow documenting whatever occurs (or crosses)
4m height?
The authors state that "In this work, only the data from the co-polarized exposures have been
analysed." What wat the reason for this decision? What is the difference between backscatter that
did and backscatter that did not change is polarization?
I did not understand this statement too: "The minimum detectable size of an organism is larger at
far distance than at close distance" Can this be clarified? The backscatter decreases with range,
but so does the target signal right? So how come SNR improves?
Another weakness of the paper is lack of validation. I understand that full validation is hard to
get, but some validation could probably be obtained without too much effort and it would
substantially help judging the method. For example, what is the smallest insect that the system
can detect (during day or night)? This might not influence temporal patterns, but it might, if it
4
depends strongly on humidity or temperature. Can it be that a mosquito is more than one
mosquito? No validation is shown. This could strongly effect the absolute activity numbers given
by the authors. How should I read the activity axes? As arbitrary units? The authors could
probably throw some insects into the air (from below or from above) and examine how the
system detects them. It is also fairly easy to use ultrasonic recordings to assess bat activity (in
order to compare relative [not absolute] temporal activity patterns).
The authors claim that "For example, it was quite surprising that bat activity was so high and
persistent over the field", But as I understand it, it could have been 1 bat that was detected ca. 100
times in a 10 minute period. I am exaggerating of course, but this emphasizes that there is no info
on how to read the numbers and how the authors interpret them.
The authors state that: " However, the mean time delay between the insect and bat activity peaks
was as much as 37 minutes, and the null hypothesis (that bat and insect activity coincide) can be
rejected " How can a null hypothesis be rejected based on 2 observations?
The authors claim that: "The bats observed over the field at dusk and dawn frequently made
chases and dives, as expected if they were actively hunting insects." But there is no explanation
how this could be determined?
Finally, most of the results seem qualitative and are not quantified:
Based on figures 4 and 6 the increase in bat/bird activity during dusk and dawn does not seem
substantial (actually during dawn it does not seem significant). The authors do not quantify this
increase statistically. They could for example, compare it to supposedly random fluctuations
during the night.
The delay analysis presented in figure 7 should be better explained.
The authors suggest that " alternatively, the density of aerial insects may be reduced by predation
as soon as the bats emerged and started to feed" but this seems very unlikely when following
their data and reasoning that shows that the increase in bat activity starts after the decline has
already begun. Also, it is hard ot believe that bats can affect the

SPONSE: The reviewer makes a good point. The traps were not used during the time periods

SPONSE: Agreed
VISION: The word has been replaced by “visually observed bats”.

SPONSE: reviewer makes a good point.
VISION: This has been rewritten (p. 11) in order to make this clear. “Separation” replaces
cape” and “shift”.
viewer 2:
-1: I would like the authors to invest more efforts in explaining how it works for non-experts.
m not familiar with Lidar, and I was missing some technical information in order to
erstand how the system works.
SPONSE: We see this point and agree.
VISION: The description of the Lidar system has been somewhat extended and clarified in the
tion Description of the Lidar system. We have also referred more extensively to details to be
nd in more specialized physics journals. There is always a trade off in how detailed one could
before destroying the flow and readability of a subject interface paper, like this one. We believe
now have achieved a reasonable compromise, and met the point raised.
-2: When the authors refer to a 1kHz sampling rate, is this how often the information from a
gle beam is collected (i.e., a beam is emitted every 1ms) or is this the rate with which the
nal is sampled?
SPONSE: This is how often one beam is sampled by the detector. The sampling rate of the
ector is 3 kHz but we divide the sampling into three. During the first exposure one of our
rs are on, during the next exposure the second laser is on, and during the third exposure both
rs are off to record the optical background. This results in an effective sampling rate of 1 kHz
laser band. Polarization multiplexing is also described in reference 32 (Mei. L et al,
evelopment of an atmospheric polarization Scheimpflug lidar system based on a time-division
ltiplexing scheme”).
VISION: The description of the sampling rate (p. 6) has been edited, to make this clear.
-3: How often is a beam emitted?
SPONSE: Each laser diode is emitting for 333 µs and repeated every 1 millisecond.
VISION: See revision R2-2.
-4: How often is a 360 degrees’ scan completed?
SPONSE: We think the reviewer has misunderstood what our Lidar transect is like in this
dy. We do not scan our laser beam. The Lidar transect is horizontal and static, shown by
re 1, e.g. it covers the same horizontal air volume throughout the measurements.
VISION: The fact that the Lidar transect is static and horizontal has now been clarified in the
tion Study site and data collection.
-5: How does occlusion work? i.e., if there is a large object at angle theta at 10m, can you see
thing behind it?
SPONSE: If the “object” is dilute like an aerosol plume, then yes, we can profile the
centration. If the object is sparse like vegetation, then yes, we may be able to see echoes
ond although this is suboptimal and may not yield good data quality. If the target is opaque
block the entire beam e.g. ø10cm, then no, we do not see beyond.
ou compare to Radar, then Lidar beam quality is much better. We are able to arrange transect
de forest as long as there is line of sight. This is not possible with radar because of side lobes
ground clutter.
his study, the transect is free from solid static objects. Large organisms can obscure the
aining transect. In practice, large organisms have a high velocity and appear in the beam for
w milliseconds while insects on average appear during 20 milliseconds. Living organisms
ount for some 1% of the data whereas the remaining 99% of data is clean air. Therefore, the
lihood of two simultaneous observations is in the order of 1:10.000. Insects appear about 100
es more frequently than vertebrates, so the chance of a vertebrate obscuring an insect is in the
er of 1:1.000.000. The chance that they enter and leave the beam simultaneously is even
aller.
-6: I am also not sure what does this mean: "The total air volume covered by the laser beam in
experiment was ca 2.5 m3" The authors say that the system provides information from up to
500m, so the volume covered by it is much larger than 2.5m3. Is this the instantaneous beam?
ould probably be more informative to know what are the beam's angles.
SPONSE: See response R2-4. We have a horizontal, static beam which is terminated on a
ck screen. In this study the transect was limited by the size of the experimental grounds. In
ther fauna study (Brydegaard et al, ILRC27), the maximum range was approximately 2 km.
record, so far, is a beam termination about 12 km away on cliff wall in Stellenbosch. See
degaard et al, “Realistic Instrumentation Platform for Remote Sensing” Appl. Spec. More
rmation about the probe volume can be found in reference 26 (Brydegaard et al, 2017, SPIE
ceedings). It is important to point out that the probed volume is also smaller than the beam
ume. One reason is that there are regions where the overlap between the FOV of the detector
the laser beam is incomplete. The probed volume is also limited by the size of the pixels on
detector.
VISION: The fact that the beam is static and horizontal has been made more clear in section
dy site and data collection and a reference has been added where information on how the the
of the probe volume can be estimated.
-7: What about altitude limit? Does the system only allow documenting whatever occurs (or
sses) 4 m height?
SPONSE: See response R2-4. We have a horizontal, spatially static beam. For this campaign
have evaluated a horizontal Lidar transect since we wanted to monitor over different rice
ds. If it is desired, a vertical Lidar transect is also possible. Our record in altitude profiling
h Scheimpflug Lidar is a Cirrus cloud in Nyteboda, Sweden, at 14 km. This is unpublished.
reason why the Lidar transect was at a height of 4 m was mostly due to laser safety issues.
beam can also be scanned to produce 2D polar density, or 3D spherical density but this does
increase the number of observations per time unit (if organisms are evenly distributed).
-8: The authors state that "In this work, only the data from the co-polarized exposures have
n analyzed." What wat the reason for this decision?
SPONSE: The reason for this is that the spatial overlap between the two laser beams was not
d enough to properly match the signals from the two laser bands on an individual organism
el, and the co-polarized signal is the strongest of the two.
VISION: Section added on page 6 where polarization is mentioned.
-9: What is the difference between backscatter that did and backscatter that did not change is
arization?
SPONSE: The amount of light that has kept or lost its polarization after scattering can tell us
ut the microstructural properties of the material. Melanization can also affect the
olarization ratio. A shiny surface would give a large amount of co-polarized light while a
t surface would result in a larger amount of de-polarized light.
VISION: Despite the limited polarization work in this study, references for further reading
arding polarization and polarization Lidar have been added on page 6.
-10: I did not understand this statement too: "The minimum detectable size of an organism is
er at far distance than at close distance" Can this be clarified? The backscatter decreases with
ge, but so does the target signal right? So how come SNR improves?
SPONSE: This description was unclear. What we meant to say is that an organism has to be
er to be detected further away, i.e. the system has a bias towards detecting small organisms
se to the system. The smallest detectable size would get larger and larger further away from
Lidar system.
VISION: The sentence was changed into: “The minimum organism size that can be detected
the Lidar system increases with increasing range, due to the decreasing signal strength of the
kscattering at far distances. Small organisms are thus more likely to be detected close to the
tem than far away from it.”
-11: Another weakness of the paper is lack of validation. I understand that full validation is
d to get, but some validation could probably be obtained without too much effort and it would
stantially help judging the method “…” The authors could probably throw some insects into
air (from below or from above) and examine how the system detects them. It is also fairly
y to use ultrasonic recordings to assess bat activity (in order to compare relative [not absolute]
poral activity patterns).
SPONSE: We thank the reviewer for the suggestions and acknowledge that this is something
should be done in the future. However, this was not done during this study. To improve on
results, future measurements should be carried out with ultrasonic recordings which could
n be correlated with our Lidar data. Insect validation could be done by deadly traps that are
tinuously emptied and the insect identified and counted. For daytime observations of birds,
ual identification by telescope could be added.
-12: What is the smallest insect that the system can detect (during day or night)?
SPONSE: The smallest detectable target size during these measurements can be seen in the
er left corner of figure 5. Since it depends on the optical background level and on the range,
anisms with this size were most likely detected at night, close to the system. The implication
has on the data is discussed further in the supplementary material.
-13: Can it be that a mosquito is more than one mosquito? This could strongly effect the
olute activity numbers given by the authors.
SPONSE: In our raw data files, the different observations show up as sparse events in time
in space. An adaptive threshold algorithm is used to extract individual observations. There is
ourse a possibility that two mosquito observations are so close in time and space that they
ld be interpreted by the algorithm as one but in our experience this rarely occurs. See
ponse R2-5.
-14: How should I read the activity axes? As arbitrary units?
SPONSE: The activity axes is in number of observations detected per time unit. We cannot
ermine whether an individual organism is counted more than once and that is why our data is
elled “observations” and not “population size”. If we take it to the extreme and say that all
ervations are the result of one individual organism, we would still interpret an increase in
ervations of that individual during a specific time as higher activity during this time.
VISION: The section Sensitivity of Lidar system (P. 7) is renamed Lidar observations and
sitivity of the Lidar system and a clarification of how the “activity” data is interpreted has
n added.
-15: The authors claim that "For example, it was quite surprising that bat activity was so high
persistent over the field", But as I understand it, it could have been 1 bat that was detected
100 times in a 10-minute period. I am exaggerating of course, but this emphasizes that there
o info on how to read the numbers and how the authors interpret them.
SPONSE: The reviewer makes a valid point. Since we are doing untagged detection, we
not determine whether an individual organism is counted more than once and that is why our
a is labelled “observations” and not population size or number of individuals. One way to
w if we were counting an organism more than once would be to release animals that have
n tagged with a unique tag (e.g with fluorescence dye), but this would be a very different kind
tudy, requiring different instrumentation, and it would only include few individuals. There is,
hermore, no guarantee that a trapped animal would remain foraging in the area where they
captured. See also response R2-14.
VISION: The section Sensitivity of Lidar system (p. 7) is renamed Lidar observations and
sitivity of the Lidar system and a clarification of what the “activity” data has been added.
-16: The authors state that: " However, the mean time delay between the insect and bat
vity peaks was as much as 37 minutes, and the null hypothesis (that bat and insect activity
ncide) can be rejected " How can a null hypothesis be rejected based on 2 observations?
SPONSE: We agree with the reviewer.
VISION: The sentence is rewritten and the statement removed. P. 11, l. 10.
-17: The authors claim that: "The bats observed over the field at dusk and dawn frequently
de chases and dives, as expected if they were actively hunting insects." But there is no
lanation how this could be determined?
SPONSE: Agree. This statement was based on visual observations.
VISION: Added that the statement that the claim is based on visual observations (p. 8).
-18: Based on figures 4 and 6 the increase in bat/bird activity during dusk and dawn does not
m substantial (actually during dawn it does not seem significant). The authors do not quantify
increase statistically. They could for example, compare it to supposedly random fluctuations
ing the night.
SPONSE: The difference is very substantial, differing by an order of magnitude. The scale
the figures is logarithmic. We agree that a number of statistical layers could be applied to the
a, but with the restricted data at hand (only two days), we believe that the most transparent,
est and straight forward representation are histograms with adequate bin sizes.
horough statistical analysis of the pattern along the lines suggested will surely be an excellent
ject of the next paper, when we have more extensive data that we can assume are more
resentative.
-19: The delay analysis presented in figure 7 should be better explained.
SPONSE: Agreed
VISION: This has been clarified in section Dusk and dawn observations – rush hours on
e 10, and in the caption of figure 7.
-20: The authors suggest that " alternatively, the density of aerial insects may be reduced by
dation as soon as the bats emerged and started to feed" but this seems very unlikely when
owing their data and reasoning that shows that the increase in bat activity starts after the
line has already begun.
SPONSE: Yes, we agree, but we think the latter process (reduction of insects by predation)
uld still be worth mentioning although it probably is of secondary importance.
VISION: We have changed the text accordingly on Page 11.
