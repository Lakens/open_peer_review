1. The manuscript needs significant improvements in English:
For example, ‘The little change of the<U+03BB>SPR of AgNPs from A to C (see Figure S1) after adding 10
µM of UO22+ showed no aggregation of AgNPs.’ This is not a complete sentence.
‘The high background signal causes bad, even deadly effect for molecule detection, especially for
trace analysis.’ ‘Bad’ and especially ‘deadly’ are not good descriptive words.
‘The interaction between uranyl and Cit is complex’ was unclear. Do you mean the interaction
was to form complex or the interaction was complicated?
2. I recommend authors to report LOD in the abstract.
3. Condition D was not clear. What does it mean by ‘2 mL of water after twice centrifugation’
Need to describe better how condition D was prepared.
4. It was unclear which condition (A-D)was optimal.Looking at the data in Figure 1d, it seems
like condition D would be a good condition, because it was the only condition both that had both
peaks at 750 cm-1 and 930 cm-1. Condition C did not show the citrate peak at 930 cm-1.
5. I recommend authors to specify the condition A-D in the Figure 1 legend.
6. In Figure 3 legend. concentration from 5 uM to 0.1 uM should be changed to from 0.1 uM to 5
uM.
7. Figure 3b is cited wrong in the manuscript.
8. What is the detection capability of the UO2 in the presence of competitive metal ions?
9. Figure 4 does not show the method is selective to detecting UO2. To show a method that is
selective to UO2, the method should have about the same amount UO2 intensity while high
concentrations of competitive metal ions are present. Figure 4 only shows the method is sensitive
to detecting UO2 comparing to detecting other metal ions.

The authors introduced a simple and convenient wet state SERS method for uranyl detection
based on the citrate stabilized silver nanoparticles, and this method had its own advantages
compared with others reported in the literature. The authors also mentioned the Raman signal
interference of citrate in SERS studies, which can be easy neglected by many researchers, this is a
good and important point. In general, the experimental data can support their views and the
manuscript can be considered for publication after the following questions have be solved
reasonably.
1.There are many aggregates in the SEM image of AgNPs, the authors needs to explain that and
provide low magnification SEM or TEM images to more clearly determine particle dispersion and
morphology uniformity.
2.From Figure 1(d), it can be seen that the intensity of uranyl band decreases with the increase of
citrate. The authors claimed that can be explained by the complex of UO22+ moiety with
excesscitrate free in solution, which has no contribution to the uranyl band. This explanation is
not convincing enough, because the increase of citrate will protected AgNPs from aggregation,
which may also induce the decrease of the Raman intensity. So the authors should provide more
experimental data (e.g. DLS results) to confirm whether the AgNPs aggregates or not after uranyl
addition.
3. The detection reproducibility of the proposed strategy between different batches of Ag
nanoparticle solution matrix should also needs to be investigated in this manuscript.

improving the manuscript, for some examples,

Reply: Thanks for your kindly suggestions. We have carefully
examined and corrected the language in the revised manuscript. Please
find more details in the revised manuscript.
2. I recommend authors to report LOD in the abstract.
Reply: According to your professional suggestion, we have added the
description of LOD in the abstract section. Please see more details on
Page 1 in the revised manuscript.
3. Condition D was not clear. What does it mean by ‘2 mL of water after
twice centrifugation’ Need to describe better how condition D was
prepared.
Reply: Thanks for your kindly suggestion. We have revised the
description for fabricating condition D.
--“ D) the colloid was centrifuged and washed with water for two times
and condensed by adding 2 mL of water,”-- Please find this sentence on
Page 3.
4. It was unclear which condition (A-D)was optimal. Looking at the
data in Figure 1d, it seems like condition D would be a good condition,
because it was the only condition both that had both peaks at 750 cm-1
and 930 cm-1. Condition C did not show the citrate peak at 930 cm-1.
Reply: Thanks for your kindly suggestion. The overage aggregation of
silver in condition D despite produced a good signal of Cit at 930 cm-1,
but obtained a low signal ratio of U/Cit, so the condition of sample C is
optimal. When the concentration of UO22+ is low, the signal of citrate
becomes clear (see Figure 3). And we also added the description of
optimal choice. --" So the condition C is an appropriate choice for uranyl
detection.”-- Please find this sentence on Page 4.
5. I recommend authors to specify the condition A-D in the Figure 1
legend.
Reply: According to your kindly suggestion, we added the description
of condition A-D in Figure 1 legend. Please see more details on Page 7.
6. In Figure 3 legend. concentration from 5 uM to 0.1 uM should be
changed to from 0.1 uM to 5 uM.
Reply: Thanks for your kindly suggestion. We have changed the
description in Figure 3 legend to “from 0.1 to 5 uM”.
7. Figure 3b is cited wrong in the manuscript.
Reply: Thanks for your kindly suggestion. We have corrected the wrong
citation.
--" After calibration and normalization by citrate, a good linear
relationship (R2=0.996) can be obtained between relative Raman
intensity (Iuranyl/Icirtrate) and uranyl concentration from 0.2 to 5 µM
(Figure 3 (b)).”-- Please find this sentence on Page 4.
8. What is the detection capability of the UO22+ in the presence of
competitive metal ions?
Reply: According to your professional suggestion, we added the
investigation of the proposed strategy for detecting UO22+ in the
presence of competitive metal ions. The interfere ions (e.g. Na+, Ca2+
and Cu2+) had no effect on the performance of the proposed strategy for
UO22+ detection (see Figure S5 in the Electronic Supplementary
Material).
9. Figure 4 does not show the method is selective to detecting UO22+. To
show a method that is selective to UO22+, the method should have about
the same amount UO22+ intensity while high concentrations of
competitive ions are present. Figure 4 only shows the method is
sensitive to detecting UO22+ comparing to detecting other metal ions.
Reply: Thanks for your professional suggestion. In order to show the
selectivity of the proposed method for UO22+ detection, we added the
selectivity investigation in the presence of high concentration of three
typical competitive metal ions (Na+, Ca2+ and Cu2+). And the result was
shown in Figure S5 in the Electronic Supplementary Material. The
interfere ions had no effect on the performance of the proposed strategy
for UO22+ detection, showing a good selectivity. --" At the same time,
the presence of other competitive metal ions had no effect on the relative
Raman intensity of uranyl ion (see Figure S5), indicating a good
sensitivity.”-- Please find this sentence on Page 5 in the revised
manuscript.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors introduced a simple and convenient wet state SERS method
for uranyl detection based on the citrate stabilized silver nanoparticles,
and this method had its own advantages compared with others reported
in the literature. The authors also mentioned the Raman signal
interference of citrate in SERS studies, which can be easy neglected by
many researchers, this is a good and important point. In general, the
experimental data can support their views and the manuscript can be
considered for publication after the following questions have be solved
reasonably.
1.There are many aggregates in the SEM image of AgNPs, the authors
needs to explain that and provide low magnification SEM or TEM
images to more clearly determine particle dispersion and morphology
uniformity.
Reply: Thanks for your professional suggestion. We have provided the
low magnification SEM image of AgNPs in the revised manuscript and
explained the reason of the aggregates.
--“The low magnification SEM image (see Figure S1) shows that the
average size of AgNPs with rather narrow size distribution is ~60 nm,
which guarantees high sensitivity, since larger size of nanoparticle can
produce more sensitive signal. The aggregates may be produced from
the nanoparticles aggregation when the colloid was drying.”-- Please
find these sentences on Page 3.
2.From Figure 1(d), it can be seen that the intensity of uranyl band
decreases with the increase of citrate. The authors claimed that can be
explained by the complex of UO22+ moiety with excess citrate free in
solution, which has no contribution to the uranyl band. This explanation
is not convincing enough, because the increase of citrate will protect
AgNPs from aggregation, which may also induce the decrease of the
Raman intensity. So the authors should provide more experimental data
(e.g. DLS results) to confirm whether the AgNPs aggregates or not after
uranyl addition.
Reply: Thanks for your professional suggestion. I agree with your point.
In fact, it is no doubt that the increase of citrate will protect AgNPs from
aggregation, and decrease the Raman intensity (the weak signal of Cit
can also prove that), so we think the DLS experiment is not very
necessary. In addition, the amount of Cit is far larger than that of UO22+
(Sample A and B), where the excess citrate free in solution will capture
UO22+ from being captured by silver. Thus the signal of uranyl in
Sample A and B is low. Thus we think these two factors contribute the
results. As for condition D, the silver NPs are aggregated deeply (we
can see a strong signal of Cit, and the color becomes darker, see Figure
1d), brought the sedimentation of silver. But an appropriate amount of
Cit in Sample C produced a strong signal of U/Cit, which is important
in sample analysis. Therefore, according to your suggestion, we
corrected the explanation in the revised manuscript.
--“ The increase of citrate will protect AgNPs from aggregation and
widen the distance between adjacent AgNPs, and thus decrease the
Raman intensity. In addition, the UO22+ moiety will complex with
excess citrate free in solution, preventing UO22+ from close to AgNPs,
which have no contribution to the uranyl band (Sample A and B).”--
Please find these sentences in Page 4.
3. The detection reproducibility of the proposed strategy between
different batches of Ag nanoparticle solution matrix should also needs
to be investigated in this manuscript.
Reply: According to your professional suggestion, we added the
reproducibility investigation of different batches of AgNPs colloids.
And the results were shown in the revised manuscript. --" In addition,
the RSDs of the inter-assay for UO22+ was 8.7% by using five batches
of different Ag nanoparticles colloids.”-- Please find this sentence on
Page 5.
