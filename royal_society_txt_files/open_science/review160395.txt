Review of Royal Society Open Science ms. RSOS-160395
Fouquet et al., “Seven and up: Individual differences in male voice fundamental frequency
emerge before puberty and remain stable throughout adulthood”
General comments:
This concise paper reports interesting longitudinal data on male speakers’ F0, drawn from
analyses of the “Up” series of films. The study was carefully conducted and the data will be of
interest to a range of speakers. In my opinion it will be acceptable for publication after some
relatively minor revisions.
I have three primary concerns. First is the structure of the introduction. As written, all the
information is there that is needed to motivate the hypothesis (which is clearly stated), but the
material is arranged in such a way that it seems unfocused, rather clearly leading the reader to
the hypothesis (which on first reading seems unmotivated as a result). I suggest re-writing this
section of the paper so that it provides theoretical background, and not just results of previous
literature, so that we understand why this work is important to begin with.
My second concern is with the amount of information provided about the voice samples. The
authors state that clips were chosen only from interviews (which is good), but the topic of the
particular interview questions could have a significant impact on F0 due to varying emotions.
Some information about topics would be helpful for readers who are concerned about this
possibility. Also, a small table showing the number of clips and their total duration in the main
text would also be useful. I haven’t seen any of these films for a while—did the number of
interviews vary across the speakers, so that there is day-to-day variability in some cases but not
in others?
Finally, the results and discussion seem somewhat overstated given that only 10 speakers were
studied, with complete data for only 6. There are no data available about hormone levels in these
speakers, so discussion of this aspect of the study should be moderated and clearly marked as
speculative. Also, the authors might consider referring to Houri Vorperian’s work on
development of the vocal tract, which could add some further support to their arguments.
Minor suggestions:
Figure 2 is missing from the manuscript.
Throughout the paper, beginning with the first line of the abstract, the distinction is blurred
between the acoustic measure of fundamental frequency (F0) and its perception as pitch. Please
clarify the distinction and be sure you are using the correct term through the paper.
P. 3, line 18: “babies” should be either baby’s or babies’.
p. 8, line 14: I truly dislike claims of priority (“Our longitudinal study is the first…”). They are
impossible to prove, and they seem overly boastful for formal scientific writing. I strongly
suggest removing this wording, and rewriting line 17-18 to read “…two additional findings.

This manuscript makes a fine contribution to the literature on human vocalization. While
research has focused on uncovering the vocal traits most salient in influencing human behavior
by associating variation in such traits with variation in fitness-relevant outcomes, such studies
have tended to employ, as the authors note, cross-sectional designs. As such, this line of research
has been limited to inferences from sample means rather than evidence possible via longitudinal
designs. The present manuscript addresses this deficiency, examining temporal change in pitch
over 50 years for the same individuals. In addition to corroborating pubertal decreases in pitch,
the authors demonstrate that childhood pitch is predictive of adulthood pitch, which remains
relatively stable. The former finding highlights the importance of early organizational effects of
sex hormones and suggests that individual differences in vocal pitch, a trait with demonstrated
fitness implications, are present very early in life.
Although acceptance for publication in R. Soc. Open Sci. is not contingent on a manuscript’s
perceived impact, the present research is likely to have a substantial impact. The paper’s
methodological novelty and important insights will make it a valuable reference for researchers
in acoustics, traditional behavioral sciences, and human evolutionary biology. As such, I
recommend acceptance with the following minor revisions:
1. I would consider removing Seven and Up from the title. In addition to conjuring images
of a carbonated beverage for some audiences, particularly those unfamiliar with the Up Series, its
connection to the subtitle is not apparent without knowledge of the paper’s contents (by contrast,
e.g., Chimps of a feather sit together: chimpanzee friendships are based on homophily in
personality). More importantly, however, unnecessarily lengthening the paper’s title might
detract from its findings. See the following recommendation from the publisher:
“Vast numbers of scientific articles are published each year, some of which attract considerable
attention, and some of which go almost unnoticed. Here, we investigate whether any of this
variance can be explained by a simple metric of one aspect of the paper's presentation: the length
4
of its title. Our analysis provides evidence that journals which publish papers with shorter titles
receive more citations per paper. These results are consistent with the intriguing hypothesis that
papers with shorter titles may be easier to understand, and hence attract more citations.”
2. Since the paper’s focus is male voice pitch, since this is what is advertised in the title, and
since the small number of female participants precludes meaningful analyses for them, I wonder
whether they warrant inclusion and may distract the reader from the important findings
concerning men (I assume this is why the female data are graphically depicted only in the
supplemental information). If there are not more females regularly featured in the Up Series, it
might be best to produce a female-focused companion paper in the future using a different
dataset.
3. p. 3, ll. 15-16: 80 to 175 Hz should be 80 and 175 Hz; 160 to 270 Hz should be 160 and 270
Hz
4. p. 3, l. 18: babies should be babies’; sex should be used in lieu of gender
5. p. 3, l. 23: The authors should clarify that reference 18 (Apicella et al., 2007) examined
reproductive success in a natural fertility population and that reference 19 (Puts, 2005) examined
self-reported mating success.
6. p. 3, ll. 23-24: The authors should add language making clear that low male pitch could
have evolved to advertise physical formidability (the papers cited at the end of the sentence are
suggestive of this).
7. p. 5, ll. 1-7: It would be helpful for the authors to include a few more sentences to
introduce the Up Series so that it is clear why recordings from these participants were chosen in
lieu of those from other archival recordings (e.g., convenience only?). Additionally, it is unclear
from either text or supplemental material whether all participants or only a subset were included.
8. p. 10, l. 1: between 110 to 230 Hz should be between 110 and 230 Hz
9. p. 10, ll. 2-5: Can the authors please elaborate a little on their predictions for the increase
in pitch for the measurements at age 28? In addition, the authors’ statement of restricting the
sample to recordings of interviews could be complimented by a discussion of other factors that
potentially influence individual differences in voice pitch (e.g., were any of the participants
clinically depressed?). Though the authors may not have access to this type of information for the
participants used, addressing such potential influences while also noting the consistent
relationships voice pitch exhibits over time in their data may help to underscore the findings.

Comments to the Author:
Dear Dr Pisanski, Dr Reby,
I have now received reviews of your manuscript from two experts in the field. As you will see
from their comments, they both viewed your study and manuscript favourably, and I am happy
to recommend it as suitable for publication pending minor revisions.
7
Please consider carefully all the points made by the reviewers. I agree with both that there is
scope for some more detail on the stimuli used - while factors like emotional state and context
cannot be accounted for in the analyses, I think readers would find it helpful to know something
more about the variability of samples in the set (see Reviewer #1's query about the number of
interviews within each episode). I would also encourage you to revisit the Introduction in terms
of giving a stronger theoretical motivation for the work - it is true that this study presents a very
important methodological advance over previous work, but why is the subject matter of
importance to the field?
Thank you again for submitting your work to Royal Society Open Science. I look forward to
receiving the revised manuscript.
Best wishes

y second concern is with the amount of information provided about the voice samples. The

noted in the original manuscript, several factors were coded for during the extraction of
ice clips, including the context and recording conditions of each clip. On the basis of this
formation, we selected for analysis only clips from interviews, those without background
ise, and importantly, as noted by the Reviewer, those lacking strong emotional content.
us, clips coded as containing highly valenced (e.g., angry) speech or chaotic vocalizations
g., laughing, crying, shouting) were excluded from acoustic analysis. We have now
cluded these details in our Methods:
“Short audio clips of speech were extracted from each Up Series DVD and saved as
WAV files with Audacity v.1.2.6. We extracted a total of 300 voice clips with an average
duration of 11.3 ± 6.6 s, while documenting the speaker, context, and recording
conditions (e.g., setting, noise level) of each clip. To standardize these variables and
reduce potential contextual or social influences on vocal production, we analysed only
voice clips extracted from interviews, as well as those in which background noise was
negligible and strong emotional content was absent (257 clips). Hence, clips containing
crying, whispering, shouting) were excluded from acoustic analysis. Multiple voice clips
were extracted for each individual at each given age (see Table 1 for duration and
number of voice clips, and participation record).” (Page 6)
so, a small table showing the number of clips and their total duration in the main text would also
useful. I haven’t seen any of these films for a while—did the number of interviews vary across
e speakers, so that there is day-to-day variability in some cases but not in others?
suggested we have included a new table (Table 1) indicating the total duration and
mber of clips extracted for each participant at each given age. As noted in the manuscript,
ultiple voice clips were always extracted for each participant at each age (M=3.2 ± 1.7
ps), with only one exception of a single voice clip (ID 10, age 7). Therefore the degree of
riability was similar across participants.
nally, the results and discussion seem somewhat overstated given that only 10 speakers were
died, with complete data for only 6. There are no data available about hormone levels in these
eakers, so discussion of this aspect of the study should be moderated and clearly marked as
eculative. Also, the authors might consider referring to Houri Vorperian’s work on development
the vocal tract, which could add some further support to their arguments.
e have included disclaimers to the effect:
“Although hormone levels were not accessible in this study, our findings, combined
with those of previous studies demonstrating the effects of testosterone on laryngeal
and vocal fold morphology and on subsequent voice pitch production, suggest that pre-
pubertal and potentially even prenatal androgen levels may explain a significant
portion of the variance in adult F0.” (Page 11)
“While clearly challenging, future studies may also examine the degree to which sex
hormone levels, which we were not able to access in the present study, correlate with
voice F0 across the lifespan.” (Page 13)

e have revised the text in the Abstract and throughout the manuscript such that we refer

males (of which there were indeed only 4) from the manuscript and from the

“The Up Series documentary included four women, however this sample size was too
small to be sufficiently representative. Replication studies should therefore include
women to test whether individual differences in F0 also emerge before puberty among
females” (Page 13)

p. 3, l. 23: The authors should clarify that reference 18 (Apicella et al., 2007) examined
productive success in a natural fertility population and that reference 19 (Puts, 2005) examined
lf-reported mating success.
e have included these details (please note that text and reference numbers have changed
ghtly following revisions. In the revised MS Apicella et al. 2007 is reference 10, and Puts
05 is reference 9):
“Dozens of studies indicate that men with relatively low-pitched voices are judged as
more attractive by female listeners ([8] for review) and enjoy higher reproductive
success (e.g., report higher numbers of sexual partners [9] and have more children born
to them in a natural fertility population [10]).” (Page 3)
p. 3, ll. 23-24: The authors should add language making clear that low male pitch could have
olved to advertise physical formidability (the papers cited at the end of the sentence are
ggestive of this).
e have included the suggested additional text:
“A growing body of research suggests that men’s F0 has undergone intense sexual
selection to advertise masculinity, mate quality and threat potential [7].” (Page 3)
“Men with low-pitched voices are also judged as physically larger and stronger, more
socially dominant, and more competent than are men with higher-pitched voices ([11]
differences in physical body size [12], men with relatively low F0 have higher
circulating levels of testosterone [5,7,13–15] and are indeed more formidable than are
men with higher F0 [16].” (Page 3)
p. 5, ll. 1-7: It would be helpful for the authors to include a few more sentences to introduce
e Up Series so that it is clear why recordings from these participants were chosen in lieu of those
m other archival recordings (e.g., convenience only?). Additionally, it is unclear from either text
supplemental material whether all participants or only a subset were included.
e have expanded the Methods to include additional details regarding both the participants
d the Up Series itself. As requested we state explicitly that we analysed the voices of all 10
en who took part in the series, not just a subset. Under ‘Audio Extraction’ we also note that
ble 1 functions as a participation record (i.e. blank cells indicate instances in which a
rticipant did not take part in the documentary at that particular age). We specify that
terviews, which we also now describe in more detail (see below), offer a large longitudinal
pertoire of standardised voice recordings. This is the key reason why we chose the Up
ries for our study.
low we include an excerpt of the revised subsection ‘Voice Sample and Up Series’.
“We analysed the voices of all 10 men who took part in the British documentary the Up
Series [31]. All were born in England in the year 1956 and were audio-video recorded
for the series once every seven years from age 7 to age 56. The Up Series was first
broadcast in 1964 (Seven Up!), with subsequent documentaries debuting in 1970 (7 Plus
Seven), 1977 (21 Up), 1984 (28 Up), 1991 (35 Up), 1998 (42 Up), 2005 (49 Up), and 2012
(56 Up) [31]. In addition to 10 men, the Up Series also followed the lives of 4 British
women, however due to this small and unrepresentative sample, data from these
women were not included in the current study.
The original aim of the documentary, in 1964, was to get a glimpse of England at the
turn of the millennium, at a time when “the shop-stewards and executives of the year
2000 are now seven years old” [32]. The directors chose children from various socio-
economic backgrounds. Each episode of the Up Series features interviews in which the
participants of the documentary are asked to discuss their personal and professional
lives, their values and aspirations, and to share their opinions on a range of topics.
These interviews offer a large and longitudinal repertoire of standardised voice
recordings.” (Pages 5-6)
p. 10, l. 1: between 110 to 230 Hz should be between 110 and 230 Hz
e have implemented this correction.
p. 10, ll. 2-5: Can the authors please elaborate a little on their predictions for the increase in
ch for the measurements at age 28? In addition, the authors’ statement of restricting the sample
recordings of interviews could be complimented by a discussion of other factors that potentially
luence individual differences in voice pitch (e.g., were any of the participants clinically
pressed?). Though the authors may not have access to this type of information for the
rticipants used, addressing such potential influences while also noting the consistent
llowing the Reviewer’s suggestions we have expanded on our Discussion as follows:
“Although our findings demonstrate longitudinal stability in men’s average F0, this
voice feature is known to vary at the intra-individual level as a function of mood and
prosodic expression ([40] for review). Hence, all acoustic analyses were performed on
speech from interviews that lacked strong emotional content, and F0 measures were
averaged across multiple interviews for each individual at each age. This allowed us to
compute representative, average F0 measures for each individual and to largely control
for the influence of emotions, such as intense stress or excitement, on voice production.
Intriguingly, we observed a transient but systematic increase in men’s F0 parameters
at age 28. We predict that this brief rise in F0 may be related to social life events, such
as first marriage and childbirth, which often take place around this age among
European men. Indeed, cues to mating and parenting effort may manifest in the voice,
either through the behavioural mechanism of volitional voice modulation [41] or
through physiological changes in the body (e.g., changes in relative hormone levels
[7,13–15]) that could in turn have an indirect effect on vocal production. While there is
some evidence of lower testosterone levels in married versus unmarried men and
among those with children versus those without (see e.g., [42–44]), it remains unclear
whether this reflects between-individual differences or within-individual fluctuation in
androgen levels. The potential influence of social life events on vocal production
warrants investigation using a larger longitudinal dataset.” (Pages 12-13)
