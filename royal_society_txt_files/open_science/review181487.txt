label_comment_2
This manuscript examines the seasonal and diel acoustic behaviour of southern right whales at a
remote calving ground using PAM. The paper jumps between focusing on PAM and SRW
acoustic ecology, which leads to a lack of conceptual flow. A little more cohesion between the
concepts will help the manuscript flow better (e.g., acoustic ecology of a difficult to study species
is revealed by PAM). A thorough read of the manuscript is needed to ensure the grammatical
errors throughout are remedied. Some (but by no means all) are noted in the specific comments
below. There are too many Figures presented with the majority replicating information and can
be removed from the manuscript. What is missing, however, is a clear Table detailing the auto-
detector success/failure rates. After major revision the manuscript will be an important
contribution to the literature.

Specific comments are provided below:
Abstract
L3-6: I suggest combining these two sentences, and adding in a sentence about southern right
whales (e.g., distribution, ecology, etc.). Your opening paragraph in the Introduction focuses on
behaviour and yet your abstract focuses on PAM.
L10: add “detected” after call rates.
Background
L22-30: I suggest including the word “|diurnal” in this paragraph – as that is what you are
describing.
L54: Add “For example,” autonomous recordings....
This will allow your sentences to link better.
L64: You need a link to the previous paragraph, for example: “In the Southern Hemisphere, most
knowledge....”
L64-6: What about genetic studies? These have revealed information about migratory behavior,
etc. Please include.
L74: “an excellent tool to answer these questions”. Reword to something a little more focused on
your coming questions e.g., “provide/present a viable/robust tool for understanding the
seasonal and diurnal calling behavior of SRW”. This then links into your next paragraph.
L76-80: Q1 is basically revealed by Q2 so I don’t see why this is a separate focus. PAM is
important and will reveal presence. Again, is this paper focused on PAM or on the acoustic
ecology of the species? My feeling is the latter and PAM is the tool to get you to the important
questions about your species.
Methods
L86: delete “of”.
L103: i.e., a 12.5% duty cycle. Please add. Please also mention that a 4 kHz sampling rate covers
the vocalisation range of this species.
L105-12: Please include the specific depth at the deployment location and the depth of the
recorder in the water column.
L115-9: Your classification methods need to be expanded. So, you first manually scanned all
recordings for call presence. Does this include all calls no matter the SNR? If so, please state this
or the SNR you used as a cut off. Once a call was identified, you classified the call type based on a
previous quantitative classification of a subset of your data. Please include this information. From
here you then counted the number of calls and call types per recording/hour/day/month? More
information is required.
L122: all acoustic recordings or a subset? Please clarify.
L136: what about missed detections? How many calls were missed by the detector? There is no
Table in Results detailing number of calls manually classified, classified by detector, missed by
4
detector, missed by human, etc. Please add such a Table. [I see information is provided in the SI
but this should be summarised for the reader in a Table].
L163: delete “Program”.
L170: “calls” should be “call”.
L172: More information is required about the difference between positive and negative values.
“This correction resulted in a mean adjusted call rate where positive values indicate....”.
Results
Footnote 1 pg 9: remove “a” from the first sentence.
L200: This is half of a sentence. I suggest including a statement after this along the lines of “The
vocalisation rate increased sharply in May (41, 2.9), coinciding with ....[winter migration into the
area].”
I would like to see a Figure with spectrograms of the five major call types for the generalist
reader. Corresponding audio files would also be nice. Especially for the upcall, which you run
and auto detector on. Ideally, at least 5 examples of different upcalls would be good to see what
variability in call is allowable to be classified by the detector (and human as an upcall).
L245-57: This information should be presented in a clear Table outlining the detector’s success (or
failure). Number of calls manually detected, Number of calls autodetected, number of missed
calls, number of false detections – all with actual counts and percentages. Given this is then
discussed by month I suggest then breaking it down by month too. This was run on 10% of the
data – was this spread across all months? Please include more information in the methods at L133
to confirm this.
Discussion
After the focus of the paper is clarified (PAM or acoustic ecology), the Discussion can be
tightened to reflect the focus. I suggest adding a concluding paragraph to leave the reader with a
clear take home message.
Figures and Tables
There are too many figures.
Figure 2: delete figure as the information is explained in the text and covered in Figures 3 & 4.
Delete Figure 4 as Figure 5 provides more information. If the authors feel information from Fig. 4
needs to be included, this should be presented in a Table of call numbers.
Figure 6 & 7: more information about what positive and negative numbers mean is required.
Each Figure should be stand-alone and not require consultation with the main text.

3 1 Abstract
4
5
6
2 Autonomous recorders are frequently utilised for examining vocal behaviour of animals, and
7
8 3 are particularly effective in remote habitats. Here a system was employed to examine whether
9
10 4 the acoustic behaviour of southern right whales differed seasonally and throughout the day at
11
12 5 their main calving ground in New Zealand. An autonomous recorder was moored at the
13
14 6 isolated sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands for a year. Recordings were made in each month
15
16 7 except June, and vocalisations were audible in all months with recordings except January. A
17
18
8 total of 35,487 calls were detected, of which upcalls were the most common (11,623). Call
19
20
21 9 rate peaked in August (288±5.9 [SE] calls/hour) and July (194±8.3). Vocal behaviour varied
22
23 10 diurnally with highest call rates at dusk and night, consistent with the concept that upcalls
24
25 11 function primarily as contact calls. Zero-inflated model results confirmed that seasonal
26
27 12 variation was the most important factor for explaining differences in vocal behaviour. An
28
29 13 automated detector designed to expedite the analysis process for North Atlantic right whales
30
31
14 correctly identified 80% of upcalls, although false detections were frequent, particularly
32
33
34 15 when call rates were low. This study is the first to attempt year-round monitoring of southern
35
36 16 right whale presence in New Zealand.

3 21 Background
4
5 22 Animals vary their behaviour in response to a wide range of factors, including changes in
6
7 23 light levels [1], availability of prey [2], predation pressure [3,4] and weather conditions [5,6].
8
9 24 Similarly, vocal behaviour of many animals changes temporally. For example, terrestrial
10
11
12
25 species, such as wolves (Canis lupus [7]) and many temperate and tropical bird species [8],
13
14 26 exhibit higher levels of vocal activity during the late evening and dawn. The drivers of
15
16 27 temporal variation in vocal behaviour can be difficult to determine, but may relate to optimal
17
18 28 ambient noise and propagation conditions [9], energy reserves [10], predation risk [11] or
19
20 29 sociality [8,12]. The calling activity of frogs [13] and some insects [14,15] is correlated with
21
22 30 precipitation and temperature.
23
24
31
25
26
27 32 Marine mammals in general, and cetaceans in particular, are highly vocal, relying on sound
28
29 33 for communication [16], navigation [17] and feeding [18]. Consequently, the occurrence of
30
31 34 species-specific vocalisations can reveal information about a species’ presence. For example,
32
33 35 in the Gulf of Alaska, echolocation clicks made by sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus)
34
35 36 are detected more often in summer than in winter, consistent with known seasonal migration
36
37
37 of reproductive males from productive high latitudes in summer, to the lower latitudes
38
39
40 38 favoured by breeding females in winter [19]. Vocalisation types and rates can change over
41
42 39 short timescales (hours/days) or longer monthly or seasonal timescales revealing details of a
43
44 40 species’ behaviour. Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) from the eastern tropical Pacific
45
46 41 show higher vocalisation rates between February and June; thought to be associated with
47
48 42 their foraging behavior which is also highly seasonal [20]. Diel changes in acoustic behaviour
49
50
43 have been observed in both mysticetes [21,22] and odontocetes [23,24]. For example, sound

52
53 44 pressure levels of vocalisations of wintering humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) off

3 45 Maui increase at sunset, remain relatively high through the night and progressively decrease
4
5 46 from sunrise [25]. Vocal behaviour can also be used to infer the level and type of activity that
6
7 47 an animal is engaged in. Elevated echolocation rates and buzzes (associated with feeding)
8
9 48 indicate that foraging at night is the norm for several odontocete species, including harbour
10
11
12
49 porpoise (Phocoena phocoena [26]), finless porpoise (Neophocoena asiaorientalis [24]) and
13
14 50 Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus [23]).
15
16 51
17
18 52 Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has become an increasingly important research tool,
19
20 53 particularly for documenting a species’ presence [19,21] and how vocal behaviour changes
21
22 54 with time [20]. Autonomous recording systems used to detect species-specific calls and
23
24
25
55 monitor temporal variation in vocal behaviour have been fundamental to the establishment of
26
27 56 protection measures for North Atlantic right whales (NARWs, Eubalaena glacialis) in and
28
29 57 around shipping lanes [27]. Typically, passive acoustic detection and localisation of right
30
31 58 whales uses upcalls [28,29] which are the most common call type [30,31,32], and are
32
33 59 produced by both males and females [33,34]. PAM is increasingly used to monitor right
34
35 60 whales, particularly in remote regions or those with inhospitable weather conditions
36
37
61 [35,36,37]. Consequently, automated detection systems [28] have been developed to facilitate
38
39
40 62 processing the large quantities of data produced by PAM.
41
42 63
43
44 64 Most knowledge of the behaviour of southern right whales (SRWs, Eubalaena australis) in
45
46 65 New Zealand comes from visual surveys and observations at the sub-Antarctic Auckland
47
48 66 Islands [38,39,40,41]. Right whales are the only cetacean species known to be regularly
49
50
67 present in Auckland Islands waters [42] and arrive there each winter to calve [38]. Practical
51
52

3 69 wintertime window of up to eight weeks [39] little is known about how or when right whales
4
5 70 use this habitat. The vocal repertoire of SRWs at the Auckland Islands has received attention
6
7 71 recently [43], but we do not know how long SRWs are present in this habitat or how their
8
9 72 vocal behaviour varies over time. Given the limitations of the remote location and inclement
10
11
12
73 weather conditions in the sub-Antarctic, autonomous acoustic recorders [44] provide an
13
14 74 excellent tool to answer these questions.
15
16 75
17
18 76 This research addressed three specific questions: (1) what do autonomous acoustic recorders
19
20 77 reveal about the presence of whales at the Auckland Islands outside the winter breeding
21
22 78 season, (2) how do calls vary temporally, both seasonally and diurnally, and (3) how
23
24
25
79 effectively does an automated upcall detector developed for North Atlantic right whales [29]
26
27 80 perform for this population of whales?

31 82 Methods
32
33 83 Data collection
34
35 84 Recordings were made using a DSG-Ocean autonomous recorder (Loggerhead Instruments,
36
37
85 USA, www.loggerhead.com) moored in Laurie Harbour in Port Ross, a large, sheltered
38
39
40 86 harbour of at the northern end of the Auckland Islands (Figure 1), where SRWs occur at
41
42 87 highest densities [40]. The deployment location, in the upper reaches of Port Ross
43
44 88 (50°33.4’S, 166°12.3’E) was chosen for its physical characteristics: shallow depth (<20 m),
45
46 89 flat and sandy seabed, shelter from prevailing swells and minimal risk of fouling due to
47
48 90 vessels anchoring.

3 92 The DSG-Ocean is a digital recorder with a single HTI-96-MIN hydrophone (sensitivity: –
4
5 93 185.6 dBV/µPa, frequency response: 20 Hz - 50 kHz ± 3dB) and programmable sampling
6
7 94 rate and recording schedule. DSG-Ocean recorders have been used extensively for acoustic
8
9 95 studies on fish [45,46,47] and are increasingly used for marine mammal research [48].
10
11
12 96
13
14 97 A compromise between sampling rate and recording schedule was required to maximise data
15
16 98 quantity, given limited battery power, over an extended deployment period. A trial
17
18 99 deployment was made between 22 July and 1 August 2011 to verify that the recorder worked
19
20 100 and assess the practicality of the mooring system. During the test period the DSG-Ocean
21
22 101 recorded at a default sampling rate of 50 kHz, recording for 2.5 min every 30 min. The first
23
24
25
102 long-term deployment was from 6 August 2011 to 27 July 2012. The recorder was set to a
26
27 103 sampling rate of 4 kHz, recording for 3.75 min every 30 min.
28
29 104
30
31 105 The mooring system was designed without surface buoys or trailing lines to minimise
32
33 106 entanglement risk. The recorder was attached via a 1 m length of 5 mm nylon line (designed
34
35 107 to break in the event of an entanglement) to a c. 50 kg steel mooring weight. A second
36
37
108 mooring weight was connected to the first via 40 m of negatively buoyant 16 mm nylon rope.
38
39
40 109 The weights were deployed so the rope stretched taut along the seabed. A flotation collar
41
42 110 attached to the top of the PVC housing of the recorder ensured that it remained upright during
43
44 111 deployment. The recorder was retrieved by snagging the line between the two moorings with
45
46 112 a grapnel and winching it on board.

3 115 Acoustic data were first analysed manually using Raven Pro 1.5 (Bioacoustics Research
4
5 116 Program, Cornell University, www.birds.cornell.edu). All SRW vocalisations in each of the
6
7 117 recordings were highlighted and counted. Each vocalisation was assigned to one of nine types
8
9 118 (upcall, downcall, gunshot, high, pulsive, tonal low, very high, hybrid or blow) based on a
10
11
12
119 previously determined classification system [43].
13

15
16 121 Automated vocalisation detection
17
18 122 Acoustic recordings were also examined using an automated detector [29] in the eXtensible
19
20 123 BioAcoustic Tool (XBAT [49]) written in MATLAB (The Mathworks Inc., MA, USA). The
21
22 124 automated call detection algorithm is specifically designed to detect upcall vocalisations
23
24
25
125 produced by NARWs [29]. The XBAT detector was set at a correlation threshold of 0.4, a
26
27 126 value typically used for detections of NARW calls. Acoustic similarity between a call
28
29 127 template and possible upcall events was assessed using a Generalised Likelihood Ratio Test
30
31 128 (GLRT) based scheme, and all events exceeding this threshold were logged.

34
35 130 Verification of detector results
36
37
131 Manual and automated detections were compared in order to test the effectiveness and
38
39
40 132 sensitivity of the algorithm for detecting SRW upcalls. We randomly selected 10% (n =
41
42 133 1443) of the total number of recordings for verification analysis. Each recording was
43
44 134 reviewed in XBAT using the event palette to display all detection events logged by the
45
46 135 detector. The detection events were then annotated as either true or false upcall detections
47
48 136 based on the manual classification.

3 138 Two measures of detector performance were applied [50]. The first (Positive Predictive
4
5 139 Value; PPV) represents the proportion of the upcalls logged by the detector that were judged
6
7 140 by the human analyst to have been correctly assigned, and thus accounted for false positives.
8
9 141 The second measure (True Positive Rate, TPR) is the proportion of correctly assigned upcalls
10
11
12
142 logged by the detector, and accounted for false negatives.
13
14 143
15
16
17 144 Deviation of the automated detections from the number of manually detected upcalls was
18
19 145 examined using regression. In this context, the slope of the fitted line indicated bias (1:1 =
20
21 146 zero bias), while the fit of the line indicated consistency of assignment.

26 148 Statistical analyses
27
28
149 Acoustic recordings were examined for any seasonal or diel patterns in vocalisations. Data on
29
30
31
150 the timing of sunrise, sunset, transit time and nautical dusk/dawn at Port Ross were obtained
32
33 151 from Land Information New Zealand (LINZ, www.linz.govt.nz). Transit was defined as the
34
35 152 maximum altitude of the sun relative to the horizon. Nautical twilight was defined as the
36
37 153 period between nautical dawn (or dusk), when the sun is 12° below the horizon, and sunrise
38
39 154 (or sunset). Each acoustic recording was assigned to one of five diel periods: dawn (nautical
40
41 155 dawn to sunrise), morning (sunrise to transit), afternoon (transit to nautical dusk), dusk
42
43
44
156 (sunset to nautical dusk) and night (nautical dusk to dawn). The duration of each diel period
45
46 157 varied between season, with longer daylight hours in summer (mid-summer: dawn ˜2 h, day
47
48 158 ˜14 h, dusk ˜ 2 h, night ˜ 6 h) than winter (mid-winter: dawn ˜1.5 h, day ˜8 h, dusk ˜ 1.5 h,
49
50 159 night ˜ 13 h). Recordings were also classified by season; December to February was defined

8
9 163 All statistical analyses were carried out in Program R version 3.0.2 (R Development Core
10
11
12
164 Team 2004, www.R-project.org). To assess seasonal and diel variation in vocal behaviour,
13
14 165 hourly calling rates (all calls) and hourly upcall rates were calculated from the manual call
15
16 166 appraisal. Diel patterns were examined by comparing rates during hour-long time bins based
17
18 167 on local time (e.g. 00:00-01:00, 01:00-02:00) and diel periods (dawn, morning, afternoon,
19
20 168 dusk, night). Call rates were adjusted to correct for the variation observed during the year in
21
22 169 terms of total number of calls detected each day, i.e. to remove any influence of times with
23
24
25
170 very high calls rates. The corrections were calculated by subtracting the overall calling rate
26
27 171 (calls/h-1) for that 24-h day from the hourly calling rate within a particular period [51,52,53].
28
29 172 This correction resulted in a mean adjusted call rate. A Zero Inflated Model (ZIM) with a
30
31 173 negative binomial distribution was used to evaluate whether particular seasons and/or diel
32
33 174 periods were important for explaining differences in right whale call presence and call rate. A
34
35 175 ZIM is a two component mixture model [54] and was used in preference to a Generalised
36
37
176 Linear Model (GLM) because it accounted for the false zeros which may have been present
38
39
40 177 due to whales being absent from the study area [55]. The two components are a binomial
41
42 178 GLM which models the probability of obtaining a false zero, and a negative binomial GLM
43
44 179 which models the count data [55]. A log-likelihood ratio test [56] was used to determine
45
46 180 whether a poisson or negative binomial distribution best fitted the count data.

4
5 184 during which there were a total of 302 recording days (80.5% of deployment days, Figure 2),
6
7 185 resulting in 892 hours of acoustic data. No recordings were made after 24 May 2012 when
8
9 186 the batteries ran out1. The recorder was out of the water from 2-5 August 2011 inclusive. A

17
18 190 Right whale vocalisations were detected in all months with recordings except for January.
19
20 191 Vocalisation rates varied dramatically during the deployment period (Figure 3) and showed a
21
22 192 strong seasonal trend. Vocalisation rates were highest in the austral winter (219 ± 4.9 calls h-1
23
24
25
193 ±SE) and lowest during the summer (0.2 ± 0.06). A similar seasonal pattern was evident
26
27 194 when upcalls were examined separately (Figure 3).
28
29 195
30
31 196 The months with the highest call rates were August (288 ± 5.9 calls h-1) and July (194 ± 8.3).
32
33 197 Mean vocalisation rates remained relatively high in September (91 ± 3.6) before declining
34
35 198 through October (27 ± 7.2) and November (6 ± 0.7). No calls were observed in January and
36
37
199 although calls were detected in December, February, March and April, the mean rate was
38
39
40 200 very low (<1 call h-1). The vocalisation rate increased sharply in May (41 ± 2.9).
41
42 201
43
44 202 Upcalls were evident in all months that vocalisations were detected and upcall rate followed
45
46 203 a broadly similar trend to all vocalisations (Figure 3). Upcalls were the most prevalent of the
47
48 204 vocalisation types, 11,623 (33%) of all of the calls detected. These vocalisations typically
49
50
205 accounted for a smaller proportion of calls, 30 to 40%, between July and October when the

3 206 overall call rate was high, and rose to 93% in April and 100% in February when vocalisation
4
5 207 rates were low. Mean upcall vocalisation rates were highest in July (76 ± 4.1 calls h-1) and
6
7 208 August (60 ± 2.2).

10
11
12
210 Other vocalisation types (downcall, gunshot, high, hybrid, very high and blow; Webster et al.,
13
14 211 2016) were recorded much less frequently than upcalls, and in some months not at all (Figure
15
16 212 4). Collectively, however, these vocalisation types accounted for 67% of the total calls
17
18 213 observed. Hybrid, high and gunshot vocalisations exhibited similar patterns of seasonal
19
20 214 presence (Figure 4). Very high calls were only detected during a four month period between
21
22 215 July and October and at very low levels (< 1 call h-1). Seasonal patterns in vocal behaviour of
23
24
25
216 SRWs for the five most abundant call types (upcall, tonal low, pulsive, downcall and
26
27 217 gunshot) showed that call rate for each call type was highest during winter months and lowest
28
29 218 during summer months (Figure 5). The proportion of the five most abundant call types,
30
31 219 however, varied little over the year; upcall rates were highest, then tonal and pulsive calls,
32
33 220 and gunshots and downcalls were always the lowest (Figure 5).

41
223 While vocalisations were recorded during all hours of the day and night a strong diurnal
42
43 224 pattern was evident (Figures 6 and 7). Mean vocalisation rate increased during the evening
44
45 225 and remained high throughout the night. Mean adjusted call rates exhibited a similar diel
46
47 226 pattern to mean call rates and accounted for the fact that call rates were higher during winter
48
49 227 months (Figure 7). The same diel pattern was evident with higher call rates at dusk and night
50
51 228 when upcall rate was examined separately.

14 235 Modelling of effects on call presence and rate
15
16 236 A log-likelihood ratio test revealed that a negative binomial model best fitted the count data.
17
18 237 The ZIM results revealed a strong effect of season on presence and acoustic behaviour of
19
20 238 whales, and a lesser effect of diel period (Table 1). The ZIM coefficients showed that false
21
22 239 zeros were most likely to occur in summer, suggesting whales were more likely to be absent
23
24
25
240 from the study area. The count model coefficients suggest that call rate was significantly
26
27 241 higher in winter, when whales were more likely to be present. The count data also show that
28
29 242 call rates were higher during dusk and night time periods and lower in the morning.

34 244 Effectiveness of automated detector
35
36 245 The automated detector designed to identify NARW upcalls [29] worked well for detecting
37
38 246 SRW upcalls at the Auckland Islands. There was a positive relationship between the
39
40
41
247 manually observed and automatically detected upcalls, although the automated detector
42
43 248 picked out slightly more calls than the human analyst (Figure 9). The TPR (sensitivity) of the
44
45 249 detector was high; 80.4% (SE ± 1.7) of manually categorised upcalls were identified by the
46
47 250 detector. Thus the rate of missed calls was c.20%. The mean PPV of the detector was,
48
49 251 however, relatively low with only 40.4% (SE ± 1.9) of detected upcalls correctly identified.
50
51 252 Mean PPV was higher (47-67%) when monthly vocalisation rates were high, but dropped
52
53
253 between October and April to a mean of 16% when vocal activity was minimal. Therefore,

1
2
3 254 many false detections were made by the automated system, particularly when call rate was
4
5 255 low. A proportion of the false detections however, were other right whale call types (e.g. part
6
7 256 of a hybrid call). These were classified as false detections here because they were not strictly
8
9 257 upcalls.

14 259 Discussion
15
16 260 Seasonal variation
17
18
261 This study found that SRWs are present more often and for far longer periods than previously
19
20
21 262 observed at the Auckland Islands [39]. Call rates indicate that right whales are vocally active
22
23 263 (and therefore routinely present) between May and November. Except for January,
24
25 264 vocalisations were detected in every month of the year, indicating at least occasional presence
26
27 265 in these months. Previously, SRWs were thought to be present at the Auckland Islands from
28
29 266 early May to the end of September [39]. Long-term acoustic studies regularly find that
30
31
267 marine mammals are present far more frequently than observed visually [37,57]. Peak
32
33
34 268 vocalisation rates (July-August) occurred in the same months as previous visual observations
35
36 269 of peak abundance [39]. If SRWs are only passing through or using the outer part of the
37
38 270 harbour it is possible that they would not be detected due to the location of the recorder in the
39
40 271 inner part of Port Ross. Also, to be recorded, the whales have to be calling. For these reasons,
41
42 272 vocal measures of presence should be considered conservative indicators of SRW presence at
43
44
273 the Auckland Islands. It should also be noted that the long periods of silence, in January for
45
46
47 274 example, are presumed to indicate that whales are not present at the Auckland Islands, rather
48
49 275 than a change of behaviour that has resulted in the cessation of vocalisations. This is
50
51 276 consistent with what is known of seasonal migration behaviour of southern right whales, i.e.
52
53 277 offshore foraging in summer and inshore calving in winter [58]. Comparative analyses

3 278 between autonomous passive acoustic and visual techniques using a solar powered camera in
4
5 279 the Auckland Islands showed that both techniques were comparable for monitoring southern
6
7 280 right whale presence [59]. However, while the solar powered camera was able record
8
9 281 information over a longer period than the battery-limited acoustic recorder, the acoustic
10
11
12
282 recorder was less limited by weather conditions, sea state and light availability.
13
14 283
15
16 284 The vocalisation rate in winter was four times that of any other season. Consequently, the
17
18 285 ZIM results showed that seasonal variation was the biggest contributing factor to call
19
20 286 presence. Strong seasonal trends in call occurrence have been observed in other populations
21
22 287 of right whales [37,52]. Seasonal variability in call detection is unsurprising given that right
23
24
25
288 whales migrate between feeding and calving habitats [58]. Taken together, however, the
26
27 289 acoustic studies show that right whales are present in particular habitats more often than
28
29 290 expected given what was previously understood of their movements.
30
31 291
32
33 292 Upcalls were the most abundant call type detected (33%) and remained so throughout the
34
35 293 year. Recent research [60] on NARW vocalisations also found upcalls to be the most
36
37
294 frequently used call type, although they constituted a higher proportion (49%) of all calls than
38
39
40 295 in this study. This variation in proportion could be the result if comparing two different
41
42 296 (albeit closely related) species. Given that upcalls appear to function as contact calls [30,61]
43
44 297 it makes sense that they are the most commonly produced call type. In-situ recordings made
45
46 298 in July and August indicate that upcalls are made similarly often to tonal low and pulsive
47
48 299 calls [43]. This underscores the value of the much larger dataset provided via autonomous
49
50
300 recording.

3 302 Previous studies have shown that right whales use specific calls in different behavioural
4
5 303 contexts [33,34,62] and that the relative proportion of call types varies both seasonally and
6
7 304 geographically [44]. In this study very high, hybrid, high and gunshot calls were observed
8
9 305 only during a period of between four to six months of the year. This potentially indicates a
10
11
12
306 seasonal change in behaviour, or may simply reflect the low call rates detected outside the
13
14 307 main winter period. Gunshots, hybrid and high calls are understood to be related to mating
15
16 308 activities [34,62] and the relative proportions of these calls increase during the breeding
17
18 309 season [44,63]. The Auckland Islands are the major calving grounds for SRWs in New
19
20 310 Zealand waters [39,40], but it is currently unclear where most mating occurs. Despite
21
22 311 extensive photo-identification work (Rayment, unpub. data), no female right whale has been
23
24
25
312 seen at the Auckland Islands in the year before giving birth. If the gestation period is about a
26
27 313 year, as in SRWs in South Africa [64], the Auckland Islands are not likely to be the principal
28
29 314 mating site for SRWs in New Zealand. Further acoustic monitoring and exploration of other
30
31 315 areas such as Campbell Island [65] may help locate the main mating habitat for this
32
33 316 population.

318 Diel variation
39
40 319 Call rates showed a clear diel pattern, with more vocal activity at dusk and during the night
41
42 320 than during the day (dawn, morning and afternoon). Upcalls showed a similar pattern when
43
44 321 examined separately. Mean adjusted vocalisation rates, which compensated for the high
45
46 322 winter call rates, also exhibited the same diel pattern.
47
48 323
49
50
324 The rate at which right whales call varies with call type, activity of the whales, group
51
52
53 325 composition and group size [33,63,44]. Right whales call more often during twilight and

3 326 night in winter calving areas [66] and on feeding grounds [52,53,63]. On feeding grounds, the
4
5 327 behaviour of NARWs is strongly influenced by the diel migration of copepods, their primary
6
7 328 prey [67]. This extends to their vocal behaviour; where an inverse relationship between
8
9 329 foraging and call production has been suggested [63]. Daily activity cycles dictated by prey
10
11
12
330 availability have also been observed for other mysticetes and are often linked to the vertical
13
14 331 migration of prey [20,51]. Sei whales (Balaenoptera borealis) called more frequently during
15
16 332 the day when prey was less available and hence the whales were not feeding [22]. The high
17
18 333 rate of NARW upcalls during twilight periods is considered to be a reflection of prey
19
20 334 distribution, i.e. when prey are more dispersed and foraging intensity is lower, call rate
21
22 335 increases [53]. There is little evidence of right whales feeding at the Auckland Islands [38]
23
24
25
336 and baleen whales seldom feed whilst on calving grounds [68]. It is therefore unlikely that
26
27 337 vocalisation rates at the Auckland Islands are much affected by prey availability. Diel
28
29 338 patterns in vocalisation rate could also indicate a change in social behaviour or a general
30
31 339 increase in activity or communication [33]. In NARWs gunshot calls, potentially indicative of
32
33 340 mating activity, are most frequent in the late afternoon and evening [69]. Chorusing by
34
35 341 humpback whales on wintering grounds in Hawaii increases at night, both in terms of
36
37
342 amplitude and the number of whales involved [25]. While there was little change in the
38
39
40 343 relative proportions of different call types throughout the day, SRWs at the Auckland Islands
41
42 344 vocalise more at dusk and night. This may be because reduced visual contact in the dark
43
44 345 increases the need for acoustic communication, particularly between mother-calf pairs. Risk
45
46 346 of predation is likely to be low for SRWs at the Auckland Islands and hence communication
47
48 347 at night may not incur the cost it would for other species [70].

3 350 Throughout the year upcalls were more prevalent than any other vocalisation type and were
4
5 351 made at all times of the day. Overall they constituted a third of the calls recorded. Particularly
6
7 352 given that upcalls are produced by both males and females [33,34], they are especially
8
9 353 appropriate for automated detection. While there is ongoing development of algorithms to
10
11
12
354 detect other right whale call types [60,71], to date the focus remains on upcalls [28, 29].
13
14 355 Although no call-positive days were missed by using only an upcall detector, the addition of
15
16 356 other call types would increase detection probability, particularly when call rates are low.
17
18 357
19
20 358 The strong positive relationship between the manually observed and automatically detected
21
22 359 upcalls, consistent throughout the year, confirms the utility of the detector. Importantly,
23
24
25
360 however, the false positive detection rate of the automated detector was high, particularly
26
27 361 during periods of low vocal activity. The detection threshold of the algorithm could be
28
29 362 increased to reduce the number of false positives, but this would also increase the rate of false
30
31 363 negatives (missed calls). In our study, false detections were often right whale vocalisations
32
33 364 other than upcalls. In areas with other mysticetes, false detections will sometimes be species
34
35 365 other than right whales. An additional problem is that the true number of calls is never known
36
37
366 precisely – detector efficiency can only be compared against a human analyst, an imperfect
38
39
40 367 standard at best [28].

43
44
45 369 This study has proven the effectiveness of using an autonomous passive acoustic recorder to
46
47 370 provide detailed data on vocal behaviour of southern right whales in a remote area seldom
48
49 371 visited by vessels. Previously, information on habitat use in this area was limited to visual
50
51
372 observations during relatively short visits in the austral winter [38,40,41]. Autonomous
52
53
54
373 recorders have compelling additional benefits: they are viable 24 hours a day, are less

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a really nice study. My only main comment is that it would be helpful
for the reader to understand how this habitat relates to the bigger picture of
SRW distribution and knowledge. I've included some minor comments within
the attached document.
Response: further information about how this habitat relates to the bigger
picture of SRW distribution and knowledge has been included and is
addressed in response to the comment on line 64 (see below).
Line 64: I think it would be useful to give the reader a broader understanding
of SRW population and distribution for this stock and to describe how / why
this study is important in the bigger context. How can it inform what is and
isn’t known about this stock?
Response to line 64: The following has been added to give a broader
introduction to SRW and help to put this study into context. “Southern right
whales (SRWs, Eubalaena australis) have a circumpolar distribution in the
southern hemisphere, with major breeding populations in South Africa,
Argentina, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand. SRWs were hunted to the brink
of extinction in New Zealand [38], but since the cessation of whaling the
population has grown at an estimated 7% resulting in a recent abundance
estimate of 2169 (95%: 1836-2563) [39]. For other SRW populations
mainland calving grounds mean that they are easily observable. SRWs in
New Zealand only calve in the remote sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands, so we
know very little about distribution and behaviour through the year.” See lines
64-71.
Line 67: arrive from where or describe it is or isn’t known. Also is this the only
purpose of this habitat or are there non m/c whales there too? It might be an
important descriptor to put these calls in context.
Response to line 67: “from offshore feeding grounds” has been added to
address from where the whales arrive. An additional comment has been
added to explain that non m/c whales are also present “Non-breeding whales
are also present potentially due to social factors [41]”. See line 75.
Line 86: Remove “of”
Response to line 86: “of” has been removed (line 94).
Line 141: I’m struggling with the second value and how it is calculated. Needs
a little more explanation of the process for that – how do you know what was
correctly assigned in the TPR process or does it come from the PPR? It’s
confusing as written.
Response to line 141: Agree that this is confusing as currently written. The
sentence paragraph has been re-written as “The second measure (True
Positive Rate, TPR) is the percentage of upcalls detected by the analyst also
logged by the detector; the converse enabled estimation of false negatives.”
See lines 150-151.
Line 156: to nautical dawn?
Response to line 156: “dawn” has been corrected to “nautical dawn”. See
line 165.
Line 170: I’m having a hard time understanding how this would actually work.
Are you only doing this for a subset of days with atypically high calling rates?
Response to line 170: This is done for all days, which has now been clarified
in the text by adding “for each day”. For further explanation of how mean
adjusted call rate is calculated “(e.g. hour or diel period)” was also added.
The response to a comment (line 172) from reviewer 2 also further explains
what this calculation means. See lines 178-180.
Line 255: What proportion? This seems important to understand.
Response to line 255: This was a large proportion of calls, exact numbers
are not available as these data were not explicitly collected as part of this
study. We have added “large” for further clarification. See line 266-267.
Line 295: Also could be the result of comparing different sorts of habitats
Response to line 295: “or because whales were sampled in different
habitats” has been added. See lines 306-307.
Line 324: Make it clear that this is all RW species
Response to line 324: “all right whale species” has been added for
clarification. See lines 313-315.
Line 374: It might be important to mention what can be learned from acoustic
recorders and their utility really depends on the question one is trying to
answer. Down the road of there is clearer linkage of acoustics with whale
behaviour which you have sort of touched on, ie if the acoustic outputs in a
calving area are somehow a lot different than feeding and/or mating area and
that could be better described then maybe acoustic
Response to line 374: A sentence has been added to the discussion to
highlight the linkage with acoustics and whale behaviour “Furthermore,
different call types might be indicative of different behaviours which may not
be apparent from visual observation alone”. See lines 385-386.

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript examines the seasonal and diel acoustic behaviour of
southern right whales at a remote calving ground using PAM. The paper
jumps between focusing on PAM and SRW acoustic ecology, which leads to
a lack of conceptual flow. A little more cohesion between the concepts will
help the manuscript flow better (e.g., acoustic ecology of a difficult to study
species is revealed by PAM). A thorough read of the manuscript is needed to
ensure the grammatical errors throughout are remedied. Some (but by no
means all) are noted in the specific comments below. There are too many
Figures presented with the majority replicating information and can be
removed from the manuscript. What is missing, however, is a clear Table
detailing the auto-detector success/failure rates. After major revision the
manuscript will be an important contribution to the literature.
Response: Further clarification throughout the manuscript, of the focus on
acoustic ecology of SRW as revealed by PAM, has been added as addressed
in the specific comments below. Additional grammatical errors have been
remedied, figures reduced and a table added as suggested (see specific
comments below).
Specific comments are provided below:
Abstract
L3-6: I suggest combining these two sentences, and adding in a sentence
about southern right whales (e.g., distribution, ecology, etc.). Your opening
paragraph in the Introduction focuses on behaviour and yet your abstract
focuses on PAM.
Response to L3-6: The two sentences have been joined as follows “A
recorder was moored at the isolated sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands for a
year to examine whether the acoustic behaviour of southern right whales
differed seasonally and throughout the day at their main calving ground in
New Zealand” There is a 200 word limit for the abstract so a short sentence
about SRWs was added “Southern right whales are known to have an
extensive acoustic repertoire”. See lines 3-6.
L10: add “detected” after call rates.
Response to L10: “detected” has been added. See line 10.
Background
L22-30: I suggest including the word “|diurnal” in this paragraph – as that is
what you are describing.
Response to L22-30: Diurnal has been added in this paragraph. Which now
reads “…exhibit diurnal variation in vocal activity with higher call rates during
the late evening and dawn”. See lines 24-27.
L54: Add “For example,” autonomous recordings....
This will allow your sentences to link better.
Response to L54: For example has been added. See line 54.
L64: You need a link to the previous paragraph, for example: “In the Southern
Hemisphere, most knowledge....”
Response to L64: Following a comment from reviewer 1 (line 64) a
paragraph on SRW has been added to give the reader the bigger picture.
This serves as a linkage between the two paragraphs, and thus makes this
addition unnecessary. See lines 64-71.
L64-6: What about genetic studies? These have revealed information about
migratory behavior, etc. Please include.
Response to L64-6: A genetic reference (Carroll et al. 2013 [39]) has been
added as part of the broader picture of SRW (see previous comment on line
64 from reviewer 1). See line 68.
L74: “an excellent tool to answer these questions”. Reword to something a
little more focused on your coming questions e.g., “provide/present a
viable/robust tool for understanding the seasonal and diurnal calling behavior
of SRW”. This then links into your next paragraph.
Response to L74: The text has been changed to “present a robust tool for
understanding the seasonal and diurnal calling behaviour of SRW”. See lines
80-82.
L76-80: Q1 is basically revealed by Q2 so I don’t see why this is a separate
focus. PAM is important and will reveal presence. Again, is this paper
focused on PAM or on the acoustic ecology of the species? My feeling is the
latter and PAM is the tool to get you to the important questions about your
species.
Response to L76-80: We agree that the focus of the paper is the acoustic
ecology of SRW and PAM is a tool to help with this. Q1 is about seasonal
presence, Q2 is about vocal behaviour. Q1 has been reworded to reflect this
focus “what is the seasonal variation in the presence of whales at the
Auckland Islands as revealed by autonomous acoustic recorders”. Rates and
types has been added to Q2 to provide further clarification “how do call rates
and types vary temporally”. See lines 84-88.
Methods
L86: delete “of”.
Response to L86: “of” has been deleted (line 94).
L103: i.e., a 12.5% duty cycle. Please add. Please also mention that a 4 kHz
sampling rate covers the vocalisation range of this species.
Response to L103: “(i.e. a 12.5% duty cycle)” and “(covering the vocalisation
range of this species)” have been added to the text. See lines 109-111.
L105-12: Please include the specific depth at the deployment location and the
depth of the recorder in the water column.
Response to L105-12: The deployment depth has been made more specific
“16-20 m” instead of <20m. The depth of the recorder is covered in line 109,
but we have added “on the seabed” to make it clear that the depth is 1m from
the seabed. See lines 96 and 115.
L115-9: Your classification methods need to be expanded. So, you first
manually scanned all recordings for call presence. Does this include all calls
no matter the SNR? If so, please state this or the SNR you used as a cut off.
Once a call was identified, you classified the call type based on a previous
quantitative classification of a subset of your data. Please include this
information. From here you then counted the number of calls and call types
per recording/hour/day/month? More information is required.
Response to L115-9: “regardless of signal to noise ratio” has been added to
make this clearer. We have also added “based on a previously determined
quantitative classification system described in a concurrent study of this
population” to further clarify what the classification was based on. Details
about the number of calls and call types per time period is detailed later in the
methods (under the section on statistical analyses). Lines 124-128.
L122: all acoustic recordings or a subset? Please clarify.
Response to L22: “All” has been added for clarification. See line 131.
L136: what about missed detections? How many calls were missed by the
detector? There is no Table in Results detailing number of calls manually
classified, classified by detector, missed by detector, missed by human, etc.
Please add such a Table. [I see information is provided in the SI but this
should be summarised for the reader in a Table].
Response to L136: This information was summarised in the paragraph on
effectiveness of the automated detector (in the results section). We have
added an additional table (Table 2) to summarise the detection effectiveness
information as suggested. The following data have been included: number of
calls manually detected, number of upcalls autodetected, number of true
positive calls, number of false positive calls, number of false negative calls,
PPV and TPR. These have been broken down for each month separately,
except for October to April where data were combined due to a low call rate.
See lines 655-660.
L163: delete “Program”.
Response to 163: “Program” has been deleted (line 172).
L170: “calls” should be “call”.
Response to L170: “Calls” has been changed to “call” (line 178).
L172: More information is required about the difference between positive and
negative values. “This correction resulted in a mean adjusted call rate where
positive values indicate....”.
Response to L172: We have added further information to the text to explain
this better. “where positive values indicate an above average (and negative a
below average) rate during a particular time period allowing for seasonal
variation in the total number of calls detected.”
Results
Footnote 1 pg 9: remove “a” from the first sentence.
Response to Footnote1: “a” has been deleted.
L200: This is half of a sentence. I suggest including a statement after this
along the lines of “The vocalisation rate increased sharply in May (41, 2.9),
coinciding with ....[winter migration into the area].”
I would like to see a Figure with spectrograms of the five major call types for
the generalist reader. Corresponding audio files would also be nice.
Especially for the upcall, which you run and auto detector on. Ideally, at least
5 examples of different upcalls would be good to see what variability in call is
allowable to be classified by the detector (and human as an upcall).
Response to L200: The coincidence with the winter migration is discussed in
the discussion. We would prefer to leave this for the discussion as it is
interpretation of the results. Figure 2 showing all of the major call types has
been added to the manuscript as suggested to provide additional
classification information for the reader.
L245-57: This information should be presented in a clear Table outlining the
detector’s success (or failure). Number of calls manually detected, Number
of calls autodetected, number of missed calls, number of false detections – all
with actual counts and percentages. Given this is then discussed by month I
suggest then breaking it down by month too. This was run on 10% of the data
– was this spread across all months? Please include more information in the
methods at L133 to confirm this.
Response to L245-57: A table (Table 2) has been included to summarise the
detection information as suggested in a previous comment (line 136). The
detector was run on all of the data but only 10% of the data were analysed in
detail, the 10% was randomly selected but this does include representation
for each of the months (although samples are not evenly spread). We have
added “which included representation of each month” to give further detail in
the text (line 142).
Discussion
After the focus of the paper is clarified (PAM or acoustic ecology), the
Discussion can be tightened to reflect the focus. I suggest adding a
concluding paragraph to leave the reader with a clear take home message.
Response to discussion: The focus of the paper has been clarified as
acoustic ecology, and a concluding paragraph has been added to reflect this
and leave the reader with a clear take home message. “In this study we
used PAM to investigate the acoustic ecology and behaviour of SRW at their
only known calving ground in New Zealand. SRWs in particular lend
themselves to PAM due to their highly vocal nature and extensive vocal
repertoire. The year-round monitoring of SRWs at the Auckland Islands
expanded upon our current knowledge, revealing that they are at least
occasionally present in every month of the year. Call rates in winter were
however four times higher than any other season, suggesting seasonal
variations in density as a result of winter migration inshore to
calve. Upcalls were the most commonly produced call type proving ideal for
automated detection throughout the year. Seasonality was apparent in many
other call types, likely indicating a change of behaviour during winter. Call
rates exhibited a clear diurnal pattern with higher vocal activity during dusk
and night time potentially because reduced visual contact increases the need
for acoustic communication. This study begins to scratch the surface
of temporal variation in the acoustic behaviour of SRWs, but there is much
more to be revealed.” See lines 389-400.
Figures and Tables
There are too many figures.
Response to figures and tables: Two figures have been deleted as
suggested (see specific comments below).
Figure 2: delete figure as the information is explained in the text and covered
in Figures 3 & 4.
Response to Figure 2: Figure 2 has been deleted and numbering of figures
altered accordingly.
Delete Figure 4 as Figure 5 provides more information. If the authors feel
information from Fig. 4 needs to be included, this should be presented in a
Table of call numbers.
Response to Figure 4: Figure 4 has been deleted and numbering of figures
altered accordingly. Additional text has been added so that the detail from
figure 4 is not lost. “Hybrid, high and gunshot vocalisations exhibited similar
patterns of seasonal presence and are completely absent between December
and April” and “were recorded much less frequently than upcalls, and in some
months not at all (particularly during summer)”
Figure 6 & 7: more information about what positive and negative numbers
mean is required. Each Figure should be stand-alone and not require
consultation with the main text.
Response to Figure 6 & 7: Additional information has been added to the
captions for figures now 5 & 6 to clarify “Positive values indicate an above
average rate and negative values indicate a below average rate”. See lines
678-679, 683-684.
