The authors have performed in depth theoretical mechanistic study of the sequence reactions
known as the Banert processes. It is in my view solid and novel piece of work which desreves to
be published. However, there are two issues which shall be improved. First of all, the english
style must be corrected by a native speaker. The second scientific issue is related to a direct
comparison of the calculated data to experimental outcomes - for example, are the calculated rate
constants consistent with the experiment? Are any of the proposed intermediates detecteded by
experiment? Additionally, Figure 5 must be corrected since it is unreadable and contains the
spurious background. Actually, similar applies to Figure 2 and Figure 3. Finally, it shall be
commented how these results can be useful for experimentalists? Since these reactions involves
ionic azide species it is possible that a solvent might directly participate in some stages of these
reactions - it could be also considered.

In recent years, the Banert cascade reaction has been recognized as a valuable tool for the
synthesis of the NH-1,2,3-triazole-based drug candidates. The computation approach to the
Banert cascade reaction was presented in the manuscript. The experimental facts existing in the
literature were confirmed, i.e. (i) propargyl azides were identified as the cascade-starting
derivatives, and (ii) the [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of propargyl azides to the corresponding
allenyl azides was recognized as the rate-determining step of the cascade. The presented
calculations led Authors to conclusion on the negligible effect of the solvent on the course of the
cascade. The results presented in the manuscript (especially those reported for DMSO) were in
3
opposition to the experimental facts published by Sharpless and Loren (Synthesis 2005, No. 9, pp
1514–1520). This problem must be solved before publication of the manuscript.

Authors quote publication of Koszytkowska-Stawinska and Sas (Tetrahedron, 2013, 69, 2619 –
2627) as the response on my concerns from my previous review. In contrast to Sharpless and
Loren (Synthesis 2005, No. 9, pp 1514–1520), Koszytkowska-Stawinska and Sas succeeded
Bannert cascade in water. Indeed, these two examples might suggest solubility of reactants in
water as one of the factors affecting a course of the Bannert cascade conducted in the two-step,
one pot protocol starting from a propargyl halide. However as Koszytkowska-Stawinska and Sas
showed, the displacement of halogen-azide might be responsible for a poor yield of the Bennert
product. In contrast to the Authors suggestion, Koszytkowska-Stawinska and Sas did not conduct
the Bannert cascade in DMF. They used DMF for the preparation of the propargyl azide. Authors
should modify the manuscript in this respect.
Concluding, an effect of a solvent on the Bannert cascade is an extremely complex issue.
Especially in the light of information provided by Sharpless and Loren on stopping the reaction
in DMSO on the stage of the corresponding propargyl azide (Synthesis 2005, No. 9, pp 1514–
1520). In my opinion Authors should quote all issues regarding a role of a solvent in the Bannert
cascade in their manuscript. I hope the open access publication will stimulate broad research on
this unusual transformation. I encourage Authors to establish cooperation with experimentalists
in order to verify their computations in practice.

Dear Editor,
Thank you for your kind response on our manuscript ID RSOS-171075 entitled “Theoretical
Investigation of Banert-Cascade Reaction” by Shubhankar Bhattacharyya and Kaushik Hatua.
We have revised our manuscript based on the comments and criticism of our two reviewers. Indeed,
thanks to their comments we were able to improve the quality of our manuscript. A point-by-point
response to reviewer comments follows as:

Referee 1:
Comment 1: “the English style must be corrected by a native speaker.”
Our response: We acknowledge reviewer 1 for his/her useful comments. English style is corrected.
Comment 2: “are the calculated rate constants consistent with the experiment? Are any of the
proposed intermediates detected by experiment?”
Our response: Detailed study of the rate constants for this reaction wasn’t reported well but we found
that rate constant for formation of triazole directly from propargyl azide was reported by Banert and it
is in the order of 10-5 s-1 which is consistence with our [3, 3] sigmatropic transformation (1.47x10-
5). Mechanistic studies of this reaction were not reported well but most of the intermediate was
detected as well as isolated by Banert et al (Angew. Chem. Inr. Ed. Engl., 1989, Vol. No. 28, Issue No.
12, 1675). Propargyl azide and allenyl azide can be isolated by reported method (ref 45 and ref 44
respectively) which already discussed in the manuscript. Some texts are added in the manuscript
regarding these two points.
Comment 3: “Figure 5 must be corrected since it is unreadable and contains the spurious background.
Actually, similar applies to Figure 2 and Figure 3.”
Our response: Figure 2, 3, 5 is corrected and high resolution picture is included.
Comment 4: “how these results can be useful for experimentalists? Since these reactions involves
ionic azide species it is possible that a solvent might directly participate in some stages of these
reactions - it could be also considered”.
Our response: The most important part of this reaction is the formation of triazafulvene. Due to high
dipole moment of triazafulvene, can be easily attacked by any desired external nucleophile present in
the reaction which can further leads to benzylic substituted 1, 2, 3-triazoles to stitch with any
molecular architecture. We have demonstrated influence of functional group for this reaction. This can
further guide the experimentalist to design benzylic substituted 1, 2, 3-triazoles which can be
accessed via Banert cascade reaction.
In some stages solvent may participate in this reaction, as it is already mentioned that the
intermediate triazafulvene is highly electrophilic in nature and can be attacked by simple solvent
molecules if nucleophilic solvent (MeOH, EtOH etc) is used. So, it is possible to alter solvent system
depending on target molecules.

Comment 1: “The results presented in the manuscript (especially those reported for DMSO) were in
opposition to the experimental facts published by Sharpless and Loren (Synthesis 2005, No. 9, pp
1514–1520). This problem must be solved before publication of the manuscript.”
Our response: The experimental facts published by Sharpless and Loren are mainly related to
solubility of reactants. In this case sodium azide was used as azide source as well as buffering agent
ammonium chloride also used for this reaction. Contribution for the solubility parameters as well as
buffering agents are not included in this calculation. Further Sharpeless and Loren got very low yield in
other solvents (e.g. water, DMF etc) but Mariola et al (Tetrahedron, 2013, 69, 2619 – 2627) isolate
various types of triazolo-nucleosides with high yield via Banert cascade reaction. Some texts related to
this are added in the manuscript.
