To the Editor
This paper has the value to investigate, both experimentally and through model simulations, the
stability and robustness of a gait apparently unimportant for human ordinary life. Skiipping is
rather a relevant gait on Earth, as acknowledged by the Authors in the quoted literature, for
humans of any age, for birds and lemurs.
It has been recently demonstrated that skipping is a crucial expansion in our locomotor repertoire
when moving in environments with lower gravity than on Earth. In those conditions, skipping
become a primary gait, as witnessed by Apollo missions on the Moon.
This paper confirms an hypothesis previously published about a better stability and robustness
than in other locomotion types, when moving with perturbations. This indirectly holds also when
the terrain is slippery, as because of regolyths on the Moon, and potentially on Mars.
It would be interesting to see the prediction of models where the ‘active’ stiffness of the leading
and trailing limbs is not constant, but changes during the contact time (as to resemble, and it is so,
an actuator - muscle - plus a passive element - tendon). This could be lead to design/discover
new strategies to cope with perturbations.

Comments to the Author:
It was noted by a reviewer that numerous sentences in the current manuscript appear to be
directly copied from previously published papers. In response to this comment, I have run the
text through plagiarism software and found that the results substantiated this claim. In
particular, many sentences were quoted nearly directly from a paper by Fiers et al. 2012, cited
below. For example, the first sentence of the introduction in the submitted manuscript is
identical to Fiers et al. 2013. The second and third sentences of the introduction also appear
verbatim later in the work by Fiers. There are other instances of such direct re-use of sentences
from previously published work throughout the manuscript.
There are also many instances of self-plagiarism of nearly identical sentences from the authors’
own previously published works. While ‘self-plagiarism’ might not be considered quite as
serious as the direct use of another author’s words, neither form of plagiarism is acceptable.
Considering the frequent instances of text recycling that appear in the current manuscript, I
consider that the writing does not meet the ethical standards of the Royal Society Open Science.
I suggest that the authors revisit the scientific guidelines on plagiarism and ensure that the
writing in submitted manuscripts is original. When citing ideas from previous works, the authors
should summarize and rephrase using original words while also referencing the original authors
appropriately.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
General comments:
The authors present a manuscript that addresses the adaptation strategies used to compensate for
a singular perturbation during skipping. Although the study appears thought out, the writing
and organization of the manuscript was difficult for me to understand. In particular, my major
comments are as follows:
The motivation for this study was not sufficiently explained. In the discussion section, the
authors mention how this is relevant to locomotion in hypogravity situations or for walking
down stairs but the statements are very ambiguous. Please be more specific about how you think
your results contribute to the general knowledge of human gait, and please add these
justifications to the abstract and introduction sections. Simply noting that such gait has not been
studied before is not a strong argument for conducting the study.
I found the description of results to be vague (especially in the Simulations section). A limited
number of numerical quantifications were made and, more often, the description of results relied
on ambiguous statements such as “this leads to larger …”. Such statements are very subjective
and depend on the authors’ definition of “larger”. As a result, I believe actual values should be
presented so the readers can draw their own conclusion. In addition, the figures did not show
clearly quantified differences. This meant it was difficult for me to evaluate if the results
supported the conclusions.
Finally, the writing was often difficult to follow, making their experimental setups and
interpretations unclear. Perhaps the authors could consider an editing service.
Minor comments:
For future submissions, please make sure that the line numbers are continuous from page to page
10
(and do not reset with every page) and that they actually correspond to the lines of the text. It is
difficult to leave comments otherwise.
P2 L10: …dynamics of human skipping HAVE not been addressed…
P2 L12: What choice are you referring to? Right now it seems like you’re trying to clarify why
nobody has studied skipping on uneven ground. Please clarify.
P2 L14: numerical simulations of what? Also, what parameters? How did you use those
parameters to dictate the design of the model? The abstract is vague and it is unclear how
empirical data relates to simulation design.
P2 L23: What are the identified strategies? Again, please be more specific to improve clarity.
P3 L7: leg dynamics differ – watch for tenses and extra letters.
P3 L9-10: Time course of the center of mass? Do you mean the dynamics of the CoM? Or the
trajectories? What do you mean by “time course”?
P3 L32-35: How would addressing the dynamics of skipping on uneven terrain improve current
knowledge of human biomechanics? How could these results potentially be used?
P4 L5-12: It is unclear in the first sentence what study you are referring to. It becomes clearer in
the following sentence so I suggest either removing the first sentence or combining the two
sentences.
P4 L27: change to aerial.
P4 L36-41: This sentence is confusing. I would suggest to re-word into shorter, concise sentences
to improve clarity.
P5 L36-39: It is unclear how the virtual leg length was defined. What do you mean by “middle of
the center of the ball of the foot and lateral malleolus”? How did you identify the ball of the foot
and what is “the middle”? Please clarify and justify your choice.
P5 L41-46: Why are you averaging leg length? In the previous sentence, you said that you used
the maximum leg compression to calculate leg stiffness. Why you averaged leg length during leg
contact is unclear.
P5 L52: correct typo in “focused”
P6 L12: The authors refer to a previous paper by Andrada and say only the differences in models
are presented. However, without context, it is difficult to follow what exactly are the differences
between the models. A brief summary of the Andrada model should be presented (or the
differences between them made clearer) to make this work standalone.
P6 L40: “…has up to seven parameters.” The words “up to” imply that the model can have less
parameters. Do you ever use it with less parameters? Consider rephrasing.
P6 L54-57: This sentence is confusing to me. I thought you are trying to fit a model to the subjects
and the subjects don’t even see the model? The way it is written, it appears that the subjects are
directly interacting with the model?
P7 L14-17: This sentence is confusing. Then applied? After what? What are the representative
stable solutions? Those have not been defined previously.
11
P7 L17: why 7cm? You need to explain this briefly and then cite the study in which this was
explained in more detail.
P7 L19: …is not enough to prevent the model from stumbling…
P7 L21: The next simulations included, in addition…in addition to what? Suggest removing.
P7 L30: ode45 is a MATLAB function, which you have not cited. However, I also do not think you
need to provide the details of your integrations.
Results section: Please add statistics results with p-values.
P8 L18: “…extracted the following movement strategies.” Movement strategies for what?
P8 L32: The simulation results section is very vague; e.g. “…leads to larger robustness” – how do
you define robustness? How much better is the model with these compensation strategies?
“extremely resistant to errors” Again, what does this mean? It is not sufficient to simply refer to
your figures without explaining them. Please add more specifics and explanations.
P8 L34: Compared to angle of attack? Do you mean, compared to the angle of attack strategy? If
so, this strategy was not described in the above list and the comparison is unclear. Please clarify.
P9 L36: …and lowered their centre of mass…
P9 L43: Change “suggests” to “suggests.” Please review the manuscript to ensure agreement
between verb tenses.
P9 L50: …to prevent the model from reverting to…What do you mean by “motion direction”?
P10 L38: Change “occurs” to “occur”
Table1: Titles are not consistently capitalized. In general, things are not consistently named so
please go through the document to make sure all names are the same throughout. Certain
parameters are missing units.
Fig2: Adding a legend would really help clarity. Also, please clarify if this is for participants
and/or the model. If it’s just calculated from subject data, why is there no standard deviation
envelope for the red dashed line (suggest adding)?
Fig 3: The x-axes in A and B are different, please match to improve visual comparisons of the
data. What is the gray vertical line? Please label in figure and in text. In part C, please add legend.
Fig 4: Please add a legend. In caption – change “curse” to “course.”

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
Dear Editor,
I have considered the manuscript on ‘Skipping on uneven ground, trailing leg adjustments
simplify control and enhance robustness’ by Müller & Andrada. Based on the available
information, this concerns a revision of a second version of the paper. Presumably, several
questions/comments/suggestions were formulated before and as far as I can see (only replies to
the comments of one referee were available), the authors dealt with these in a convenient way. I
only have a few suggestions remaining.
I would like to suggest the define in the introduction what exactly the definition of ‘stability’ and
‘movement robustness’ as used in this paper, is. Further in the manuscript, it becomes obvious
that ‘stability’ refers to the cyclical pattern, but it seems essential to make sure this cannot be
misunderstood from the beginning (stability may have other mechanical meanings as well).
From this respect it not clear to me what is exactly meant with ‘robustness’. It seems to be used
as a synonym: a stable pattern is a robust one ? If wrong this should be clarified.
The authors speak about ‘asymmetrical gait’ (line 7 and elsewhere) referring to the fact that
mechanical behaviour of both limbs differ. It should be noted that (not only) in (older) literature
on locomotion, gait asymmetry is used in another context: it refers to time-(a)symmetry
(Hildebrand). Limb dynamics of ‘time-asymmetrical gaits’ can be perfectly identical (e.g. a
ricochet is time-asymmetrical but the mechanical behaviour of both hind limbs is the same). I
should avoid this confusion by explicitly mentioning the ‘asymmetric limb mechanics’ each time
(or by adding a footnote if the journal allows this).
Indicate the leg angle on figure 1. Several readers (like me) would define the leg angle as the
complementary angle with respect to the horizontal, meaning that leg retraction during final
swing yields a decrease instead of an increase of the leg angle (angle of attack). This confusion
can be avoided by this addition to the figure (referring to the figure when leg angle or angle of
attack is used for the first time).
Apparently, test subjects knew before there would be a drop and where this was located. I
should mention this explicitly in M&M. This means that, most probably also targeting occurred.
Moreover, conditions were not randomized. Was there a difference between drop-trial 1 and
drop-trial 8 (training effect during experiment; practice trials were only on flat surface). For what
concerns ‘stability and/or robustness’, it may be worth to consider this in the discussion. Active
anticipation may play its role in ‘stability’. Clearly, this may also be reflected in the simulations
since (if I understood correctly) leg stiffness is collected from the experimental trials (kind of
average value ?).

a singular perturbation during skipping. Although the study appears thought out, the writing
15
and organization of the manuscript was difficult for me to understand. In particular, my major
comments are as follows:
The motivation for this study was not sufficiently explained. In the discussion section, the
authors mention how this is relevant to locomotion in hypogravity situations or for walking
down stairs but the statements are very ambiguous. Please be more specific about how you think
your results contribute to the general knowledge of human gait, and please add these
justifications to the abstract and introduction sections. Simply noting that such gait has not been
studied before is not a strong argument for conducting the study.
I found the description of results to be vague (especially in the Simulations section). A limited
number of numerical quantifications were made and, more often, the description of results relied
on ambiguous statements such as “this leads to larger …”. Such statements are very subjective
and depend on the authors’ definition of “larger”. As a result, I believe actual values should be
presented so the readers can draw their own conclusion. In addition, the figures did not show
clearly quantified differences. This meant it was difficult for me to evaluate if the results
supported the conclusions.
Finally, the writing was often difficult to follow, making their experimental setups and
interpretations unclear. Perhaps the authors could consider an editing service.
Minor comments:
For future submissions, please make sure that the line numbers are continuous from page to page
(and do not reset with every page) and that they actually correspond to the lines of the text. It is
difficult to leave comments otherwise.
P2 L10: …dynamics of human skipping HAVE not been addressed…
P2 L12: What choice are you referring to? Right now it seems like you’re trying to clarify why
nobody has studied skipping on uneven ground. Please clarify.
P2 L14: numerical simulations of what? Also, what parameters? How did you use those
parameters to dictate the design of the model? The abstract is vague and it is unclear how
empirical data relates to simulation design.
P2 L23: What are the identified strategies? Again, please be more specific to improve clarity.
P3 L7: leg dynamics differ – watch for tenses and extra letters.
P3 L9-10: Time course of the center of mass? Do you mean the dynamics of the CoM? Or the
trajectories? What do you mean by “time course”?
P3 L32-35: How would addressing the dynamics of skipping on uneven terrain improve current
knowledge of human biomechanics? How could these results potentially be used?
P4 L5-12: It is unclear in the first sentence what study you are referring to. It becomes clearer in
the following sentence so I suggest either removing the first sentence or combining the two
sentences.
P4 L27: change to aerial.
P4 L36-41: This sentence is confusing. I would suggest to re-word into shorter, concise sentences
to improve clarity.
P5 L36-39: It is unclear how the virtual leg length was defined. What do you mean by “middle of
16
the center of the ball of the foot and lateral malleolus”? How did you identify the ball of the foot
and what is “the middle”? Please clarify and justify your choice.
P5 L41-46: Why are you averaging leg length? In the previous sentence, you said that you used
the maximum leg compression to calculate leg stiffness. Why you averaged leg length during leg
contact is unclear.
P5 L52: correct typo in “focused”
P6 L12: The authors refer to a previous paper by Andrada and say only the differences in models
are presented. However, without context, it is difficult to follow what exactly are the differences
between the models. A brief summary of the Andrada model should be presented (or the
differences between them made clearer) to make this work standalone.
P6 L40: “…has up to seven parameters.” The words “up to” imply that the model can have less
parameters. Do you ever use it with less parameters? Consider rephrasing.
P6 L54-57: This sentence is confusing to me. I thought you are trying to fit a model to the subjects
and the subjects don’t even see the model? The way it is written, it appears that the subjects are
directly interacting with the model?
P7 L14-17: This sentence is confusing. Then applied? After what? What are the representative
stable solutions? Those have not been defined previously.
P7 L17: why 7cm? You need to explain this briefly and then cite the study in which this was
explained in more detail.
P7 L19: …is not enough to prevent the model from stumbling…
P7 L21: The next simulations included, in addition…in addition to what? Suggest removing.
P7 L30: ode45 is a MATLAB function, which you have not cited. However, I also do not think you
need to provide the details of your integrations.
Results section: Please add statistics results with p-values.
P8 L18: “…extracted the following movement strategies.” Movement strategies for what?
P8 L32: The simulation results section is very vague; e.g. “…leads to larger robustness” – how do
you define robustness? How much better is the model with these compensation strategies?
“extremely resistant to errors” Again, what does this mean? It is not sufficient to simply refer to
your figures without explaining them. Please add more specifics and explanations.
P8 L34: Compared to angle of attack? Do you mean, compared to the angle of attack strategy? If
so, this strategy was not described in the above list and the comparison is unclear. Please clarify.
P9 L36: …and lowered their centre of mass…
P9 L43: Change “suggests” to “suggests.” Please review the manuscript to ensure agreement
between verb tenses.
P9 L50: …to prevent the model from reverting to…What do you mean by “motion direction”?
P10 L38: Change “occurs” to “occur”
Table1: Titles are not consistently capitalized. In general, things are not consistently named so
17
please go through the document to make sure all names are the same throughout. Certain
parameters are missing units.
Fig2: Adding a legend would really help clarity. Also, please clarify if this is for participants
and/or the model. If it’s just calculated from subject data, why is there no standard deviation
envelope for the red dashed line (suggest adding)?
Fig 3: The x-axes in A and B are different, please match to improve visual comparisons of the
data. What is the gray vertical line? Please label in figure and in text. In part C, please add legend.
Fig 4: Please add a legend. In caption – change “curse” to “course.”

Comments to the Author(s)
Dear Editor,
I have considered the manuscript on ‘Skipping on uneven ground, trailing leg adjustments
simplify control and enhance robustness’ by Müller & Andrada. Based on the available
information, this concerns a revision of a second version of the paper. Presumably, several
questions/comments/suggestions were formulated before and as far as I can see (only replies to
the comments of one referee were available), the authors dealt with these in a convenient way. I
only have a few suggestions remaining.
I would like to suggest the define in the introduction what exactly the definition of ‘stability’ and
‘movement robustness’ as used in this paper, is. Further in the manuscript, it becomes obvious
that ‘stability’ refers to the cyclical pattern, but it seems essential to make sure this cannot be
misunderstood from the beginning (stability may have other mechanical meanings as well).
From this respect it not clear to me what is exactly meant with ‘robustness’. It seems to be used
as a synonym: a stable pattern is a robust one ? If wrong this should be clarified.
The authors speak about ‘asymmetrical gait’ (line 7 and elsewhere) referring to the fact that
mechanical behaviour of both limbs differ. It should be noted that (not only) in (older) literature
on locomotion, gait asymmetry is used in another context: it refers to time-(a)symmetry
(Hildebrand). Limb dynamics of ‘time-asymmetrical gaits’ can be perfectly identical (e.g. a
ricochet is time-asymmetrical but the mechanical behaviour of both hind limbs is the same). I
should avoid this confusion by explicitly mentioning the ‘asymmetric limb mechanics’ each time
(or by adding a footnote if the journal allows this).
Indicate the leg angle on figure 1. Several readers (like me) would define the leg angle as the
complementary angle with respect to the horizontal, meaning that leg retraction during final
swing yields a decrease instead of an increase of the leg angle (angle of attack). This confusion
can be avoided by this addition to the figure (referring to the figure when leg angle or angle of
attack is used for the first time).
Apparently, test subjects knew before there would be a drop and where this was located. I
should mention this explicitly in M&M. This means that, most probably also targeting occurred.
Moreover, conditions were not randomized. Was there a difference between drop-trial 1 and
drop-trial 8 (training effect during experiment; practice trials were only on flat surface). For what
concerns ‘stability and/or robustness’, it may be worth to consider this in the discussion. Active
anticipation may play its role in ‘stability’. Clearly, this may also be reflected in the simulations
since (if I understood correctly) leg stiffness is collected from the experimental trials (kind of
average value ?).

Associate Editor's comments:
Your resubmitted paper has now been considered by two expert referees. While they suggest
that the overall experimental and modeling approaches appear to be sound, they raise some
concerns that require further revisions to the text. If the authors can address these further
comments, I would be happy to consider a revised version of the manuscript.
In the revised version, please ensure that you fully address the points raised by the referees with
appropriate clarifications to the text and a point-by-point response. In particular, ensure that
you pay careful attention to the comments about 1) making the rationale for the study clear, 2)
providing clear definitions of stability and robustness, 3) making the instructions given to
participants and the experimental design are completely clear, and 4) ensuring that all the
statements in the results and the conclusions drawn from the experimental data are fully
supported by statistical results and quantitative comparisons.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
While the authors have revised this manuscript to address the scientific concerns raised in
previous reviews, the language in the manuscript used to interpret the findings is too subjective
and over-interprets the conclusions that can be drawn from a simple model, drawing potentially
misleading conclusions. Consequently, while I am happy to accept the appear in principle, the
language must be edited to be objective and circumscribed about the interpretations of the model.
This paper provides a careful but incremental addition to our understanding of potential leg
control strategies for robust skipping gaits; if a person chooses to skip. The paper does not
demonstrate functional benefits for skipping gaits compared to other possible gaits. The
interpretations in the paper need to be adjusted throughout to accurately reflect the scientific
findings.
As some examples (but the problem is present in a number of places):
page 1 Line 51-53: The last line of the 100-word summary does not logically follow from the
previous. 'Thus, simplified control, stability, and robustness might be key reasons for adopting
skipping’.
The paper analyses skipping gait (only), and demonstrates some strategies for increased
robustness with trailing leg adjustments. This does not demonstrate that skipping is better than
any other possible gait with leg adjustments in the same terrain context. You have not analyzed
all possible gaits and all possible leg adjustments and found the most robust one.
The authors logic is flawed here and similarly in other parts of the paper. The observations from
the model support the idea that specific mechanisms of trailing leg adjustment during skipping
20
can help increase the robustness of skipping gait only. It does not demonstrate that this gait
provides specific benefits for robustness compared to other possible gait choices.
Other minor comments:
P. 3 L8 use of the word ‘amazing’ in this context is too subjective for a scientific paper. Please
make a more concrete statement about how the actual self-stable speed range compares to other
gaits.
Page3 L 38-39 It is unclear why ‘defending stairs’ is used as an example here. Skipping is not
typically a preferred gait for stair descent on Earth. if you have factual evidence to support such
a statement, please provide it.

RSOS-170371 - Skipping on uneven ground: trailing leg adjustments simplify control and enhance
robustness
Dear Alice Power,
We submitted the manuscript RSOS-170371 entitled "Skipping on uneven ground: trailing leg
adjustments simplify control and enhance robustness" to Royal Society Open Science. The paper was
rejected because of plagiarism.
First, we want to thank the reviewer, who detected few sentences with plagiarism issues. It would be
very embarrassing for us, if those sentences would have been published within our manuscript. The
corresponding sentences do not include any novel idea that we tried to sell as ours. In most cases, they
are just common places (e.g. “Locomotion is an important aspect of human life.”). In our point of view,
rewriting the mentioned sentences or skipping them is a minor issue. Our study is unique and has never
been published before. The first reviewer was positive on the study, indicating just minor points. Thus,
while we understand the reaction of the reviewer and your decision from an ethical point of view, we
would kindly ask you to reconsider them. We want to apologise again for the inconvenience and have
now acquired a plagiarism software to ensure that this never happens again.
We would appreciate if you give us the possibility to submit a revised version of our paper that is free of
plagiarism issues and that also considers the minor comments of the first reviewer.
On behalf of both authors,
Yours sincerely
Roy Müller
Appendix B
Dear reviewers,
Thank you very much for your valuable and helpful comments that guided us in improving
he manuscript. Changed manuscript text is marked up in red in both the manuscript and in
our responses.
Reviewer: 1
This paper has the value to investigate, both experimentally and through model simulations,
he stability and robustness of a gait apparently unimportant for human ordinary life. Skipping
s rather a relevant gait on Earth, as acknowledged by the Authors in the quoted literature, for
humans of any age, for birds and lemurs.
t has been recently demonstrated that skipping is a crucial expansion in our locomotor
epertoire when moving in environments with lower gravity than on Earth. In those
conditions, skipping become a primary gait, as witnessed by Apollo missions on the Moon.
This paper confirms a hypothesis previously published about a better stability and robustness
han in other locomotion types, when moving with perturbations. This indirectly holds also
when the terrain is slippery, as because of regolyths on the Moon, and potentially on Mars.
t would be interesting to see the prediction of models where the ‘active’ stiffness of the
eading and trailing limbs is not constant, but changes during the contact time (as to resemble,
and it is so, an actuator - muscle - plus a passive element - tendon). This could be lead to
design/discover new strategies to cope with perturbations.
Minor comments
page 3, line 7: after unilateral skipping, reference 4 could appear, as to acknowledge the first
paper on the mechanics and energetics of human skipping.
Done as suggested.
page 3, line 18: … and in lemurs and birds.
Added.
page 3, line 40: I would swap the references, as 2 deals with models and 8 with experiments.
Done as suggested.
page 3, line 53: swing is normally conceived as a forward movement; did you mean swining
backward before touch down? Otherwise it should be called stance.
Changed to: ‘swinging the leg backward before touch down’.
page 4, line 18: ‘that study’
Done as suggested.
page 6, line 9 and successive occurences: I would suggest to use the term ‘active’ stiffness.
Tiffness alone reflects passive material properties in deformation, which is not exactly the
case for the human leg.
Leg stiffness displays a global behavior of the whole leg that emerges from the active control
of the leg muscles and the passive properties of muscles, tendons and soft tissues that belong
o the leg. Therefore we would like to maintain ‘leg stiffness’.
page 6, line 20: although the estimate of the CoM in this gait is probably slightly affected by
movement of the arms (not measured here), this approximation should be acknowledged.
We added a statement that the estimation of the CoM did not include arm movements.
page 6, line 38: ‘bellow’
Changed to ‘below’
page 9, line 48: reference 4 should be added to [1].
Done as suggested.
page 15, line 16: ‘und’. ‘level and uneven’ could suggest that uneven is also on gradients.
Maybe ‘homogeneous and uneven’ or ‘even and uneven terrain’ could better describe the two
conditions.
Changed to ‘even and uneven’
why subject faced 8 cm drop and the model 7 cm drop?
This difference was already explained in the previous version of the manuscript (at the end of
he section 2.2.). 7cm is just the maximum drop-high that the model can cope with, without
extra movement strategies such as leg retraction or stiffness variation.
At the end of this section it reads: “For the representative stable solutions, we then applied
during a simulation a sudden drop up to 7 cm to test the influence of the identified strategies
o the robustness of locomotion. At this drop-height the aperture angle strategy was not
enough to prevent that the model stumbled in the perturbation. The next simulations included,
n addition, one of the other identified movement strategies (trailing limb retraction speed,
railing limb more protracted at touchdown, reduced stiffness in the trailing limb). We did this
o highlight the single influence of every of these strategies to skipping stability”.
page 11, line 1: ref 4 should be added to 1, 5 and 7
Done as suggested

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors need to review the definitions of plagiarism. There are many cases in the
ntroduction and discussion sections that are copy/pasted sentences from other sources and,
although references are given, this is highly inappropriate and constitutes plagiarism. As a
esult, I cannot provide feedback on the scientific merit of the work.
We want to thank the reviewer for detecting few sentences with problems. We rewrote or
deleted the mentioned sentences in the introduction and discussion sections.

Reviewer: 2
Major Comments:
The authors present a manuscript that addresses the adaptation strategies used to compensate for a
ingular perturbation during skipping. Although the study appears thought out, the writing and
organization of the manuscript was difficult for me to understand. In particular, my major comments
are as follows:
The motivation for this study was not sufficiently explained. In the discussion section, the authors
mention how this is relevant to locomotion in hypogravity situations or for walking down stairs but the
tatements are very ambiguous. Please be more specific about how you think your results contribute to
he general knowledge of human gait, and please add these justifications to the abstract and
ntroduction sections. Simply noting that such gait has not been studied before is not a strong
argument for conducting the study.
Response: to motivate the study in more detail, we reworked the introduction section and added the
ollowing paragraph:
A recently published study that extracted model parameters from humans skipping over flat ground
howed that bipedal spring loaded inverted pendulum (BSLIP) skipping is self-stable (i.e. the system
s able to reject perturbations without any feedback-loop) over an amazing speed range [8]. This
ndicates that skipping might be a more stable gait than walking or running. However, skipping is
ather costly for humans and consumes 24 % to 30 % more metabolic energy and 15 % more
mechanical energy than running at the same speed [9-11]. Nevertheless, skipping might be
energetically beneficial in environments with reduced gravity [12, 13]. Thus, skipping is a crucial
expansion in our locomotor repertoire when moving on the Moon, and potentially on Mars and could
become the primary gait in those conditions [10, 12, 13]. Whether skipping is used on Earth (e.g.
descending stairs) or on the Moon (e.g. moving across rough terrain covered with regoliths),
perturbations in ground level must be rejected to maintain balance. However, human control strategies
hat might increase stability of skipping on uneven ground have not yet been addressed.’
found the description of results to be vague (especially in the Simulations section). A limited number
of numerical quantifications were made and, more often, the description of results relied on ambiguous
tatements such as “this leads to larger …”. Such statements are very subjective and depend on the
authors’ definition of “larger”. As a result, I believe actual values should be presented so the readers
can draw their own conclusion. In addition, the figures did not show clearly quantified differences.
This meant it was difficult for me to evaluate if the results supported the conclusions.
Response: the simulation sections (both Methods and Results) were re-written. We added more
explanations about the simulations performed, and present values for comparison. Ambiguous
tatements were deleted.
Methods
…Note that the eigenvalues give a measure of how fast a perturbation can be absorbed by the model.
However, the eigenvalues do not inform about the size of the perturbation that the model can cope
with. The analytical way to measure such robustness is to compute the basin of attraction of a fixed
point. We used a rather intuitive and computationally less expensive method closer to our experiments,
which is based on sudden drops during forward simulations (called step-down step-up perturbation [8,
24, 25]). After such a perturbation, the system energy is maintained. SLIP models cannot abolish
perturbations with respect to energy.
Following this, we first analysed whether the aperture angle strategy improves the ability of the model
o cope with sudden perturbations in relation to the angle of attack strategy. For the representative 600
table solutions from our previous study, we applied a sudden drop during a forward simulation.
Starting at 1 cm, the drop-height was increased until 10 cm. This procedure was applied to both leg
placement strategies. Afterwards, the mean drop-height for every leg placement strategy was
computed as an indicator of robustness. For the aperture angle strategy, we identified the simulations
at which the model stumbled in the perturbation. For these simulations we performed further forward
imulations that included one of the other identified movement strategies (trailing leg retraction,
railing leg more protracted at touchdown, reduced stiffness in the trailing leg) maintaining the drop-
height at which the model stumbled. We did this to highlight the single influence of every of these
trategies to skipping stability.’
Results
Mean drop-height values for the angle of attack strategy were 9.7 cm for the trailing leg and 3.2 cm
or the leading leg. For the aperture angle strategy mean drop-height values were 9.5 cm for the
railing leg and 9.6 cm for the leading. Thus, compared to the angle of attack strategy, the aperture
angle strategy leads to a larger robustness against sudden-drop perturbations during BSLIP skipping
especially for the leading leg).
By using the aperture angle strategy, only 10 % of the simulations were not able to cope with sudden
drops of 10 cm when the trailing leg dropped in the perturbation, and only 8 % of the simulations were
not able to cope with sudden drops of 10 cm when the leading leg dropped in the perturbation. For
hose cases, the addition of one of the other identified movement strategies (2, 3, or 4) permitted the
model to overcome the perturbation successfully (one example is shown in Fig. 3A-B).’
Finally, the writing was often difficult to follow, making their experimental setups and interpretations
unclear. Perhaps the authors could consider an editing service.
Response: we revised the whole manuscript. Additionally, the manuscript was proof-read.
Minor comments:
For future submissions, please make sure that the line numbers are continuous from page to page (and
do not reset with every page) and that they actually correspond to the lines of the text. It is difficult to
eave comments otherwise.
Response: unfortunately we had no influence on it, the line numbers were generated during the
ubmission process.
P2 L10: …dynamics of human skipping HAVE not been addressed…
Response: thanks, done.
P2 L12: What choice are you referring to? Right now it seems like you’re trying to clarify why nobody
has studied skipping on uneven ground. Please clarify.
Response: thanks, it now reads ‘To find the reasons that may motivate this gait…’
P2 L14: numerical simulations of what? Also, what parameters? How did you use those parameters to
dictate the design of the model? The abstract is vague and it is unclear how empirical data relates to
imulation design.
Response: good point. The model was later in the abstract described. As in our last paper, we used the
bipedal spring loaded inverted pendulum model (BSLIP) to model Skipping. We also included the
model parameters that we estimated from experimental data. In the abstract now reads:
…, we combined experimental data on humans with numerical simulations on a bipedal spring loaded
nverted pendulum model (BSLIP). To drive the model, the following parameters were estimated from
nine subjects skipping across a single drop in ground level: leg lengths at touchdown, leg stiffness of
both legs, aperture angle between legs, trailing leg angle at touchdown (leg landing first after flight
phase), and trailing leg retraction speed. ‘
P2 L23: What are the identified strategies? Again, please be more specific to improve clarity.
Response: you are right, it now reads ‘We found that leg adjustments in humans occur mostly or only
n the trailing leg (low to moderate leg retraction during swing phase, reduced trailing leg stiffness,
and flatter trailing leg angle at lowered touchdown). When transferring these leg adjustments to the
BSLIP model, the capacity of the model to cope with sudden-drop perturbations increased.’
P3 L7: leg dynamics differ – watch for tenses and extra letters.
Response: thanks, done.
P3 L9-10: Time course of the center of mass? Do you mean the dynamics of the CoM? Or the
rajectories? What do you mean by “time course”?
Response: Changed to ‘trajectory’.
P3 L32-35: How would addressing the dynamics of skipping on uneven terrain improve current
knowledge of human biomechanics? How could these results potentially be used?
Response: to motivate the study in more detail, we reworked the introduction section and added the
ollowing paragraph:
A recently published study that extracted model parameters from humans skipping over flat ground
howed that bipedal spring loaded inverted pendulum (BSLIP) skipping is self-stable (i.e. the system
s able to reject perturbations without any feedback-loop) over an amazing speed range [8]. This
ndicates that skipping might be a more stable gait than walking or running. However, skipping is
ather costly for humans and consumes 24 % to 30 % more metabolic energy and 15 % more
mechanical energy than running at the same speed [9-11]. Nevertheless, skipping might be
energetically beneficial in environments with reduced gravity [12, 13]. Thus, skipping is a crucial
expansion in our locomotor repertoire when moving on the Moon, and potentially on Mars and could
become the primary gait in those conditions [10, 12, 13]. Whether skipping is used on Earth (e.g.
descending stairs) or on the Moon (e.g. moving across rough terrain covered with regoliths),
perturbations in ground level must be rejected to maintain balance. However, human control strategies
hat might increase stability of skipping on uneven ground have not yet been addressed.’
P4 L5-12: It is unclear in the first sentence what study you are referring to. It becomes clearer in the
ollowing sentence so I suggest either removing the first sentence or combining the two sentences.
Response: thanks, we combined both sentences to ‘That would then be in accordance with a
imulation study (mentioned above) in that the authors found that a larger trailing leg angle at
ouchdown is a very resistant strategy to sudden drops independent of which leg steps into the
perturbation [8].’
P4 L27: change to aerial.
Response: thanks, done.
P4 L36-41: This sentence is confusing. I would suggest to re-word into shorter, concise sentences to
mprove clarity.
Response: you are right, it now reads ‘Depending on the leg that steps into the perturbation, we
expected that trailing and leading leg adjustments differ.’
P5 L36-39: It is unclear how the virtual leg length was defined. What do you mean by “middle of the
center of the ball of the foot and lateral malleolus”? How did you identify the ball of the foot and what
s “the middle”? Please clarify and justify your choice.
Response: thanks, it now reads ‘The virtual leg was defined from trochanter major to a point midway
between the distal head of the first metatarsal bone and the lateral malleolus.’
P5 L41-46: Why are you averaging leg length? In the previous sentence, you said that you used the
maximum leg compression to calculate leg stiffness. Why you averaged leg length during leg contact
s unclear.
Response: thanks, it now reads ‘Stiffness of the leg was calculated as the ratio between the maximum
GRF and the maximum leg compression. As leg length is normally non-symmetric relative to
ouchdown and toe-off events, we used the average leg length at touchdown and toe-off and the
minimal leg length during ground contact to calculate the maximum leg compression [8].’
P5 L52: correct typo in “focused”
Response: thanks, done.
P6 L12: The authors refer to a previous paper by Andrada and say only the differences in models are
presented. However, without context, it is difficult to follow what exactly are the differences between
he models. A brief summary of the Andrada model should be presented (or the differences between
hem made clearer) to make this work standalone.
Response: thanks, we included the following text ‘). In Andrada et al. [8] we presented a model with
ix parameters (m, g, leg stiffness k, trailing leg angle at touchdown aT, leading leg angle at touchdown
aL, leg length at TD l0).’ to the methods.
P6 L40: “…has up to seven parameters.” The words “up to” imply that the model can have less
parameters. Do you ever use it with less parameters? Consider rephrasing.
Response: thank you, yes the model can be driven with 6 parameters if one uses the same leg stiffness
on both legs (see above). The text now reads: ‘Thus, the model presented here has seven
parameters…’ we also added: ‘…, note that the model needs only six parameters when both trailing
and leading leg stiffness are equal).’
P6 L54-57: This sentence is confusing to me. I thought you are trying to fit a model to the subjects and
he subjects don’t even see the model? The way it is written, it appears that the subjects are directly
nteracting with the model?
Response: we do not understand exactly what the reviewer meant here. We rephrased the sentence to:
Rather, we were interested in the influence of the movement strategies used by the subjects on the
model’s behaviour.’
P7 L14-17: This sentence is confusing. Then applied? After what? What are the representative stable
olutions? Those have not been defined previously.
Response: thanks, the sentence was changed.
P7 L17: why 7cm? You need to explain this briefly and then cite the study in which this was explained
n more detail.
Response: we changed the sentence for more clarity. Now reads: ‘For the representative 600 stable
olutions from our previous study, we applied a sudden drop during a forward simulation. Starting at
1 cm, the drop-height was increased until 10 cm. This procedure was applied to both leg placement
trategies.’
P7 L19: …is not enough to prevent the model from stumbling…
Response: thanks, the sentence was changed (see above).
P7 L21: The next simulations included, in addition…in addition to what? Suggest removing.
Response: thanks, done.
P7 L30: ode45 is a MATLAB function, which you have not cited. However, I also do not think you
need to provide the details of your integrations.
Response: we added following sentence before the description of the integrator: ‘The model was
mplemented in Matlab®-Simulink®.’
Results section: Please add statistics results with p-values.
Response: done as suggested.
P8 L18: “…extracted the following movement strategies.” Movement strategies for what?
Response: thanks, it now reads ‘Based on the experimental findings, the following movement
trategies were transferred to the numerical BSLIP model:’
P8 L32: The simulation results section is very vague; e.g. “…leads to larger robustness” – how do you
define robustness? How much better is the model with these compensation strategies? “extremely
esistant to errors” Again, what does this mean? It is not sufficient to simply refer to your figures
without explaining them. Please add more specifics and explanations.
Response: Thanks, we added more information and values for comparison in both methods and results
ections (see above).
P8 L34: Compared to angle of attack? Do you mean, compared to the angle of attack strategy? If so,
his strategy was not described in the above list and the comparison is unclear. Please clarify.
Response: we agree. We added information about the comparison in both methods and results sections
see above).
P9 L36: …and lowered their centre of mass…
Response: thanks, done.
P9 L43: Change “suggests” to “suggests.” Please review the manuscript to ensure agreement between
verb tenses.
Response: changed to ‘suggest’.
P9 L50: …to prevent the model from reverting to…What do you mean by “motion direction”?
Response: changed to locomotion direction.
P10 L38: Change “occurs” to “occur”
Response: thanks, done.
Table1: Titles are not consistently capitalized. In general, things are not consistently named so please
go through the document to make sure all names are the same throughout. Certain parameters are
missing units.
Response: done, many thanks.
Fig2: Adding a legend would really help clarity. Also, please clarify if this is for participants and/or
he model. If it’s just calculated from subject data, why is there no standard deviation envelope for the
ed dashed line (suggest adding)?
Response: thanks, done.
Fig 3: The x-axes in A and B are different, please match to improve visual comparisons of the data.
What is the gray vertical line? Please label in figure and in text. In part C, please add legend.
Response: thanks, done. Additionally, we added the following sentence to the caption of Fig. 3: ‘In A
and B the grey vertical line indicates the moment at which the leg enters in the perturbation.’
Fig 4: Please add a legend. In caption – change “curse” to “course.”
Response: thanks, done as suggested.
Reviewer: 3
Dear Editor,
have considered the manuscript on ‘Skipping on uneven ground, trailing leg adjustments simplify
control and enhance robustness’ by Müller & Andrada. Based on the available information, this
concerns a revision of a second version of the paper. Presumably, several
questions/comments/suggestions were formulated before and as far as I can see (only replies to the
comments of one referee were available), the authors dealt with these in a convenient way. I only
have a few suggestions remaining.
would like to suggest the define in the introduction what exactly the definition of ‘stability’ and
movement robustness’ as used in this paper, is. Further in the manuscript, it becomes obvious that
stability’ refers to the cyclical pattern, but it seems essential to make sure this cannot be
misunderstood from the beginning (stability may have other mechanical meanings as well). From this
espect it not clear to me what is exactly meant with ‘robustness’. It seems to be used as a synonym: a
table pattern is a robust one ? If wrong this should be clarified.
Response: thanks, done.
ntroduction
A recently published study that extracted model parameters from humans skipping over flat ground
howed that bipedal spring loaded inverted pendulum (BSLIP) skipping is self-stable (i.e. the system
s able to reject perturbations without any feedback-loop) over an amazing speed range [8].’
The same model also becomes more robust to sudden perturbations (robustness defined as the
maximum perturbation that the system can cope with) when the leading leg (landing last) drops down
with a larger leg angle and/or higher stiffness [8].’
The authors speak about ‘asymmetrical gait’ (line 7 and elsewhere) referring to the fact that
mechanical behaviour of both limbs differ. It should be noted that (not only) in (older) literature on
ocomotion, gait asymmetry is used in another context: it refers to time-(a)symmetry (Hildebrand).
Limb dynamics of ‘time-asymmetrical gaits’ can be perfectly identical (e.g. a ricochet is time-
asymmetrical but the mechanical behaviour of both hind limbs is the same). I should avoid this
confusion by explicitly mentioning the ‘asymmetric limb mechanics’ each time (or by adding a
ootnote if the journal allows this).
Response: thanks, we added the following footnote: ‘In our paper gait asymmetry should not be
understood in the sense of Hildebrand (time-(a) symmetry, [6]), rather that leg movements and
mechanics of one side are not exactly repeated on the other side.’
ndicate the leg angle on figure 1. Several readers (like me) would define the leg angle as the
complementary angle with respect to the horizontal, meaning that leg retraction during final swing
yields a decrease instead of an increase of the leg angle (angle of attack). This confusion can be
avoided by this addition to the figure (referring to the figure when leg angle or angle of attack is used
or the first time).
Response: thanks, done.
Apparently, test subjects knew before there would be a drop and where this was located. I should
mention this explicitly in M&M. This means that, most probably also targeting occurred. Moreover,
conditions were not randomized. Was there a difference between drop-trial 1 and drop-trial 8 (training
effect during experiment; practice trials were only on flat surface). For what concerns ‘stability and/or
obustness’, it may be worth to consider this in the discussion. Active anticipation may play its role in
stability’. Clearly, this may also be reflected in the simulations since (if I understood correctly) leg
tiffness is collected from the experimental trials (kind of average value ?).
Response: we added a statement that ‘Subjects were visually aware of the single step down and were
allowed to perform another two to three practice trials’. Thus, we do not believe that drop-trial 1 and
drop-trial 8 differ. However, this point and the use of unexpected or camouflaged drops in ground
evel during skipping are important points that need to be addressed in future studies.
Appendix D
Dear Associate Editor,
Thank you very much for giving us the opportunity to revise and resubmit our manuscript. Thanks
also for your helpful comments that guided us in improving it.
Changed manuscript text is marked up in red in both the manuscript and in our responses to your
comments.
Associate Editor Comments to Author:
While the authors have revised this manuscript to address the scientific concerns raised in previous
eviews, the language in the manuscript used to interpret the findings is too subjective and over-
nterprets the conclusions that can be drawn from a simple model, drawing potentially misleading
conclusions. Consequently, while I am happy to accept the appear in principle, the language must be
edited to be objective and circumscribed about the interpretations of the model.
This paper provides a careful but incremental addition to our understanding of potential leg control
trategies for robust skipping gaits; if a person chooses to skip. The paper does not demonstrate
unctional benefits for skipping gaits compared to other possible gaits. The interpretations in the paper
need to be adjusted throughout to accurately reflect the scientific findings.
Response: good point. We identified and reworded all the sentences that were not supported by our
experimental and simulation results.
As some examples (but the problem is present in a number of places):
page 1 Line 51-53: The last line of the 100-word summary does not logically follow from the
previous. 'Thus, simplified control, stability, and robustness might be key reasons for adopting
kipping’.
Response: We deleted this misleading sentence from the 100-word summary and from the abstract.
The paper analyses skipping gait (only), and demonstrates some strategies for increased robustness
with trailing leg adjustments. This does not demonstrate that skipping is better than any other possible
gait with leg adjustments in the same terrain context. You have not analyzed all possible gaits and all
possible leg adjustments and found the most robust one.
The authors logic is flawed here and similarly in other parts of the paper. The observations from the
model support the idea that specific mechanisms of trailing leg adjustment during skipping can help
ncrease the robustness of skipping gait only. It does not demonstrate that this gait provides specific
benefits for robustness compared to other possible gait choices.
Response: you are right in your assessment, we included knowledge that we collected from simulating
different gaits with the BSLIP (to us it is clear that skipping is more stable), but we (others neither)
never published such a comparison, and therefore your point is completely correct. Accordingly, we
deleted any conclusions of this type from the manuscript. We now just mention the fact that BSLIP
kipping is stable at speeds at which walking and running are not (see next point).
Other minor comments:
P. 3 L8 use of the word ‘amazing’ in this context is too subjective for a scientific paper. Please make
a more concrete statement about how the actual self-stable speed range compares to other gaits.
Response: thanks, it now reads: “…skipping is self-stable (i.e. the system is able to reject perturbations
without any feedback-loop) from hopping on the spot to running speeds (authors stop simulating by
human speeds close to 4.3 ms-1; [8]). Thus, BSLIP skipping is stable at speeds at which BSLIP
walking and BSLIP running are not (BSLIP walking is stable in a narrow corridor around 1 ms-1,
BSLIP running at speeds higher than 3 ms-1; [9]).”
Page3 L 38-39 It is unclear why ‘defending stairs’ is used as an example here. Skipping is not
ypically a preferred gait for stair descent on Earth. if you have factual evidence to support such a
tatement, please provide it.
Response: you are right, we deleted this example.
