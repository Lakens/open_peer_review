A novel superabsorbent composite based on wheat bran grafted with poly(acrylic acid) and
laterite, distributed within the polymer network is described in this manuscript. Several
experimental parameters affecting the properties of the composite are examined and specific
applications are mentioned as urea fertilizer carrier and in the growth of Chinese herb for
medicinal purposes. It is a very well written manuscript with a lot of experimental results. The
products are promising for several practical applications. From this point of view this work
deserves to be published in RSOS, since it will be beneficial and interesting to the readers. The
main drawback is that it is a, more or less, technical work without in depth analysis concerning
the structure of the produced composite. Parameters, such as the crosslinking density, the
molecular weight of the polymer between the crosslinks, the amount of linear poly(acrylic acid)
in the composite, the degree of grafting of the wheat bran, the possible presence of unreacted
wheat bran etc. are not fully discussed, although they are going to greatly affect the properties of
the composite. Therefore, I encourage the authors to provide more details on the structure of their
basic material.

In this work, the authors prepared grafted wheat bran based superabsorbent composites. The
chemical structure, swelling behavior, thermal stability, and potential application in plant growth
were characterized and studied. Overall this article is well written. I have the following
comments for the authors to address.
3
1. In line 169, the authors should cite literature for the IR band assignment.
2. To prove the success of graft copolymerization, did the authors try use Soxhlet extraction to
make sure all the acrylics were well grafted?
3. For thermal stability analysis, there are too much weight loss in the low temperature range. The
authors could try to dry the materials in the vacuum oven at room temperature and then do the
thermal stability test.
4. It will help readers if the authors could provide some reaction scheme for the graft
copolymerization.

Dear Editor:
We thank you very much for processing and giving us an opportunity to revise our
manuscript, entitled “Preparation of a Low-cost Superabsorbent Composite for
Potential Application in Chinese Herbal Medicine Growth”. (ID: RSOS-180007).
Certainly, we appreciate the reviewers very much for spending time to read our
manuscript and offering us constructive comments and suggestions. We have studied
reviewer’s comments carefully and have tried our best to revise our manuscript. Our
responses, in the manner of point to point, to the reviewers’ comments, are follows
their comments and suggestions, which marked in blue in the revised manuscript. Our
changes and response are presented in the following:

with a lot of experimental results. The products are promising for several practical

Our response: Thank you very much for reviewers' comment. The basic material
including laterite and wheat bran have been discussed in detail and reported in our
previous work and cited the literature in present manuscript:

Comments to the Author(s)
In this work, the authors prepared grafted wheat bran based superabsorbent
composites. The chemical structure, swelling behavior, thermal stability, and potential
application in plant growth were characterized and studied. Overall this article is well
written. I have the following comments for the authors to address.
1. In line 169, the authors should cite literature for the IR band assignment.
Our response: we appreciate the reviewer very much for offering us such
constructive suggestions. We have cited relevant literature for the IR band assignment,
ref. [29] in the manuscript.
2. To prove the success of graft copolymerization, did the authors try use Soxhlet
extraction to make sure all the acrylics were well grafted?
Our response: we appreciate the reviewer very much for offering us such
constructive suggestions. As far as we know, the graft copolymerization is usually
proved by simple and efficient traditional characterization methods, such as fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In addition, we also cite the relevant
discussion results literatures in manuscript to further demonstration of our
experimental results. The relevant literatures are as follows:
[12 in manuscript] Y.A. Zheng, J.P. Zhang and A.Q. Wang, Chem. Eng. J., 2009, 155,
215–222.
[37 in manuscript] G.F. Ma, F.T. Ran, Q. Yang, E.K. Feng and Z.Q. Lei, RSC Adv.,
2015, 5, 53819–53828.
We are sorry that due to the limitations of the current experimental conditions and
time, we cannot use the method proposed by the reviewer to test present experiment.
We will focus on this method suggested by reviewers in our later work. We appreciate
the reviewer very much again for offering us the important and constructive
suggestions.
3. For thermal stability analysis, there are too much weight loss in the low
temperature range. The authors could try to dry the materials in the vacuum oven at
room temperature and then do the thermal stability test.
Our response: Thank you very much for reviewers' constructive suggestions. The
samples were dried in an oven at 60°C to constant weights and then milled before do
the thermal stability test in present manuscript. As the reviewers’ comment, the
vacuum drying is indeed also an effective method. And it is necessary to dry the
milled materials in the vacuum oven at room temperature and then do the thermal
stability test, which we will be used as one of the analytical methods in our later work.
4. It will help readers if the authors could provide some reaction scheme for the graft
copolymerization.
Our response: According to the reviewers' suggestions, we have provided the
reaction scheme for the graft copolymerization, as shown in the follow figure and in
Scheme 1 in Electronic Supporting Material.
Scheme s1. Proposed reaction mechanism for preparation of WB-g-PAA/LA.
We would like to express our great appreciation to Editors and Reviewers for
informing us that our manuscript will be accepted for publication in Royal Society
Open Science subject to minor revision in accordance with the referee suggestions.
Thank you very much for you kind consideration and looking forward to hearing
from you.
