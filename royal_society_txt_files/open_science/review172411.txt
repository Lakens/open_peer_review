Dear Editor,
This manuscript presents the description of a new pythonomorph specimen with exceptional
preservation. The manuscript is very well written, easy to follow, clear with adapted references. I
have only one main concern. I do not understand why there is so much importance in the
manuscript about the soft tissues, but no description of the bones/anatomy. I understand of
course that preservation is exceptional, but, if it can be described indeed, and should, it is not
what enables to draw the phylogeny and the conclusions. I thus strongly recommend to add to
the paper the description of the specimen in detail, which is an important part of the work (if not
the main one).
I thus disagree with wat is written in the abstract "the exceptional preservation of mineralized
muscles.....provides unprecedented sources of information about this extinct group of lizards"
and the end of the introduction "the astonishing preservation.......provides an unprecedented
source of information to help us better understand the morphology of pythonomorphs and their
interrelationship". This is not the description of these soft tissues that enables all that. I thus
recommend to change that. Since I am sure the authors did this description, in order to fill the
character matrix, this should be minor for them to add this section.
Otherwise, almost nothing to comment in this very well written manuscript. I join a pdf with
only a few comments.
Best wishes,
Alexandra Houssaye

This is a very well preserved lizard. The specimen preserves muscle tissue and integument. In
addition the authors propose that the taxon along with Tetrapodophis, a supposed basal snake, is
part of this clade of aquatic pythonomorphs and sister to snakes.
I am not in a position to evaluate those claims, as I am not a lizard expert. I hope that an expert
with knowledge of Tetrapodophis has seen the manuscript and evaluated their character
evaluations and scorings. What I notice is that tetrapodophis is just shifted a node from its former
placement, which has me worried. This may not be particularly robust, or it could be real.
Irrespective of character analyses, the actual analyses should follow some recent guidances. The
authors have only done MP and IW parsimony. This is shown to be overconfident and less
accurate. The authors should investigate their characters scorings with Bayesian methods. Check
out these papers here:
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pala.12330/full
http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/4/10/170833
Bayesian analyses is not difficult to do and would be easily executed after following a tutorial
from the developers, or similar. The Bayesian analysis would demonstrate the robustness of the
recoding, but not the validity of the codings. For example, recently Langer et al. recoded Baron et
al.'s character matrix on early dinosaurs. They claimed that by recoding 2000 characters they got
Saurischia, but that was only in Parsimony. Baron et al. analysed their recoded dataset and
obtained Ornithoscelida. Irrespective, if the authors are unwilling to report on Bayesian analyses
one may suspect that their result isn't robust.
I would like to focus on the taphonomy. This is a really interesting aspect in my view. Its rare to
find lizards with muscle preservation.
I have some reservations with their interpretations of the preservation and more precisely what
they argue is preserved. I would suggest some more careful wording of preservation here, so that
these aspects will not be cited incorrectly in the future.
Scale preservation. Indeed, scales are preserved, but as far as I can tell they are not phosphatised.
The authors argue they have been permineralised, but actually they shimmer from their absense
of phosphatised material and in fact, its the integument surrounding them that is permineralised.
In terms of the pathway to phosphatisation, the authors state: Page 13, line 34. "The bacteria,
although not actively involved in the mineralization of the soft tissues, formed the microbial film
that together with the sediment cover worked as a trap for the P (20, 21). Under these conditions,
with the establishment of an anoxic environment and a drop in the pH of the microenvironment
around the specimen, the precipitation of calcium carbonate from the surrounding sediment
would be inhibited, and the abundance of P would favour instead replacement by calcium
phosphate (19, 40)."
Here I would say that the sediment and microbial mat cannot trap ions in solution. What happens
is that diffusion is becoming limited by the fine grained sediment (which is limestone and hence
saturated with Ca+ and CO3-). This will allow for the localised acculumulation of metabnolic
products from the carcass, including phosphate ions, carbonic acids et al. this geochemical
gradient will lower the pH and hence switch the conditions from CaCO3 precipitation to CaPO3
as Wilby and Briggs have detailed previously. Microbial mats most likely has less to do with
creation of geochemical barriers and judging from the preservation of the specimen it did not sit
4
to rot for long on the seafloor prior to burial and allowing for a microbial mat to overgrow it.
Much of this work in the 90s and 00s thought that vast microbial mats were necessary because we
find bacterial fossils pseudomorphing soft tissues, but we now know with 100% certainty that
these are melanosomes and not bacteria. So, the foundation for the microbial mat paradigm is lost
and we need to carefully scrutinise some of this literature.
Hence, I would focus on two aspects. You have comparable conditions to those that is observed
in Hakel/Hjoula and Solnhofen, where you have rapid burial in carbonate rocks. Perhaps you
have microbial mats on the bedding planes. These help to ensure little exchange and dilution of
geochemical concentration gradients within the sediments. I would consider local enrichment of
P in the tissues in question. The authors suggest bones to be the source of P, but muscles have
ATP-rich mitochondria.
Another aspect that the authors should consider, and this is one that actually would speak in
favor of their aquatic interpretation!:
There are taxonomic as well as tissue specific trends in muscle preservation.
This study highlighted fabrics and specific taxa that tend to preserve
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016699597800563
This study highlighted biases within a single taxon
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pala.12237/full
The latter study discusses that this worm, a fireworm, is better preserved than other worms from
the same beds. It also highlight that certain muscles didn't preserve in this taxon and discuss that
the major muscle groups preserved could be due to phosphate availability, like for example
enriched in ATP-rich mitochondria or density etc.
Your taxon preserve extensively the lateral musculature. This may suggest that these muscles
have a different composition and elaboration than other muscles. Why could this be? Well, if
these are swimming by lateral undulation they may need extra high energy composition through
mitochondria and thus the lateral muscles are the ones with the right composition and phosphate
enrichment to preserve through this pathway.
Finally. It is clear that some epidermal, or subepidermal tissue is preserved. The authors here
propose that it may be the bilaminar fascia. This is not something I have seen argued before and
the authors does not substantiate this with any structural evidence from their taxon either. Here I
think that the authors need to review evidence of phosphatised epidermis and decide if they can
make such a claim on one evidence or another, or whether they would want to be less assertive in
this regard. I woudl say that the areas preserving scale impressions are preserved in the same
fashion as the ones that is suggested to preserve bilaminar fascia as the scales are clearly not
preserved, but the surrounding tissue. Hence, I would recommend extensive rewriting to make
this clear.
Overall. I think that this is a really important discovery. I recommend that the authors consider
the taphonomy and their interpretations here in a little more detail. In particular, there are some
recent literature that I think that they should consider and they need to more clearly articulate
what is preserved (tissue surrounding scales, not scales themselves and substantiate, or retract
from, bilaminar fascia) and perhaps think about my suggested observation that the preservation
of lateral muscles may indeed be because of their relative prowesses due to an aquatic mode of
life.

This paper describes a marine lizard from the upper Cretaceous of Italy and discusses its
implications for understanding the evolution of marine lizards. It is a very interesting specimen,
both because it has exquisite soft-tissue preservation and because it potentially helps shed light
on the evolution of the Mosasauroidea, a clade that dominated Late Cretaceous oceans. Overall
the paper is well done, but I recommend publication but feel the paper would benefit from doing
some additional phylogenetic analyses and/or adding characters to see whether the results are
robust against different assumptions, e.g. molecular topologies, different matrices such as the
Gauthier et al. 2013 one. I also feel that this specimen is interesting enough that it would merit
more extensive figures of the anatomy, photographs and ideally some line drawings.
DETAILED COMMENTS
Several things about this fossil are striking:
• It is a very late occurrence of a primitive lineage. It hints that basal mosasauroids persisted up
to the K-Pg boundary. I suspect the late Maastrichtian Pachyvaranus is another one of these,
although unfortunately so far all we have are vertebrae. This is an interesting range extension and
expands our understanding of latest Cretaceous marine diversity.
• It has a well-developed tail fluke. The tail is bent down at the same point as in derived
Mosasauridae. It has soft tissue extensions up, and to a greater degree, downward. This suggests
that a tail fluke of some kind probably characterized not just Mosasauridae but a wider range of
mosasauroids.
• The skin extends well beyond the ribs… this suggests a lot of tissue around the body, similar to
the situation of the Mexican plesiosaur where they appear to have been much fatter than
assumed. I’ve always wondered about this, and indeed the issue of accurate soft-tissue
reconstruction of marine vertebrates goes back to Melville’s writings about Basilosaurus in Moby-
Dick. He suggests there was a lot more soft tissue and baslisaurs were much fatter than you’d
think from the skeleton. Is the same true of mosasauroids?
6
ECOLOGY
Is it semiaquatic? Its possible that semiaquatic lineages persisted along fully aquatic lineages,
and an intriguing idea. Perhaps these things hauled out on rocks like marine iguanas to bask.
However the limbs and toes may not necessarily mean it was terrestrial; it may be benthic- using
limbs to crawl along the bottom in search of prey. I don’t have a good idea of how to test this
hypothesis to be honest.
EVOLUTION
“…the first evidence of a diverse and long-lived dolichosaur fauna”. Worth considering
Pachyvaranus here. It has a distinctly dolichosaur-like look to it, and in light of Primitivus, I
suspect it’s a dolichosaur or other primitive mosasauroid. Whether they are diverse, I don’t
know. It is part of the Tethys.
Did mosasaurs originate in the Tethys? Almost all the basal stuff is from the Tethys, with the
exception of Coniasaurus, which gets to the UK and US, and the more derived things
(Tethysaurus+Mosasauridae).
PHYLOGENY
In my opinion, there are a number of with the analysis. First, snakes and mosasaurs are nested
inside Anguimorpha, which is enforced by using only anguimorphs as outgroups. Or is this just a
rooting thing- the authors have assumed that anguids go basal but you could reroot the tree such
that Angiumorpha was monophyletic?
Whether mosasaurs are anguimorphs seems debatable, but the molecular data strongly support
the monophyly of Anguimorpha to the exclusion of Serpentes; Shinisaurus is sister to
Lanthanotus and Varanidae; Anguidae and Xenosauridae and Heloderma form a clade. This
pattern is consistently found in different studies using different genes and different models, and
in combined analyses.
The position of Simoliophiidae is intriguing in that the last author has suggested that they are a
paraphyletic assemblage of stem snakes, between crown snakes and mosasauroids, and here they
are crown snakes. Personally, I’m coming around to the idea that they are stem, and not crown,
snakes…
Tetrapodophis… I’m a bit biased here, but I stand by our interpretation of the fossils, and others,
such as Hussam Zaher, have independently replicated our results in terms of the placement of
this fossil (and Zaher was initially extremely sceptical of this result). I don’t think the evidence
supports dolichosaur affinities, or aquatic habits. It isn’t pachyostotic, doesn’t have a tail fluke,
and the limbs suggest grasping ability. I’d have an easier time believing it was arboreal than
marine. But it doesn’t really affect the paper all that much one way or the other.
I am a little puzzled by the phylogenetic position of Primitivus. I concede I haven’t spent enough
time looking at dolichosaur- and aigialosaur-grade animals. But this animal looks relatively
derived in several ways. The humerus looks as long or longer than the femur- that’s a mosasaurid
feature. The tail is proportionately short, which is another mosasaurid-like feature. The tail seems
to have a distinct downcurve to a degree not seen in Aigialosaurus or Adriosaurus. To me this
animal looks intermediate between “aigialosaurs” and mosasaurs.
My thinking is that it would be worth considering some other possibilities-
i. rerunning the analysis with a molecular constraint,
ii. perhaps throwing this thing into another analysis, e.g. Gauthier et al. 2013 or the
Tetrapodophis matrix.
Figures. Please add more figures! Closeup photographs of the skull, forelimbs, hands, spine, legs,
feet, hips, tail, etc. would be greatly appreciated by people studying evolution of primitive
mosasauroids and more likely to get your paper cited and your animal included in phylogenetic
analyses. Line drawings would be nice, but more figures are in my opinion necessary.

both because it has exquisite soft-tissue preservation and because it potentially helps shed light
on the evolution of the Mosasauroidea, a clade that dominated Late Cretaceous oceans. Overall
the paper is well done, but I recommend publication but feel the paper would benefit from doing
some additional phylogenetic analyses and/or adding characters to see whether the results are
robust against different assumptions, e.g. molecular topologies, different matrices such as the
Gauthier et al. 2013 one. I also feel that this specimen is interesting enough that it would merit
more extensive figures of the anatomy, photographs and ideally some line drawings.
DETAILED COMMENTS
Several things about this fossil are striking:
• It is a very late occurrence of a primitive lineage. It hints that basal mosasauroids persisted up
to the K-Pg boundary. I suspect the late Maastrichtian Pachyvaranus is another one of these,
although unfortunately so far all we have are vertebrae. This is an interesting range extension and
expands our understanding of latest Cretaceous marine diversity.
• It has a well-developed tail fluke. The tail is bent down at the same point as in derived
Mosasauridae. It has soft tissue extensions up, and to a greater degree, downward. This suggests
that a tail fluke of some kind probably characterized not just Mosasauridae but a wider range of
mosasauroids.

• The skin extends well beyond the ribs… this suggests a lot of tissue around the body, similar to
the situation of the Mexican plesiosaur where they appear to have been much fatter than
assumed. I’ve always wondered about this, and indeed the issue of accurate soft-tissue
reconstruction of marine vertebrates goes back to Melville’s writings about Basilosaurus in Moby-
Dick. He suggests there was a lot more soft tissue and baslisaurs were much fatter than you’d
think from the skeleton. Is the same true of mosasauroids?
ECOLOGY
Is it semiaquatic? Its possible that semiaquatic lineages persisted along fully aquatic lineages,
and an intriguing idea. Perhaps these things hauled out on rocks like marine iguanas to bask.
However the limbs and toes may not necessarily mean it was terrestrial; it may be benthic- using
limbs to crawl along the bottom in search of prey. I don’t have a good idea of how to test this
hypothesis to be honest.
EVOLUTION
“…the first evidence of a diverse and long-lived dolichosaur fauna”. Worth considering
Pachyvaranus here. It has a distinctly dolichosaur-like look to it, and in light of Primitivus, I
suspect it’s a dolichosaur or other primitive mosasauroid. Whether they are diverse, I don’t
know. It is part of the Tethys.
Did mosasaurs originate in the Tethys? Almost all the basal stuff is from the Tethys, with the
exception of Coniasaurus, which gets to the UK and US, and the more derived things
(Tethysaurus+Mosasauridae).
PHYLOGENY
In my opinion, there are a number of with the analysis. First, snakes and mosasaurs are nested
inside Anguimorpha, which is enforced by using only anguimorphs as outgroups. Or is this just a
rooting thing- the authors have assumed that anguids go basal but you could reroot the tree such
that Angiumorpha was monophyletic?
Whether mosasaurs are anguimorphs seems debatable, but the molecular data strongly support
the monophyly of Anguimorpha to the exclusion of Serpentes; Shinisaurus is sister to
Lanthanotus and Varanidae; Anguidae and Xenosauridae and Heloderma form a clade. This
pattern is consistently found in different studies using different genes and different models, and
in combined analyses.
The position of Simoliophiidae is intriguing in that the last author has suggested that they are a
paraphyletic assemblage of stem snakes, between crown snakes and mosasauroids, and here they
are crown snakes. Personally, I’m coming around to the idea that they are stem, and not crown,
snakes…
Tetrapodophis… I’m a bit biased here, but I stand by our interpretation of the fossils, and others,
such as Hussam Zaher, have independently replicated our results in terms of the placement of
this fossil (and Zaher was initially extremely sceptical of this result). I don’t think the evidence
supports dolichosaur affinities, or aquatic habits. It isn’t pachyostotic, doesn’t have a tail fluke,
and the limbs suggest grasping ability. I’d have an easier time believing it was arboreal than
marine. But it doesn’t really affect the paper all that much one way or the other.
I am a little puzzled by the phylogenetic position of Primitivus. I concede I haven’t spent enough
time looking at dolichosaur- and aigialosaur-grade animals. But this animal looks relatively
derived in several ways. The humerus looks as long or longer than the femur- that’s a mosasaurid
feature. The tail is proportionately short, which is another mosasaurid-like feature. The tail seems
to have a distinct downcurve to a degree not seen in Aigialosaurus or Adriosaurus. To me this
animal looks intermediate between “aigialosaurs” and mosasaurs.
My thinking is that it would be worth considering some other possibilities-
i. rerunning the analysis with a molecular constraint,
14
ii. perhaps throwing this thing into another analysis, e.g. Gauthier et al. 2013 or the
Tetrapodophis matrix.
Figures. Please add more figures! Closeup photographs of the skull, forelimbs, hands, spine, legs,
feet, hips, tail, etc. would be greatly appreciated by people studying evolution of primitive
mosasauroids and more likely to get your paper cited and your animal included in phylogenetic
analyses. Line drawings would be nice, but more figures are in my opinion necessary.

1 - “I thus strongly recommend to add to the paper the description of the specimen in detail, which is an
important part of the work (if not the main one).”
A detailed description of the specimen was originally presented in our supplementary
terial. We welcome the suggestion provided by Reviewer 1 to add the description of the
cimen to the main text.
2 - “It could also be exclusively aquatic, like probably aigialosaurs were (or the sea otter); it is not because
anatomy seems compatible with a terrestrial locomotion, like in the sea otter, that the animal is semi aquatic
sea otter spends 99.5% of its time in water).”
True, but this may depend on what we mean by ‘semi-aquatic’: 1) amount of time spent in
water; or 2) presence of aquatic adaptations but retention of the ability to move on land when
ded, as indicated by plesiopelvic anatomy and limb proportions. We agree with the fact that
alosaurs (e.g. Aigialosaurus, Carsosaurus, Komensaurus) may have spent most of their time in
water, but they were most certainly still capable of moving on land, as suggested both by their
vic girdle + sacrals anatomy (plesiopelvic condition), and limb proportions. Based on limb
portions, which are not as extreme as in other aigialosaurs (see below), our specimen was
ly better suited for occasionally walking on land. In any case, although interesting, a detailed
ussion of the boundaries between facultatively aquatic (a minority of the time spent in the
er) versus facultatively terrestrial (a minority of the time spent on land) versus obligatory
atic would be beyond the scope of this paper. Teasing such differences apart would likely
uire a detailed study of bone microanatomy. For example, the marine iguana is a powerful
mmer, capable of diving for up to an hour; however, they spend most of their time outside the
er, basking on rocks, and their gross anatomy doesn’t differ much from that of their fully
estrial sister-species. Similarly, many terrestrial lizards are able to swim in freshwater quite
ily, even when they don’t display clear aquatic traits (e.g. Physignathus, some other agamids,
anids, some anoles, etc…).
To further elaborate on our point above, a semi-aquatic lifestyle in our specimen is
gested by the retention of a functional sacrum (plesiopelvic condition, i.e. articulation between
sacral vertebrae+ribs and the pelvic girdle through the ilium, the so-called iliosacral or
roiliac joint), in a similar fashion to most terrestrial lizards. The sacrum/iliosacral joint is crucial
errestrial locomotion in tetrapods, because it transfers the forces of gravity between the
endicular and axial skeletons, and it is by far one of the most important features to consider as
igatory aquatic tetrapods, such as mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, cetaceans, tend to lose this joint.
fact that our specimen was capable of moving on land is hardly arguable even because of the
rall morphology of the limbs, and especially the hindlimb autopodium: “Unlike in Aigialosaurus
., in MPUR NS 161 the femur is still quite long relative to the axial skeleton, and the morphology
he pes is not significantly modified in comparison to a terrestrial lizard, as observed in
tosaurus.” The presence of a slightly hooked metatarsal V in our specimen is also suggestive of
tially terrestrial habits (e.g. Snyder 1954, Schaeffer 1941); in contrast to distally diverging
podials, which are instead associated to paddle-like limbs. This co-existence of terrestrial-like
tures together with aquatic-like features (e.g. dorso-ventrally expanded tail) is what lead us to
clude that a semi-aquatic lifestyle (facultatively terrestrial) is the most reasonable
rpretation.
Last, the paleoenvironment is also important: the sediments in which the specimen is
bedded originated in a sabkha-like environment (coastal sedimentation). These are supratidal
bonates with heavy dolomitization, coupled with the lack of any sign of displacement of the
cass. We believe it is reasonable to assume that the animal was actually living in such
ironment, and a coastal setting is more appropriate to a semiaquatic rather than an obligatory
atic lifestyle.

1 - “I have some reservations with their interpretations of the preservation and more precisely what they

le preservation. Indeed, scales are preserved, but as far as I can tell they are not phosphatised. The authors
e they have been permineralised, but actually they shimmer from their absense of phosphatised material and
ct, its the integument surrounding them that is permineralised.
r taxon preserve extensively the lateral musculature. This may suggest that these muscles have a different
position and elaboration than other muscles. Why could this be? Well, if these are swimming by lateral
ulation they may need extra high energy composition through mitochondria and thus the lateral muscles are
ones with the right composition and phosphate enrichment to preserve through this pathway.
lly. It is clear that some epidermal, or subepidermal tissue is preserved. The authors here propose that it may
he bilaminar fascia. This is not something I have seen argued before and the authors does not substantiate
with any structural evidence from their taxon either. Here I think that the authors need to review evidence of
sphatised epidermis and decide if they can make such a claim on one evidence or another, or whether they
ld want to be less assertive in this regard. I woudl say that the areas preserving scale impressions are
erved in the same fashion as the ones that is suggested to preserve bilaminar fascia as the scales are clearly
preserved, but the surrounding tissue. Hence, I would recommend extensive rewriting to make this clear.”
We have carefully evaluated Reviewer 2 suggestions about the scale-integument issue,
also read the literature he/she linked for us, that in turn led to further readings. We agree
h the claim that indeed it is the surrounding integument and not the scales themselves
ratinized stratum corneum) to be phosphatised, as this interpretation seems to be more
sistent with the preservation of our specimen, where the external morphology of the scales is
visible. Changes to our manuscript have been made accordingly: the words ‘skin’ and ‘scale’
e been mostly replaced with ‘integument’, and we used the term ‘scale impressions’ to refer to
outline of the scales being preserved because of the permineralization of the integument
ow the stratum corneum of the epidermis.
2 - “The authors should investigate their characters scorings with Bayesian methods.”
We have accepted this suggestion as well, and we have included a Bayesian analysis using
dataset. Changes to the manuscript have been done accordingly, and two additional
plementary files related to the Bayesian results and settings have also been included.
Reviewer 3:
We realise that as for Reviewer 1, most of the comments of Reviewer 3 seem to be due to
fact that he/she may have missed our supplementary information, and with it the osteological
cription and line drawings (e.g. adding more figures, line drawings, phylogenetic analysis
tings, etc.).

s soft tissue extensions up, and to a greater degree, downward. This suggests that a tail fluke of some kind

The tail in our specimen is incomplete, likely a great deal of tail is missing, and there is no
ual bending; simply the tail is exposed in dorsal view until a certain point, then there is a partial
ation and the last part is exposed in lateral view. The last caudals preserved on the slab are also
te large, not showing reduction in size as usually happens approaching the end of the tail.
thermore, presence of a tail fluke would be indicated by a change in orientation of the neural
nes (posteriorly oriented, vertical, anteriorly oriented), nothing of the sort can be observed in
specimen.

(see response above to Reviewer 1, point 2)
We believe that also in this case, part of the comments of Reviewer 3 are related to fact
t he did not see the line drawings and additional figures provided in the supplementary
terial, together with his misinterpretation of the tail (broken in our specimen and without a
e).
3 – “First, snakes and mosasaurs are nested inside Anguimorpha”
“i. rerunning the analysis with a molecular constraint,
ii. perhaps throwing this thing into another analysis, e.g. Gauthier et al. 2013 or the Tetrapodophis
matrix.”
We attempted to score our specimens in larger datasets, such as Gauthier’s. The problem
h such dataset is with the character construction: many of the characters are highly
blematic (see Simões et al. 2016), and reviewing a large squamate dataset is way beyond the
pe of this study. Moreover, assessing the phylogenetic relationships of our new specimen into
rge squamate dataset does not provide any good discussion about its position among
ichosaurs/pythonomorphs, unless significantly increasing the taxon sampling within these
asets (again beyond the purposes of this study). This is also why we decided to review instead a
aset that is more meaningful for the group of interest. In either Gauthier et al. 2012 (or even
der et al. 2015 and Conrad 2008), the new taxon simply follow on the ‘Mosasauria’ side of the
e, which does not add much to what is already obvious based on comparative anatomy. A focus
the intra-relationships of Pythonomorpha is way more appropriate in our case, and raises
resting discussions about the relative position of the different dolichosaurs, and between
ichosaurs, snakes and mosasauroids.
As for the ‘molecular constraint’, we prefer a non-constrained approach. It is well known
t molecular and morphological analyses do not agree on the position of squamate clades (see
der et al. 2015, Gauthier et al. 2012, Conrad 2008, Vidal & Hedges 2005, and more), and the
umption that one of the two sources of data provides superior results is unfounded. Applying a
lecular constraint would silence part of the phylogenetic signal in our morphological dataset,
this would be unjustified.
6 – “transversely expanded caudal scales. Aren’t these dorsoventrally expanded?”
This aspect is also easier to understand by looking at some of the figures in the
plementary material, which is why we have decided to welcome the suggestion of Reviewer 1
move that information to the main text: “In MPUR NS 161, either the tail is exactly in left lateral
w, with the scales visible along the ventral edge representing part of the right-side counterparts
e the paired condition in snakes), or due to twisting and compression of the soft tissues – as
gested by the irregularity of the tail base outline – the long scales represent complete,
nsversally expanded ventral scales (like the single condition in snakes).” These scales go side to
e across the ventral region of the body, which means they are expanded along the transversal
ne, and not dorso-ventrally.
