In this paper, the authors focused on an esterification reaction that is generally catalyzed by
Bronsted acids. They are studying the reaction in heterogeneous catalysis using a clay that has
Bronsted acidic sites. They modified this clay by the exchange of cations of the interfiloliar space
(Na+ and Ca2+) by other cations (Al3+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Mn2+ and Fe3+). The authors, at no time,
explains the choice of these ions and the interest of their presence in the clay. In addition, only
Al3+-based materials have been characterized and no significant difference with the base clay is
observed.

The paper may be published subject to the following modifications:
1. Authors must insert a space between the value and the unit for all data.
2. The volume unit is mL and not ml.
3. The polarity of toluene is 0.099 and not 0.999.
4. The diffractograms of the clay before and after exchange with the Al3+ ions are similar and I do
not think that a difference of values (9.93 Å and 9.81 Å) is significant. Moreover after exchange
the interfoliar space increases or decreases?
5. The results of the yields of p-Cresyl phenyl acetate (%) in tables 1 & 2 and figure 11 are not the
same.
6. The choice and role of metal cations must be specified.

there any side product was obtained when the catalyst amount was taken more than 0.75 g?
The percentage yield of product was maximum when the catalyst amount used at 0.75 g. When the
catalyst amount more than 0.75 g, no side product was obtained. p-cresyl phenyl acetate was only
product obtained in the esterification reaction.
any Fries -rearrangement was occurred during the esterification reaction?
No Fries – rearrangement reaction was observed during the esterification reaction.
C-NMR of the products must be reported to know the purity of the product.
13C NMR (d= ppm) 170.0, 148.6, 135.3, 133.6, 129.8, 129.3, 128.7, 127.2, 121.1, 40.8, 20.7
-Methoxyphenol and p-tert-butyl-phenol also be tested for this reaction to know the effect of donating
up and steric factor.
Authors thank to the reviewer for giving opportunity to test with these two reagents i.e
ethoxyphenol and p-tert-butyl-phenol. Esterification reactions were conducted by using different
-mont-nanoclay catalyst under standard reaction conditions. No product was obtained when the
rification reaction conducted using p-methoxy phenol and p-tert-butyl-phenol. Standard reaction
ditions in the esterification reaction explained in manuscript (table 4).

uthors must insert a space between the value and the unit for all data.
Corrections made in manuscript.
he volume unit is mL and not ml.
Corrections made in manuscript page numbers 2,3,6,7 and 8.
he polarity of toluene is 0.099 and not 0.999.
Corrections made in manuscript page number 4.
he diffractograms of the clay before and after exchange with the Al3+ ions are similar and I do not
k that a difference of values (9.93 Å and 9.81 Å) is significant. Moreover after exchange the interfoliar
ce increases or decreases?
The basal spacing values of raw nanoclay and Al3+-mont-nanoclay are 9.93 Å and 9.81 Å respectively.
The difference between these values looks very small. But after interacalation with metal cation (Mn+ =
Al3+) the interfoliar spacing of nanoclay increases.
he results of the yields of p-Cresyl phenyl acetate (%) in tables 1 & 2 and figure 11 are not the same.
We checked the data’s and corrected the mistake in figure 11. Table 1 refers that percentage of p-
cresyl phenyl acetate by varying different molar ratio of the reactants in presence of different Mn+-
mont-nanoclay. It was found that the maximum yield obtained when the molar ratio of the reactants
were 1:4 . By fixing that molar ratio (1:4) of the reactant as constant we conducted the experiment by
varying time period. The percentage yield obtained by varying reaction period were explained in
figure 11. It was found that the maximum yield obtained when the reaction time was 6 hours. Table 2
refers the regeneration activity of the catalyst. After completion of the reaction, the same catalysts
were taken for the reaction to study the regeneration activity of the catalyst upto four times and the
data’s provided in table 2.
he choice and role of metal cations must be specified.
The reaction can be carried out by using various metal cations, in this study selection of cations
purely on cost basis and environmental friendly.
Most frequently used cations in the preparation of cation-exchanged nanoclays include Al3+, Fe3+, Cr3+,
Zn2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and H+. The exchangeable cations play a key role in controlling surface acidity
and catalytic activity. More polar Al3+-ions provide highest activity and other ions with lower charge
to radius such as Fe3+ , and Zn2+, Mn2+, Cu2+ being less active .
The interlammellar cations present in nanoclay mineral when exchanged with highly polar species
such as Al3+ cations, results in increase in Brønsted acidity.
