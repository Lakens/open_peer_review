Dear Authors,
I send you the review of the manuscript RSOS-181402. In general, the manuscript is nearly
conforming to the journal requirements, formats and quality. General remarks are focused on a
better presentation of figures, and on including a comparison with previous works in a real
discussion section. Some others compositional analysis of water could be included in order to get
a complete view of the environmental concern authors are refereed to.
Section 2. Materials and methods
- Figure 1. Please include coordinates and a visible scale for the figure.
- I recommend authors to rename Section 2.1.1. as "Geological setting".
- Figures 2 and 3. Visible scales. Joint in only one figure could improve both figures. And include
two representatives photographs: one for the open pit and another for the underground roadway.
- What about the foliation of metamorphic rocks?. Orientation?. Please draw with the correct
orientation at the Figure 2.
- Faults are normal, inverse, slip-strike, ...? Displacement measured?
- 2.1.2. A reference for thickness of aquifer data is necessary.
- 2.2.1. P10 L7 "... (Fig. 5b)".
- A reference is necessary for SCM.
- An explanation (or reference) for water mineralisation groups is necessary.
- 2.2.2. What about the orientation of metamorphic foliation?. It could play an important role in
the infiltration of groundwater.
- Figure 11. Include a scale.
Section 3. Result
- Rename as "Results".
- Inset values in Figures 13, 14 and 15 are so small. Please enlarge for a correct visualization.
Section 4. Discussion
- P23 L22. Authors talk about "... environmental pollution." but nothing is said about the
potentially hazardous element contents in water composition. It could be very explicative to
include metallic composition of water previous and after passing for the mine roadways.
- P23 L59. A multilevel drainage method is using for the treatment of water. In this sense, include
the analytical results of the final chemical composition of water could be really interesting
focused in an abroad audience.
- Finally, as said at the presentation paragraph of this review, a real Discussion section is
necessary. Taken into account the presented data, a comparison with previous works on similar
scenarios could significantly improved the manuscript and increase audience. There are several
similar works for comparison.
I urge the authors not to view this solely as a critique but a chance to improve this paper to
convey their ideas and data in the best possible and most accurate manner.
Warm regards

This paper is interesting because the mine water inrush is an important problem, which it must
be addressed to ensure the water quality in mining areas. I believe that the article contributes to
scientific-technical knowledge, is well-structured and addresses the objectives proposed.
However, in my opinion, there are several issues that should be corrected prior to publication.
My suggestion is that the authors revise and reorder the text and include all the information
necessary to improve some aspects for its publication.
Groundwater flow model
1. Justify the domain of the model
2. Explain the boundary conditions applied
3. Calibration process. It would be necessary to show the input parameters and the parameters
obtained from the calibration; Level adjustment, Mass balance.
4. Justify the period time chosen to model
General
• The paper say that a methodology to prevent the mine water inrush has been implemented.
Please, explain how this methodology has improved or not the mine water inrush. Make an
assessment of the methodology used.
• The conclusion section is a repetition of what has been said in the introduction. Please, I
recommend that you restructure this section and focus on the conclusions

nk you for your question. As you pointed out, some references are necessary for explanation on
Shukalev classification method (SCM). In order to analyse the hydrogeological connectivity, the
rochemical analysis method was proposed to analyse the hydrochemical characteristics in the
y area. Hydrochemical classification is a comprehensive indicator for analysing the
rochemical characteristics of groundwater. At present, the SCM is one of the most widely used
hods in hydrochemical type analysis. The results of the hydrochemical analysis of water samples
the study area was placed in the classification table according to their chemical composition.
ed on the similar chemical composition between different water samples, the migration law of
ndwater was analysed. We have fully absorbed your suggestions and referred to related
rences. The description of the Schukalev classification method was added in the revised
uscript in Line 114-118 “Artificial exploitation significantly changes the concentrations of major
in the groundwater, resulting in the complex and diverse hydrochemical characteristics in the

rochemical characteristics of groundwater. At present, the Shukalev classification method (SCM)

n explanation (or reference) for water mineralisation groups is necessary.
ly:
nk you for your question. Unfortunately, we have not been able to give a clear explanation on the
nition of mineralization of water in the previous manuscript. Mineralization of water refers to the
of bicarbonates, chlorides, sulfates, nitrates, and various metals carbonates such as calcium,
nesium, aluminum, and manganese in the water. The SCM is based on the main ions
centrations and mineralization in groundwater. Water samples cannot be classified in detail based
ly on ion concentration. Ion concentrations greater than 25 meq% are categorized into 49 types.
mineralization of water is categorized into four types: Type A (<1.5 g/L), Type B (1.5-10 g/L),
e C (10-40 g/L), and Type D (>40 g/L). The advantage of this classification is that it is easy to
erstand and can be used to organize water analysis data. We have fully absorbed your suggestions
added the description of the SCM in the revised manuscript in Line 118-122 “The SCM is based
he main ions concentrations and mineralization in groundwater. Ion concentrations greater than
meq% are categorized into 49 types (Table 1). The mineralization of water is categorized into four
s: Type A (<1.5 g/L), Type B (1.5-10 g/L), Type C (10-40 g/L), and Type D (>40 g/L). The two
sifications—ion content and water mineralization—are combined into a designation of the form
A", for example, where 1 denotes the ion concentration and A denotes the water mineralization
35].”
What about the orientation of metamorphic foliation?. It could play an important role in the
tration of groundwater.
ly:
nk you for your question. Indeed, as you said the orientation of metamorphic foliation plays an
ortant role in the infiltration of groundwater. The well-developed foliation provide provide the
age channel for the groundwater. However, through related reference and the hydrogeological
of the study area, we found that both sets of the foliation of phyllite were closed before
avation. Therefore, the foliation of phyllite was barely influenced on the groundwater migration.

ussion in Line 267-297 “Mine water inrush has a great adverse impact on mining production, and

eover, based on the above analysis, it is illustrated that the excavated roadway is the main factor
cting groundwater migration. Therefore, appropriate measures should be taken to prevent mine
er inrush. Prevention measures can be divided into two aspects. (1) The first of these is surface
ention. The main source of groundwater in the study area is precipitation, and the main seepage
nnel is the outcropped fissures. Therefore, the work began with two aspects: reducing
ndwater sources and reducing precipitation seepage channels. Precipitation was observed in the
y area, and drainage projects were established to discharge the surface water in a timely manner.
itionally, a backfill layer of appropriate thickness was applied at the bottom of the pit to reduce
precipitation seepage channel. (2) The second aspect is underground prevention. Based on the
ementioned results of the study, preventing water inrush at the mine roadway was primarily a
ter of reducing the groundwater seepage channel. To address the faults and fissures around the
e roadway, a suitable plugging technology was adopted to effectively prevent the groundwater
flowing into the mine roadway. Simultaneously, a waterproof gate was installed in the mine
way, and the water inflow was monitored.
The distribution of aquifer in the study area nearly is upright and the aquitards on both sides of

ways is large. Due to the complex terrain and deep mining, traditional drainage methods cannot
dly and effectively solve the drainage problem in the study area. [44, 45]. Therefore, a multilevel
nage method was adopted for the treatment of mine water [46] (Fig. 15). (1) Water sumps and
ping stations were established at -320 m and -501 m before underground mining. (2) When

discharged to the surface reservoir by the pumping station and the drainage pipe. (5) According
