Multidimensional optical spectroscopies is an important tool for studying dynamics of chemical,
biological and nanomaterial systems. The current manuscript does provide a good overview of
the development of both the technique itself and a number of important results in the literature.
The reviewer find the paper informative, clear to follow and quite useful for readers working in
closely related fields. Therefore, I would recommend its acceptance by RSOS.
One minor comment: It is advised to try to shorten the manuscript a bit.

This is a nice summary of recent developments in multidimensional optical spectroscopy. Over
the last few years, traditional 2DIR and 2DES methods have been implemented in frequency
domains spanning UV to THz. This review provides a brief overview of 2D optical methods,
then devotes the majority of the discussion to the most recent progress in the area. Useful
examples from literature are presented to illustrate the new, but distinct information provided by
each variant of the 2D experiments. Attention is also paid to experimental considerations
associated with the different ways of implementing the 2D methods. Such practical information
should be helpful for those who are contemplating the most optimal experimental
implementation to best address their particular scientific questions. I think this review will be
useful to those both outside and within the community to get an overview of the current state of
the field and its directions in the near future.
Publication of the manuscript is recommended. I have only a couple comments that the authors
can utilize at their discretion.

In the discussion on pg 8 about the pros of the boxcar geometry, another consideration that could
be included is the ability to independently control the third excitation beam and LO intensities, to
ensure that the excitation beam does not limit the detection sensitivity.
Methods to implement pseudo-rotating wave data acquisition have been reported (e.g. Bloem,
Donaldson 2010, Opt Exp; Kramer, et al. JOSA 2016), which eliminate the need for sub-Nyquist
sampling (pg. 7, ln ~24).
The nomenclature "t1-w3" and "w1-w3" on page 7 to refer to 2D maps might be confusing to a
newcomer to the field, who might interpret the hyphen as a subtraction sign.
First line pg 13 - deltaT is confusing since t2 is used for the population time throughout the
document.
Suggest adding "vis" and "IR" on axes of Fig. 5 similarly to Fig. 6.
Suggest a careful editing of language and review for errors. Abbreviation use is not consistent
(e.g. 2D and CLS are sometimes used, sometimes spelled out). Nouns are commonly used as
adjectives, without hyphenation. Otherwise, note errors in following places: pg 5, ln 14 could
use "the" before "diagonal"; sentence pg 6, ln 53; sentence pg. 9, ln 56; "transition frequency" pg
15, ln 37 - which one?; pg 16, ln 27, "Fig. 5" should be "Fig. 6"; pg 23, ln 36, multiple "recently".
