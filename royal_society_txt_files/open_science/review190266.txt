Authors investigated the effects of Dendropanax morbiferus (DM) leaf extract on
oligodendrocyte (OL) development in this study. DM leaf extract treatment facilitated OL
differentiation and changed gene expression patterns in the OLs in both pure OPC cultures and
myelinating cocultures. Furthermore, they analyzed the components of DM leaf extracts by LC-
MS/MS, reporting novel components potentially effective on OL development.
This paper describes the effects of DM leaf extracts on OL development, which is a critical step
for targeting multiple sclerosis, a disease having a broad spectrum of patients. As there is no cure
for the multiple sclerosis currently regardless of high prevalence worldwide (2.3million people in
2015), novel targets appeared in this paper as well as basic science behind it have a value to
attract broad audience of RSOS. I think this study is scientifically sound and useful to the
community, therefore, relevant for the publication for RSOS in general.
The authors have originality on the report of basic biology about how DM leaf extracts affect OL
development and on identification of the potential bioactive components.
The methods used in this research is convincing and relevant when judged by researches in the
similar field. Authors used various primary cultures not the cell lines, which make the story
stronger. Authors limited their analysis in oligodendrocytes only, which made the interpretation
more clear. The interpretation of results are thought to be valid and appropriate.
Although this paper is thought to be suitable for the publication, followings are some minor
points that authors can consider for the improvement of the paper.

2. Authors used OL developmental markers in Figure 3. It will be nicer if they add additional
image information, which readers can understand how the marker expression changes according
to the developmental stage.

Authors demonstrated that Dendropanax morbiferus (DM) extracts enhance oligodendrocyte
differentiation, followed by increase in membrane size and axonal contacts, thereby indicating
enhanced myelination. DM-treated OPC cultures showed upregulation of MBP and
phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and enhanced myelin gene upregulations such as Myrf, CNP, and
PLP. The manuscript was designed and described well. DM may be important or novel
therapeutics for demyelinating disease. So this manuscript is suitable for publications.

The authors can show convincingly that the dendropanax morbiferus leaf EtOH extract increases
oligodendrocyte differentiation and membrane sheath size in culture.
Comments:
- Figure1: In the figure legend, statistical tests are described, however in the figure there are no
statistical tests in the figure.
- Figure1: The MBP-positive area per cell differs stronly between the OPC DIV4 14000 µm2 (k)
and OPC DIV3 3500 µm2 (p). How do the authors explain this difference in the effect of
4
dendropanax morbiferus leaf extract on the MBP-area?
- Figure2: The Western Blot shows a strong increase in MBP signal with DM extract, but the beta-
Actin surprisingly weak. In addition this experiment seems to be done only once. Would it be
possible for the authors to show another replicate?
-Table 1 is added twice in the manuscript.

A graphic image of oligodendrocyte development with marker information is provided as new Figure

solated OPC cultures contain oligodendrocyte lineage cells of mixed developmental stages. At DIV3,
e are still many immature oligodendrocytes, however once oligodendrocytes enter into the mature
e, the size of membrane expands fast. Next figure (O’Meara et al., 2011) describes how fast the
brane expansion progresses after DIV3. The graph shows about 8-fold increase in MBP+cell number
about 7.2-fold increase in MBP protein at DIV6 compared to DIV3. We measured MBP+ area and it
about less than 4-fold increase at DIV4 compared to DIV3 (new Figure 1n, o). As area is the most
essive factor in terms of oligodendrocyte maturity, our result is consistent with previous reports
ribing developmental stage of oligodendrocytes in vitro (O’Meara et al., 2011).
