This manuscript examines the differences in skin microbiomes between 6 species of frogs and
newts in Germany. I think the results are interesting and it is worth publishing, however, the
authors must address some of these concerns or questions.
1-The title says that species are syntopic. Do these species hybridize? I would like to see more
discussion about which of these species are closely related and how their microbiomes are
similar/different. For example, I would expect the Lissotritons to be more similar to each other
than to Ichthyosaura and Triturus. Although the number of species does not allow for
phylogenetic comparative methods, it would be interesting to see how evolutionary relatedness is
correlated with microbiome composition.
2-I would like to see more information about habitat partitioning in these species.
Minor comments

factors, such as season, location or host ecology”. Statement is not entirely true see McKenzie et al

Line 14-17 Long sentence and unclear. Rewrite. I did not understand the second set of numbers.
Are those Jaccard distances?

with shared OTUs among the 6 species.
Line 19 delete word ‘some’
Line 21 Break sentence after colonizers. Start new sentence about future studies. Also, how
genomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic analyzes are going to help understand chemical and
physical characteristics of the skin environment. What about differences in pH, cell size, structure
etc?

Line 43 delete ‘so far’
Line 45 “species from major clades of amphibians consistently differ from species of other such
clades in cutaneous microbial composition or diversity.” This statement needs to be rewritten. Is

Line 67 Remove capitalized S from spring
Line 135 replace ‘completed’ to ‘performed’.
Line 143-144 I don’t agree with the threshold chosen by the authors for this analysis. If the
comparisons are just between two categories (frogs vs newts), then the OTU should be present in
100% of the individuals of all species of newts/frogs.
Line 151 Here it starts to get confusing, why core microbiome differs from the LDA analyses, then
on line 155 another OTU table is used with a 75% threshold. I would recommend using the same
threshold for all the analyses.

The paper analyses microbiota composition of frogs and salamanders collected from two
different localities for patterns of differences between phylogenetically distinct and related taxa.
Differences in species richness and diversity between frogs and salamanders were found and
these were consistent across the two localities.
The cutaneous microbiome of amphibians is affected by many factors and teasing apart the
possible roles of host and environmental factors on microbiota variation by examining syntopic
species, as this study shows, can provide useful results. However, specific comparisons between
the life histories and corresponding habitat usage of the salamanders and frogs should be
considered to interpret the observed patterns of micobiota variation.
The study might be of more general interest if were to include results of screening for the
presence of amphibian pathogens known to affect amphibian population viability and
microbiota. Screening for Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and/or Batrachochytrium
4
salamandrivorans (Bsal) from swabs now is relatively routine. Availability of such data would be
very useful in interpreting the results.
Specific comments
Given that the study emphasises comparisons among syntopic species, low samples sizes (or
complete absence) of some species from some localities in the dataset reduces the generality of
the conclusions. Why were R. dalmatina and L. helveticus not represented from one locality, and
why were sample sizes of I. alpestris so low?
Sample collection (lines 77-79): Please mention the distance between the localities. Also mention
details on geographical variation and possible anthropogenic factors that may affect the collection
sites with potential consequences on skin microbiota.
Statistical analyses (lines 135-136) need to be explained in more detail. There are many different
types of ANOVA. What model was used, and using what software?
ANOVA results are not properly presented (line 164). How many degrees of freedom in the
comparison, and what error term was used? Also P is indicated with unjustifiable precision.
Have authors screened Bd/Bsal from swab samples? This would provide a possible basis for
understanding patterns of cutaneous microbiota variation within and between species/families.
Authors have quoted the evidence that Bd can alter skin microbiome (lines 36 and 310), so might
expand their paper if they have such data available from their swabs.

manuscript examines the differences in skin microbiomes between 6 species of frogs and newts in
many. I think the results are interesting and it is worth publishing, however, the authors must address
e of these concerns or questions.
he title says that species are syntopic. Do these species hybridize? I would like to see more
ussion about which of these species are closely related and how their microbiomes are
ilar/different. For example, I would expect the Lissotritons to be more similar to each other than to
hyosaura and Triturus. Although the number of species does not allow for phylogenetic comparative
hods, it would be interesting to see how evolutionary relatedness is correlated with microbiome
position.
would like to see more information about habitat partitioning in these species.
ponse: We used “syntopic” here with the meaning of “joint occurrence of two species in the same
itat at the same time”. While we believe the reviewer is not uncomfortable with the term itself, we have
aced it in the manuscript with “co-occurring”. We have furthermore emphasized that these species, in
two ponds, co-occur strictly within the very same small pond area and thus are certainly exposed to
same environmental reservoir of bacteria in their terrestrial habitat. We have furthermore emphasized
these species in general do not hybridize, with exceptional hybridization recorded from the two
otriton. We have also added a table of the pair-wise species distances to show the microbial
inctness patterns with respect of more and less closely related host species. Briefly, for the sampled
ts there was no clear pattern of congeners being more similar than species from different genera. We
e also briefly mentioned this in the discussion.
or comments
8-9 “these differences have rarely been analyzed in systems that minimize confounding factors, such
eason, location or host ecology”. Statement is not entirely true see McKenzie et al ISMEJ, Kueneman
l. MolEco, Belden et al. Frontiers Micro.
ponse: We have adjusted the wording of this sentence to make it less strong. It now reads: “however,
studies have analysed these differences in systems that minimize confounding factors, such as
son, location or host ecology.” It’s important to note, that the three references mentioned here are
uded within the introduction when introducing the concept of host-specific communities.
acknowledge that other studies have also addressed this; however, we see only the Mckenzie et al
er as fully removing the stated factors, and this study focused on larval amphibians. Belden et al
pares amphibian species with very different habitat usages (terrestrial and arboreal frogs), and
neman et al again studies species that will differ in host microhabitat usage.
14-17 Long sentence and unclear. Rewrite. I did not understand the second set of numbers. Are
e Jaccard distances?
ponse: We have rewritten this as follows to improve its clarity: “While frogs and newts had similar
neous bacterial richness, their bacterial composition strongly differed. The average Jaccard distances
ween frogs and newts >0.5, while between species within these groups the Jaccard distances were
0.387 and 0.407 for frogs and newts, respectively.”
17-19 I do not think that this core analysis is appropriate. The comparisons should be done with
red OTUs among the 6 species.
ponse: We believe there has been a slight misunderstanding here as a result of ambiguity
ounding our use of the word “core”. In effort to clarify this we have removed the word “core” in the
tract, and worked to clarify this within the methods on LEfSe and core computation.
explain further, in the context of the LEfSe, we used the “compute_core_microbiome.py” script to
erate lists of common OTUs for each species as a way to focus the LEfSe analysis on true
ochthonous member and minimize the number of comparisons being performed. The lists from each
cies were compiled and then the OTU table composed of all samples from all species was filtered to
ntain the OTUs from the compiled list. These calculations were not meant to define the core
munities.
e restrict the LEfSe comparison to only shared OTUs we will lose important information about OTUs
are perhaps abundant on one group and nearly absent in the other.
19 delete word ‘some’
ponse. This change has been made.
21 Break sentence after colonizers. Start new sentence about future studies. Also, how genomic,
scriptomic and metabolomic analyzes are going to help understand chemical and physical
racteristics of the skin environment. What about differences in pH, cell size, structure etc?
ponse: We have broken the sentence where suggested and expanded the future studies piece to
ude specific investigations into the chemical composition of the skin. We have chosen to keep the
ement of the omics methods as it pertains to both host and microbiota sequencing. For example, with
t transcriptomics we can begin to understand what is expressed in skin.
cted efforts to understand how the chemical composition of the mucosal environment differs among
t and the specificity of amphibian antimicrobial peptides against potential colonizers as well as
omic, transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of both hosts and their microbiota will help to better
erstand this intriguing pattern.
33-34 Not true. See Walke et al Biotropica 2011
ponse: We have adjusted this sentence to include this reference. It now reads: “While vertical
smission may provide initial colonizers for some amphibian species [9]; maintenance of amphibian
microbial communities likely results from continual exchange from the environment[5]”
43 delete ‘so far’
ponse: This change has been made.
45 “species from major clades of amphibians consistently differ from species of other such clades in
neous microbial composition or diversity.” This statement needs to be rewritten. Is the objective to
that there are phylogenetic differences in amphibian microbiomes?
ponse: We have rewritten this sentence in effort to make it clearer.
ow reads, “However, field studies have often compared species from different genera; it remains
xplored whether cutaneous microbial composition or diversity consistently differ to the same extent
n comparing species from within major amphibian clades or genera as when comparing species from
ween these major clades (i.e. does host phylogeny play a role in amphibian microbial differences?).”
67 Remove capitalized S from spring
ponse: This change has been made.
135 replace ‘completed’ to ‘performed’.
ponse: This change has been made.
143-144 I don’t agree with the threshold chosen by the authors for this analysis. If the comparisons
just between two categories (frogs vs newts), then the OTU should be present in 100% of the
viduals of all species of newts/frogs.
ponse: We believe, as explained above, there was misunderstanding associated with this analysis. If
restrict the LEfSe comparison to only shared OTUs across all groups we will lose important
rmation about OTUs that are perhaps abundant on one group and nearly absent in the other. We
eve this confusion is associated with our use of the word “core”, and we have now, throughout the
nuscript, used core only with respect to our description of the core community (OTUs found on 90% of
viduals).
151 Here it starts to get confusing, why core microbiome differs from the LDA analyses, then on line
another OTU table is used with a 75% threshold. I would recommend using the same threshold for all
analyses.
ponse: We have recalculated these distances using the same threshold as the core analyses (90%).
161 I would suggest incorporating pairwise comparisons directly in Fig. 1 instead of having tables 1
2.
ponse: Thanks for this suggestion. We have incorporated the main effect statistical details (Table 1)
the figure. We have chosen to keep table 2 (now Table 1) as it is difficult to display these pair-wise
parisons when we have the two locations presented separately.
208-209 True, but also they might inhabit different areas of the ponds. Any insights on this? Do you
k that ponds are completely homogenous?
ponse: We have added a sentence here to acknowledge that we cannot fully separate differences
ociated with microhabitat use; however, it’s important to note that individuals of frogs and newts are
n found in the same exact habitat in the shallow edges of the ponds. The sentence we added says
ile we cannot fully exclude differences in microhabitat preferences between frogs and newts as factor
encing cutaneous bacterial composition, individuals of both groups are often found in the shallow
es of the ponds.”
222 Please mention which are the 3 OTUs.
ponse: The names of these taxa have been added to the discussion.
226-227 I didn’t see in the methods anything about environmental samples. Please check.
ponse: Indeed, thank you for noticing this. We failed to mention this in the methods. We have now
ed this to the methods. We have also added a brief summary in the results to document the major
present in the pond water.
228-231 Maybe move to methods? Seems awkwardly placed.

ponse: We agree Bd/Bsal survey data are of interest. We do have such data, however, they are
ently within another manuscript that has recently been accepted for publication in ISMEJ. We have
ed a sentence in the discussion noting the presence of Bd at the sampled ponds.
cific comments
en that the study emphasises comparisons among syntopic species, low samples sizes (or complete
ence) of some species from some localities in the dataset reduces the generality of the conclusions.
y were R. dalmatina and L. helveticus not represented from one locality, and why were sample sizes
alpestris so low?
ponse: Unfortunately the ability to have all species at the same site is quite difficult. Rana dalmatina
Lissotriton helveticus are not known to occur in Kleiwiesen, and we have now added a sentence to
erials and Methods specifying this. It also is worth mentioning that finding exact biological replicates
hese species co-occurring in precisely the same pond is difficult. The pond in the Elm is in fact the
site known to us, and rather exceptional, in that all four Central European newt species occur here at
ctly the same spot.
his study, our focus was on minimizing environmental effects by strictly focusing on amphibian
viduals collected in the same period of time from the same sites, and this led to somewhat uneven
ple numbers, as is now mentioned in Materials and Methods. For instance, the sample sizes for I.
stris at Kleiwiesen is low because during these sampling dates very few individuals were captured.
itional individuals were sampled on later dates (March 24 and April 1), however, to minimize the time
dow of sampling they were not included in this study.
ple collection (lines 77-79): Please mention the distance between the localities. Also mention details
geographical variation and possible anthropogenic factors that may affect the collection sites with
ential consequences on skin microbiota.
ponse: We have added a description of the sampling locations to the methods.
istical analyses (lines 135-136) need to be explained in more detail. There are many different types of
OVA. What model was used, and using what software?
ponse: Additional details on the performed ANOVAs have been added to the methods.
OVA results are not properly presented (line 164). How many degrees of freedom in the comparison,
what error term was used? Also P is indicated with unjustifiable precision.
ponse: We have added in the degrees of freedom, and rounded the p-value to 3 decimal places.
e authors screened Bd/Bsal from swab samples? This would provide a possible basis for
erstanding patterns of cutaneous microbiota variation within and between species/families. Authors
e quoted the evidence that Bd can alter skin microbiome (lines 36 and 310), so might expand their
er if they have such data available from their swabs.
ponse: As mentioned above, we agree Bd/Bsal survey data are of interest. We do have these data
ever, they are currently within another manuscript that has recently been accepted for publication in
EJ. In any case, although we have evidence for Bd in the system, its prevalence is low (about 6%
rall among the newts, across species and seasons) and therefore it is unlikely that our results in the
sent study would have been strongly influenced by the presence of the pathogen in some samples.
is now also briefly mentioned in the Discussion.
