“The analysis of glutamate and glutamine frequencies in human proteins as markers of tissue
oxygenation”
Summary:
The authors of this study examined the ratio of glutamate to glutamine in proteins, and related
these values to local oxygenation status in the environment where the protein is produced. The
tissues selected in this study, epidermis and liver, were chosen because both are striated in terms
of access to nutrients and oxygenation status, and thus could be evaluated by use of tissue/zone
specific protein expression. Because glutamine synthesis is favored under conditions of hypoxia,
the authors hypothesized that regions of tissue that have less access to oxygen would
preferentially produce proteins containing more glutamine (i.e. the Glu:Gln ratio would be
lower). To test this hypothesis, the authors used cluster and statistical analysis of Gln:Glu ratios
in proteins expressed in each zone of the epidermis or liver. Their hypothesis was supported by
the epidermis model in which metabolism may be more self-contained, but the more complicated
metabolic requirements of the liver indicated that the hypoxia model may only serve as a good
predictor of protein expression in such self-contained systems.
Overall, the authors generate the interesting hypothesis that the known effects of hypoxia on
glutamine synthetase and glutaminase, which favor higher glutamine levels, ultimately result in
the translation of proteins reflective of oxygenation status. While the link between hypoxia and
glutamine metabolism has been previously demonstrated, the link between glutamine/glutamate
availability and protein translation seems more tenuous. The authors suggest that this link could
be 1) amino acid response elements (AAREs) that function as enhancers that sense AA levels, and
2) spatial organization of genes with similar AA compositions. Both of these are reasonable
suggestions, but neither is explored beyond speculation. Moreover, the relationship that the
authors are trying to establish is further complicated by tissue access to external AA sources,
which is acknowledged in the liver model. Ultimately, this study establishes a correlation
between oxygen levels and preferred protein translation in specific model systems, but provides
no causal link.
Major points:
1) The link between AA availability and protein translation could be greatly strengthened by the
identification of AAREs upstream of the analyzed proteins in both epidermis and liver models. If
such enhancers are identified, it could help resolve the conflicting trend found in liver tissue.
2) The authors suggest that genes might be physically clustered based on AA composition, so that
they can be translated together when a specific AA is abundant. Besides the EDC, are there other
such clusterings that could be identified? This, again, would support the link between hypoxia
and protein AA content.
3) As the authors demonstrate, hypoxia is only a valid predictor of preferential protein
production when metabolism is relatively self-contained. Are there other such systems that could
further support the epidermis model? I.e., where else is this model useful? The hypothesis could
3
be made more universal if Major Point 5 is addressed.
4) The authors, as they acknowledge, evaluate protein AA content in terms of percentages, which
removes protein size from consideration. It would be interesting if the authors also performed an
evaluation on absolute numbers of Glu/Gln within a protein and its expression level. For
example, would a large protein with a much higher number of glutamines (even if the ratio
Glu:Gln is high) be translated more under conditions of hypoxia than a smaller protein with a
similar AA content? This would strengthen their hypothesis considerably and support the trend
seen in their evaluation of Glu/Gln ratios.
5) Ultimately, the link between hypoxia and protein translation will need to be tested
experimentally. The authors could conceivably test this hypothesis in a cell-culture system by
varying levels of glutamine and evaluating transcription of target genes by RT-PCR. Until an
experiment like this is done, the relationship at the heart of this manuscript will remain
speculation.
6) The authors say on page 4, line 26-28, that: “The exposure to hypoxia increases both GS mRNA,
protein levels and enzymatic activity…” Where is GS mRNA increased? It seems important to
this study that mRNA levels of GS are increased in the two model systems presented.
Minor points:
1) If data is available to quantify oxygen levels in epidermal layers, it would be better than “low,
medium, and high.”
2) All references beyond reference 31 are missing from the reference list (but still cited in paper).
3) References are not cited consistently—some are cited in parenthesis, some as superscript, and
some with author name.
4) The sentence on page 3, lines 16-26, is confusing and could be written much more clearly.
5) The sentence on page 11, line 22: “the overall elongation rate of transcription is tightly
controlled by translation” seems as if the words transcription/translation were swapped. This
could not be verified, however, as reference 32 was not provided.

Comments to the Author(s)
This interesting article deal with the analysis of amino acid content as indicator of a specific
cellular context. Specifically, the article stresses the role of oxygen gradient on the control of
protein expression. It represent a new approach to evaluate general interest in biological
chemistry and estimation of glutamate/glutamine ratio can give useful information on the level
of tissue oxygenation. This could be a potential marker of hypoxia, a common condition in the
pathophysiology of various diseases.
The manuscript appears well written and protocol well developed.

Summary:
The authors of this study examined the ratio of glutamate to glutamine in proteins,
and related these values to local oxygenation status in the environment where the

chosen because both are striated in terms of access to nutrients and oxygenation

Overall, the authors generate the interesting hypothesis that the known effects of
hypoxia on glutamine synthetase and glutaminase, which favor higher glutamine
levels, ultimately result in the translation of proteins reflective of oxygenation status.
While the link between hypoxia and glutamine metabolism has been previously
demonstrated, the link between glutamine/glutamate availability and protein
translation seems more tenuous. The authors suggest that this link could be 1)
amino acid response elements (AAREs) that function as enhancers that sense AA
levels, and 2) spatial organization of genes with similar AA compositions. Both of
these are reasonable suggestions, but neither is explored beyond speculation.
Author response: The suggested mechanisms are discussed as two explanatory
models for gene clustering. In fact we analysed the EDC complex, which is
responsible for the coordinated synthesis of many proteins enriched in glutamine.
Our belief is that the amino acid availability selects and drives the simultaneous
translation of many proteins, hence the evolutionary pressure to bring the genes
together, as we discuss at page 12. Because this is a novel hypothesis, we
considered possible and discussed also the possibility supported by previous
studies, which is the presence of AAREs sensing the amino acid levels and
enhancing the coordinated protein synthesis. Stimulated by the comments of the
Reviewer, we went further into the subject and we found out that the glutamine
does not seem to be involved in AARE regulation, differently from other amino
acids. We added this observation in the text.
Moreover, the relationship that the authors are trying to establish is further
complicated by tissue access to external AA sources, which is acknowledged in the
liver model. Ultimately, this study establishes a correlation between oxygen levels
and preferred protein translation in specific model systems, but provides no causal
link.
Author response: In our opinion the causal link is the control of translation exerted
by glutamine availability. Whereas other amino acid can directly control transcription
through AAREs, no one ever found evidences that glutamine works this way.
Besides the control of transcription, other mechanisms can influence the production
of proteins, such as mRNA stability and translation. Glutamine could work
controlling the steps that follow transcription, which should be reasonably linked.
For example when the translation of a gln-rich protein slows down because of
scarce availability of glutamine, the stability of messenger is affected and the
synthesis of the protein is reduced, and vice versa.
Major points:
1) The link between AA availability and protein translation could be greatly
strengthened by the identification of AAREs upstream of the analyzed proteins in
both epidermis and liver models. If such enhancers are identified, it could help
resolve the conflicting trend found in liver tissue.
Author response: We believe that the conflicting trend is due to intracellular
availability of gln, as we discussed in the manuscript, page 16. We propose that the
difference between skin and liver is not generated by a conflicting control of
transcription but rather by a different utilization of glutamine, because the amino
acid is incorporated into proteins by skin and released in circulation by liver.
Moreover, glutamine does not seem to be involved in AARE regulation, differently
from other amino acids. Glutamine is described as an important regulator of gene
expression without any evidence for a ‘glutamine- responsive element’. This point
has been added in text at page 12.
Based on these considerations, the research of AAREs would give results not
linked to the ratio glu/gln of the analised proteins.
2) The authors suggest that genes might be physically clustered based on AA
composition, so that they can be translated together when a specific AA is
abundant. Besides the EDC, are there other such clusterings that could be
identified? This, again, would support the link between hypoxia and protein AA
content.
Author response: After further evaluation of published data, we found another
gene clustering that is transcribed only in granular keratinocytes: the family of lipase
enzymes, which are codified by genes located in chromosome 10 q23.31. This
specialized human genomic locus includes six lipase genes and five other genes of
apparently unrelated function. The human lipase genes appear to be exclusively
expressed in the epidermis and their expression is highly specific for granular
keratinocytes that are exposed to the lowest oxygen tension of epidermis (7
mmHg). The analysis of the human 10q23.31 locus originated a list of proteins that
is shown in supplementary Table S2. The ratio glu/gln of the lipase locus (LIP) was
significantly lower than the ratio calculated for the proteins codified by the nearby
genes, in agreement with the analysis of the EDC locus. The new data have been
added in Fig.3 and are discussed at page 11.
3) As the authors demonstrate, hypoxia is only a valid predictor of preferential
protein production when metabolism is relatively self-contained. Are there other
such systems that could further support the epidermis model? I.e., where else is
this model useful? The hypothesis could be made more universal if Major Point 5 is
addressed.
Author response: In this work we have analysed the glu/gln ratio of different
proteins in the same tissue exposed to an oxygen gradient. This model is unique in
its simplicity and self-containment. However, we can transpose the concept when
we compare the glu/gln ratio of the same protein produced as isoform in distinct
tissues differently oxygenated or when we compare proteins that alternate their
expression in the same tissue with an oxygen-related oscillation. A new analysis
has been added as a new paragraph at page 14, with an additional figure 5.
4) The authors, as they acknowledge, evaluate protein AA content in terms of
percentages, which removes protein size from consideration. It would be interesting
if the authors also performed an evaluation on absolute numbers of Glu/Gln within a
protein and its expression level. For example, would a large protein with a much
higher number of glutamines (even if the ratio Glu:Gln is high) be translated more
under conditions of hypoxia than a smaller protein with a similar AA content? This
would strengthen their hypothesis considerably and support the trend seen in their
evaluation of Glu/Gln ratios.
Author response: The proposed evaluation would be interesting, actually when we
planned our analysis we took into consideration this approach. However, there are
a number of different obstacles that can interfere with this kind of analysis. First of
all, experimental data comparing the expression of the selected proteins in the
same tissue in the same experimental conditions are not available, therefore we do
not know whether the size and the expression levels are related. Second, many
steps following transcription could influence the amount of protein synthesized and
could introduce unpredictable variables, for example the stability of the mRNA or
the amino acid sequence in the protein. We demonstrate that the ratio glu/gln is
important, but other factors could interfere with the translation process and the
relationship between absolute numbers of Glu/Gln and protein expression could be
not necessarily linear. Third, it is of note that the ratio Glu/Gln does not change
between absolute numbers and percentage, and in our analysis we highlight the
importance of the ratio in relation to oxygen levels. For these reasons, we decided
to work with percentages and removed protein size from consideration. We added a
comment at page 9.
5) Ultimately, the link between hypoxia and protein translation will need to be
tested experimentally. The authors could conceivably test this hypothesis in a cell-
culture system by varying levels of glutamine and evaluating transcription of target
genes by RT-PCR. Until an experiment like this is done, the relationship at the heart
of this manuscript will remain speculation.
Author response: The aim of our work was to analyse a self-contained model to
prove the correlation between glu/gln ratio and tissue oxygenation. Once this is
proved beyond speculation, some hypothesis can be put forward about the
mechanisms, and it is true that this study, not conceived as an experimental work,
cannot reach definitive conclusions. We assume that glutamine does not modulate
directly the transcription step, because it has been reported that it does not work
through AAREs and because we could not find in literature evidences of mRNAs
levels modulated directly by glutamine. For example the work by Bellon and coll.
concluded that glutamine exerts its stimulating effect on collagen synthesis
indirectly at the transcriptional level, with a mechanism requiring protein synthesis.
If glutamine controls the activity of many transcription factors, the variation of its
levels in vitro could influence many pathways and the results could be unclear.
Moreover, we expect that the deprivation of gln would induce glutamine synthase
activity, as shown by the studies in vitro on keratinocytes carried out by Danielyan
(reference 8), and this would override the modulation of transcription. For these
reasons we feel that the suggested experiments would not give definitive answers
about the mechanism that links glutamine availability and glutamine incorporation
into proteins. We added a comment at page 12.
6) The authors say on page 4, line 26-28, that: “The exposure to hypoxia
increases both GS mRNA, protein levels and enzymatic activity…” Where is GS
mRNA increased? It seems important to this study that mRNA levels of GS are
increased in the two model systems presented.
Author response: The references cited in the text refer to the increase of GS
activity induced by hypoxia in vivo, in brain (ref 8), muscle and liver (ref 9). One
study in vitro (10) carried out on PC12 cells demonstrated the induction of mRNA,
protein and activity.
We have modified the text to make the information clear.
The study of Danielyan and coll. (reference 8) showed the high expression of the
protein in the epidermal granular layer by immunohistochemistry and the increased
activity of GS in vitro when keratinocytes were deprived of glutamine or the same
cells were treated with ammonium chloride or dexamethasone. It is therefore clear
that during the passage from basal layer to outer layers GS is induced by hypoxia,
surely also at the mRNA level although not directly measured. Interestingly, also in
the liver model the same induction occurs in the hypoxic zone, as in table 2 GS is
listed among the proteins specifically expressed in the perivenous hypoxic zone.
This is highlighted also in the text at page14. Therefore we can confirm that mRNA
levels of GS must be increased in the two model systems presented.
Minor points:
1) If data is available to quantify oxygen levels in epidermal layers, it would be
better than “low, medium, and high.”
Author response: We described the oxygen tension of different epidermal layers at
page 8.
2) All references beyond reference 31 are missing from the reference list (but
still cited in paper).
3) References are not cited consistently—some are cited in parenthesis, some
as superscript, and some with author name.
Author response: We corrected the references, sorry for the previous mistakes.
4) The sentence on page 3, lines 16-26, is confusing and could be written much
more clearly.
Author response: The sentence has been modified
5) The sentence on page 11, line 22: “the overall elongation rate of transcription
is tightly controlled by translation” seems as if the words transcription/translation
were swapped. This could not be verified, however, as reference 32 was not
provided.
Author response: The sentence is correct and the reference has been revised.
