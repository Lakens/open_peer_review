This study claims to visualize ‘reactivity’ of nanostructures by making functionalzsed nanotubes
and mixing them with gold nanoparticles. The hypothesis is that the gold nanoparticles
chemisorb on the area of functionalized nanotubes pin-pointing the location of functionality.
There are many reports in the literature on nanotube-nanoparticle interaction, including
carboxylated, thiolated, aminated etc. nanotubes as well as un-functionalized nanotubes (which
still contain some groups even without functionalization). This area has been well developed in
the past 15 years, and it has been shown by dozens of research groups that gold nanoparticles can
effectively bind to supposed positions of functional groups, and to un-functionalized nanotubes
alike due to Columbic and dispersion interactions directly with the carbon lattice of nanotube.
On the technical level, the title is wholly inappropriate – there is no even a hint of visualizing
‘reactivity’ in this work. The authors do not demonstrate any images / movies of chemical
reactions in nanotubes, and the claim of visualizing positions of the functional groups is
questionable. There is no evidence that the functional groups are present in the material, and the
Raman spectra are inconclusive at best. Further, even if the groups are present there is no direct
evidence that the positions of the group corresponds to the positions of Au nanoparticles, so the
claim of visualizing reactivity is unjustified.

The paper presents a microscopic method to determine the presence of functionalities in different
carbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene. The authors propose a method which
is based on mixing the functinalized materials with gold nanoparticles and subsequently
3
observating them by TEM. According to the position of gold nanoparticles respect to the carbon
support, the position of the functional group could be determine. Three different materials have
been used: single wall carbon nanotubes, multiwall carbon nanotubes and graphene flakes. Each
sample was analized as pristine, oxidised and after a Boc modification. Despite the fact that the
functionaliztion was characterise by Raman spectroscopy, other techniques are necessary to
support this results. Karl-Fischer analysis should be shown and temogravimetric analysis or FT-
IR could help to quantify and furhter discuss the results. I encourage the authors to provide a
more interconneted discussion between the data obtained with the different systems.
The TEM images, in every case are shown in different scales and it makes the comparison hard.
Also, an EDS analysis could favor the interpretation.
Some punctual points:
During the discussion of the origin of the graphene D band, it is not only determined by edges,
vacancies or topological deffects should be mentioned.
FIgure 5: all spectra should be presented with bigger amount of sampled points in order to
smooth the signal. Extra signals are observed in the blue spectra, authors should explained what
are they due to.
In Figure 6, an extra discussion about the change in D' should be added.

This manuscript entitled “Imaging Carbon Nanostructures Reactivity” presents the results on the
experimental investigation of carbon nanotubes and graphene flakes by well-characterized
covalent organic reactions. Raman spectroscopy was used to corroborate the degree of
functionalization achieved for each reaction on each type of carbon nanostructure. Presented
results on the experimental methodology for investigation of the functionalized carbon nanotubes
and graphene can reveal its structural conformation. The presented manuscript is well written
and organized and obtained results are of high interest. Presented methodology is expected to
improve the design of hierarchical interfaces which will contribute to the search for the
4
integration of carbon nanostructures in composite and functional materials with unique
properties. Therefore I can recommend publication of the manuscript as present.

Title: Imaging Carbon Nanostructures Reactivity
Manuscript ID: RSOS-180605
We appreciate the remarks made by the Reviewers. Their comments
have definitely allowed us to improve our final manuscript. We have
extensively revised and modified the manuscript according to the
requests done, as follow:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This study claims to visualize ‘reactivity’ of nanostructures by making
functionalzsed nanotubes and mixing them with gold nanoparticles. The
hypothesis is that the gold nanoparticles chemisorb on the area of
functionalized nanotubes pin-pointing the location of functionality.
There are many reports in the literature on nanotube-nanoparticle
interaction, including carboxylated, thiolated, aminated etc. nanotubes as
well as un-functionalized nanotubes (which still contain some groups
even without functionalization). This area has been well developed in the
past 15 years, and it has been shown by dozens of research groups that
gold nanoparticles can effectively bind to supposed positions of
functional groups, and to un-functionalized nanotubes alike due to
Columbic and dispersion interactions directly with the carbon lattice of
nanotube.
In this work, we are presenting a complementary strategy to find out the
final structure of Carbon Nanoparticles after chemical functionalization.
We are not reporting a new protocol to attached gold nanoparticle to
carbon lattices. To clarify this point we have introduced the next
paragraph in the manuscript abstract:
This methodology, in combination with other characterization analysis,
is expected to improve the design of hierarchical interfaces by the spatial
localization of the functionalities responsible for colloidal stabilization
in solvents with different polarities aside from their homogeneous
incorporation into different matrices.
On the technical level, the title is wholly inappropriate – there is no even
a hint of visualizing ‘reactivity’ in this work. The authors do not
demonstrate any images / movies of chemical reactions in nanotubes,
and the claim of visualizing positions of the functional groups is
questionable. There is no evidence that the functional groups are present
in the material, and the Raman spectra are inconclusive at best.
For the sake of clarity the tittle was modified to: Imaging Carbon
Nanostructures Reactivity: A Complementary Strategy to Define
Chemical Structure.
We have introduced XPS characterization analysis with its
corresponding graphs.
The chemical composition of the samples was analysed by X-Ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using an XPSVERSAPROBE PHI
5000 from Physical Electronics, equipped with a Monochromatic Al Ka
X-ray source under UHV conditions. The energy resolution was 0.7 eV.
For the compensation of built-up charge on the sample surface during
the measurements, a dual beam charge neutralization composed of an
electron gun (B1 eV) and an argon ion gun (r10 eV) was used. The XPS
spectra were deconvoluted into different chemical surroundings using
commercially available software (CASA-XPS).
Further, even if the groups are present there is no direct evidence that the
positions of the group corresponds to the positions of Au nanoparticles,
so the claim of visualizing reactivity is unjustified.
All the control experiments reported in this manuscript demonstrate that
Au NPs do not attached on pristine carbon nanostructures at the used
experimental conditions.

Comments to the Author(s)
The paper presents a microscopic method to determine the presence of
functionalities in different carbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes
and graphene. The authors propose a method which is based on mixing
the functinalized materials with gold nanoparticles and subsequently
observating them by TEM. According to the position of gold
nanoparticles respect to the carbon support, the position of the functional
group could be determine. Three different materials have been used:
single wall carbon nanotubes, multiwall carbon nanotubes and graphene
flakes. Each sample was analized as pristine, oxidised and after a Boc
modification. Despite the fact that the functionaliztion was characterise
by Raman spectroscopy, other techniques are necessary to support this
results. Karl-Fischer analysis should be shown and temogravimetric
analysis or FT-IR could help to quantify and furhter discuss the results. I
encourage the authors to provide a more interconneted discussion
between the data obtained with the different systems.
Additional XPS analysis for each sample was included. We have added
the next paragraphs to interconnect the results of the different systems:
In purified samples, shown in Fig.2b), the C 1s spectrum present a
main feature at 284.3 eV and a secondary corresponding to a p
plasmon excitation centered at 291 eV. The shoulder at the high-
energy side of the C 1s peak for ox-SWCNTs, shown in Fig.2c) is
generated by photoelectrons emitted from C atoms in oxygenated
groups: hydroxyl (component centered at 286.2 eV), carbonyl (287.2
eV), and carboxyl groups (288.9 eV). The chemical composition of p-
SWNCTs is C (99.3 %) and O (0.7 %). For f-SWCNTs, the Kaiser
test value of 125 <U+F06D>mol/g of free NH2 in combination with the XPS of
p-SWCNTs correspond to a chemical composition of C (99 %), O (0.7
%) and N (0.15 %), while ox-SWCNTs contains C (84 %) and O (16
%). As we have previously reported, 13 AuNP@ox-SWNCT shows a
reduction in the intensity of the C 1s satellite peaks due to
oxygenated-groups. This signal reduction demonstrates that AuNPs
selectively grown on the oxygen rich areas forming C-O-Au bonds.
The XPS analysis gives similar information as the one reported for
SWCNTs. Additionnal bands compared with the purified material
arised for ox-MWCNTs. These bands correspond to hydroxyl (286.2
eV), carbonyl (287.2 eV), and carboxyl groups (288.9 eV). The
composition of p-MWCNTs is C (99.4 %) and O (0.6 %). The Kaiser
test value of 297 <U+F06D>mol/g for f-MWCNTs combined with the XPS if p-
MWCNTs relate to a composition of C (99.05 %), O (0.6 %) and N
(0.35 %). After the oxidation treatment, the chemical composition of
ox-MWCNTs changes to C (90.8 %) and O (9.2%).
Although f-MWCNTs exhibit lower functionalization degree than ox-
MWCNTs, the first appear as well dispersed tubes (Fig.5c)
completely covered by AuNPs (Fig.5d) while the oxidized ones
remain as smaller bundles, confirming that oxidation occurs at the
residual amorphous carbon (Fig. 5f) mostly close to the defects. The
same trend was observed for SWCNTs.
The XPS characterization for FLG and GO are reported in Fig. 6. In
FLG (b), the main peak at 284.8 eV is assigned to the binding energy
photoelectrons emitted from sp 2 C atoms. A secondary peak appears
at 286.2 eV related to C-O and C-N bonds. The chemical composition
is C (96.7 %), O (2.5 %) and N (0.7 %). The presence of N in the
sample derives from the non-covalent adsorption of the solvent
(DMF) on FLG produced by the sonication process. 20 In GO, the
presence of oxidized groups increased considerable, tree components
corresponding to: 1) C-O and C-N are revealed at 286.2 eV, 2) C=O
bonds shown by the peak at 287 eV and 3) O-C=O species at 288.0
eV. As expected, the GO spectrum shows two main peaks due to the
high amount of oxygenated functionalities. In f-FLG, the chemical
composition obtained by the combination of the Kaiser test value and
XPS analysis of FLG is C (95.8 %), O (2.5 %) and N (0.8 %). The
percentance of N corresponded only to the covalently attached free
NH2 functionalities since the Kaiser test blank was FLG. The
chemical composition is C (69.3 %) and O (29.3 %).
The TEM images, in every case are shown in different scales and it
makes the comparison hard. Also, an EDS analysis could favor the
interpretation.
Some TEM images where changed to favour interpretation.
We have included the XPS analysis to corroborate the degree of
functionalization of the samples.
Some punctual points:
During the discussion of the origin of the graphene D band, it is not only
determined by edges, vacancies or topological deffects should be
mentioned.
This observation is out of the scope of the present work.
FIgure 5: all spectra should be presented with bigger amount of sampled
points in order to smooth the signal. Extra signals are observed in the
blue spectra, authors should explained what are they due to.
Figure was corrected.
In Figure 6, an extra discussion about the change in D' should be added.
This observation is out of the scope of the present work.
