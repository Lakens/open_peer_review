Positive points:
deals with a modern and high profile area,
makes a new contribution,
clearly presented,
Weak points:
1. this type of research approach will always give an answer---fit the model parameters and then
see what the model predicts, a stronger piece of work would test/validate the model,
2. the authors seem to be describing a complex, multi-scale system in terms of two parameters,
which seems hugely ambitious,
3. having read the main paper, I was left with no feeling for what data was used, to what extent
this data is a proxy for the actual quantities in the model, how the model was calibrated, how
much uncertainty there is in the simple point estimates produced, whether any other model
would perform similarly,
Further comments:
a) It also was not clear whether the code and data are available.
b) I was also disappointed by the use of words such as "Crucially", "Interestingly" and
"inevtiably". I would prefer to let the reader make these judgements.
c) I felt that the work was generally oversold. For example, in the final paragraph:
As shown in our study
would be more accurate and realistic as
Under the assumptions used in this study
d) At the start of subsection 3.2 the phrase "rigorous thermodynamic analogy" seems to be an
oxymoron.
e) Finally, the Authors' contributions sections suggests that only one of the authors performed the
research. I am happy to leave it to the editorial team to decide the implications of this in terms of
authorship.

This manuscript presents an urban spatial interaction model, based on the typical approach of
modelling flows of people/income between different areas, taking as constraints rent and
transport costs. The authors recover well-established ideas about how it is not possible to explain
the polycentric structure of many urban agglomerations using only one process. To this end, they
developed a statistical-mechanical model with two components: a Boltzmann one that takes care
of the static flow of income in the system and a Lotka-Volterra component for the redistribution
of the services over time. This mixed model is calibrated using Greater Sydney Census data.
Finally, the concept of thermodynamic efficiency is introduced in the context of urban dynamics
via a Fisher information approach. The model produces the observed abrupt change (phase
transition) from sprawl structures to polycentric ones.
This is a well-written paper with soundable conclusions for the available data and variables taken
into consideration. The supplied video is a useful addition. Their result about how changes in the
social disposition component will cause a more abrupt disruption in the dynamics of the model
than the ones introduced by the impedance to travel are quite exciting and make me wonder if
this is particular to the Greater Sydney area, as in London, for example, you certainly would find
the opposite, where the rent factor (strongly correlated with transport) is the crucial element for
the vast majority of the Londoners.
Mainly, the thermodynamic analogy is quite robust. In this type of social physics studies, is
unusual to see an actual trace of the changes in the energy and entropy for example. Section 3.2
and Supplemental Materials 3 and 4 are particularly useful and will be in hand for developing
future thermodynamic urban models.
However, the treatment of the Census variables is not as robust as the thermodynamical one. I'd
suggest the following revisions to wrap up this paper:
1. Is it Eq. 4 correct? Why the total cost of commuting between i and j is equal to the Cost times
the predicted income flow. I feel that the yij shouldn't be there.
2. Could authors provide the explicit expression for f(Pj) (page 3)? Although it is true that a
population could decay once it reaches higher densities, for large urban areas where population
remains stable after reaching a condensation point, a logistic function is more suitable.
(https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069469)
3. My primary concern is with the Cost C. At 2.1 authors mentioned that "Cij represents the
structure of the transport network, which may include the roads as well as different types of
public transport", but in the supplemental section 1, they said that Cij was estimated as the
Euclidean distance between centres of the employment/residence areas. So, no transport
network or transport modes were involved in the calculation of Cij. They assume that people
"somehow" get from i to j, which is a huge issue that could potentially derail their results. There
are a several, more robust alternatives to the Euclidean distance and not all of them require
4
"access to high-resolution data". For example, the road network distance should not present a
challenge due to the large available data from Google maps for example. The calculation of Cij
must consider the transport mode. Areas with similar Euclidean distance could be indeed
entirely different depending on the existing public transport infrastructure. In short, a weighted
version for Cij is required that takes as input, the road distance and the principal transport mode
between i and j.

original article was reviewed by two referees, who expressed enthusiasm for the proposed analysis, yet pointed
ome issues that need to be addressed before publication. In an interdisciplinary field such as urban science, the
t of view of experts is highly valuable and we appreciate both referees’ judgement. The points raised by the
rees have been addressed in the revised manuscript. Please find below our detailed response to their comments

. This type of research approach will always give an answer—fit the model parameters and then see what the
model predicts, a stronger piece of work would test/validate the model.
We agree that this type of models is driven by data. However, a simple MaxEnt model without the Lotka-
Volterra component does not produce dynamics with phase transitions, so we believe that there is some value
in BLV modelling, calibrated to real-world data. Our focus was on demonstrating the critical regime in the
first place, complemented by the thermodynamic analysis, and validation of the results (including determining
likelihood of the data given the model) remains a subject of our future/current research.
. The authors seem to be describing a complex, multi-scale system in terms of two parameters, which seems
hugely ambitious.
We acknowledge that complex, multi-scale systems such as urban networks may include a huge amount of
variables. However, one of the main ideas in Statistical physics is that only a small subset of these variables are
necessary to understand the macroscopic behaviour of a systems from its microscopic description. This idea is
at the core of the universality observed in many different systems, and its application to cities is well explained
in [1]. Phase transitions, for example, are observed in many different systems ranging from magnetic materials
to neural networks and even social dynamics. In all these seemingly different systems, the drastic macroscopic
changes are driven by one or few parameters. In the revised manuscript we highlight this view in a sentence at
the end of the first paragraph of page 2.
. Having read the main paper, I was left with no feeling for what data was used, to what extent this data is a
proxy for the actual quantities in the model, how the model was calibrated, how much uncertainty there is in
the simple point estimates produced, whether any other model would perform similarly.
The description of the data is provided in Supplementary Material Section 1, followed by the description of
the calibration process. Specifically, the last three paragraphs of Section 1 describe all the variables obtained
from the Census. Therefore, the constraints used in Eqs. 2 and 3 of the main manuscript are produced from
the Census data, given the definition of attractiveness A in terms of the population P and the services S. The
constraint used in Eq. 4 is produced by the geospatial data. We added this clarification in the last paragraph of
Supplementary Material Section 1.
The calibration included the estimation of Lagrangian multipliers. A comparison across different models,
using maximum likelihood, is ongoing but is out of the scope of this manuscript.

it Eq. 4 correct? Why the total cost of commuting between i and j is equal to the Cost times the predicted
come flow. I feel that the Yi j shouldn’t be there.
es, Eq. 4 is correct and has been used in the original commodity flow model proposed by Wilson [2] as well
in many models derived from it. Commodities (units of income Y , in our case) flow from i to j at a certain
ost per unit Ci j . Therefore, the total cost of moving Yi j units of income from i to j is the product of Yi j and
i j . The constraint described by Eq. 4 sets the total expenditure in the system on transporting the income Y .
ould authors provide the explicit expression for f (Pj ) (page 3)? Although it is true that a population could
ecay once it reaches higher densities, for large urban areas where population remains stable after reaching
condensation point, a logistic function is more suitable. (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069469).
e have added the explicit expression for f (Pj ). Please notice that in our case it is not the population of a
gion that decays once it reaches a high density, but rather the part of the attractiveness of the region that is
ased on its population. Let us suppose that high densities are reached and the population Pj keeps increasing
ecause other factors, i.e., abundance of services and/or short distance from employment areas. f (Pj ) will
en decrease, eventually making the attractiveness of the area decrease as well, in spite of the other factors.
herefore, at a certain point the population will stabilise.
. .Ci j was estimated as the Euclidean distance between centres of the employment/residence areas. So, no
ansport network or transport modes were involved in the calculation of Ci j . . . . There are a several, more
bust alternatives to the Euclidean distance and not all of them require “access to high-resolution data”.
or example, the road network distance should not present a challenge due to the large available data from
oogle maps for example. The calculation of Ci j must consider the transport mode. . . . a weighted version for
i j is required that takes as input, the road distance and the principal transport mode between i and j.
e acknowledge the concerns of the referee about the representation of the transport costs in terms of the
uclidean distance and agree that both road networks and a variety of the transport modes need to be taken
to account. However, to suitably reflect this rich data for Greater Sydney, we need to assemble dataset which
cludes Sydney’s transport networks (bus, rail and ferry), in addition to the road networks. While the latter
ata are publicly available (e.g., OpenStreetMaps), the former is not. Furthermore, the network connectivity
eeds to be augmented with monetary costs associated with the corresponding travels, as well as individual
eferences reflected in travel pattern data (such as Opal cards). We believe that considering only one aspect,
g., the publicly available road networks, may be more biased than a simpler solution based on Euclidean
stances. Nevertheless, a follow-up research project will focus on modelling precisely this issue. We added
is clarification in the last paragraph of page 1 of Supplemental material.
