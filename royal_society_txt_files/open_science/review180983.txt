Kudos to the authors for a thorough revision which addressed all of my concerns. The splitting
up of the plots into several less confusingly overlapping versions, the addition of a phylogenetic
tree with relevant characters mapped on, the explicit discussion of the condition in pterosaurs
and squamates, the tuned-up discussion of pneumaticity, and the additional citations of the
literature are all meaningful improvements. Only a handful of things remain to be fixed.
Most seriously, the numbered reference citations in the text (which stop at 75) are out of sequence
with the bibliography (which runs to 81). For example, the last paragraph of the discussion is
about the potential advantages of a parabronchial lung in the low-O2 conditions of the Mesozoic,
but the numbered refs include the Nomina Anatomica Avium (nonsensically) and not the
relevant works by Ward, Berner, etc. that are listed at the end of the bibliography.
In the same paragraph, the following sentence is so convoluted and contains so many negatives
that I _think_ it ends up saying the opposite of what the authors intend: "We found no evidence
to contradict conclusions in recent studies asserting that the dinosaurian respiratory system could
not support the high, or at least intermediate, levels of metabolism." Maybe best to separate it into
two sentences, one stating what those studies concluded, and a second relating those previous
conclusions to the results of the current study.
Finally, a careful line-by-line reading is needed to clean up a last few stray errors, like "apart from
the a few vertebrae in Camarasaurus" in the last two lines of page 10 of the PDF.

Determining the respiratory function of non-avian dinosaurs, and tracing the evolution of the
distinctive avian respiratory system, has been the target of much research. The authors provide
an interesting addition to this debate through their testing of a suggested proxy of archosaur lung
structure, namely the relative positioning of the costothoracic joint along the dorsal vertebral
column. They find convincing evidence that non-avian dinosaurs shared features of their dorsal
vertebrae in common with birds, differing from the condition in extant crocodilians, and they
suggest that in many respects all dinosaurs had acquired features of the avian-type lung. As a
result, I think that this contribution will be of wide interest and is clearly suitably for publication
in RS Open Science.
In general, the analyses are appropriate and have been conducted competently. Further
discussion of taxon sampling and phylogeny would be useful, however, as there a few obvious
gaps in the data (particularly among basal members of the major dinosaur lineages and in the
immediate avian stem-lineage), though these gaps do not necessarily detract from the overall
pattern recovered (though they could have added more nuance). It would also be interesting to
apply the same technique to a variety of pseudosuchian archosaurs, pterosaurs and non-
archosaurian archosauromorphs to establish whether this represents a true croc-line/bird-line
split or whether some of these features might be more widespread among extinct archosaur-like
animals (after all, living crocs are very derived in comparison with other extinct pseudosuchians
in numerous ways). For example, the poposauroid Effigia has dorsal vertebrae that are, at least
superficially, very dinosaur-like (see Nesbitt 2006) and it could be that this kind of analysis might
find that bird-like lungs are more widespread among archosaurs and have been lost in the
ancestors of extant crocodilians. However, the latter would require significant extra work and
should probably be regarded as a separate project, though it might be interesting to mention in
their Discussion. Other more detailed comments follow below.
p. 4, para 3. Although information on the taxa included in the Supplement it would be useful to at
least state the number of taxa in each extinct clade included in the study in the main Methods
section (numbers are quoted for extant taxa): this would give an immediate impression of the
taxonomic coverage of the study, rather than requiring the reader to dig for it.
p. 4, para 3. Could you say something about the reasons behind your taxon selection? The list
looks its chosen primarily for convenience (which is fine, it’s not possible to see everything), but
this should be justified somehow in terms of either phylogenetic sampling or simple logistics. For
a study that’s interested in the non-avian dinosaur/bird transition there is almost no sampling of
taxa close to the origin of birds (only one maniraptoran and only four theropods in total). I’m
aware that finding good specimens for this kind of work is difficult, but there might have been
others (such as Coelophysis, some ornithomimosaurs, etc.) that could be have been informative
and it seems odd not to have tried to get as many theropods as possible to really try and pin
down the transition. Also, you’ve only included derived members of each clade, whereas it
would have been good to have some basal forms also (there are a lot of ‘prosauropod’ columns
out there and they might have extended sauropodomorph morphospace quite a bit). Dorsal
columns are easier to find in the dinosaur record than ribs. Alternatively, the Discussion could
acknowledge that the results could be tested by including more of these taxa.
p. 4, para 4. Given that many recent studies on form and function are now moving to 3D
geometric morphometrics and are often using semi-landmarks to describe overall shape it would
be good to justify the use of 2D geometric morphometrics here.
p. 5, para 3. Although non-avian dinosaurs show the same dorsal migration of the parapophysis
along the dorsal column as seen in crocs, they still retain bicapitate ribs along the entire length of
4
the vertebral column (although the tuberculum is reduced), so this is potentially different from
the situation in crocs if the posterior ribs are single-headed in these taxa. As a result, the thoracic
roof in non-avian dinosaurs might have been more furrowed than parapophysis position alone
suggests.
p. 5, para 3. What you’re essentially doing is quantifying variation in the prominence of the
tuberculum along the dorsal series using parapophysis position as a proxy for ‘furrowedness’.
You could make a simple statement along these lines somewhere in the Methods to make this
explicit.
p. 5, para 4. You should cite the sources of the trees you use to reconstruct your informal
supertree. Also, recent work on dinosaur phylogeny has questioned the “traditional”
saurischian/ornithischian split, with multiple groups finding support for other arrangements
(e.g. Ornithoscelia hypothesis has been shown several times to be as good an explanation of early
splits in the tree as the traditional hypothesis: Baron et al. 2017; Langer et al. 2017; Parry et al.
2017; Muller 2018). As a result, it would be good to think about what this rearrangement might
imply for your study also.
p. 8, para 1. It’s not just the ventral position of the parapophysis that creates the furrowed
thoracic roof in birds, it’s also (perhaps primarily) the retention of a ventrally extensive
tuberculum, which is associated with the ventrally positioned parapophysis. Some discussion of
dorsal rib morphology is essential here to back up the results from your analysis with description
of the anatomy present.
p. 8, para 2. You’ve not discussed the “morphology of the costovertebral joint”, but its relative
position. Joint morphology would involve more discussion of the shape of the actual joint
surfaces on both the vertebrae and the ribs and potentially of the soft tissues also. Similarly,
you’re discussing a proxy for lung structure, not lung structure itself (which you can’t observe
directly). A little more precision in the language used would make it clearer what you did and
what the limits of your study are, whereas using broader statements like these implies that
you’ve extended this study way beyond what was actually carried out.
p. 9, para 2. The situation in pterosaurs is anatomically similar to that in non-avian dinosaurs. The
parapophysis in both groups migrates dorsally to lie on the transverse process. As this is
qualitatively the same in both groups pterosaurs cannot be regarded as more “crocodile-like”
than “dinosaur-like”.
p. 10, para 1. This isn’t true, there are some ornithischians where the parapophysis is on the same
level as the diapophysis and is fully migrated onto the transverse process (indeed they sometimes
fuse into a single facet) – this reflects the lack of a wider range of ornithischians in your sample.
This occurs in a variety of small-bodied taxa, including Dryosaurus (Galton 1981),
Heterodontosaurus (Santa Luca 1980), Hypsilophodon (Galton 1974) and Jeholosaurus (Han et al.
2012). Also, all ornithischians retain distinct bicapitate dorsal ribs along their dorsal series, so
they would also have had a furrowed morphology (to some extent regardless of where the
parapophysis was). This indicates that you need to not only think about this one landmark, but
combine it with info on the rib morphology itself in all taxa.
p. 10, para 3. In ‘prosauropods’ all of the dorsal ribs remain bicapitate, though there is a reduction
in tuberculum length along the series. In these taxa the parapophysis is on the neural arch in
middle and posterior dorsals, though it does not usually merge with the diapophysis, though it
can be positioned just anteroventral to it on the posterior-most dorsals.
p. 11, para 2. Herrerasaurus is spelt incorrectly and the informal group name ‘abelisauroid’ can
5
start with a lowercase ‘a’. Also, it’s possible that Herrerasaurus isn’t a true theropod, but a
member of a small clade of early dinosaurs (Herrerasauria), which might lie outside Dinosauria
or be more closely allied to sauropodomorphs.
p. 14, para 1. Although you provide good evidence for the origin of somewhat bird-like lungs in
earlier dinosauriforms, stretching this observation to account for the replacement of synapsids by
dinosaurs is taking this way too far. The idea of competitive replacement in the end Triassic
extinctions long dead in the literature (this harks back to debates in the 1980s, rather than
reflecting the current state of the field). How would you test this? How would you weigh up
other biological and environmental factors to make this a prime contender for the replacement?
Best to leave this out.

1. Summary
The lung-air sac system of modern birds is unique among vertebrates. However, debate surrounds
whether an avian-style lung is restricted to birds or first appeared in their dinosaurian ancestors, as
common osteological correlates for the respiratory system offer limited information on the lungs
themselves. Here, we shed light on these issues by using axial morphology as a direct osteological
correlate of lung structure, and quantifying vertebral shape using geometric morphometrics in birds,
crocodilians and a wide range of dinosaurian taxa. Although fully avian lungs were a rather late
innovation, we quantitatively show that non-avian dinosaurs and basal dinosauriforms possessed bird-like
costovertebral joints and a furrowed thoracic ceiling. This would have immobilised the lung’s dorsal
surface, a structural prerequisite for a thinned blood-gas barrier and increased gas exchange potential. This
could have permitted high levels of aerobic and metabolic activity in dinosaurs, even in the hypoxic
conditions of the Mesozoic, contributing to their successful radiation.
2. Introduction
The respiratory system of non-avian dinosaurs has been the topic of considerable study over the
years, both in an attempt to shed light on the biology of now extinct members of the Dinosauria,

and in order to understand the origins and evolution of the highly derived lung-air sac system of
modern birds [1–7]. Unfortunately, reconstructions of the dinosaur respiratory system based on
phylogenetic bracketing are problematic, due to the disparity in lung morphology, physiology, and
ventilatory mechanics of their closest living relatives, birds and crocodilians [8–18]. Therefore,
additional information from osteological correlates is needed.
Postcranial skeletal pneumaticity (PSP: invasion of the bone by respiratory diverticula), is
an osteological correlate commonly used to reconstruct the presence of air sacs [3,6,19–25], but
this only provides indirect information about the structure of the lungs themselves. As the lungs
are the primary site of gas exchange in terrestrial vertebrates [26,27], reconstructing their anatomy
and structure is essential for estimating key physiological parameters in fossil organisms [2,28].
The anatomy of the vertebrae, ribs, and costovertebral joints has been proposed as an osteological
correlate of lung structure [4,5]. In extant sauropsids, the dorsal surface of the lungs is directly
adjacent to- and often attaches to- the vertebral bodies and rib heads. The dorsal region of the lung
often has a denser concentration of gas exchanging parenchyma, and a strong attachment to the
body wall helps to prevent collapse [29–31]. Although overall axial morphology is also correlated
with posture and locomotion [32,33], the anatomy of the costovertebral joint specifically relates
directly to the gross morphology of the dorsal surface lung, and can be used as an osteological
correlate to reconstruct lung structure in fossil taxa [4,5].
Both birds and crocodilians share bicapitate ribs, with two articulations to the vertebral
column at the costovertebral joint - the rib capitulum with the vertebral parapophysis and the rib
tuberculum with the vertebral diapophysis [34,35]. Differences in the anatomy of the joint
between birds and crocodilians are associated with differences in the structure and mechanics of
the lungs. In crocodilians, the anterior-most thoracic vertebrae have the parapophyses located on
the vertebral centra, and the diapophyses are positioned on the distal ends of the transverse
processes. From the third thoracic vertebra, the parapophysis begins to migrate onto the transverse
process towards the diapophysis, and eventually the two articulations fuse and disappear [15].
This shift in the position of the parapophysis results in a reduction of the tuberculum, and
combined with the broad and thin transverse processes, provides a smooth thoracic ceiling (Fig. 1)
[4,5], which may facilitate antero-posterior motion of the viscera and mobile, compliant lungs
during ventilation via the hepatic piston mechanism [5,15,36].
In birds, the parapophysis is located on the centrum for the entire dorsal series, and so the
ribs are all strongly forked with a distinct capitulum and tuberculum. This creates a furrowed
thoracic ceiling, where the dorsal surface of the lungs are deeply incised by the rib capitulae (Fig.
R. Soc. open sci.

1); 20-33% of the lung tissue may lie between the rib heads [8,37]. Further, this immobilises the
lung’s dorsal surface providing structural support for the lung as a whole, which experiences very
little change in volume during breathing [38] and is practically rigid overall [8,13]. This
immobility is considered a prerequisite for the extreme subdivision of the parabronchi and
thinning of the blood-gas barrier [13,39,40].
Rib and vertebral morphology has been thoroughly described in dinosauriforms [4,5], but
these descriptions are purely qualitative in nature. This lack of quantitative data means that
currently it is difficult to rigorously test hypotheses on the respiratory morphology of fossil
archosaurs based on differences in the axial skeleton, particularly those that are subtle, or
divergent from the avian or crocodilian anatomy. Additionally, a quantitative approach should
yield finer detail in the differences between specific fossil groups, allowing for a clearer analysis
of the progression of the evolution of the respiratory system along the avian stem. Based upon the
anatomy observed in extant taxa, extinct individuals with a more bird-like “furrowed” thoracic
ceiling can be parsimoniously reconstructed as having a stronger attachment between the lungs
and the axial skeleton, which would be indicative of a more heterogeneous distribution of gas
exchanging parenchyma, with a densely partitioned dorsal region, and a more sac-like ventral
region [5,29,31].
In order to address these issues, we conducted a geometric morphometric analysis of dorsal
vertebral morphology (Fig. 2) in a range of archosaur taxa, including extant birds and
crocodilians, as well as fossil dinosauriforms. This allows us to test the hypothesis that basal
dinosauriforms had vertebral (and hence, lung) morphologies intermediate between birds and
crocodilians as proposed by Schachner et al (2009, 2011). We also hypothesise that there is a
phylogenetic progression towards a more “bird-like” condition, in terms of the structure and
mechanics of the respiratory system (as evidenced by the morphology of the axial skeleton)
beginning with basal dinosauriforms to crown group Aves. Ultimately this information should
enable us to further refine our understanding of the morphology of the extinct dinosauriform lung,
and the progression towards the fully avian-like respiratory system, with an immobilized gas
exchanging lung, and completely decoupled flexible ventilator air sacs.
3. Materials and Methods
Descriptions of the skeletal and pulmonary anatomy of birds and crocodilians are widely available
in the literature [4,7,8,10,35,41–43]. For the lung models in Fig. 1, CT data were obtained from
R. Soc. open sci.
one hatchling Alligator mississippiensis and one Psittacus erithacus. The hatchling Alligator
specimen was harvested from the Rockerfeller Wildlife Sanctuary for purposes unrelated to this
study. Both the hachling Alligator and Psittacus specimens had the trachea cannulated, inflated
with a syringe and sealed. The thorax was scanned with the lungs inflated, using a Scanco µCT 40
at the Louisiana State University School of Veterinary Medicine (0.036-0.097 mm; 55 kVp 145
uA). The three-dimensional (3D) digital models were segmented with a Wacom Intuos Pro pen
tablet in the scientific visualization program Avizo, Versions 7.1
(https://www.fei.com/software/amira-avizo/).
For the morphometric analyses, the complete dorsal vertebral series of selected crocodilian
and bird taxa was digitised either via surface scanning, or computed tomography (CT) scanning.
CT data was obtained for one sub-adult Alligator mississippiensis, which was scanned previously
as part of an unrelated study, and one Caiman crocodilus. The Caiman specimen was intubated
with plastic tubing, the lungs were artificially inflated via a 60 cc syringe and sealed with a
stopcock prior to scanning. Scanning took place at the University of Utah Medical Center in South
Jordan using a 164 slice dual energy Siemens SOMATOM Definition CT unit (slice thickness:
0.6-1 mm; 120 kVp 120, 200 ma). 3D digital models of the vertebrae were segmented in Avizo
8.0. All other specimens were surface scanned using a HP David SL3 Structured light scanner.
Individual scans were aligned and merged in David Software Version 5.0, to produce 3D models
of each vertebra. The extant dataset consists of the complete (or near-complete) dorsal series of 4
crocodilian taxa and 29 non-passerine birds, with a range of locomotor modes and body-forms.
For a complete list of extant taxa used, see the Supplementary Methods.
For the fossil taxa, measurements were based on images and figures taken from the literature,
as well as some observations of original material in museum collections. Vertebral series were
sampled from Theropoda (4 taxa), Sauropoda (3 taxa) and the three main clades of Ornithischia
(Thyreophora, Marginocephalia, and Ornithopoda) (8 taxa)[5], as well as one non-dinosaurian
dinosauriform, Silesaurus opolensis [44,45]. Taxa were chosen based on whether or not individual
vertebrae could be seen in the required anterior view required for landmarking, and with ideally
complete dorsal vertebral series. For a full list of the fossil taxa used in this study, as well as the
appropriate references, see Supplementary Methods.
Morphological variation of the dorsal vertebrae was quantified based on two-dimensional
landmarks placed on vertebrae in anterior view (Fig. 2). Although 3D analyses are increasingly
common, 2D analyses may be more applicable to fossil data which are often crushed or flattened
[46], and overall shape variation between species captured by the landmarks is almost always
R. Soc. open sci.
R. Soc. open sci. article template
5
greater than the discrepancies introduced by using 2D morphometrics to represent 3D structures
[47]. As outlined above, the taxonomic sample covered a range of major clades of crocodilians,
birds and non-avian dinosaurs, as well as various different body forms and locomotor styles
within birds. In anterior view, the centrum, neural arch, parapophysis, and diapophysis are all
visible and identifiable using landmarks, which are homologous across archosaurs. As the
vertebrae in this sample are approximately bilaterally symmetric, only the left side of each
vertebra was digitised. If the left side was damaged or missing, specimens were mirrored as
appropriate.
The landmark scheme used here is based on Head and Polly [46], with some modifications
based on Bömer et al [48]; the 11 landmarks capture the height and width of the centrum, the
height of the neural arch and neural spine, size and position of the prezygapophyses and the
placement of the diapophysis and parapophysis (Fig. 2); the position of the parapophysis and
diapophysis serving as our proxy for the “furrowedness” of the thoracic ceiling. Detailed
descriptions of each landmark are provided in Supplementary Methods.
Landmarks were collected using tpsDIG 32 [49], and imported into R [50], where they were
analysed using geomorph [51]. Landmark data were superimposed using a Procrustes alignment
to remove the effects of size, translation and orientation. Significance of differences between
mean shapes for each major taxonomic grouping was assessed via a Procrustes ANOVA. A
principal components analysis was carried out for initial data visualisation, and shape graphs
showing the positive and negative extremes of the PC axes were also generated in geomorph [51].
Landmark data, in the form of .txt files, are available in the supplementary information.
As well as the PCA, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was carried out in R using the
MASS package [52]. This uses additional a priori information, increasing the chances of finding
differences between groups. The extant dataset was split into three groups based on the
descriptions of Schachner et al., [4,5] (a) birds, which all have a furrowed thoracic ceiling, forked
ribs and the parapophysis on the vertebral centrum, (b) anterior crocodilian vertebrae which create
a furrowed thoracic ceiling, have forked ribs, and where the parapophysis lies on the vertebral
centrum, and (c) more posterior crocodilian vertebrae which create a smooth thoracic ceiling, with
unforked ribs and where the parapophysis has migrated onto the transverse process. This LDA
function was then used to classify fossil taxa into one of these three categories. When predicting
the classifications of fossils, posterior probabilities for each assignment were generated using
“leave-one-out” cross validation in order to test the statistical robustness of each classification.
R. Soc. open sci.
The linear discriminant scores for both extant and extinct taxa were used to make morphospace
plots similar to those generated by the PCA.
The linear discriminant scores from LD1, which separated vertebrae based on a smooth versus
furrowed thoracic ceiling, were then used as a quantitative measure of the strength of rib forking
(which in turn served as a proxy for dorsal lung immobility, and gross lung surface structure).
LD1 scores were plotted against vertebral position to visualise changes in costovertebral joint
anatomy along the vertebral column. Finally, an informal super-tree was assembled [53–55], and
within-column variation in LD1 scores was compared across different phylogenetic groups in
order to visualize when a furrowed thoracic ceiling appeared in the evolution of archosaurs.
4. Results
Measuring vertebral morphology. A Procrustes ANOVA showed significant differences
between the mean vertebral shapes of all major taxonomic groups (nAves=164, nCrocodylia= 57,
nSilesaurus= 16, nOrnithischia= 69, nSauropoda= 30, nTheropoda= 30; F = 64.497; p<0.05 in all cases)
(Supplementary Table 1). When examining effect sizes, fossil taxa were generally more similar to
birds than to crocodilians, although ornithischians were equally distant from both (Supplementary
Table 1). A vertebral morphospace plot, derived from a Principal Components Analysis (PCA),
including the whole dataset, is presented in Fig. 3. The first PC axis accounts for 38.73% of the
variation in the sample and roughly separates dinosaurs - particularly ornithischians - from extant
archosaurs. High values of PC1 are associated with a relatively narrow centrum, proximally
positioned parapophysis, and short transverse process sharply angled to the horizontal.
Conversely, lower values of PC1 show wide centra, distally placed parapophyses, and long, flat
transverse processes. PC2, on other hand, accounts for 27.5% of the variation in the sample and
seems to distinguish vertebrae which create a furrowed thoracic ceiling - birds, some dinosaurs
and the anterior-most vertebrae in crocodilians - from those which create a smooth thoracic
ceiling – crocodilian mid- and posterior-thoracic and lumbar vertebrae (Fig. 3). High values of
PC2 are associated with a parapophysis located on the centrum and short transverse processes.
Conversely, lower values of PC2 have the parapophysis located on the transverse process, as well
as long transverse processes (Fig. 3).
Measuring costovertebral joint positioning. A second Procrustes ANOVA showed significant
differences between the mean shapes for each of the three categories used in the LDA
(nbird_furrowed=164, ncroc_furrowed= 10, ncroc_smooth= 47; bird_furrowed- croc_furrowed, p=0.018;
bird_furrowed - croc_smooth, p=0.002; croc_furrowed- croc_smooth, p=0.02). However, there

was much a smaller effect size between the two furrowed groups than between either of these and
the smooth group (bird_furrowed- croc_furrowed, Z=2.69164; bird_furrowed - croc_smooth,
Z=17.30133; croc_furrowed- croc_smooth, Z=10.41833).
The LDA was generally successful at assigning to correct categories to the extant dataset.
Bird vertebrae were correctly classified 100% of the time, and posterior crocodilian vertebrae,
which created a smooth thoracic ceiling, were correctly classified ~98% of the time. Anterior
crocodilian vertebrae, which created a furrowed thoracic ceiling, were classified correctly 70% of
the time. Almost all dinosauriform vertebrae were classified along with either birds or crocodilian
vertebrae with the parapophysis on the centrum, with high posterior probabilities. The full results
from the LDA are available in the supplementary information (Supplementary Table 2).
In the morphospace based on the linear discriminant scores from the LDA, LD1 explained
95% of the shape variation between groups (Fig. 4). This was effectively an axis of how far the
diapophysis and parapophysis were separated and how furrowed or smooth the thoracic ceiling
was, combining elements of PC’s 1 & 2 from the PCA (Fig. 3, 4). LD1 was dominated by the
position of the parapophysis relative to the diapophysis, as well as the length of the transverse
processes; low values of LD1 are associated with a parapophysis positioned on the centrum, and
short transverse processes. High scores for LD1 on the other hand are associated with a
parapophysis located on the transverse process, close to the diapophysis, and long transverse
processes (Fig. 4). LD2 accounted for the remaining 5% of the variation, and is associated with
the morphology of the prezygopophyses, neural arch and angle of the transverse processes to the
horizontal.
Intra-columnar variation in the thoracic ceiling. Variation in smoothness of the thoracic
ceiling along the vertebral column (represented by the LD1 score) is shown in Fig. 5. Birds retain
low values (i.e., furrowed thoracic ceiling) throughout the dorsal series. In crocodilians, LD1
values are low in the anterior-most vertebrae, but then there is a sharp increase in LD1 values and
the thoracic ceiling becomes substantially smoother at the 3rd/4th dorsal vertebra, corresponding to
20-25% along the dorsal series in these taxa. In most dinosauriform taxa, the thoracic ceiling is
furrowed anteriorly (low values along LD1), and although there is a general trend towards
increased LD1 scores posteriorly, none of the fossil taxa reach the same very high LD1 values
seen in crocodilians.
R. Soc. open sci.
Evolutionary variation in the thoracic ceiling. Phylogenetic variability in vertebral morphology
and costovertebral joint anatomy - again, represented by LD1 score - is shown in Fig. 6.
Crocodilians show the greatest range of morphological variation along the vertebral column, and
their mean vertebral shapes have the highest scores along the first LD axis. Individual avian taxa
show much less within-column variation (likely due in part to their lower dorsal vertebral counts),
although there is still considerable variation between different genera. All birds have low mean
LD1 scores. Many dinosauriform taxa fall within the range of variation seen in modern birds,
particularly theropods, and all dinosauriforms have mean values below those of crocodilians.
5. Discussion
This analysis builds on previous qualitative studies on the archosaurian respiratory system and
axial skeleton [4,5]. Our methods clearly separate extant birds and crocodilians as these two
groups plot out distinctly in the PCA and the Procrustes ANOVA found significantly different
group means. The LDA easily discriminated between vertebrae which produced a “furrowed” or
“smooth” thoracic ceiling. Two main aspects of vertebral morphology, the length of the transverse
processes and the relative positions of the diapophysis & parapophysis, have been previously
identified as major correlates of lung structure and ventilation mechanics in archosaurs
[4,5,15,16]. Both of these features strongly loaded the first two PC axes of the PCA (Fig. 3), as
well as the first (and major) axis of the LDA (Fig. 4). Birds have short transverse processes and
the parapophysis remains on the centrum, creating a furrowed thoracic ceiling in articulation with
the ribs, which have a distinct capitulum and tuberculum (associated with the ventral
parapophysis). In crocodilians, the anterior vertebrae are similar to birds – short transverse
processes and parapophysis on the centrum – and indeed, this resulted in some overlap between
birds and crocodilians in the PCA (Fig. 3). However, in the more posterior vertebrae, the
parapophysis migrates onto the transverse processes and the transverse processes themselves are
relatively long and flat (Fig. 3, 4); combined with the reduction in the rib tuberculum associated
with the parapophysis’ migration, this creates a smooth thoracic ceiling.
By precisely quantifying the relative position of the costovertebral joint as an osteological
correlate, we aimed to provide a more detailed, fine-scale comparison of the lung structure of
different dinosauriform groups. However, we found limited evidence to support a phylogenetic
progression towards an increasingly “furrowed” thoracic ceiling and a more bird-like lung
structure, as all dinosaurian taxa showed osteological correlates of dorsally immobile lungs.
Although the initial PCA and Procrustes ANOVA showed that fossil dinosauriforms occupied
different regions of vertebral morphospace from extant groups, they are all still characterised by a
R. Soc. open sci.

distinct separation of the parapophysis and diapophysis – the parapophysis being placed ventral
and substantially medial to the diapophysis, even if it has migrated away from the vertebral
centrum. In line with this, most dinosauiform taxa plotted more closely towards the “furrowed”
end of the first LD axis, and the LDA classed most dinosaurs as having vertebrae which would
create a “furrowed” thoracic ceiling, with high posterior probabilities.
Despite gross morphological differences, extant birds and crocodilians do share many
pulmonary characteristics, including major components of their bronchial tree, and patterns of
airflow within the lung [17,43,56]. Based on extant phylogenetic bracketing, we might assume
that fossil archosaurs had a heterogeneously partitioned lung, with a less mobile antero-dorsal
region containing more of the respiratory parenchyma, and a more compliant, saccular ventral
region, which likely served a primarily ventilatory role [17,7]. Extant phylogenetic bracketing
also suggests that the lungs were supported by a post-pulmonary septum (PPS), with the body
divided into a pleural and peritoneal cavity [57]. However, the results of our morphometric
analysis indicate that the common ancestor of Dinosauria possessed a lung which was
immobilised across the whole of the dorsal surface, implying more extreme partitioning and
regionalisation of gas-exchange and ventilator functions. This also suggests the presence and
increased role of an intracoelomic septum, which would support the saccular portion of the lung
during ventilation, and prevent collapse during exhalation [57].
Whether the more extreme partitioning of the respiratory system implied here in basal
dinosauriforms represents an ancestral condition for Ornithodira, or maybe even for Archosauria,
remains unclear. Pterosaurs, the ornithodiran outgroup to dinosauriforms, have been reconstructed
as having an avian-style respiratory system based on the presence of unambiguous PSP and
inferred air sacs [58,59]. Their costovertebral morphology has been described as “crocodilian-
like”, as the parapophysis migrates dorsally to lie on or at the base of the transverse process, and it
has been suggested that pterosaurs therefore had more compliant, more homogeneous lungs [60].
However, the parapophysis also migrates dorsally towards the transverse process in many
dinosaurian taxa, and our results showed greater similarity between dinosaurs and birds rather
than dinosaurs and crocodilians. Further quantitative studies focusing on pterosaurs are clearly
needed.
The sister taxon to Archosauria, the lepidosaurs, generally have compliant lungs, and are
considered to have a “smooth” thoracic ceiling [5]. However, lepidosaurs also lack transverse
processes, and the diapophysis and parapophysis are fused into a single joint, the synapophysis
R. Soc. open sci.
[5,34]. Additionally, the pulmonary anatomy and ventilator mechanics are extremely diverse
across the various groups, with some having complex lungs that are dorsally attached to the body
wall (e.g., varanids) and others possessing more simplified mobile lungs (e.g., teiids) [30,57].
Therefore, further osteological correlates need to be identified to investigate pulmonary evolution
in lepidosaurs.
We now proceed to reconstruct the evolution of the respiratory system through the
evolution of dinosauriforms. Beginning at the base of the tree, the reconstructions of Silesaurus
[45] represent the most complete dorsal series known from a non-dinosaurian dinosauriform.
Generally, Silesaurus vertebrae had low LD1 scores, with the more anterior vertebrae falling
within the range of values seen in extant birds (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). Only in the posterior half of the
ribcage is there an increase in LD1 scores, but these are well below the values seen in the
posterior ribcage of crocodilians (Fig. 5). All vertebrae in Silesaurus were classed as creating a
“furrowed” thoracic ceiling by the LDA, with high posterior probabilities. The vertebral anatomy
of Silesaurus combined with the morphology of the ribs, which possess a clearly separated
tuberculum and capitulum [5,45], would have produced a furrowed thoracic ceiling. This in turn
indicates that Silesaurus had a heterogeneously partitioned lung, with an immobile dorsal region
that likely contained most of the gas exchange tissue and vasculature.
Previous descriptive work on the vertebral anatomy of ornithischians noted that they, of all
the non-avian dinosaurs, most closely resembled crocodilians, particularly in the position of the
parapophosis [5]. This character is variable among Ornithischia, as some taxa have the
parapophysis on the neural arch, but in others it may be positioned at the base of the transverse
process or on the transverse process itself [5]. The ornithischian vertebrae included in our sample
had the parapophysis ventral to the diapophysis, and it never fully migrated to the distal end of
transverse processes. As a result, in our analysis, most ornithischians had relatively low LD1
scores, and were generally classed as having “forked” ribs by the LDA. Nevertheless, certain
ornithischian taxa were picked out by the LDA as showing crocodilian traits in their vertebral
morphology; both Stegosaurus and Triceratops had vertebrae classified as creating a “smooth”
thoracic ceiling. However, the LD1 scores were still much lower than those seen in crocodilians.
In a variety of small-bodied ornithischian taxa, the diapophysis and parapophysis sometimes fuse
into a single facet in the posterior-most dorsals [61–63]. However, even in taxa such as this,
ornithischians retain distinct bicapitate dorsal ribs along all (or at least most) of their dorsal series,
and so would also have had a furrowed thoracic ceiling. Ornithischians, therefore, generally show
evidence of a dorsally immobile lung, and even the specific exceptions discussed above still show
less dorsal mobility and a more furrowed thoracic ceiling than in extant crocodilians, especially
when considering the morphology of both the vertebrae and ribs.

Both non-dinosaurian dinosauriforms and ornithischian dinosaurs lack unambiguous
evidence of PSP and so it is difficult to make inferences about the non-gas exchanging regions of
the lung in these groups. However, Butler et al [25] do raise the possibility of non-invasive
respiratory diverticula, and possibly air sacs, being present in both Silesaurus and ornithischians,
as an ancestral feature of Ornithodira. The cervical and anterior dorsal vertebrae of Silesaurus, as
well as some ornithischians, possess strongly developed laminae and deep fossae [25,45] and
there are similarities in the distribution and development of these “ambiguous” pneumatic features
(i.e. features possibly associated with respiratory diverticula) and unambiguous features found in
other taxa [25]. The “common pattern” of pneumaticity in extant birds has PSP limited to the
cervical and anterior dorsal vertebrae [64], and this is also where the first unambiguous evidence
of PSP occurs in pterosaurs, sauropods and theropods [6,25]. This provides support for the
features in Silesaurus and ornithischians being potentially associated with respiratory diverticula,
although this still requires further testing e.g. using newly identified histological correlates for
bone and air-sac associations [65].
Descriptions of preserved sauropod ribcage elements show the separation of the
diapophysis and parapophysis, and the consistently forked ribs [5]. This is supported by the results
of this analysis, where the sauropod taxa examined had generally low scores on LD1, and fit
broadly within the range of values seen in extant birds (Fig. 5, 6); indeed, Apatosaurus and
Diplodocus fit entirely within this range. Additionally, all sauropod vertebrae were classified as
creating a “furrowed” thoracic ceiling in the LDA, apart from a few vertebrae in Camarasaurus.
Basal sauropodomorphs (“prosauropods”) have been previously described as having a distinct
parapophysis and diapophysis, as well as short transverse processes [5]; the parapophysis is on the
neural arch in middle and posterior dorsals, and though it does not usually merge with the
diapophysis, it can be positioned just anteroventral to it on the posterior-most dorsals. The first
four ribs were strongly forked, and while this was followed by a gradual reduction in the
tuberculum, all ribs remain bicapitate [5]. Therefore, the overall picture of respiratory evolution in
both basal sauropodomorphs and sauropods is that they all possessed a well separated diapophysis
and parapophysis, bicapitate ribs, a furrowed thoracic ceiling, and the dorsal surfaces of the lung
were immobilized by the adjacent ribs and vertebrae.
Theropods have been previously described as having the most “distinctly avian” axial
morphology [4,5]. The taxa included in this study included one taxon from most of the main
clades of Theropoda – Tetanurae, Coelurosauria, and Maniraptora. There was no observable trend
towards an increasingly avian vertebral structure moving crown-wards towards birds; however,
more specimens from a broader phylogenetic range of taxa are required to properly evaluate any
R. Soc. open sci.
specific trends in this group. Theropods have a very separate parapophysis and diapophysis for the
entire vertebral series [5], and showed low LD1 scores as a result (Fig. 4, 5). All theropods had
vertebrae classified as creating a “furrowed” thoracic ceiling in the LDA, and all taxa fell within
the range of LD1 values seen in extant birds (Fig. 5, 6). Although not included in this analysis,
descriptions of more basal theropods, e.g. the abelisauroid Majungatholus note separate
parapophysis and diapophysis, and ribs with a distinct capitulum and tuberculum [5,66]. These
results support the reconstruction of a dorsally immobilized lung in non-avian theropods.
In both sauropods and theropods, the presence and distribution of PSP has been widely
used to infer the presence of bird-like air sacs, and imply the presence of a bird-like lung
[3,24,67,68]. Respiratory diverticula originating from specific air sacs pneumatise specific regions
of the skeleton adjacent to the skeleton [20]. Whereas older accounts suggested that diverticula
from the cervical air sacs and lungs can extend from the all the way down to the pelvic region
[69], these findings could not be replicated [20]. Some juvenile birds exhibit a “pneumatic
hiatus”, or a gap in the pneumatisation of the vertebral column indicative of an anterior and
posterior centre of pneumatisation [70,71]. Although absent in the most basal members of each
clade [6,72], there are several examples of this, and similar “pneumatic diminutions” (a reduction
in the extent of pneumatisation), in the fossil record of both sauropodomorphs [24,68,72,73] and
theropods [3,23,74]. This indicates that the diverticula responsible for pneumatising the axial
skeleton originated from multiple sources, further suggesting the presence of air sacs.
However, in addition to their associations with respiratory diverticula, avian air sacs have
strict embryological and topological distinctions from the homologous “saccular regions” of the
crocodilian lung [17]. In birds the air sacs are projections of the lung, separated from it by the
horizontal and oblique septa, a relationship laid down early on in development when the air sac
primordia invade the PPS, splitting it into two distinct septa [75,76]; by contrast, in other
sauropsids, including crocodilians, lung development occurs along the pleural aspect of the PPS,
so that the saccular regions are not projections from the rest of the lung, and the whole lung has a
smooth outer contour [17]. Therefore, in order to say a fossil taxon truly possessed air sacs
requires additional evidence of a bipartite PPS. The patterns and distribution of pneumaticity
observed in fossils could also be explained by pulmonary diverticula emerging from the anterior
and posterior saccular regions of a heterogeneous, ventrally flexible lung not bounded by
horizontal and oblique septa. This would be a transitional stage towards the avian condition, but is
not a fully decoupled exchanger and ventilator (i.e. immobilised lung and flexible air sacs) as seen
in extant birds.

It is possible that some more derived theropods did have a fully decoupled lung and air
sacs, with the immobile lung supported ventrally by a bipartite post-pulmonary septum, as in
birds. This has been speculated based on the presence of well-developed hypapophyses in
maniraptoran theropods [57]. The hypapophyses act as attachment sites for the median fibres of
the horizontal and oblique septa [8], and so are a potential osteological correlate for the avian
bipartite PPS. The presence of this bipartite PPS would have provided additional structural
support for a rigid immobile lung, and physically separated the gas-exchanging regions from the
air sacs, completing the division of the respiratory system into a functionally discrete exchanger
and ventilator, as seen in extant birds [57]. This remains somewhat speculative however, as the
hypapohyses are also present in crocodilians, and in both birds and crocodilians serve as an
attachment for the longus colli muscles [77,78].
It should also be noted in discussions of PSP that respiratory diverticula themselves have
not been shown serve any respiratory function, beyond providing evidence of air sac-like
structures [79]. In extant birds, increased PSP beyond the cervicothoracic region is generally
associated with increasing body mass [64]. In theropod dinosaurs, increased PSP has also been
observed in in large-bodied taxa [6] further suggesting its main role was in mass reduction. The
prevalence of PSP in sauropods, which are almost all uniformly large [24,80], and pterosaurs
which need to reduce mass for flight [58,59], also suggests a role in mass reduction.
Therefore, we propose the following scenario for the evolution of the dinosauriform
respiratory system (Fig. 7). A dorsally immobile lung, strongly partitioned into gas exchanging
and ventilatory regions, which may have been associated with non-invasive diverticula, was
present in the immediate ancestors of dinosauriforms [25] (Fig. 7). In sauropods and theropods
respiratory diverticula became invasive, associated with the presence of unambiguous PSP. This
was presumably as a means of body mass reduction, as an adaptation to large body size [6,24]
(Fig. 7). The distribution of PSP suggests that these taxa possessed anteriorly and posteriorly
positioned flexible air sacs, or at least saccular regions of the lung. In more derived maniraptoran
theropods, the body size threshold at which increased PSP evolved was reduced, possibly as an
adaptation to high metabolic rates [6], and the presence of well-developed hypapophyses on the
dorsal vertebrae may indicate the presence of an avian, bipartite post-pulmonary septum, and a
fully decoupled immobilised lung and flexible air sacs [57] (Fig. 7).
Recently, major reorganisations have been proposed for the dinosaurian tree, with the
traditional Saurischia-Ornithischia split rejected in favour of the “Ornithoscelida” hypothesis,
R. Soc. open sci.
where theropods and ornithischians are sister taxa, to the exclusion of sauropodomorphs [81,82].
While this has major implications for the evolution of some dinosaurian characters, it is unlikely
to alter our conclusions on respiratory evolution a great deal. Our results support the presence of a
bird-like, highly partitioned lung in all dinosaurs - and even non-dinosaurian dinosauriforms -
before the three major clades of dinosaurs split from one another (Fig. 7). Also, although often
thought of as a shared saurischian character, the evolution of unambiguous PSP and a pneumatic
hiatus occurred independently in sauropods and theropods (Fig. 7).
The anatomy of the costovertebral joint in non-avian dinosaurs provides information not
only on the structure of the lungs, but also on how they were potentially ventilated. The
morphology of the vertebrae in crocodilians is suggested to correlate with hepatic piston breathing
[4]. Experimental fluoroscopy data clearly show the antero-posterior motion of the viscera and the
displacement of the lung’s posterior border [15,36]; the smooth thoracic ceiling is hypothesised to
facilitate this motion [4]. This is also associated with vertebrae with very high LD1 scores (Fig. 4,
5, 6). Birds, by contrast, have a furrowed thoracic ceiling which contributes to the immobility of
the volume-constant avian lung, which is ventilated by compliant “extra-pulmonary” air sacs via
costosternal pumping [5,7]. It has been previously suggested that some dinosaurs ventilated their
lungs using either a hepatic piston mode of breathing, or a similar “visceral pump” driven by
rotation of the pelvic bones [1,5]. However, there is no evidence that any of the fossil taxa
analysed in this study possessed the associated smooth thoracic ceiling to facilitate the anterior-
posterior translation of the viscera associated with the hepatic-piston mechanism. All extinct taxa
had low LD1 scores, and almost all of the species analysed had “forked” ribs associated with a
furrowed thoracic ceiling and a dorsally immobile lung, which suggests that dinosaur taxa
ventilated their respiratory system using costal aspiration [83,7] and perhaps a secondary
mechanism associated with the gastralia or pelvic girdle [84,85]. Although some dinosaurs had
their vertebral ribs fused to the vertebral column (e.g., Ankylosaurus) the major drivers of
ventilation in extant archosaurs seem to be the sternal ribs, which would have remained mobile,
and thus costal aspiration would still have been feasible [7,27].
Our findings have significant palaeobiological implications. The evolution of avian
endothermy, and whether or not non-avian dinosaurs possessed similar levels of metabolism, has
been a topic of considerable debate, and much of this has focused on whether the dinosaurian
respiratory system was capable of sustaining such levels of metabolism [1–3]. Our results show
dinosaurs had dorsally immobile, heterogeneously partitioned lungs, which could have supported
high concentrations of gas exchanging parenchyma [29] and potentially a thinned blood-gas
barrier[5,86]. Recent studies have asserted that dinosaurs had high, or at least intermediate, levels
R. Soc. open sci.
R. Soc. open sci. article template
15
of metabolism [87,88] and our results suggest that the dinosaurian respiratory system was capable
of sustaining metabolic rates such as these. The dorsally immobile parabronchial lung structure of
dinosaurs (and other archosaurs) would have been particularly advantageous in the Mesozoic,
which is considered to have been a period of relative hypoxia compared with both modern day
and with the preceding Permian [89,90], as the avian parabronchial lung is more efficient at
extracting O2 under hypoxic conditions compared with the mammalian bronchoalveolar lung [91].
Although models of active competitive replacement of synapsids by dinosaurs have long been
rejected [92], dinosaurs along with other archosaurs still likely had adaptations - the anatomy of
the respiratory system being one [86,89,90] - which gave them an advantage in the aftermath of
the end-Permian mass extinction [93].
6. Conclusion
In extant archosaurs, birds and crocodilians, the morphology of the dorsal vertebrae, and in
particular that of the costovertebral joint, is very different and this reflects differences in the
dorsal surfaces and structure of the adjacent lungs. Whereas crocodilians have a smooth thoracic
ceiling and compliant lungs, birds possess a furrowed thoracic ceiling resulting in complete
immobilization of the gas-exchanging regions of the lung. With this new analysis, we
quantitatively show that all non-avian dinosaurs possessed costovertebral joints more similar in
structure to birds than to crocodilians, and are reconstructed to have a dorsally immobilized,
heterogeneously partition lung. The evolution of the dorsally immobilised lung ventilated by
functionally decoupled air sacs, was a major evolutionary innovation along the avian stem. The
relative volume constancy of the gas-exchanging portion of the avian lung is a prerequisite for the
thinning of the blood-gas barrier, and extreme subdivision of the parabronchi. Similar pulmonary
modifications would have provided dinosaurs with more efficient means of oxygen uptake relative
to other vertebrates during the environmentally hypoxic conditions which pervaded much of the
Mesozoic, thus potentially contributing to their radiation and dominance over terrestrial
ecosystems.

Comments to the Author(s)
Kudos to the authors for a thorough revision which addressed all of my concerns.
The splitting up of the plots into several less confusingly overlapping versions, the
addition of a phylogenetic tree with relevant characters mapped on, the explicit
discussion of the condition in pterosaurs and squamates, the tuned-up discussion of
pneumaticity, and the additional citations of the literature are all meaningful
improvements. Only a handful of things remain to be fixed.
Most seriously, the numbered reference citations in the text (which stop at 75) are
out of sequence with the bibliography (which runs to 81). For example, the last
paragraph of the discussion is about the potential advantages of a parabronchial
lung in the low-O2 conditions of the Mesozoic, but the numbered refs include the
Nomina Anatomica Avium (nonsensically) and not the relevant works by Ward,
Berner, etc. that are listed at the end of the bibliography.
Response: There was an error in the referencing manager. This has now been fixed.
In the same paragraph, the following sentence is so convoluted and contains so
many negatives that I _think_ it ends up saying the opposite of what the authors
intend: "We found no evidence to contradict conclusions in recent studies asserting
that the dinosaurian respiratory system could not support the high, or at least
intermediate, levels of metabolism." Maybe best to separate it into two sentences,
one stating what those studies concluded, and a second relating those previous
conclusions to the results of the current study.
Response: This line has been split as suggested to improve clarity.
Finally, a careful line-by-line reading is needed to clean up a last few stray errors,
like "apart from the a few vertebrae in Camarasaurus" in the last two lines of page
10 of the PDF.
Response: The paper has been proof read and hopefully all errors have now been
caught.
Comments to the Author(s)
Determining the respiratory function of non-avian dinosaurs, and tracing the
evolution of the distinctive avian respiratory system, has been the target of much
research. The authors provide an interesting addition to this debate through their
testing of a suggested proxy of archosaur lung structure, namely the relative
positioning of the costothoracic joint along the dorsal vertebral column. They find
convincing evidence that non-avian dinosaurs shared features of their dorsal
vertebrae in common with birds, differing from the condition in extant crocodilians,
and they suggest that in many respects all dinosaurs had acquired features of the
avian-type lung. As a result, I think that this contribution will be of wide interest and
is clearly suitably for publication in RS Open Science.
In general, the analyses are appropriate and have been conducted competently.
Further discussion of taxon sampling and phylogeny would be useful, however, as
there a few obvious gaps in the data (particularly among basal members of the
major dinosaur lineages and in the immediate avian stem-lineage), though these
gaps do not necessarily detract from the overall pattern recovered (though they
could have added more nuance). It would also be interesting to apply the same
technique to a variety of pseudosuchian archosaurs, pterosaurs and non-
archosaurian archosauromorphs to establish whether this represents a true croc-
line/bird-line split or whether some of these features might be more widespread
among extinct archosaur-like animals (after all, living crocs are very derived in
comparison with other extinct pseudosuchians in numerous ways). For example, the
poposauroid Effigia has dorsal vertebrae that are, at least superficially, very
dinosaur-like (see Nesbitt 2006) and it could be that this kind of analysis might find
that bird-like lungs are more widespread among archosaurs and have been lost in
the ancestors of extant crocodilians. However, the latter would require significant
extra work and should probably be regarded as a separate project, though it might
be interesting to mention in their Discussion. Other more detailed comments follow
below.
p. 4, para 3. Although information on the taxa included in the Supplement it would
be useful to at least state the number of taxa in each extinct clade included in the
study in the main Methods section (numbers are quoted for extant taxa): this would
give an immediate impression of the taxonomic coverage of the study, rather than
requiring the reader to dig for it.
Response: The numbers of extinct taxa have been added as requested.
p. 4, para 3. Could you say something about the reasons behind your taxon
selection? The list looks its chosen primarily for convenience (which is fine, it’s not
possible to see everything), but this should be justified somehow in terms of either
phylogenetic sampling or simple logistics. For a study that’s interested in the non-
avian dinosaur/bird transition there is almost no sampling of taxa close to the origin
of birds (only one maniraptoran and only four theropods in total). I’m aware that
finding good specimens for this kind of work is difficult, but there might have been
others (such as Coelophysis, some ornithomimosaurs, etc.) that could be have been
informative and it seems odd not to have tried to get as many theropods as possible
to really try and pin down the transition. Also, you’ve only included derived
members of each clade, whereas it would have been good to have some basal forms
also (there are a lot of ‘prosauropod’ columns out there and they might have
extended sauropodomorph morphospace quite a bit). Dorsal columns are easier to
find in the dinosaur record than ribs. Alternatively, the Discussion could
acknowledge that the results could be tested by including more of these taxa.
Response: The reviewer makes some excellent points, and we agree that our
sampling is not ideal. Unfortunately, finding and digitising complete dinosaur dorsal
series turned out to be more challenging than we thought. It was especially difficult
to find specimens with complete vertebral series where individual vertebrae could
be disarticulated from the others and digitised & landmarked separately. We then
turned to the literature as a source of published photographs and illustrations, but
even then many specimens did not have their vertebrae figured in the required
anterior view. A statement justifying the sample based on these logistical issues has
been added to the Methods section.
p. 4, para 4. Given that many recent studies on form and function are now moving
to 3D geometric morphometrics and are often using semi-landmarks to describe
overall shape it would be good to justify the use of 2D geometric morphometrics
here.
Response: Although a 3D analysis would have been preferred, performing the
analyses in 2D was something of a necessity given that the main part of our fossil
taxa had to be taken from the literature. 3D approaches are becoming more
common, but 2D morphometrics are still very informative, and a section has been
added to the methods justifying their use here.
p. 5, para 3. Although non-avian dinosaurs show the same dorsal migration of the
parapophysis along the dorsal column as seen in crocs, they still retain bicapitate
ribs along the entire length of the vertebral column (although the tuberculum is
reduced), so this is potentially different from the situation in crocs if the posterior
ribs are single-headed in these taxa. As a result, the thoracic roof in non-avian
dinosaurs might have been more furrowed than parapophysis position alone
suggests.
Response: The relevant parts of the Discussion have been expanded, going into
some additional detail on how rib morphology affects our results.
p. 5, para 3. What you’re essentially doing is quantifying variation in the prominence
of the tuberculum along the dorsal series using parapophysis position as a proxy for
‘furrowedness’. You could make a simple statement along these lines somewhere in
the Methods to make this explicit.
Response: The suggested statement has been added to the methods.
p. 5, para 4. You should cite the sources of the trees you use to reconstruct your
informal supertree. Also, recent work on dinosaur phylogeny has questioned the
“traditional” saurischian/ornithischian split, with multiple groups finding support for
other arrangements (e.g. Ornithoscelia hypothesis has been shown several times to
be as good an explanation of early splits in the tree as the traditional hypothesis:
Baron et al. 2017; Langer et al. 2017; Parry et al. 2017; Muller 2018). As a result, it
would be good to think about what this rearrangement might imply for your study
also.
Response: The sources for the supertree have been added to the methods section;
the bird topology was based on Prum et al (2015), and the crocodilians on Man et al
(2011). The dinosaur tree was based on the “traditional” Saurischia-Ornithischia
framework (trees taken from Benton (2014), and based on references therein). The
Ornithoscelida hypothesis does represent a major shake-up of the dinosaur tree, but
given our results suggest that a heterogeneously partitioned, dorsally immobile,
bird-like lung was present in all dinosaurs (and in some more basal dinosauriforms),
we do not think this affects our conclusions too much. Still, this has been added as
an additional section to the Discussion.
p. 8, para 1. It’s not just the ventral position of the parapophysis that creates the
furrowed thoracic roof in birds, it’s also (perhaps primarily) the retention of a
ventrally extensive tuberculum, which is associated with the ventrally positioned
parapophysis. Some discussion of dorsal rib morphology is essential here to back up
the results from your analysis with description of the anatomy present.
Response: More detailed discussions of the rib morphology have been added, as
suggested.
p. 8, para 2. You’ve not discussed the “morphology of the costovertebral joint”, but
its relative position. Joint morphology would involve more discussion of the shape of
the actual joint surfaces on both the vertebrae and the ribs and potentially of the
soft tissues also. Similarly, you’re discussing a proxy for lung structure, not lung
structure itself (which you can’t observe directly). A little more precision in the
language used would make it clearer what you did and what the limits of your study
are, whereas using broader statements like these implies that you’ve extended this
study way beyond what was actually carried out.
Response: When referring to the costovertebral joint, the word “morphology” has
been changed where appropriate.
p. 9, para 2. The situation in pterosaurs is anatomically similar to that in non-avian
dinosaurs. The parapophysis in both groups migrates dorsally to lie on the
transverse process. As this is qualitatively the same in both groups pterosaurs
cannot be regarded as more “crocodile-like” than “dinosaur-like”.
Response: The “crocodilian-like” comparison was one made explicitly in the cited
reference (Geist et al 2014), the only paper to our knowledge to discuss the
costovertebral joint as it relates to lung structure in pterosaurs. However, we agree
with the comments the reviewer has made and have altered this section
accordingly.
p. 10, para 1. This isn’t true, there are some ornithischians where the parapophysis
is on the same level as the diapophysis and is fully migrated onto the transverse
process (indeed they sometimes fuse into a single facet) – this reflects the lack of a
wider range of ornithischians in your sample. This occurs in a variety of small-bodied
taxa, including Dryosaurus (Galton 1981), Heterodontosaurus (Santa Luca 1980),
Hypsilophodon (Galton 1974) and Jeholosaurus (Han et al. 2012). Also, all
ornithischians retain distinct bicapitate dorsal ribs along their dorsal series, so they
would also have had a furrowed morphology (to some extent regardless of where
the parapophysis was). This indicates that you need to not only think about this one
landmark, but combine it with info on the rib morphology itself in all taxa.
Response: We acknowledge that our sampling of Ornithischians was incomplete,
and this part of the Discussion section has been updated and revised with the
information supplied by the reviewer.
p. 10, para 3. In ‘prosauropods’ all of the dorsal ribs remain bicapitate, though there
is a reduction in tuberculum length along the series. In these taxa the parapophysis
is on the neural arch in middle and posterior dorsals, though it does not usually
merge with the diapophysis, though it can be positioned just anteroventral to it on
the posterior-most dorsals.
Response: This has been noted, and this part of the Discussion section has been
updated with the information supplied by the reviewer.
p. 11, para 2. Herrerasaurus is spelt incorrectly and the informal group name
‘abelisauroid’ can start with a lowercase ‘a’. Also, it’s possible that Herrerasaurus
isn’t a true theropod, but a member of a small clade of early dinosaurs
(Herrerasauria), which might lie outside Dinosauria or be more closely allied to
sauropodomorphs.
Response: Due to the uncertainties in its phylogenetic position, we have removed
the mention of Herrerasaurus from this section of the Discussion. The capitalisation
on ‘abelisauroid’ has also been changed.
p. 14, para 1. Although you provide good evidence for the origin of somewhat bird-
like lungs in earlier dinosauriforms, stretching this observation to account for the
replacement of synapsids by dinosaurs is taking this way too far. The idea of
competitive replacement in the end Triassic extinctions long dead in the literature
(this harks back to debates in the 1980s, rather than reflecting the current state of
the field). How would you test this? How would you weigh up other biological and
environmental factors to make this a prime contender for the replacement? Best to
leave this out.
Response: Although we agree with the reviewer that the idea of active competitive
replacement is indeed long dead, it is still plausible that dinosaurs possessed certain
adaptations (such as a bird-like lung) which provided them with advantages over
other taxa following the end-Permian mass extinction. We are keeping this section,
but it has been re-worded and additional references added to downplay suggestions
of active competitive replacement.
