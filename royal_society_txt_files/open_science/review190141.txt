In this manuscript, Chen, et al, reported a multiple polymerization route to synthesize poly
(acrylic acid) coated magnetic nanoshperes with controlled surface modification. The obtained
magnetic nanospheres were fully characterized by XRD, TGA, TEM, DLS, and VSM. Besides, the
relationship between the structure of magnetic nanospheres and the thickness of the grafted poly
(acrylic acid) layer has been investigated. This work provided a new idea to control the structure
and surface of magnetic polymer nanospheres. Therefore, I recommend that this work can be
published in RSOS after addressing some specific issues as follows:
1. Line 13, Page 3: the description on Figure 1 is not correct. The peak positions for (422), (511),
and (440) is wrong, there three peaks should be 53.7°, 57.1°, and 62.9°.
2. Page 4, line 32. Authors described the pH responsiveness of magnetic nanospheres, however,
it's better to provide the hydrodynamic size in extreme pH values such as pH 3 and pH 11 in
Figure 6.
3. The magnetic content of the nanospheres is low. Can the loading amounts of magnetite in
polymer matrix be adjusted?
4. How the stability of the poly (acrylic acid) coated magnetic nanoshperes in PBS?
5. In the caption of Figure 5, “loop” should be “loops”
6. Some related reported papers on the surface modification of magnetic composites (such as
Chem. Commun. 2008, 4463-4465; Adv. Funct. Mater. 2010, 5, 773-780) should be cited.

The submitted manuscript proposed preparation of poly(acrylic acid) coated magnetic
nanospheres (PMNS) via a multiple polymerization route. In general, this work is written clearly,
but some experiment design and characterization results are inadequate and the claims author
proposed here don’t have sufficient evidence to support. Some comments attached as follows:
1<U+3001>In the Introduction part, a problem was presented that magnetic nanoparticles would migrate
to the surface of the nanospheres during the process of miniemulsion polymerization, and further
affected the further surface modification by functional groups. Aimed to this topic, author
proposed a multiple polymerization route to overcome it. However, in all subsequent
experimental results described in this work, there was no direct evidence or convincing data to
support the multi-step polymerization approach did not affect subsequent surface modification.
For example, what is the difference in the density of the surface functional groups or the
thickness of the PAA layer on the surface of the magnetic microspheres obtained from the multi-
step polymerization method compared with the conventional emulsion polymer method?
2<U+3001>In the 3.6 Characterization, did the TGA data be measured in nitrogen atmosphere ? It should
be described clearly.
3<U+3001>In the last sentence of 4.1.2, it should hydrodynamic size increased by 50 nm rather than size
increased by 50 nm.
4<U+3001>In the part of 4.1.3, the saturation magnetization of MNS1 and MNS2 should directly give the
actual saturation magnetization measured by VSM firstly, without subtracting the mass of
ligands and polymers on the surface of magnetic particles. Only with such data could make the
readers understand intuitively the magnetic properties of the obtained magnetic microspheres in
this work.
5<U+3001>In the part of 4.2.1, MNS2 should be set as the control group when studying the particle size of
microspheres varies with the increase of pH. That is to say, the particle size of MNS2 varies with
the increase of pH must be measured.

Dear Editor,
We have revised our manuscript according to the reviewers' comments and the revised texts
have been highlighted by "Track Changes" in MS Word. We appreciate the detailed and
useful comments and suggestions from you and the reviewers. The point-by-point answers to
he comments were listed as below.
R1:
n this manuscript, Chen, et al, reported a multiple polymerization route to synthesize poly
acrylic acid) coated magnetic nanoshperes with controlled surface modification. The
obtained magnetic nanospheres were fully characterized by XRD, TGA, TEM, DLS, and VSM.
Besides, the relationship between the structure of magnetic nanospheres and the thickness of
he grafted poly (acrylic acid) layer has been investigated. This work provided a new idea to
control the structure and surface of magnetic polymer nanospheres. Therefore, I recommend
hat this work can be published in RSOS after addressing some specific issues as follows:
Answer: We thank this reviewer’s careful reading and good understanding of our manuscript.
Below we will list the corresponding revisions made in our revised manuscript to meet the
eviewer’s comment.
1. Line 13, Page 3: the description on Figure 1 is not correct. The peak positions for (422),
511), and (440) is wrong, there three peaks should be 53.7°, 57.1°, and 62.9°.
Answer: We thank the reviewer for pointing out this mistake. We have made corrections to
Figure 1a according to the reviewer’s suggestion.
2. Page 4, line 32. Authors described the pH responsiveness of magnetic nanospheres,
however, it's better to provide the hydrodynamic size in extreme pH values such as pH 3 and
pH 11 in Figure 6.
Answer: We thank the reviewer for his/her valuable advice. In Figure 6, we added
hydrodynamic sizes at extreme pH (pH 3 and pH 11). In line 9, section 4.2.1, the discussion
or size at extreme pH is added as "PMNS is unstable at low pH (pH = 4) because of
nsufficient space hindrance and reduced electrostatic repulsion."
3. The magnetic content of the nanospheres is low. Can the loading amounts of magnetite in
polymer matrix be adjusted?
Answer: Actually, the amount of magnetic content can be adjusted. However, we take the
magnetic content of 5wt% as an example to study the effect of multi-step polymerization on
he functional modification of magnetic microspheres. In our future work, we will focus on
he magnetic content effect on the preparation process.
4. How the stability of the poly (acrylic acid) coated magnetic nanoshperes in PBS?
Answer: Poly (acrylic acid) coated magnetic nanoshperes can be stored for up to 6 months in
PBS solution without precipitation. We added "The MNS2 showed a large amount of
precipitation in one month. While the PMNS stored in a PBS buffer was stable for up to 6
months without precipitation, which demonstrated that the poly(acrylic acid) chains endow
PMNS a good stability." in line 10, section 4.2.1 in the revised manuscript.
5. In the caption of Figure 5, “loop” should be “loops”
Answer: We thank the reviewer for pointing out the typo and it has been corrected.
6. Some related reported papers on the surface modification of magnetic composites (such as
Chem. Commun. 2008, 4463-4465; Adv. Funct. Mater. 2010, 5, 773-780) should be cited.
Answer: We thank the reviewers for their valuable suggestions for related references. We
have carefully reviewed the literatures and cited them in the revised manuscript as ref [15] in
ine 12, section 2, and ref [17] in line 12, section 2, respectively.
R2:
The submitted manuscript proposed preparation of poly(acrylic acid) coated magnetic
nanospheres (PMNS) via a multiple polymerization route. In general, this work is written
clearly, but some experiment design and characterization results are inadequate and the
claims author proposed here don’t have sufficient evidence to support. Some comments
attached as follows:
Answer: We thank this reviewer’s careful reading and good understanding of our manuscript.
Below we will list the corresponding revisions made in our revised manuscript to meet the
eviewer’s comment.
1. In the Introduction part, a problem was presented that magnetic nanoparticles would
migrate to the surface of the nanospheres during the process of miniemulsion polymerization,
and further affected the further surface modification by functional groups. Aimed to this topic,
author proposed a multiple polymerization route to overcome it. However, in all subsequent
experimental results described in this work, there was no direct evidence or convincing data
o support the multi-step polymerization approach did not affect subsequent surface
modification. For example, what is the difference in the density of the surface functional
groups or the thickness of the PAA layer on the surface of the magnetic microspheres
obtained from the multi-step polymerization method compared with the conventional emulsion
polymer method?
Answer: We thank the reviewer for this question. Here, we are sorry for the reviewer's
confusion on the motivation of our manuscript because of our improper presentation. In this
work, poly(acrylic acid) coated magnetic nanospheres were prepared by a multi-
polymerization method, which is an alternative route for preparation of functional magnetic
nanospheres with controlled structure. It is also proposed that the seed emulsion
polymerization method can be used to control the aggregation morphology of MNP in
magnetic microspheres and the distribution of MNP to affect the surface functionalization. To
avoid the confusion, we revised some sentences in the introduction. In line 22, section 2, We
have deleted the " However, MNP would migrate to the surface of the nanospheres in some
cases, which affect the further surface modification by functional groups [37]. To avoid this
negative effect, efforts have been made by researchers."Then,in line 24, section 2, add "In
order to further improve the encapsulation of magnetic nanoparticles" later. In line 28, section
2, add "Therefore, we provide an alternative way to prepare functional magnetic
nanospheres." In line 33, section 2, add " At the same time, the effect of aggregation state of
magnetic nanoparticles in magnetic nanospheres on surface functionalization was also
studied." In order to make the paper's data more convincing, we compare it with traditional
aggregation methods. In line 15, section 4.2.2, add " Xu used a seed emulsion polymerization
method to increase the thickness of functional layer by ~10 nm [19]. Compared with the
iterature, our method improves the layer thickness to some extent."
2. In the 3.6 Characterization, did the TGA data be measured in nitrogen atmosphere ? It
should be described clearly.
Answer: TGA was carried out in air atmosphere instead of nitrogen atmosphere. In line 3,
section 3.6, "The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) model Q600 SD was used to analyze the
magnetite content at a heating rate of 10 °C/min." was corrected to "The thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) model Q600 SD was used to analyze the magnetite content at a heating rate of
10 °C/min in air atmosphere."
3. In the last sentence of 4.1.2, it should hydrodynamic size increased by 50 nm rather than
size increased by 50 nm.
Answer: It has been corrected according to the reviewer’s suggestion in the revised
manuscript.
4. In the part of 4.1.3, the saturation magnetization of MNS1 and MNS2 should directly give
he actual saturation magnetization measured by VSM firstly, without subtracting the mass of
igands and polymers on the surface of magnetic particles. Only with such data could make
he readers understand intuitively the magnetic properties of the obtained magnetic
microspheres in this work.
Answer: We thank the reviewer for pointing out this question. We provided a more intuitive
data description as shown in Figure 5a. Add " In Figure 5a, the saturation magnetizations of
MNP, MNS1 and MNS2 are 52.4 emu/g, 2.7 emu/g and 0.96 emu/g, respectively. " in line 2,
section 4.1.3.
5. In the part of 4.2.1, MNS2 should be set as the control group when studying the particle
size of microspheres varies with the increase of pH. That is to say, the particle size of MNS2
varies with the increase of pH must be measured.
Answer: We did the control experiments and added the data to Figure 6b. In line 7, section
4.2.1, we added text as “With the increase of pH value, the hydrodynamic size of MNS2 is
almost a constant, because MNS2 has no pH sensitivity.”
