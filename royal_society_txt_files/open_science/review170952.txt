The paper is enjoyable and covers an aspect that hasn't been explored in an extensive,
quantitative way as of now (at least, to my knowledge). The analysis is a bit superficial at times
(see for example geographic analysis) but gives a nice overview on a topic that could be further
explored. The authors cleverly use existing methods and open data to deliver a compelling first
data-driven exploration on the relationship between music, workds, and sentiment. I don't have
major comments about the paper, but there are three points that, if addressed, would improve the
quality of the manuscript.
- I don't know if this aspect is imposed by the journal requirements, but I don't like too much the
way the paper is structured. There are some fundamental points (e.g., how the valence is
extracted from words, the meaning of the word shift graph, how the explained variance is
computed, ...) that should not be postponed to the "Methods" section. Doing that, leaves the
reader wondering how some of the results have been obtained until the very end. For example, it
would be much easier to say immediately that the LabMT lexicon has been used to get the
valence scores. That doesn't take more lines and it's much clearer than mentioning some obscure
MTurk job conducted to get word valence. The same goes for the word shift graphs. Figure 2 is
quite hard to understand: the combination of color, sign, arrows, and direction of the bar is hard
to parse unless the way in which the plot is made is clarified immediately.
- The authors discuss some caveats around the geographical analysis, but it seems to me they
have missed the main one. The regional analysis is very biased by the fact that the authors
considered only songs in English. This point needs to be explicitly stated when Figure 5 is
presented.
- The authors consider a subset of all possible chords (a summary here
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chords) because of lack of data. It is quite surprising that
there are only 5 unique chords with enough datapoints when considering a database of almost
1M chord occurrences. I would suggest to include in the paper the results of a preliminary
analysis of the chord dataset (e.g., distribution of chord occurrences or the top chord-word co-
occurrences) to give a better sense of how big is the portion of the dataset that has been filtered
out.

In this manuscript the authors study the association between chords and emotional valence of
lyrics in songs written for guitar.
They use up to date methods of sentiment analysis to give an emotional valence score to lyrics,
and aggregate chords together, based on their types, making possible to have a statistical
confidence for the chord-lyrics associations.
This is a sound study, clearly written, and with some neat results. I found the temporal analysis
and region analysis most interesting, especially the part where they show the decrease of the
emotional valence and the changes in chords proportion over time.
I only have some minor comments, that could improve the readability of the manuscript:
- many of the results presented here are similar and consistent with previous literature, as
indicated by the same authors. And this is good. However, I had difficulties to identify the novel
contributions and results of this work, as opposed to confirmation of old results. Perhaps could
the authors highlight a bit more what we learnt here that we did not known? Or if all it’s old,
what is novel in the method and/or in the application?
- not sure if this is an artifact of the pdf produced by the submission platform, but most figures
are quite small, to the point that it’s hard to read text, symbols, error bars. For example, printed
on paper fig. 1 is about 2” x 1”, while it could span at least over the entire text width. I suggest
that most figures are scaled up a bit.
- is the y-axis in the AIC plot in Fig. 6 correct? I am not sure about the+3.1509e6 on top of the axis
- the authors make available the data (figshare link), but I am not sure I found a link to the code
used.

We thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue. We have modified our paper’s structure to adhere to
the journal's requirements and the reviewer's comment; we have moved Methods section so that
readers would find it easier to understand the tools and techniques used in our research. This Methods
section also contains an explanation of the word shift diagram so that the reader will be informed about
how to read these by the time that they appear in the paper. In addition, we now state that we use the
LabMT lexicon directly in the Introduction.

The reviewer is correct that our analysis is based on English-language songs and is unlikely to capture
overall musical trends in non-English-speaking regions. We have added a paragraph highlighting this
caveat to the “Region” section of results (where Fig 5 is presented). We also mention this in the
Discussion section.

Our source for tablatures is a user contributed website of popular music. We have observed that
majority of the tablatures consist of simple chords, thus leading to bias towards 5 chord categories.
Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we include discussion and plot of the prevalence of different chord
categories in our dataset in the Methods section.

We appreciate that the reviewer enjoyed reading our research. The novel contributions of this work
include the novel methodology of using sentiment analysis to measure emotional association between
lyrics and chords, the use of a novel data set, the findings regarding the surprisingly positive valence of
7th chords, and finally the analysis of Major vs. Minor distinction across different regions, eras, and
genres. We have edited the Discussion section to more explicitly highlight which parts of our results and
methods are novel.

We have made our figures bigger for better readability.

We have verified that y-axis in this figure is correct. The +3.151e6 indicates a constant offset for all
plotted AIC values. The AIC values are large due to the large number of data points in our dataset.

We have uploaded all code necessary to replicate the analysis and plots to
