The current manuscript by Velez-Juarbe and Salinas-Marquez reports a surprisingly small new
genus and species of early “imagotariine” walrus from the upper Miocene Tortugas Formation of
Baja California. The new taxon, Nanodobenus arandai, is based on an isolated, fragmentary
mandible with partial dentition. The specimen has a complete enough dentition to be coded into
a phylogenetic matrix. Cladistic analysis recovers Nanodobenus in an unresolved polytomy
along with Pseudotaria, Pelagiarctos, Imagotaria, and Archaeodobenus as sister to a Pontolis +
Dusignathinae + Odobeninae clade. If the specimen were more complete, perhaps better
resolution might be possible. Regardless, the specimen is interesting and marks. I recommend
acceptance after minor revision.

Moderate comments:
Owing to the short length of the article, the geologic background should be included within the
main text. There is a surprising lack of citations in the main text about the stratigraphy,
depositional setting, associated fauna, and geochronologic control of the locality. In addition, a
locality map and stratigraphic column showing relevant marker horizons is needed.
On further reflection, all of the ESM 1 text should just be incorporated into the main manuscript.
Little attempt is made to compare this new taxon with other pinniped groups. Aside from the
cladistic analysis, what anatomical evidence supports the identification of this admittedly
fragmentary and incomplete specimen as an odobenid, rather than an otariid or even a
desmatophocid? Please list any relevant odobenid synapomorphies, if possible.
Furthermore, please make comparisons with the problematic pinniped “Desmatophocine A”,
which is coeval with this new taxon (Santa Margarita Sandstone, ~9-12 Ma, Santa Cruz, CA),
recently (briefly) reidentified as Imagotaria n. sp. by Boessenecker and Churchill (2018).
Minor comments:
Line 24, 90: please change late Miocene Tortugas Formation to upper Miocene Tortugas
Formation
Line 172-174: perhaps a reference to Nanophoca is relevant here.
Figure 2: The LAD for Ontocetus emmonsi is far too young. A recently accepted paper, now in
press in Acta Palaeontologica Polonica (Boessenecker, Boessenecker, and Geisler) reevaluates the
fossil record of Ontocetus emmonsi in the North Atlantic and finds that the youngest known
specimen is a minimum of 1.1 Ma. I am happy to provide a copy of the accepted manuscript.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This manuscript describes new collections (including a calcaneum described in the
supplimentary Information) of the mid-late Miocene odobenid pinnipeds from Baja California
sur, Mexico. Because the taxon is morphologically ditinctive (especially in size), the new
collection(s) provide additional information about the diversification of the odobenids during
their evolution. The authors have made careful observations and sufficient comparisons for the
new collection(s), and they have provided useful specimen illustrations and measurements.
These are satisfactory and very fine. The discussion regarding the dispality of the new taxon and
the estimated size diversification of the odobenids in the mid-late Miocene are also satisfactory
and persuasive, and the authors’ recognition on the taxonomic diversity of the odobenids based
on results of their character analyses are worthy of discussion. The references list sufficiently and
correspond to the references in the text. Accordingly, the article undoubtedly could be published
in RSOS. However, I have some concerns regarding the following things:
1. In the section of the Systematic Paleontology, there is no suggestion of diagnostic character(s)
of this mandible to be included in the family Odobenidae. Because some other basal grade and
crown clade pinnipeds have been known from the same age along the coast of North America as
has discussed in the aothots’ discussion, specification of the diagnostic characters to identify the
holotype specimen as belonging to the family Odobenidae is recommended or could be
necessary. Please suggest the reason (diagnostic characters) for the family level identification
clearly to distinguish the mandible to be described as the holotype of a new genus and species
within the Odobenidae before the start of the description of the specimen.
2. In regard to the description for the topotypic calcaneum LACM 6659, the authors have
identified it conservatively as «odobenidae gen. et sp. indet.» in the Electronic Supplementary
Material (ESM). Apart from its similarity and size overlapping to that of Neotherium, the body of
LACM60914 is relatively thicker and wider (i.e., robust) than the lectotype and LACM 127997 (of
supplementary Table S2) of Neotherium that are considered to be female individuals, and the
calcaneofibulare tuberosity is more developped at least than the lectotype of N. mirum,
indicating that LACM 60914 may strongly be a male individual, and therefore, it could be
distinguishable from Neotherium. In this regard, the identification of Nanodobenus for the
topotypic calcaneum may be warranted as a “tentatively” referred male individual of
Nanodobenus, although the reviewer agrees to the authors’ identification.
3. As for the term “Differential Diagnosis” on the line 92 of page 5, Demere (1994) has suggested
to use the term "Characterization" to refer to a listing of distinguishing characters of both shared
4
derived and shared primitive homologous characters, and their taxonomic distribution, in this
case. It may be worth considering as a previously defined term.
Minor comments-
For Main text;
Page 2, line 24: “late” could be “upper”.
Page 4, line 82: FMSM could be F.M.S.M.(?) It may be better to write this as "the junior author"(?).
Please check.
Page 8, line 161: “)” could be inserted after “Table S1; [2, 4]”.
Page 8, line 169: “ancentral” could be “ancestral”.
For ESM;
Page 3, line 16: “is can” may be “can be”.
Page 4, line 2: “individal” could be “individual”.
Anyway, this article could be an important contribution to understand the evolution and
diversification of the odobenid pinnipeds during the mid-late Miocene, and therefore, it is worthy
of publication. However, the content of the manuscript suffers from above listed concerns,
requiring very MINOR REVISION. I hope it helps to improve the quality of the manuscript.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Robert Sansom):
Both reviewers are in agreement that this is a worthy and interesting contribution but ask for
minor revisions before publication. Their comments relate mostly to increasing specification of
the synapomorphies and moving the geological information from the ESM to main text.
As an aside, I make a few suggestions regarding the phylogenetic analysis (which are not
requested revisions, just suggestions). Consider removing (or pruning) the incomplete taxa from
an analysis to see is that improves resolution and consider running a Bayesian analysis (which is
increasingly a requirement of morphological analysis). Also Bayes traits analysis with and
without your new taxon might give some interesting insights into how your new taxon effects
our understanding of body size evolution in a quantitative way.

Response: We are thankful for this suggestion. We tried reanalyzing the matrix by
doing a heuristic search by removing other less complete taxa (i.e. Pelagiarctos spp.)
and the resulting tree lacked resolution. We did reanalyze the matrix using MrBayes
and the resulting tree was better resolved than the original one we had. We
therefore decided to use that tree and report both posterior probability and
bootstrap values (obtained with PAUP) in the updated tree. We did not perform a
Bayes trait analysis but will consider it for a future work.

than the lectotype and LACM 127997 (of supplementary Table S2) of Neotherium
that are considered to be female individuals, and the calcaneofibulare tuberosity is
more developped at least than the lectotype of N. mirum, indicating that LACM
60914 may strongly be a male individual, and therefore, it could be distinguishable
from Neotherium. In this regard, the identification of Nanodobenus for the
topotypic calcaneum may be warranted as a “tentatively” referred male individual
of Nanodobenus, although the reviewer agrees to the authors’ identification.
Response: We agree and have tentatively referred the calcaneum to Nanodobenus
and added this part to the main document.
3. As for the term “Differential Diagnosis” on the line 92 of page 5, Demere (1994)
has suggested to use the term "Characterization" to refer to a listing of
distinguishing characters of both shared derived and shared primitive homologous
characters, and their taxonomic distribution, in this case. It may be worth
considering as a previously defined term.
Response: We prefer to keep the term Differential Diagnosis, but we did changed
part of the text at the beginning to say: “… characterized by the following unique
combination of mandibular characters:…”
Minor comments-
For Main text;
Page 2, line 24: “late” could be “upper”.
Response: We disagree with this recommendation as we are referring to the age
(time) and not part of the formation (place) which is when upper is used.
Page 4, line 82: FMSM could be F.M.S.M.(?) It may be better to write this as "the
junior author"(?). Please check.
Response: We agree and have changed the text to “the junior author”.
Page 8, line 161: “)” could be inserted after “Table S1; [2, 4]”.
Response: We agree and have corrected the text accordingly.
Page 8, line 169: “ancentral” could be “ancestral”.
Response: We agree and have corrected the text accordingly.
For ESM;
Page 3, line 16: “is can” may be “can be”.
Response: We agree and have corrected the text accordingly.
Page 4, line 2: “individal” could be “individual”.
Response: We agree and have corrected the text accordingly.
Anyway, this article could be an important contribution to understand the evolution
and diversification of the odobenid pinnipeds during the mid-late Miocene, and
therefore, it is worthy of publication. However, the content of the manuscript
suffers from above listed concerns, requiring very MINOR REVISION. I hope it helps
to improve the quality of the manuscript.
