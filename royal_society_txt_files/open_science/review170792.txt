Development of polymeric films for encapsulation of flexible OPV solar cells, where these films
need to provide an ultra-high barrier to the ingress of water vapour and oxygen, is an area of
current scientific and industrial interest. As the authors indicate, in order to be useful as a barrier
encapsulant for OPV cells, it is usually considered necessary for such films to display WVTR of
the order of 10^-5 g m^-2 day^-1. Highly specialised (and costly) materials have been developed
that can satisfy these stringent barrier performance requirements, but more cost-effective barrier
materials are needed in order to make OPV technology commercially competitive.
The methodology, analysis, and conclusions of this work are scientifically and technically sound,
and the quality of English expression is good.
The authors refer to articles reporting improvement of the water-vapour barrier performance of
polymeric films using a variety of additives, including nano-celluloses. The reduced WVTR in
most of these cases is claimed to be the result of an increased tortuous path for permeating water
molecules. Tortuosity is a function of multiple factors such as additive loading, aspect ratio of
additive particles, crystallinity of the additive, etc.
As indicated by the authors, the WVTR of a 1mm-thick sheet of Surlyn is 11 g m^-2 day^-1, and
to achieve acceptable optical clarity a film thickness of no more than approx 100 microns is likely

be needed. This would give rise to a Surlyn film having a WVTR of 10^2 g m^-2 day^-1, which is
7 orders of magnitude greater than that required for a material to be of interest as a barrier
encapsulatnt for OPV solar cells! Especially considering the low aspect ratio of the micro/nano-
fibrilated cellulose, the authors should explain clearly their rationale for expecting that the
approach adopted in their work could achieve the stated target WVTR for an OPV encapsulant.
The very modest decrease in WVTR obtained in the present work of <50% (i.e. << 1 order of
magnitude decrease in WVTR) could have been anticipated from tortuous path models such as
those proposed by Bharadwaj (Macromolecules, 34, 9189, 2001). The fact that little improvement
in water vapour barrier was achieved beyond that expected from theory cannot be considered as
a “negative result”.
I recommend strongly that the authors revise the manuscript with the emphasis on the potential
for MFC-modified Surlyn to be an improvement on the polymeric encapsulants used for silicon-
type PV cells (e.g. EVA, PVB) rather than as a prospective barrier encapsulant for OPV cells.

provide an ultra-high barrier to the ingress of water vapour and oxygen, is an area of current scientific and industrial
interest. As the authors indicate, in order to be useful as a barrier encapsulant for OPV cells, it is usually considered
necessary for such films to display WVTR of the order of 10^-5 g m^-2 day^-1. Highly specialised (and costly)
materials have been developed that can satisfy these stringent barrier performance requirements, but more cost-
effective barrier materials are needed in order to make OPV technology commercially competitive.
The methodology, analysis, and conclusions of this work are scientifically and technically sound, and the
quality of English expression is good.
The authors refer to articles reporting improvement of the water-vapour barrier performance of polymeric
films using a variety of additives, including nano-celluloses. The reduced WVTR in most of these cases is claimed to
be the result of an increased tortuous path for permeating water molecules. Tortuosity is a function of multiple factors
such as additive loading, aspect ratio of additive particles, crystallinity of the additive, etc.

WVTR obtained in the present work of <50% (i.e. << 1 order of

(Macromolecules, 34, 9189, 2001). The fact that little
