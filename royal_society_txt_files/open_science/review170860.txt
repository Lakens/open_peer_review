In this elegant short study the author demonstrates the importance of two copulations in female
genital mutilation in a spider. This will no doubt be a useful contribution to our understanding of
this phenomenon that is possible much more widely practiced than the literature suggests. The
writeup is clear though it may need English fixes. The analyses seem solid and the conclusions
logical. My concern that can be addressed in a revised ms is that the literature is not adequately
cited. With only 11 citations the current ms lacks references to well documented sexual
phenomena in spiders that presumably evolve to monopolize females, such as the eunuch
behavior (this includes behaviors such as remote copulation, and eunuchs show higher levels of
endurance and aggression), the role of genital plugging, etc. Adding more literature to the picture
would make the current paper more widely relevant.

I have now finished reviewing MS "The timing of female genital mutilation and the role of
contralateral palpal insertions in the spider Cyclosa argenteoalba". The study investigates the
mating conditions in which males cause female genital mutilation in spiders. Namely the MS
tested two alternative hypotheses; 1) males mutilate females scape after two insertions, or
alternatively 2) males only destroy females scape after two contralateral papal insertions. Results
show that males that mated consecutively with two separate females did not cut the scape of the
second female (i.e. male’s second insertion did not lead to female genital mutilation). However,
when two males with contrasting pedipalps mated with the same female, the last male cut female
3
scape.
The MS addresses an interesting question. The results are presented in a clear manner and the
discussion is well supported. I have a few minor comments suggestions (see below). However my
main concern is the broad interest of the MS. In it is present form the MS is very much orientated
for an arachnid audience rather than to a broad audience. While the theme addressed in the MS
opens interesting questions in terms of evolution of multiple mating and sexual conflict, the
narrow way in which the results are discussed hinders the potential interest of the study. I am
sure the quality of the MS would improve significantly if the author could discuss the result in a
more over reaching manner (i.e. including other species rather than only spiders).
Below is a list of minor points/comments/Suggestions
Line 3 – Add “behaviour at the end of “Some male spiders exhibit female genital mutilation
behaviour (FGM)…”
Line 5 – something wrong with this sentence, “… i.e. one each on the right and left side…”
Line 25 – Instead of “In animals” why not say “in the majority of taxa”
Line 25 – Female often “mates” and not mate
Line 32 – Remove “In 2015-2016” and start the sentence “A way to inhibit…”
Line 36 – Delete “A” from the start of the sentence “A male has…”
Line 41 – “to be no costs for males and not “cost”
Line 44 – The male spider and not “A male spider”
Line 50 – This sentence needs to have a reference at the end to substantiate the claim that “ two
palpal insertions are required to fill both spermatheca with sperm…”
Line 62 & 65 – An hypothesis is predicted and not assumed
Line 94 – Something odd at the end of the sentence – “the pair temporarily separated”
I hope these comments help improving the MS

. The one-action hypothesis assumes that spiders implement no actions to mutilate the scape
during the first insertion, with scape-removal behaviour associated with only the second
insertion. Alternatively, the two-actions hypothesis assumes that a male destroys only one side
(right or left) of the scape at the first insertion.

Associate Editor's comments:
Dear Dr. Nakata,
I have now received reviews of your manuscript from two experts in the field. Both reviewers felt
your manuscript addresses an interesting question, and was well explained and conducted. The
english could be improved in several places, and having a consultant on this could be useful if
you don't think you can address this on your own. The most important issue at hand is that the
paper is narrowly focused on spiders and does not address the larger conceptual issues that it
could (and that would make it appealing to the RSOS audience). Reviewer 2 details many of these
concepts. Related to this is the point that Reviewer 1 raised; you insufficiently cited the literature.
I recommend revising this paper to broaden the context of your paper and providing a more
robust framework and foundation to discuss the larger issue that you studied (i.e., evolution of
multiple mating and sexual conflict).

Thank you for giving me a chance to revise my manuscript. I had read associate Editor's
and reviewers’ comment carefully and revised my manuscript according to them. I had
referred a number of literatures and added sentences about mating behavior of spiders
and other animals in Introduction and Discussion to widen the context of my manuscript.
I had also followed all other comments from reviewers. Details of change are explained
below. Additionally, I had asked proof reading service (https://www.editage.com) to
check my English. Various changes had been made according to advices from them. All
changes in the manuscript is indicated in red and leftside bars. I hope that these changes
will be satisfactory.

In this elegant short study the author demonstrates the importance of two copulations in
female genital mutilation in a spider. This will no doubt be a useful contribution to our
understanding of this phenomenon that is possible much more widely practiced than the
literature suggests. The writeup is clear though it may need English fixes. The analyses
seem solid and the conclusions logical. My concern that can be addressed in a revised
ms is that the literature is not adequately cited. With only 11 citations the current ms
lacks references to well documented sexual phenomena in spiders that presumably evolve
to monopolize females, such as the eunuch behavior (this includes behaviors such as
remote copulation, and eunuchs show higher levels of endurance and aggression), the
role of genital plugging, etc. Adding more literature to the picture would make the current
paper more widely relevant.

Thank you for your valuable comments. The original manuscript has firstly been
submitted to Biology Letters which word restriction is very severe, and I have to remove
many citations from the manuscript. Now, I had cited many relevant literatures about
behaviour of spider males that try to monopolize paternity (reference #11-16, 19, 23 and
28, lines 45-50, 53-54, and 204-205).

>I have now finished reviewing MS "The timing of female genital mutilation and the role
of contralateral palpal insertions in the spider Cyclosa argenteoalba". The study
investigates the mating conditions in which males cause female genital mutilation in
spiders. Namely the MS tested two alternative hypotheses; 1) males mutilate females
scape after two insertions, or alternatively 2) males only destroy females scape after two
contralateral papal insertions. Results show that males that mated consecutively with two
separate females did not cut the scape of the second female (i.e. male’s second insertion
did not lead to female genital mutilation). However, when two males with contrasting
pedipalps mated with the same female, the last male cut female scape.
>The MS addresses an interesting question. The results are presented in a clear manner
and the discussion is well supported. I have a few minor comments suggestions (see
below). However my main concern is the broad interest of the MS. In it is present form
the MS is very much orientated for an arachnid audience rather than to a broad audience.
While the theme addressed in the MS opens interesting questions in terms of evolution of
multiple mating and sexual conflict, the narrow way in which the results are discussed
hinders the potential interest of the study. I am sure the quality of the MS would improve
significantly if the author could discuss the result in a more over reaching manner (i.e.
including other species rather than only spiders).
I have cited many literatures and discussed them to attract interesting from wide
readership (reference #3-5,10,17,18,20,26,27,29, and 30, lines 42-57 and 202-208).
Please read my reply to reviewer #1’s comments.
>Below is a list of minor points/comments/Suggestions
>Line 3 – Add “behaviour at the end of “Some male spiders exhibit female genital
mutilation behaviour (FGM)…”
I had change it according to the suggestion (Line 3).
>Line 5 – something wrong with this sentence, “… i.e. one each on the right and left
side…”
I had rephrased the sentence (Line 5).
>Line 25 – Instead of “In animals” why not say “in the majority of taxa”
I had change it according to the suggestion (Line 25).
>Line 25 – Female often “mates” and not mate
I had change it according to the suggestion (Line 25).
>Line 32 – Remove “In 2015-2016” and start the sentence “A way to inhibit…”
I had change it according to the suggestion from proof-editing service (Line 33).
>Line 36 – Delete “A” from the start of the sentence “A male has…”
I had change it according to the suggestion from proof-editing service (Line 37).
>Line 41 – “to be no costs for males and not “cost”
I had change it according to the suggestion (Line 42).
>Line 44 – The male spider and not “A male spider”
I had change it according to the suggestion (Line 60).
>Line 50 – This sentence needs to have a reference at the end to substantiate the claim
that “ two palpal insertions are required to fill both spermatheca with sperm…”
I had added a reference (#23, Line 67).
>Line 62 & 65 – An hypothesis is predicted and not assumed
I had change it according to the suggestion (Lines 79 and 82).
>Line 94 – Something odd at the end of the sentence – “the pair temporarily separated”
I had rephrased the sentence (Line 109).

>Line 25 – this statement need a reference. I suggest a review of the universality of
female multiple mating. Please add
Jennions MD, Petrie M (2000) Why do females mate multiply? A review of the genetic
benefits. Biological Reviews 75 (1):21-64. doi:10.1111/j.1469-185X.1999.tb00040.x,

of Fish Biology 68 (6):1636-1661. doi:10.1111/j.1095-8649.2006.01133.x
I had change it according to the suggestion (Lines 25 and 238-241).
>Line 31 – Missing space between “plugs” and [5]
I had change it according to the suggestion (Line 31)
>Line 33 – I suggest changing the sentence to the following “…to prevent females from
mating multiply is through male female genital mutilation (FGM).”This sentence makes
it clear that genital mutilation is caused by male behaviour
I had change it according to the suggestion (Line 33).
>Line 34 – Full stop after (FGM). Start new sentence with“ For example FGM has been
described in two web spiders…”
I had change it according to the suggestion (Line 34).
>Line 35 – Start sentence “In these species, virgin females…” instead of “virgin
females of these spider…”
I had change it according to the suggestion (Lines35-36).
>Line 41 – Delete “seems” and write the sentence “FGM is a powerful way in which
males can inhibit females from mating with multiple partners, and thus ensure full male
paternity.
I had change it according to the suggestion (Lines41-42).
>Line 43 – Change sentence instead of “…that might make males to pay energetic or
opportunity costs. “ write “…that are more costly to males in terms of energy
expenditure and mating opportunity.”
I had change it according to the suggestion (Lines43-44).
>Line 52 – delete word “the” before “that”
I had change it according to the suggestion (Line 53).
>Line 67 – Use the species abbreviation C. argenteoalba
I had change it according to the suggestion (Line 67).
>Line 77- 79 – Change sentence to “ Here we examine if selection acts on C.
argenteoalba males to implement FGM after the second insertion in order to maximize
paternity success. This question will give us invaluable insights in the evolutionary
process and selective mechanisms of FGM.”
I had change it according to the suggestion (Lines 77-80).
>Line 79 – Start sentence with “ Namely we test two hypotheses”.
I had change it according to the suggestion (Line 80).
>Line 92-94 – Replace sentence with “ I collected both adult and sub-adult females C.
argenteoalba from Shimamoto, Osaka and from Nagaoka-Kyo, Japan beween 2014 and
2015. “
I had change it according to the suggestion (Lines93-94).
>Line 97 – delete “… I obtained” and replace it by “ I ensure that all adult females were
virgins prior to the experiment.”
I had change it according to the suggestion (Lines 97-98).
>Line 97 – Delete “ I released the…” and start the sentence with “Females were
released into the observation arena…”
I had change it according to the suggestion (Line 98).
>Line 109 – Delete “ I coupled a virgin female and a male…” start sentence instead
with “ Ten pairs of virgin females and males were subjected to staged mating”
I had change it according to the suggestion (Line 110).
>Line 111 -113 – Please change sentence to “Females were removed from the web after
males successfully copulated. Male successful copulations are followed by male
jumping off the female to prevent female cannibalism (Needs a reference here). After
this stage, the female was removed from the web.”
I had changed the sentence, but I did not use the sentence suggested by the reviewer. I
am now aware that male jumping off is not important in this manuscript and had
removed this from the manuscript (Line 113).
>Line 114 – delete “I” and start sentence with “ After the male resume courtship
different female was introduced to the arena”.
I had changed the sentence that was slightly different from the suggestion by the
reviewer (Lines113-114).
>Lines 140-143 – change sentence to “ Mutilation rate was similar between the first and
the second groups, and between the third and fourth groups. As result, data from the
first and second groups were pooled and considered as contralateral insertion group, and
the data from third and fourth considered as the ipsilateral group”.
I had change it according to the suggestion (Lines 139-142).
>Line 152 – add “statistically” before significant
I had change it according to the suggestion (Line 151).
>Line 162 – delete “my”
I had change it according to the suggestion (Line 159).
>Line 169 – missing space between mutilations observed) and [6]
I had change it according to the suggestion (Line 168).
>Line 195 – delete “handedness” and replaced it by preference. Delete (i.e preference)
I had change it according to the suggestion (Line 194).
