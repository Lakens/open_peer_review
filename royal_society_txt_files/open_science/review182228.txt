Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
Strong et al. present a nice overview of the ontogenetic development of the skull in a modern
colubrid snake, Thamnophis sirtalis. I found it intriguing that despite the fact that this is a very
well known snake species so much can still be found when closely observing its bones and their
development. Things like the contact between quadrate and prootic in the snake embryo and the
lack of a crista circumfenestralis in the adult are certainly novel reports and are worth publishing.
Having said this, I also found several issues with this manuscript, which preclude publication in
its current state.
Here is a summary of the major points:
1) Some of the terminology used is inadequate, like use of terms such as “orbitosphenoidal plate”
or “incisive process”.
2) There is confusion between fusion of elements and simple sutures.
3) The manuscript would be greatly improved if the lower jaws were rendered separately in
lateral and medial view. This way the authors could properly illustrate all the elements they
describe, including angular and splenial, and would not have the lower jaws obscuring most of
the anatomy of the skull in ventral view (e.g. palatines, parabasisphenoid, and basioccipital
cannot be adequately seen because of this). Moreover, the authors took the time to segment all the
individual skull bones from the three developmental stages, but then simply figure the whole
skulls without showing the internal details of any of the elements. If the authors only wanted to
provide colorized versions of the skulls, then Adobe Photoshop could have provided the very
same results in a fraction of the time. I suggest that the authors take advantage of the fact that
they have digitally segmented individual elements in 3D and provide rendered images to
illustrate internal anatomical details that at present are discussed but not figured anywhere (at
least as supplementary figures).
4) I noticed an issue with tooth counts. The authors appear to have counted only those teeth that
are actually present and ankylosed to the dentigerous elements, when instead they should have
provided counts of tooth positions. This resulted in very inconsistent tooth counts (i.e. very low
numbers in the juvenile compared to the adult), when in fact the numbers of tooth positions are
expected to be very close, if not identical (at least for dentaries and maxillae). Moreover, tooth
counts could be affected by intraspecific variability (to a small extent), but the authors provide
counts for only 3 of their eight specimens. This way it s not possible to tell whether different tooth
counts could be caused by simple random intraspecific variation rather than by ontogenetic
change.
5) There is confusion revolving around the concept of paedomorphosis and on how it is detected.
The authors assume that if a trait is retained from an embryonic or juvenile stage into the adult
stage of a given species then the adult of that species is paedomorphic. This is incorrect. See
details below (e.g. Page 21, line 10). This misconception affects their interpretation of the lack of a
CCF in Thamnophis as a plesiomorphic feature, and also their interpretation of the
3
scolecophidian skull as the result of paedomorphosis. Because the authors cannot demonstrate
that the lack of a CCF or the contact between quadrate and prootic are plesiomorphic
embryonic/juvenile traits in snakes, then they cannot reach the conclusion that Thamnophis and
scolecophidians are paedomorphic for these traits. The authors can only raise the possibility (i.e.
formulate a hypothesis that requires further data to be supported).
6) Figure 7 is quite a problematic figure. It deceivingly suggests that the authors have way more
information on the distribution of the various modes of jaw suspension than they actually have. I
have extensively discussed the issues relating to this figure in one of my comments below.
Below I provide detailed comments on all major and minor issues as they present themselves in
the manuscript:
Page 1, line 53: than in most other (insert “most).
Page 2, line 17: replace “many” with “some” (there aren’t really that many studies).
Page 6, line 6: “increased integration of the premaxilla with the rest of the snout”. I would argue
that this is not true. The images show that the premaxilla is very loosely connected to the rest of
the snout in all three specimens/stages, and the only contact is between premaxilla and anterior
tip of the septomaxilla.
Page 6, line 6: the authors mistakenly use the term “incisive process” to refer to the premaxillary
process of the vomer (the “incisive process” is a process on the ventral side of the premaxilla of
some squamates other than snakes). Please replace “incisive process” with “premaxillary
process” here and in any following instance (lines 17, 26).
Page 6, line 13: “posterior premaxillary notch which will eventually accommodate the
septomaxilla and vomer”.
The notch does not accommodate any part of those bones.
Page 6, line 22: “premaxilla’s nasal process expands both dorsoventrally and anteroposteriorly”.
I believe this is incorrect, it expands mediolaterally and anteroposteriorly. It is quite clear that the
relative height of the nasal process remains the same if compared to septomaxilla, nasal, and
prefrontal.
Page 6, lines 24-31: “Extension of the anterior processes of the septomaxilla and incisive processes
of the vomer relative to the rest of these bones creates stronger contact – and thus improved
integration – between the premaxilla and the rest of the snout (Fig. 3C).”
This is incorrect, see previous comment on line 6.
Page 6, lines 35-36: “the dorsal laminae are only present as a cluster of unfused ossifications”.
This is inaccurate, there is no cluster of unfused ossifications, which seems to imply the presence
of multiple centers of ossification, but only a weakly ossified surface that when rendered digitally
appears full of holes, most likely as a rendering artifact.
Page 6, lines 38-39: “dorsal laminae distinctly present and fused to the vertical
laminae”.
This is inaccurate. The dorsal laminae are not individual elements separate from the vertical
laminae, they are part of the same element (the nasal), which is in the process of being
mineralised. It follows that there can be no fusion between parts of the same element.
Page 7, line 13: sutured (not “fused”). The frontals never fuse in snakes.
4
Page 7, line 22: The frontals are not completely sutured to each other (don’t write “fuse”).
Page 7, line 24: please remove “at which point a deep sagittal sulcus is present.” (that is not a
“sulcus”, is the suture between the bones).
Page 7, line 33: I would suggest using the term “optic fenestra” (not “foramen”, foramina are
small round holes, fenestrae are large gaps, not necessarily round).
Page 7, line 36: Please replace the term “orbitosphenoidal plate” with “descending flange of the
frontal”. The only literature reference I could find where the term “orbitosphenoid plate” was
used in the description of a snake skull dates back to 1831 (and also refers to something different).
Please replace “orbitosphenoidal plate” with “descending flange of the frontal” also in the
following instances (same page lines 40, 52; and page 8, lines 3, 8).
Page 7, line 43: parabasisphenoid (not “basisphenoid”; the bone referred to results from fusion of
parasphenoid and basisphenoid). Please replace “basisphenoid” with “parabasisphenoid” also in
the following instances.
Page 8, line 8: emargination (not “notch”).
Page 8, line 19: Add “(Fig. 1)” after “juvenile stages”.
Page 9, line 6: replace “expanded” with “bent” or “recurved”.
Page 9, line 22: “The palatine tooth row bears 15 teeth in the embryo, 14 teeth in the juvenile, and
16 teeth in the adult”.
The palatines are hidden by the lower jaws, so it is impossible to verify the tooth counts from the
figures provided. In fact, the lower jaws hide a great deal of the ventral anatomy of the skulls; it
would be better to have them rendered separately next to the skulls, this way the authors could
also illustrate the medial view of the lower jaws, which at present is not shown.
Based on what argued below for the tooth counts on dentaries and maxillae (Page 15, lines 31 &
52), I would suggest the authors to double-check these counts as well, in order to make sure that
they actually provide counts of tooth positions and not just of preserved teeth.
Finally, the numbers presented here, if correct, do not appear to follow an ontogenetic trend (15-
14-16). I suspect that there may be some intraspecific variation in there as well. In order to see if
this is the case, the authors should provide tooth counts for all specimens that they CT scanned (3
embryos, 2 juveniles, and 3 adults). With only one specimen per ontogenetic stage it is hard to
discriminate between what is actually ontogenetic change and what is simply random
intraspecific variation. The same holds for the tooth counts in dentaries and maxillae. Moreover,
the authors should also provide the counts for left and right counterparts of each bone, in case the
numbers are different.
Page 9, lines 31-35: “The braincase undergoes a general dorsoventral flattening throughout
ontogeny, from an initially globular appearance in the embryo to a dorsoventrally compressed
and anteroposteriorly elongated form in the adult (Fig. 3A-C).”
The compression of the braincase in the adult is mostly anterior, the posterior half is as deep in
the adult as it is in the juvenile (the length/max-depth ratio of the skull is about 2.1 in both).
Please be more precise in your description.
Page 9, line 42: insert “posterior to” before “lateral aperture” (the jugular foramen is not
posteroventral to the lateral aperture, it is posterior to it).
5
Page 10, line 19: “The jugular foramen also develops internal struts that subdivides it into three
openings internally”.
“Subdivide” (not “subdivides”, the word “struts” is plural), and you could mention which nerves
go through those foramina, they are well known in the snake literature.
Page 10, line 36: “stapedial footplate and LARST exposed in lateral view (Fig. 5A-C).”
No stapedial footplate is shown in figure 5, you could add a reference to figure 3 to illustrate your
point.
Page 10, lines 42-47: “The nuchal crest that runs anteromedial-posterolateral above the fenestra
ovalis is minimally developed in the embryo, resulting in a globular process above each fenestra
ovalis”.
Please add a figure reference and label the nuchal crest in it for those people unfamiliar with the
term.
Page 10, line 49: I would replace “this process” with “it”.
Page 11, line 6: Delete “Similarly” (there is no similitude here).
Page 11, line 36: “a narrowing of the large ventral notch of the supraoccipital”. Between the otic
capsules? If so, please specify, it is unclear which notch the authors are referring to.
Page 11, lines 40-42: “Internally, the supraoccipital undergoes a general elaboration of internal
crests and subdivisions.” This sounds extremely vague and superficial. What kind of elaboration?
Which crests? Which subdivisions? Please be precise in your description or remove this sentence.
Page 11, line 52: “contact with the prootic is stronger than in the juvenile but
still not complete.”
Do the authors mean: still not complete internally? Externally it looks complete in the figures.
Page 12, line 3: insert “dorsally” after “concave”.
Page 12, line 12 and following: What is the point of segmenting all the individual bones if then
internal anatomical details like these are not properly figured and labeled? I would recommend
adding some additional figures, if not to the main text at least as supplementary information.
Page 12, line 22: insert “complex” after “dorsalis” (the cid is a muscle complex, not a single
muscle). Moreover, a better reference for the meaning of cid would be:
Rieppel, O. (1979). The evolution of the basicranium in the Henophidia (Reptilia: Serpentes).
Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 66(4), 411-431.
The Rieppel (1979) paper the authors are referencing is on scolecophidians, and while it mentions
the cid, it does not explain its meaning.
Page 12, line 35: “parabasisphenoid” instead of “basisphenoid”.
Page 12, line 35 and following: “The junction between the parasphenoid process and the body of
the basisphenoid also becomes elaborated, with minor lateral projections in the embryo and
juvenile becoming enlarged into prominent triangular projections in the adult. These projections
contribute to an increase in sutural contact with the anteroventral parietal.”
All these details are not visible because hidden by the lower jaws (see also comment above on
Page 9, line 22).
6
Page 12, line 52: “parabasisphenoid” instead of “basisphenoid”.
Page 13, line 10: delete “dorsal and” (there are no muscle crests on the dorsal surface of these
bones).
Page 13, line 19: “a slight dorsal longitudinal crest on the juvenile occipital condyle is extended
into a prominent crest running from the centre to the posterior margin of the dorsal
basioccipital.” I don’t quite understand what the authors are describing here, and there is no
figure to illustrate this feature. A prominent dorsal longitudinal crest running along the dorsal
surface of a snake basioccipital would be a very unusual, if not unique, feature. If this feature is
real it should be figured.
Page 13, line 33: “ dorsal cephalic condyle”, because there is no “ventral cephalic condyle” the
word “dorsal” is redundant, please remove.
Page 13, line 52: same as above, there is no “dorsal mandibular condyle”, so the word “ventral” is
redundant and can be removed.
Page 13, line 49: “The quadrate also undergoes a progressive deepening of its ventral mandibular
condyle”. What do the authors mean by “progressive deepening”? it’s not clear, a dorsoventral
expansion is not apparent form the figures, perhaps a mediolateral expansion?
Page 15, line 6 and following: Here the authors again describe features that are not illustrated.
This could be easily remedied by rendering the lower jaws separately in lateral and medial views.
Page 15, line 31: “The dentary bears 18 teeth in the embryo, 18 teeth in the juvenile, and 28 teeth
in the adult.”
These tooth counts cannot be correct. I can count at least 25 tooth positions in the juvenile
illustrated in fig. 3. The authors should count tooth positions, not just fully erupted teeth that are
ankylosed to the margin of the dentary. As far as I know, tooth counts on the marginal tooth-
bearing elements are very conservative in snake species and across ontogeny, I would be really
surprised if Thamnophis would show such differences in tooth counts.
Page 15, line 52: “The maxilla bears 16 teeth in the embryo and 18 teeth in the juvenile and adult.”
Same problem as above. I can count at least 23 tooth positions in the embryo and a similar
number in the juvenile. Please check these numbers again.
Page 16, lines 8-15. Angular and splenial are not figured nor labeled anywhere. Again, the
manuscript would be much improved if the lower jaws were rendered separately, so that the
ventral aspect of the skull was not obscured, and all elements of the lower jaws could be properly
illustrated.
Page 16, lines 19-26: aren’t these statolithic masses present in the adults as well? I would be
surprised if this was not the case.
Page 17, line 8: “pterygoid and dentary tooth rows, which increase from 18 to 28 and from 22 to
26 teeth, respectively”.
Based on the likely erroneous tooth counts provided by the authors for dentary and maxilla, I
would suggest to check these numbers again.
Page 17, line 47: “the quadrate, though also elongated, remains upright.”
This is inaccurate. In some booids, such as Calabaria, the quadrate is not elongated and remains
7
upright; however, when the quadrate is elongated in the adult, then it does not remain upright; in
fact, a longer quadrate becomes tilted sideways, so that the condyles are approximately in the
same vertical transverse plane, but are not aligned vertically one above the other (i.e. the condyles
appear to be one above the other only in lateral view). Obviously, a longer quadrate has to be
displaced either laterally or posteriorly, or it will create a gap between upper and lower jaws.
Page 18, line 6: I am not sure why the authors think that is the “typical” caenophidian mode.
There has been no systematic survey of jaw attachment modes in snakes as far as I am aware, and
the references listed here only examined a limited number of species.
Page 19, line 3: “the suspension of the lower jaw shifts from a prootic-supratemporal articulation
of the quadrate to a supratemporal-only articulation (Fig. 3 and 6).”
If accurate, this is a very interesting observation. A contact between quadrate and otic capsule is
thought to be absent in snake embryos (see for example Kamal and Hammouda (1965:291), who
studied the colubroid Psammophis: “It is of importance to notice that the quadrate during
ontogeny is quite apart from the neurocranium and bears no connection with the auditory
capsule. This is correlated with the absence of the otic process and the subsequent loss of the
crista parotica commonly present in Lacertilia. Only in the fully formed chondrocranium, after
the quadrate has reached its definitive position, its dorso-medial margin is attached to the hind
end of the auditory capsule by the supratemporal (tabular) bone.”
Kamal, A. M., & Hammouda, H. G. (1965). The development of the skull of Psammophis sibilans.
II. The fully formed chondrocranium. Journal of Morphology, 116(2), 247-295.
Because of this, some readers may question the authors’ observation. The fact that the quadrate
overlaps the prootic in lateral view doesn’t mean that they are in contact, let alone in articulation.
Furthermore, in Fig. 6 the tilted perspective seems to suggest that the quadrate is only in
articulation with the supratemporal in all three developmental stages, and has no contact with
the prootic (but could be an artifact of perspective). And finally, if an articulation between
quadrate and prootic was present, then one may expect an articulatory facet on the prootic in fig.
5, but such facet is not apparent. I would suggest the authors to provide as supplementary data
3D surface files (in ply or stl format) of all three embryos that have been CT-scanned, in order to
unequivocally show that an articulation between quadrate and prootic is indeed consistently
present.
Page 19, lines 6-17: Here the authors speculate about the fact that the quadrate in earlier stages of
embryonic Thamnophis is likely in articulation with the braincase. As I mentioned above, this
goes against what observed by Kamal and Hammouda (1956), and should therefore be discussed
in more detail, pointing out the contradiction with that study.
Page 19, line 29: remove “though there are exceptions” (redundant, you already said “in almost
all”).
Page 19, line 33: “The data present in the T. radix embryos and juveniles reveal
that the suspensorium of scolecophidians can be interpreted as heterchronic.”
I recommend inserting the sentence: “, if representative of the plesiomorphic embryonic snake
condition,” just after “juveniles”. Paedomorphosis is inferred after observing plesiomorphic
juvenile features in adults, thus adult scolecophidians can be considered paedomorphs only if the
plesiomorphic embryonic condition for snakes matches what described in Thamnophis rather
than what described in other snakes (such as Psammophis, the snake described by Kamal and
Hammouda [1965]).
Page 19, line 47: replace “juvenile” with “early embryonic”. Such anterior orientation in snakes is
8
only visible in developmental stages occurring before those investigated here by the authors; see
Kamal & Hammouda (1965) and Boughner et al. (2007).
Boughner, J. C., Buchtová, M., Fu, K., Diewert, V., Hallgrímsson, B., & Richman, J. M. (2007).

morphogenesis of the head and limbs. Zoology, 110(3), 212-230.
Page 21, line 10: remove “thus” (“thus” implies that the following sentence is the only possible
consequence of what is stated before, but in fact the authors later present another scenario where
T. radix is still within colubroidea but is not necessarily the only colubroid without a CCF).
Page 21, line 10 and following: “Given that the CCF is absent throughout the embryonic and
juvenile forms (Fig. 5), the continued absence of this feature in the adult snake is the result of
paedomorphosis, i.e., retention of an embryonic or
juvenile feature in an adult individual.”
This is a misinterpretation of the concept of paedomorphosis. Paedomorphosis is not inferred by
the retention of a feature from juvenile to adult, but by the retention in an adult of what is
generally assumed to be a juvenile ancestral feature (i.e. the plesiomorphic juvenile condition). In
order to say that the absence of a CCF is a juvenile feature, the authors should first show that (at
least closely related) juvenile snakes typically lack it (not just Thamnophis). This would identify
the plesiomorphic condition (ideally with support from a phylogeny). Then, and only then, they
could argue that the absence of a CCF in adult Thamnophis is a paedomorphic feature. Otherwise
anything could be a paedomorphic feature, even the presence of two eyes.
To quote from McNamara (1986:5):
“If a descendant passes through fewer stages of ontogenetic development than its ancestor, the
descendant adult form will have morphological characteristics which occurred in juveniles of the
ancestor. This phenomenon has been termed paedomorphosis.”
Or using Klingenberg’s (1998:83) words:
“The morphological outcomes of changes in rates and timing of development are
paedomorphosis or peramorphosis; they are identified by comparisons
of ancestors and descendants in relation to the ancestral ontogeny. A descendant is
paedomorphic if its later ontogenetic stages retain characteristics from
earlier stages of an ancestor”.
In summary, paedomorphosis requires a phylogenetic context, and the ontogenetic trajectory of
an individual species is not sufficient to come to any conclusion regarding heterochrony.

60(1), 4-13.

ontogeny. Biological Reviews, 73(1), 79-123.
Page 22, line 19: “A well-studied example of absence of the CCF occurs in Acrochordus, the sister
group to the Colubroidea (Fig. 7).”
This is the first reference to figure 7, where a summary of the distribution of the CCF and type of
macrostomy is presented. However, the authors do not tell anywhere where they have obtained
their data. Their material and methods section does not list representatives of all these families
and subfamilies of snakes, and to my knowledge there is no published study containing an
exhaustive sample of all these taxa and covering their type of jaw suspension. It seems that the
authors here are trying to overgeneralize statements presented in the literature, extending
9
observations that were made on some specific booids and colubroids to the whole snake clade,
with specifics that go down to each family and subfamily where no data currently exist.
The authors referenced a study (their ref. 6) that provided descriptions of the types of
macrostomy present in some booids and some colubroids. However, fig. 7 in this manuscript
seems to extrapolate the data presented in that work to ALL booids and ALL colubroids,
specifying even the condition for every subfamily, but without providing any sources for this
additional information. A few examples:
1) How do the authors know that all Dipsadinae show type B macrostomy? Did they personally
observe representatives of all species from the subfamily Dipsadinae? If so, why there is no
mention of that in their material and methods?
2) The authors themselves seem to recognize the possibility that type C macrostomy may be more
widespread than currently known, making the evolution of the macrostomatan condition more
complex than previously anticipated (page 25, lines 6-12), and yet they provide a misleading
figure where this is not the case, and type C macrostomy is limited to only two exceptions in a
deceivingly very informative image (see also the comment on the caption for Fig. 6).
In conclusion, unless the authors really posses data on the type of suspensorium for all snakes, I
would recommend them to remove such level of detail from the figure, which is highly
misleading about what we actually know about the distribution of types of macrostomy within
specific snake lineages. The authors should simplify this figure and make it very clear that it only
represents a summary of their personal hypothesis of the distribution of these traits within
snakes. They should be more straightforward about what represents actual data and what is only
assumed to happen in the various lineages.
Page 22, line 33 and following: “However, this basal placement of Acrochordus based on CCF
morphology was later rejected, due largely to the strong phylogenetic evidence placing
Acrochordus at a far more derived position as the sister to Colubroidea [33]; again, this rejection
parallels our rejection of scenario one in Thamnophis. This later analysis re-characterized the
absence of the CCF as a paedomorphic feature, making Acrochordus unique among snakes in
retaining this embryonic state – similar to our scenario two – though lacked ontogenetic data
supporting this conclusion [33].”
To be honest, Rieppel 1980 (ref. 33 herein) did not discuss the CCF of Acrochordus, but the
undivided fissura metotica of this taxon (there is no mention of the CCF at all in that paper). In
fact, the basal placement of Acrochordus by McDowell (1979) and others was mostly based on its
undivided fissura metotica (a well documented embryonic feature within squamata), and only
partially on its lack of a CCF (which according to some is still present in this snake but in
rudimentary form, see authors’ ref. 27).
Page 23, line 26: “From our data, the persistent absence of the CCF throughout all three
ontogenetic stages unequivocally demonstrates this condition in Thamnophis to be a case of
paedomorphosis.”
As I pointed out above (comment on page 21, line 10), this is an incorrect statement based on a
misinterpretation of what paedomorphosis is and how it is detected. Absence of a feature in all
developmental stages of the same given species does not provide evidence of paedomorphosis.
The authors need to identify the plesiomorphic embryonic/juvenile snake condition via a
comparison with other embryonic/juvenile snakes.
Page 23, line 43: replace “the adult condition matches the embryonic condition” with “the adult
condition matches the plesiomorphic snake embryonic condition”.
Page 25, line 3: insert “main” after “two” (exceptions have already been noted in the literature,
and have also been mentioned in this manuscript).
10
Page 25, line 8: insert a reference after Homalopsis (this taxon was not the object of this study).
Page 25, line 12: “Our observations of suspensorium development in T. radix also provide novel
evidence for paedomorphosis in the evolution and ontogeny of the scolecophidian skull.”
The condition observed in Thamnophis does not provide any evidence for paedomorphosis in
scolecophidians, unless it is shown to represent the general (plesiomorphic) embryonic snake
condition. What it does is open the possibility to new interpretations on how the scolecophidian
skull may have come to be if the contact between quadrate and prootic indeed turns out to be a
plesiomorphic embryonic snake trait (i.e. pending further data).
Page 25, line 27 and following: “Furthermore, the absence of a crista circumfenestralis in T. radix
[…] provides evidence for paedomorphosis in the evolution of this trait.”
As discussed above, the absence of a crista circumfenestralis in embryonic and adult Thamnophis
does not demonstrate that paedomorphosis is the cause of this absence in the latter. Thamnophis
alone does not tell us anything about which evolutionary developmental process is responsible
for the absence of the CCF in adult snakes. The authors first need to verify that absence of a CCF
is a plesiomorphic condition in embryonic or juvenile snakes, if that is the case, then they can
conclude that its absence in adult Thamnophis can be interpreted as paedomorphic.
Page 33, line 6: as discussed above, in booids the quadrate does not always remain upright (see
comment on page page 17, line 47)
Reference 25 is likely Kamal (1969) (and not 19696).
Table 1:
Frontal & Adult: Completely sutured with frontal (not “completely fused along frontal suture”).
Parietal & Embryo: “Almost entirely unfused along sagittal suture.” There is no sagittal suture to
speak of, only an unossified central region of the parietal.
Parietal & Juvenile: parietal roof ossified (not “sutured”).
Dentary & Embryo/Juvenile/Adult: To my knowledge, tooth counts on marginal dentigerous
elements (dentary and maxilla) are very conservative in snakes within a given species and
throughout ontogeny. Please recheck tooth positions, and make sure you don't simply count
visible teeth, but tooth positions. Tooth counts from multiple specimens (and from both sides of
the skull) would be welcome to make sure that there is no intraspecific variability added to what
may vary ontogenetically.
Figure 6: I wonder if showing the angle between quadrate and compound in a tilted perspective
of the skull is appropriate (the angles appear smaller than they actually are). I think that showing
these angles in lateral view would be much more effective. The figure caption contains a sentence
that I find misleading: “this pathway of development is unique to T. radix and one other,
unrelated genus within the Caenophidia, indicating independent evolution of this pattern”. The
sentence assumes that only Thamnophis and another caenophidian have a type C macrostomy
(see fig. 7), while in fact those are simply the only two snakes where presence of this type of jaw
suspension has been noted so far in the literature. There has been no systematic review of jaw
suspension in all snakes, therefore making such generalizations is unjustified. The authors should
rephrase by writing that “this pathway of development has so far been observed only in …” (do
not write that it is unique to two species, we simply do not know that).

label_comment_2
This is a well-written paper and was a pleasure to read! I rarely review manuscripts that do not
require many grammatical and stylistic changes, so, thank you.
Here are my comments:
Materials and Methods section: Briefly explain why you only scanned 8 specimens of this widely
available species (cost, local availability?). Were the two juveniles from the same mother or were
they unrelated? It is not fatal to your conclusions if the juveniles are related, but it would be good
to mention.
You scanned the heads of alcohol preserved specimens, not skulls, so please explain briefly that
you digitally removed soft tissues and rendered the skulls for analysis.
Results section 3.1 (page 6, line 15): I think that the premaxillary notch is seen better in the ventral
view and you should refer to Fig. 4, not Fig. 3.
Results section 3.5. (page 10, lines 29ff): It would be good to add an illustration of the crista
circumfenestralis in a different colubrid to allow direct comparison with your specimens. If that's
impossible, insert a citation where the reader could find such an illustration.
Discussion section 4.1 (bottom of page 16): Briefly mention diets of juveniles vs adult T. radix.
Since you are talking about ontogentic shifts in diet and gape, prey type is important.
Discussion section 4.3 (page 22): Explain why you didn't examine other Thamnophis to see
presence or absence of CCF. This is one of the big points of your paper, you should tell the reader
why you didn't check other species. Thamnophis are readily available in collections.
Table: Define LARST in table heading or inside table. In the row about the frontal, column 3
(adult), it should read "Complete contact with parietal", not with frontal.

These are all the suggestions I have. I'm looking forward to seeing this in print.

Comments to the Author(s)
Strong et al. present a nice overview of the ontogenetic development of the skull in a modern
colubrid snake, Thamnophis sirtalis. I found it intriguing that despite the fact that this is a very
well known snake species so much can still be found when closely observing its bones and their
development. Things like the contact between quadrate and prootic in the snake embryo and the
lack of a crista circumfenestralis in the adult are certainly novel reports and are worth publishing.
Having said this, I also found several issues with this manuscript, which preclude publication in
its current state.
Here is a summary of the major points:
1) Some of the terminology used is inadequate, like use of terms such as “orbitosphenoidal plate”
or “incisive process”.
2) There is confusion between fusion of elements and simple sutures.
3) The manuscript would be greatly improved if the lower jaws were rendered separately in
lateral and medial view. This way the authors could properly illustrate all the elements they
describe, including angular and splenial, and would not have the lower jaws obscuring most of
the anatomy of the skull in ventral view (e.g. palatines, parabasisphenoid, and basioccipital
cannot be adequately seen because of this). Moreover, the authors took the time to segment all the
individual skull bones from the three developmental stages, but then simply figure the whole
skulls without showing the internal details of any of the elements. If the authors only wanted to
provide colorized versions of the skulls, then Adobe Photoshop could have provided the very
same results in a fraction of the time. I suggest that the authors take advantage of the fact that
they have digitally segmented individual elements in 3D and provide rendered images to
illustrate internal anatomical details that at present are discussed but not figured anywhere (at
least as supplementary figures).
4) I noticed an issue with tooth counts. The authors appear to have counted only those teeth that
are actually present and ankylosed to the dentigerous elements, when instead they should have
provided counts of tooth positions. This resulted in very inconsistent tooth counts (i.e. very low
numbers in the juvenile compared to the adult), when in fact the numbers of tooth positions are
expected to be very close, if not identical (at least for dentaries and maxillae). Moreover, tooth
counts could be affected by intraspecific variability (to a small extent), but the authors provide
counts for only 3 of their eight specimens. This way it s not possible to tell whether different tooth
15
counts could be caused by simple random intraspecific variation rather than by ontogenetic
change.
5) There is confusion revolving around the concept of paedomorphosis and on how it is detected.
The authors assume that if a trait is retained from an embryonic or juvenile stage into the adult
stage of a given species then the adult of that species is paedomorphic. This is incorrect. See
details below (e.g. Page 21, line 10). This misconception affects their interpretation of the lack of a
CCF in Thamnophis as a plesiomorphic feature, and also their interpretation of the
scolecophidian skull as the result of paedomorphosis. Because the authors cannot demonstrate
that the lack of a CCF or the contact between quadrate and prootic are plesiomorphic
embryonic/juvenile traits in snakes, then they cannot reach the conclusion that Thamnophis and
scolecophidians are paedomorphic for these traits. The authors can only raise the possibility (i.e.
formulate a hypothesis that requires further data to be supported).
6) Figure 7 is quite a problematic figure. It deceivingly suggests that the authors have way more
information on the distribution of the various modes of jaw suspension than they actually have. I
have extensively discussed the issues relating to this figure in one of my comments below.
Below I provide detailed comments on all major and minor issues as they present themselves in
the manuscript:
Page 1, line 53: than in most other (insert “most).
Page 2, line 17: replace “many” with “some” (there aren’t really that many studies).
Page 6, line 6: “increased integration of the premaxilla with the rest of the snout”. I would argue
that this is not true. The images show that the premaxilla is very loosely connected to the rest of
the snout in all three specimens/stages, and the only contact is between premaxilla and anterior
tip of the septomaxilla.
Page 6, line 6: the authors mistakenly use the term “incisive process” to refer to the premaxillary
process of the vomer (the “incisive process” is a process on the ventral side of the premaxilla of
some squamates other than snakes). Please replace “incisive process” with “premaxillary
process” here and in any following instance (lines 17, 26).
Page 6, line 13: “posterior premaxillary notch which will eventually accommodate the
septomaxilla and vomer”.
The notch does not accommodate any part of those bones.
Page 6, line 22: “premaxilla’s nasal process expands both dorsoventrally and anteroposteriorly”.
I believe this is incorrect, it expands mediolaterally and anteroposteriorly. It is quite clear that the
relative height of the nasal process remains the same if compared to septomaxilla, nasal, and
prefrontal.
Page 6, lines 24-31: “Extension of the anterior processes of the septomaxilla and incisive processes
of the vomer relative to the rest of these bones creates stronger contact – and thus improved
integration – between the premaxilla and the rest of the snout (Fig. 3C).”
This is incorrect, see previous comment on line 6.
Page 6, lines 35-36: “the dorsal laminae are only present as a cluster of unfused ossifications”.
This is inaccurate, there is no cluster of unfused ossifications, which seems to imply the presence
of multiple centers of ossification, but only a weakly ossified surface that when rendered digitally
appears full of holes, most likely as a rendering artifact.
16
Page 6, lines 38-39: “dorsal laminae distinctly present and fused to the vertical
laminae”.
This is inaccurate. The dorsal laminae are not individual elements separate from the vertical
laminae, they are part of the same element (the nasal), which is in the process of being
mineralised. It follows that there can be no fusion between parts of the same element.
Page 7, line 13: sutured (not “fused”). The frontals never fuse in snakes.
Page 7, line 22: The frontals are not completely sutured to each other (don’t write “fuse”).
Page 7, line 24: please remove “at which point a deep sagittal sulcus is present.” (that is not a
“sulcus”, is the suture between the bones).
Page 7, line 33: I would suggest using the term “optic fenestra” (not “foramen”, foramina are
small round holes, fenestrae are large gaps, not necessarily round).
Page 7, line 36: Please replace the term “orbitosphenoidal plate” with “descending flange of the
frontal”. The only literature reference I could find where the term “orbitosphenoid plate” was
used in the description of a snake skull dates back to 1831 (and also refers to something different).
Please replace “orbitosphenoidal plate” with “descending flange of the frontal” also in the
following instances (same page lines 40, 52; and page 8, lines 3, 8).
Page 7, line 43: parabasisphenoid (not “basisphenoid”; the bone referred to results from fusion of
parasphenoid and basisphenoid). Please replace “basisphenoid” with “parabasisphenoid” also in
the following instances.
Page 8, line 8: emargination (not “notch”).
Page 8, line 19: Add “(Fig. 1)” after “juvenile stages”.
Page 9, line 6: replace “expanded” with “bent” or “recurved”.
Page 9, line 22: “The palatine tooth row bears 15 teeth in the embryo, 14 teeth in the juvenile, and
16 teeth in the adult”.
The palatines are hidden by the lower jaws, so it is impossible to verify the tooth counts from the
figures provided. In fact, the lower jaws hide a great deal of the ventral anatomy of the skulls; it
would be better to have them rendered separately next to the skulls, this way the authors could
also illustrate the medial view of the lower jaws, which at present is not shown.
Based on what argued below for the tooth counts on dentaries and maxillae (Page 15, lines 31 &
52), I would suggest the authors to double-check these counts as well, in order to make sure that
they actually provide counts of tooth positions and not just of preserved teeth.
Finally, the numbers presented here, if correct, do not appear to follow an ontogenetic trend (15-
14-16). I suspect that there may be some intraspecific variation in there as well. In order to see if
this is the case, the authors should provide tooth counts for all specimens that they CT scanned (3
embryos, 2 juveniles, and 3 adults). With only one specimen per ontogenetic stage it is hard to
discriminate between what is actually ontogenetic change and what is simply random
intraspecific variation. The same holds for the tooth counts in dentaries and maxillae. Moreover,
the authors should also provide the counts for left and right counterparts of each bone, in case the
numbers are different.
Page 9, lines 31-35: “The braincase undergoes a general dorsoventral flattening throughout
17
ontogeny, from an initially globular appearance in the embryo to a dorsoventrally compressed
and anteroposteriorly elongated form in the adult (Fig. 3A-C).”
The compression of the braincase in the adult is mostly anterior, the posterior half is as deep in
the adult as it is in the juvenile (the length/max-depth ratio of the skull is about 2.1 in both).
Please be more precise in your description.
Page 9, line 42: insert “posterior to” before “lateral aperture” (the jugular foramen is not
posteroventral to the lateral aperture, it is posterior to it).
Page 10, line 19: “The jugular foramen also develops internal struts that subdivides it into three
openings internally”.
“Subdivide” (not “subdivides”, the word “struts” is plural), and you could mention which nerves
go through those foramina, they are well known in the snake literature.
Page 10, line 36: “stapedial footplate and LARST exposed in lateral view (Fig. 5A-C).”
No stapedial footplate is shown in figure 5, you could add a reference to figure 3 to illustrate your
point.
Page 10, lines 42-47: “The nuchal crest that runs anteromedial-posterolateral
above the fenestra ovalis is minimally developed in the embryo, resulting in a
globular process above each fenestra ovalis”.
Please add a figure reference and label the nuchal crest in it for those people unfamiliar with the
term.
Page 10, line 49: I would replace “this process” with “it”.
Page 11, line 6: Delete “Similarly” (there is no similitude here).
Page 11, line 36: “a narrowing of the large ventral notch of the supraoccipital”. Between the otic
capsules? If so, please specify, it is unclear which notch the authors are referring to.
Page 11, lines 40-42: “Internally, the supraoccipital undergoes a general elaboration of internal
crests and subdivisions.” This sounds extremely vague and superficial. What kind of elaboration?
Which crests? Which subdivisions? Please be precise in your description or remove this sentence.
Page 11, line 52: “contact with the prootic is stronger than in the juvenile but
still not complete.”
Do the authors mean: still not complete internally? Externally it looks complete in the figures.
Page 12, line 3: insert “dorsally” after “concave”.
Page 12, line 12 and following: What is the point of segmenting all the individual bones if then
internal anatomical details like these are not properly figured and labeled? I would recommend
adding some additional figures, if not to the main text at least as supplementary information.
Page 12, line 22: insert “complex” after “dorsalis” (the cid is a muscle complex, not a single
muscle). Moreover, a better reference for the meaning of cid would be:
Rieppel, O. (1979). The evolution of the basicranium in the Henophidia (Reptilia: Serpentes).
Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 66(4), 411-431.
The Rieppel (1979) paper the authors are referencing is on scolecophidians, and while it mentions
the cid, it does not explain its meaning.
18
Page 12, line 35: “parabasisphenoid” instead of “basisphenoid”.
Page 12, line 35 and following: “The junction between the parasphenoid process and the body of
the basisphenoid also becomes elaborated, with minor lateral projections in the embryo and
juvenile becoming enlarged into prominent triangular projections in the adult. These projections
contribute to an increase in sutural contact with the anteroventral parietal.”
All these details are not visible because hidden by the lower jaws (see also comment above on
Page 9, line 22).
Page 12, line 52: “parabasisphenoid” instead of “basisphenoid”.
Page 13, line 10: delete “dorsal and” (there are no muscle crests on the dorsal surface of these
bones).
Page 13, line 19: “a slight dorsal longitudinal crest on the juvenile occipital condyle is extended
into a prominent crest running from the centre to the posterior margin of the dorsal
basioccipital.” I don’t quite understand what the authors are describing here, and there is no
figure to illustrate this feature. A prominent dorsal longitudinal crest running along the dorsal
surface of a snake basioccipital would be a very unusual, if not unique, feature. If this feature is
real it should be figured.
Page 13, line 33: “ dorsal cephalic condyle”, because there is no “ventral cephalic condyle” the
word “dorsal” is redundant, please remove.
Page 13, line 52: same as above, there is no “dorsal mandibular condyle”, so the word “ventral” is
redundant and can be removed.
Page 13, line 49: “The quadrate also undergoes a progressive deepening of its ventral mandibular
condyle”. What do the authors mean by “progressive deepening”? it’s not clear, a dorsoventral
expansion is not apparent form the figures, perhaps a mediolateral expansion?
Page 15, line 6 and following: Here the authors again describe features that are not illustrated.
This could be easily remedied by rendering the lower jaws separately in lateral and medial views.
Page 15, line 31: “The dentary bears 18 teeth in the embryo, 18 teeth in the juvenile, and 28 teeth
in the adult.”
These tooth counts cannot be correct. I can count at least 25 tooth positions in the juvenile
illustrated in fig. 3. The authors should count tooth positions, not just fully erupted teeth that are
ankylosed to the margin of the dentary. As far as I know, tooth counts on the marginal tooth-
bearing elements are very conservative in snake species and across ontogeny, I would be really
surprised if Thamnophis would show such differences in tooth counts.
Page 15, line 52: “The maxilla bears 16 teeth in the embryo and 18 teeth in the juvenile and adult.”
Same problem as above. I can count at least 23 tooth positions in the embryo and a similar
number in the juvenile. Please check these numbers again.
Page 16, lines 8-15. Angular and splenial are not figured nor labeled anywhere. Again, the
manuscript would be much improved if the lower jaws were rendered separately, so that the
ventral aspect of the skull was not obscured, and all elements of the lower jaws could be properly
illustrated.
19
Page 16, lines 19-26: aren’t these statolithic masses present in the adults as well? I would be
surprised if this was not the case.
Page 17, line 8: “pterygoid and dentary tooth rows, which increase from 18 to 28 and from 22 to
26 teeth, respectively”.
Based on the likely erroneous tooth counts provided by the authors for dentary and maxilla, I
would suggest to check these numbers again.
Page 17, line 47: “the quadrate, though also elongated, remains upright.”
This is inaccurate. In some booids, such as Calabaria, the quadrate is not elongated and remains
upright; however, when the quadrate is elongated in the adult, then it does not remain upright; in
fact, a longer quadrate becomes tilted sideways, so that the condyles are approximately in the
same vertical transverse plane, but are not aligned vertically one above the other (i.e. the condyles
appear to be one above the other only in lateral view). Obviously, a longer quadrate has to be
displaced either laterally or posteriorly, or it will create a gap between upper and lower jaws.
Page 18, line 6: I am not sure why the authors think that is the “typical” caenophidian mode.
There has been no systematic survey of jaw attachment modes in snakes as far as I am aware, and
the references listed here only examined a limited number of species.
Page 19, line 3: “the suspension of the lower jaw shifts from a prootic-supratemporal articulation
of the quadrate to a supratemporal-only articulation (Fig. 3 and 6).”
If accurate, this is a very interesting observation. A contact between quadrate and otic capsule is
thought to be absent in snake embryos (see for example Kamal and Hammouda (1965:291), who
studied the colubroid Psammophis: “It is of importance to notice that the quadrate during
ontogeny is quite apart from the neurocranium and bears no connection with the auditory
capsule. This is correlated with the absence of the otic process and the subsequent loss of the
crista parotica commonly present in Lacertilia. Only in the fully formed chondrocranium, after
the quadrate has reached its definitive position, its dorso-medial margin is attached to the hind
end of the auditory capsule by the supratemporal (tabular) bone.”
Kamal, A. M., & Hammouda, H. G. (1965). The development of the skull of Psammophis sibilans.
II. The fully formed chondrocranium. Journal of Morphology, 116(2), 247-295.
Because of this, some readers may question the authors’ observation. The fact that the quadrate
overlaps the prootic in lateral view doesn’t mean that they are in contact, let alone in articulation.
Furthermore, in Fig. 6 the tilted perspective seems to suggest that the quadrate is only in
articulation with the supratemporal in all three developmental stages, and has no contact with
the prootic (but could be an artifact of perspective). And finally, if an articulation between
quadrate and prootic was present, then one may expect an articulatory facet on the prootic in fig.
5, but such facet is not apparent. I would suggest the authors to provide as supplementary data
3D surface files (in ply or stl format) of all three embryos that have been CT-scanned, in order to
unequivocally show that an articulation between quadrate and prootic is indeed consistently
present.
Page 19, lines 6-17: Here the authors speculate about the fact that the quadrate in earlier stages of
embryonic Thamnophis is likely in articulation with the braincase. As I mentioned above, this
goes against what observed by Kamal and Hammouda (1956), and should therefore be discussed
in more detail, pointing out the contradiction with that study.
Page 19, line 29: remove “though there are exceptions” (redundant, you already said “in almost
all”).
20
Page 19, line 33: “The data present in the T. radix embryos and juveniles reveal
that the suspensorium of scolecophidians can be interpreted as heterchronic.”
I recommend inserting the sentence: “, if representative of the plesiomorphic embryonic snake
condition,” just after “juveniles”. Paedomorphosis is inferred after observing plesiomorphic
juvenile features in adults, thus adult scolecophidians can be considered paedomorphs only if the
plesiomorphic embryonic condition for snakes matches what described in Thamnophis rather
than what described in other snakes (such as Psammophis, the snake described by Kamal and
Hammouda [1965]).
Page 19, line 47: replace “juvenile” with “early embryonic”. Such anterior orientation in snakes is
only visible in developmental stages occurring before those investigated here by the authors; see
Kamal & Hammouda (1965) and Boughner et al. (2007).
Boughner, J. C., Buchtová, M., Fu, K., Diewert, V., Hallgrímsson, B., & Richman, J. M. (2007).
Embryonic development of Python sebae–I: Staging criteria and macroscopic skeletal
morphogenesis of the head and limbs. Zoology, 110(3), 212-230.
Page 21, line 10: remove “thus” (“thus” implies that the following sentence is the only possible
consequence of what is stated before, but in fact the authors later present another scenario where
T. radix is still within colubroidea but is not necessarily the only colubroid without a CCF).
Page 21, line 10 and following: “Given that the CCF is absent throughout the embryonic and
juvenile forms (Fig. 5), the continued absence of this feature in the adult snake is the result of
paedomorphosis, i.e., retention of an embryonic or
juvenile feature in an adult individual.”
This is a misinterpretation of the concept of paedomorphosis. Paedomorphosis is not inferred by
the retention of a feature from juvenile to adult, but by the retention in an adult of what is
generally assumed to be a juvenile ancestral feature (i.e. the plesiomorphic juvenile condition). In
order to say that the absence of a CCF is a juvenile feature, the authors should first show that (at
least closely related) juvenile snakes typically lack it (not just Thamnophis). This would identify
the plesiomorphic condition (ideally with support from a phylogeny). Then, and only then, they
could argue that the absence of a CCF in adult Thamnophis is a paedomorphic feature. Otherwise
anything could be a paedomorphic feature, even the presence of two eyes.
To quote from McNamara (1986:5):
“If a descendant passes through fewer stages of ontogenetic development than its ancestor, the
descendant adult form will have morphological characteristics which occurred in juveniles of the
ancestor. This phenomenon has been termed paedomorphosis.”
Or using Klingenberg’s (1998:83) words:
“The morphological outcomes of changes in rates and timing of development are
paedomorphosis or peramorphosis; they are identified by comparisons
of ancestors and descendants in relation to the ancestral ontogeny. A descendant is
paedomorphic if its later ontogenetic stages retain characteristics from
earlier stages of an ancestor”.
In summary, paedomorphosis requires a phylogenetic context, and the ontogenetic trajectory of
an individual species is not sufficient to come to any conclusion regarding heterochrony.

Page 22, line 19: “A well-studied example of absence of the CCF occurs in Acrochordus, the sister
group to the Colubroidea (Fig. 7).”
This is the first reference to figure 7, where a summary of the distribution of the CCF and type of
macrostomy is presented. However, the authors do not tell anywhere where they have obtained
their data. Their material and methods section does not list representatives of all these families
and subfamilies of snakes, and to my knowledge there is no published study containing an
exhaustive sample of all these taxa and covering their type of jaw suspension. It seems that the
authors here are trying to overgeneralize statements presented in the literature, extending
observations that were made on some specific booids and colubroids to the whole snake clade,
with specifics that go down to each family and subfamily where no data currently exist.
The authors referenced a study (their ref. 6) that provided descriptions of the types of
macrostomy present in some booids and some colubroids. However, fig. 7 in this manuscript
seems to extrapolate the data presented in that work to ALL booids and ALL colubroids,
specifying even the condition for every subfamily, but without providing any sources for this
additional information. A few examples:
1) How do the authors know that all Dipsadinae show type B macrostomy? Did they personally
observe representatives of all species from the subfamily Dipsadinae? If so, why there is no
mention of that in their material and methods?
2) The authors themselves seem to recognize the possibility that type C macrostomy may be more
widespread than currently known, making the evolution of the macrostomatan condition more
complex than previously anticipated (page 25, lines 6-12), and yet they provide a misleading
figure where this is not the case, and type C macrostomy is limited to only two exceptions in a
deceivingly very informative image (see also the comment on the caption for Fig. 6).
In conclusion, unless the authors really posses data on the type of suspensorium for all snakes, I
would recommend them to remove such level of detail from the figure, which is highly
misleading about what we actually know about the distribution of types of macrostomy within
specific snake lineages. The authors should simplify this figure and make it very clear that it only
represents a summary of their personal hypothesis of the distribution of these traits within
snakes. They should be more straightforward about what represents actual data and what is only
assumed to happen in the various lineages.
Page 22, line 33 and following: “However, this basal placement of Acrochordus based on CCF
morphology was later rejected, due largely to the strong phylogenetic evidence placing
Acrochordus at a far more derived position as the sister to Colubroidea [33]; again, this rejection
parallels our rejection of scenario one in Thamnophis. This later analysis re-characterized the
absence of the CCF as a paedomorphic feature, making Acrochordus unique among snakes in
retaining this embryonic state – similar to our scenario two – though lacked ontogenetic data
supporting this conclusion [33].”
To be honest, Rieppel 1980 (ref. 33 herein) did not discuss the CCF of Acrochordus, but the
undivided fissura metotica of this taxon (there is no mention of the CCF at all in that paper). In
fact, the basal placement of Acrochordus by McDowell (1979) and others was mostly based on its
undivided fissura metotica (a well documented embryonic feature within squamata), and only
partially on its lack of a CCF (which according to some is still present in this snake but in
rudimentary form, see authors’ ref. 27).
Page 23, line 26: “From our data, the persistent absence of the CCF throughout all three
ontogenetic stages unequivocally demonstrates this condition in Thamnophis to be a case of
paedomorphosis.”
22
As I pointed out above (comment on page 21, line 10), this is an incorrect statement based on a
misinterpretation of what paedomorphosis is and how it is detected. Absence of a feature in all
developmental stages of the same given species does not provide evidence of paedomorphosis.
The authors need to identify the plesiomorphic embryonic/juvenile snake condition via a
comparison with other embryonic/juvenile snakes.
Page 23, line 43: replace “the adult condition matches the embryonic condition” with “the adult
condition matches the plesiomorphic snake embryonic condition”.
Page 25, line 3: insert “main” after “two” (exceptions have already been noted in the literature,
and have also been mentioned in this manuscript).
Page 25, line 8: insert a reference after Homalopsis (this taxon was not the object of this study).
Page 25, line 12: “Our observations of suspensorium development in T. radix also provide novel
evidence for paedomorphosis in the evolution and ontogeny of the scolecophidian skull.”
The condition observed in Thamnophis does not provide any evidence for paedomorphosis in
scolecophidians, unless it is shown to represent the general (plesiomorphic) embryonic snake
condition. What it does is open the possibility to new interpretations on how the scolecophidian
skull may have come to be if the contact between quadrate and prootic indeed turns out to be a
plesiomorphic embryonic snake trait (i.e. pending further data).
Page 25, line 27 and following: “Furthermore, the absence of a crista circumfenestralis in T. radix
[…] provides evidence for paedomorphosis in the evolution of this trait.”
As discussed above, the absence of a crista circumfenestralis in embryonic and adult Thamnophis
does not demonstrate that paedomorphosis is the cause of this absence in the latter. Thamnophis
alone does not tell us anything about which evolutionary developmental process is responsible
for the absence of the CCF in adult snakes. The authors first need to verify that absence of a CCF
is a plesiomorphic condition in embryonic or juvenile snakes, if that is the case, then they can
conclude that its absence in adult Thamnophis can be interpreted as paedomorphic.
Page 33, line 6: as discussed above, in booids the quadrate does not always remain upright (see
comment on page page 17, line 47)
Reference 25 is likely Kamal (1969) (and not 19696).
Table 1:
Frontal & Adult: Completely sutured with frontal (not “completely fused along frontal suture”).
Parietal & Embryo: “Almost entirely unfused along sagittal suture.” There is no sagittal suture to
speak of, only an unossified central region of the parietal.
Parietal & Juvenile: parietal roof ossified (not “sutured”).
Dentary & Embryo/Juvenile/Adult: To my knowledge, tooth counts on marginal dentigerous
elements (dentary and maxilla) are very conservative in snakes within a given species and
throughout ontogeny. Please recheck tooth positions, and make sure you don't simply count
visible teeth, but tooth positions. Tooth counts from multiple specimens (and from both sides of
the skull) would be welcome to make sure that there is no intraspecific variability added to what
may vary ontogenetically.
Figure 6: I wonder if showing the angle between quadrate and compound in a tilted perspective
of the skull is appropriate (the angles appear smaller than they actually are). I think that showing
these angles in lateral view would be much more effective. The figure caption contains a sentence
that I find misleading: “this pathway of development is unique to T. radix and one other,
unrelated genus within the Caenophidia, indicating independent evolution of this pattern”. The
23
sentence assumes that only Thamnophis and another caenophidian have a type C macrostomy
(see fig. 7), while in fact those are simply the only two snakes where presence of this type of jaw
suspension has been noted so far in the literature. There has been no systematic review of jaw
suspension in all snakes, therefore making such generalizations is unjustified. The authors should
rephrase by writing that “this pathway of development has so far been observed only in …” (do
not write that it is unique to two species, we simply do not know that).
Figure 7: see comment above (Page 22, line 19).
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
This is a well-written paper and was a pleasure to read! I rarely review manuscripts that do not
require many grammatical and stylistic changes, so, thank you.
Here are my comments:
Materials and Methods section: Briefly explain why you only scanned 8 specimens of this widely
available species (cost, local availability?). Were the two juveniles from the same mother or were
they unrelated? It is not fatal to your conclusions if the juveniles are related, but it would be good
to mention.
You scanned the heads of alcohol preserved specimens, not skulls, so please explain briefly that
you digitally removed soft tissues and rendered the skulls for analysis.
Results section 3.1 (page 6, line 15): I think that the premaxillary notch is seen better in the ventral
view and you should refer to Fig. 4, not Fig. 3.
Results section 3.5. (page 10, lines 29ff): It would be good to add an illustration of the crista
circumfenestralis in a different colubrid to allow direct comparison with your specimens. If that's
impossible, insert a citation where the reader could find such an illustration.
Discussion section 4.1 (bottom of page 16): Briefly mention diets of juveniles vs adult T. radix.
Since you are talking about ontogentic shifts in diet and gape, prey type is important.
Discussion section 4.3 (page 22): Explain why you didn't examine other Thamnophis to see
presence or absence of CCF. This is one of the big points of your paper, you should tell the reader
why you didn't check other species. Thamnophis are readily available in collections.
Table: Define LARST in table heading or inside table. In the row about the frontal, column 3
(adult), it should read "Complete contact with parietal", not with frontal.
These are all the suggestions I have. I'm looking forward to seeing this in print.
Cheers,
Alex Deufel

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
I must confess that I am a bit disappointed by the tone of the authors’ replies, and especially that
after spending a considerable amount of time writing what I would consider a thorough and
helpful review, my comments were considered “unrealistic, demanding, and often pedantic”. I
can guarantee the authors that it was not my intention “to create the impression that their
manuscript was flawed empirically, conceptually, and grammatically.” A review is meant to
provide comments and suggestions on how to improve a manuscript, and my belief is that it
needs to be rigorous when pointing out flaws, no matter how small.
In any case, the manuscript has now been significantly improved, and I have only a few
additional comments.
1) My original comment on Page 6, line 13 was: “posterior premaxillary notch which will
eventually accommodate the septomaxilla and vomer”. The notch does not accommodate any
part of those bones.
To which the authors replied: The Reviewer is in error – the premaxilla of all squamates, Thamnophis
included, articulates with both the vomer and septomaxilla. The articulation is clearly articulated and the
notch we are discussing is visible in our supplementary files (S4-S6), and in numerous illustrations
provided in such works as Cundall and Irish (2008:pg 404, fig. 2.25). Perhaps we are referring to different
notches, but as mentioned, we illustrate what we mean by this.
I take it that the posterior notch in question is the notch between the two vomerine processes of
the premaxilla, if so, it does not accommodate neither the vomer nor the septomaxilla. While the
vomer and septomaxilla do articulate with the premaxilla in most squamates, these bones do not
enter that notch (quite obvious in Fig. 4). If the authors are referring to a different notch then
please elaborate and be more precise in your description.
25
2) My original comment on Page 12, line 12 was: What is the point of segmenting all the
individual bones if then internal anatomical details like these are not properly figured and
labeled? I would recommend adding some additional figures, if not to the main text at least as
supplementary information.
To which the authors replied: We have added a figure showing an internal view of the braincase, with
pertinent features labelled (Fig. 6D-F). Had the Reviewer consulted the supplementary data he/she would
have noted we supplied the requested internal anatomy as STL files.
I must admit that I missed the supplementary data in my first round of review, but in my defense
there was no mention of such data in the main text (the link to the dryad repository was only
presented at the end of the manuscript and could be easily missed). In any case, anatomical
features are not labeled in the STL files, therefore the new figures certainly help illustrate what
the authors are writing about.
3) Concerning Fig. 7, my original comment was: In conclusion, unless the authors really posses
data on the type of suspensorium for all snakes, I would recommend them to remove such
level of detail from the figure, which is highly misleading about what we actually know about
the distribution of types of macrostomy within specific snake lineages. The authors should
simplify this figure and make it very clear that it only represents a summary of their personal
hypothesis of the distribution of these traits within snakes. They should be more
straightforward about what represents actual data and what is only assumed to happen in the
various lineages.
To which the authors replied: Strongly disagreed. The reviewer cannot be serious on this comment.
Again, establishing the nonsense empirical constraint of having ALL data on ALL snakes does not make
this requirement so, it only enforces the Reviewer’s misguided approach to this component of our
manuscript. A case in point, no phylogenetic hypothesis ever published, using genes or morphology, has
ever once sampled all taxa and all genes and all morphology – never once; according to the Reviewer’s
expectations of our study, not a single phylogenetic or comparative study should ever have been published
in the history of evolutionary biology. Yet these hypotheses of sister-group relationships and inferred
phylogeny exist and are used, clearly by the Reviewer (if in fact the reviewer is not guilty of generating
phylogenies from incomplete and imperfect data sampling) for second, third and fourth order hypothesis
constructions. It is ridiculous to make such statements and expect accommodation of these extensive,
misguided, and condescending criticisms.
Obviously I would not expect anyone to sample all species of snakes to draw some general
conclusions as those presented in this manuscript, mine was a rhetorical point. The issue was that
the authors’ Fig. 7 did not make it explicit which taxa had been actually sampled and for which
ones anatomical conditions had been extrapolated. A naïve reader (or just someone unfamiliar
with the snake literature) looking at their figure may have mistakenly concluded that all of those
snake families and subfamilies had been sampled, at least partially if not thoroughly. I am
pleased to see that the authors have modified their Fig. 7 so that readers can now see which
families/subfamilies have actually been sampled, and also made it explicit that the figure just
represents their personal hypothesis of the evolution of macrostomy.
4) My original comment on Page 22, line 33 was: To be honest, Rieppel 1980 (ref. 33 herein) did
not discuss the CCF of Acrochordus, but the undivided fissura metotica of this taxon (there is
no mention of the CCF at all in that paper).
To which the authors replied: Note that, while Rieppel (1980) focussed on the undivided metotic fissure
as paedomorphic, his later paper with Zaher [ref. 18 herein] included the CCF in this hypothesis of
paedomorphosis: “[Acrochordus] appears to retain a number of surprisingly plesiomorphic features in its
cranial anatomy. [...] The most unusual features in the skull of Acrochordus are the apparent lack of the
26
crista circumfenestralis and the undivided metotic fissure (McDowell, 1979), characteristics that have been
explained as a probably consequence of paedomorphosis.” (Rieppel and Zaher 2001: pg 252). As such, our
discussion of Rieppel (1980) similarly mentions the overall otico-occipital region of Acrochordus as
paedomorphic, in line with Rieppel and Zaher’s (2001) discussion of this hypothesis.
Then the authors should have referenced Rieppel and Zaher (2001) and not Rieppel (1980).
However, the authors should know that Rieppel and Zaher (2001) also misquoted Rieppel (1980).
In fact, the complete quote from Rieppel and Zaher (2001:252) would be “In light of these
phylogenetic relationships, the most unusual features in the skull of Acrochordus are the
apparent lack of the crista circumfenestralis and the undivided metotic fissure (McDowell, 1979),
characteristics that have been explained as a probable consequence of paedomorphosis (Rieppel,
1980).” The citation of Rieppel (1980) at the end of the quote was conveniently left out by the
authors in their reply. I suspect that this is a case where a misquote is reiterated by someone (the
authors) who simply trusted another paper (in this case Rieppel and Zaher, 2001) without
actually verifying the accuracy of that quote by reading the original source (in this case Rieppel,
1980). Thus, a situation is created where two articles (Rieppel and Zaher, 2001 and this
manuscript) make reference to the work of Rieppel (1980) as if it said something about the CCF of
Acrochordus as being a paedomorphic feature, while in truth that work didn’t mention the CCF
at all. I understand that it is common practice to trust what is written in the primary literature
and take the references therein as accurate (especially when one of the authors is on both the
referenced and the citing paper!). However, the authors should have checked the original paper
by Rieppel to make sure that their statements are indeed accurate and avoid perpetuating a case
of poor scholarship.
Despite all this, I am happy with the way the authors have modified the problematic paragraph
so that a reference to Rieppel (1980) implying that he wrote about the CCF of Acrochordus is now
avoided:
We have modified this paragraph as follows: “The absence of the CCF in Acrochordus was therefore
considered consistent with a basal placement of Acrochordus among snakes, similar to the first scenario
proposed herein for Thamnophis [36]. However, this basal placement of Acrochordus was later rejected, due
largely to the strong phylogenetic evidence placing Acrochordus at a far more deeply nested position as the
sister to Colubroidea [37]; again, this rejection parallels our rejection of scenario one in Thamnophis (i.e.,
lack of a CCF does not inherently indicate basal phylogenetic status). This later analysis re-characterized
the otico-occipital region of the skull of Acrochordus – focussing on he persistent lack of division of the
metotic fissure – as paedomorphic, making Acrochordus unique among snakes in retaining this embryonic
morphology – similar to our scenario two – though lacked ontogenetic data supporting this conclusion
[18,37].”
In summary, I would recommend the authors to be more explicit about which “posterior
premaxillary notch” (point 1 above) they are referring to, because at the moment the only
posterior premaxillary notch I can think of is that between the vomerine processes of the
premaxilla. This notch does not accommodate the septomaxilla or the vomer (quite evident in
their Fig 4). If the notch they are describing is another notch, then they need to be clearer in
their description. Apart from this minor issue I am happy with the manuscript as it is.

Comments to the Author(s)
I must confess that I am a bit disappointed by the tone of the authors’ replies, and especially that

Then the authors should have referenced Rieppel and Zaher (2001) and not Rieppel (1980).
However, the authors should know that Rieppel and Zaher (2001) also misquoted Rieppel (1980).
In fact, the complete quote from Rieppel and Zaher (2001:252) would be “In light of these
phylogenetic relationships, the most unusual features in the skull of Acrochordus are the
apparent lack of the crista circumfenestralis and the undivided metotic fissure (McDowell, 1979),
characteristics that have been explained as a probable consequence of paedomorphosis (Rieppel,
1980).” The citation of Rieppel (1980) at the end of the quote was conveniently left out by the
authors in their reply. I suspect that this is a case where a misquote is reiterated by someone (the
authors) who simply trusted another paper (in this case Rieppel and Zaher, 2001) without
actually verifying the accuracy of that quote by reading the original source (in this case Rieppel,
1980). Thus, a situation is created where two articles (Rieppel and Zaher, 2001 and this
manuscript) make reference to the work of Rieppel (1980) as if it said something about the CCF of
Acrochordus as being a paedomorphic feature, while in truth that work didn’t mention the CCF
at all. I understand that it is common practice to trust what is written in the primary literature
and take the references therein as accurate (especially when one of the authors is on both the
referenced and the citing paper!). However, the authors should have checked the original paper
by Rieppel to make sure that their statements are indeed accurate and avoid perpetuating a case
of poor scholarship.
Despite all this, I am happy with the way the authors have modified the problematic paragraph
so that a reference to Rieppel (1980) implying that he wrote about the CCF of Acrochordus is now
avoided:
We have modified this paragraph as follows: “The absence of the CCF in Acrochordus was therefore
considered consistent with a basal placement of Acrochordus among snakes, similar to the first scenario
proposed herein for Thamnophis [36]. However, this basal placement of Acrochordus was later rejected, due
largely to the strong phylogenetic evidence placing Acrochordus at a far more deeply nested position as the
sister to Colubroidea [37]; again, this rejection parallels our rejection of scenario one in Thamnophis (i.e.,
lack of a CCF does not inherently indicate basal phylogenetic status). This later analysis re-characterized
the otico-occipital region of the skull of Acrochordus – focussing on he persistent lack of division of the
metotic fissure – as paedomorphic, making Acrochordus unique among snakes in retaining this embryonic
morphology – similar to our scenario two – though lacked ontogenetic data supporting this conclusion
[18,37].”
In summary, I would recommend the authors to be more explicit about which “posterior
premaxillary notch” (point 1 above) they are referring to, because at the moment the only
posterior premaxillary notch I can think of is that between the vomerine processes of the
premaxilla. This notch does not accommodate the septomaxilla or the vomer (quite evident in
their Fig 4). If the notch they are describing is another notch, then they need to be clearer in their
description. Apart from this minor issue I am happy with the manuscript as it is.

r to responding to Reviewer 1, we feel it is important to respectfully convey our concerns regarding
cts of this review. Reviewer 1 did provide many useful comments and criticisms of our manuscript, which
reatly appreciate and which improved the document; however, we also feel that in many places the
ew is unrealistic and demanding, and often pedantic to the point where it seems the Reviewer wanted
ely to create the impression that our manuscript was flawed empirically, conceptually, and grammatically.
often the case with such reviews, Reviewer 1 is also mistaken on many points of grammar, anatomy, and
rpretation. We have accommodated this Reviewer’s comments to the best of our ability, though we have
rebutted numerous points where necessary with fully reasoned arguments.
vidence of this broad problem in Review 1, we point to the nature and tone of the second review to
trate our point.
ertheless, as mentioned previously and in the spirit of the peer review process, we have made
ections and thus improvements to the manuscript, rebutting only those comments/criticisms
ch we considered incorrect.
ewers' Comments to Author:
ewer: 1
ments to the Author(s)
ng et al. present a nice overview of the ontogenetic development of the skull in a modern colubrid
e, Thamnophis sirtalis. I found it intriguing that despite the fact that this is a very well known snake
ies so much can still be found when closely observing its bones and their development. Things like
contact between quadrate and prootic in the snake embryo and the lack of a crista circumfenestralis
e adult are certainly novel reports and are worth publishing. Having said this, I also found several
es with this manuscript, which preclude publication in its current state.
must point out immediately that we are not presenting information on Thamnophis sirtalis, but
er Thamnophis radix (the Plains Garter Snake). We compare our materials to a skeletonized
imen of T. sirtalis but this manuscript details new data from T. radix.
e is a summary of the major points:
ome of the terminology used is inadequate, like use of terms such as “orbitosphenoidal plate” or
isive process”.
eed. This terminology has been changed, in accordance with the reviewer’s suggestions – see
ific comments below.
here is confusion between fusion of elements and simple sutures.
eed. This has also been revised – see specific comments below.
he manuscript would be greatly improved if the lower jaws were rendered separately in lateral and
ial view. This way the authors could properly illustrate all the elements they describe, including
ular and splenial, and would not have the lower jaws obscuring most of the anatomy of the skull in
ral view (e.g. palatines, parabasisphenoid, and basioccipital cannot be adequately seen because of
.
eed. We’ve added a figure (new Fig. 5) showing the skull without the lower jaws in ventral view,
a separate depiction of the lower jaws in dorsal and medial view (lateral and ventral views of the
s are visible in Fig. 3 and 4, respectively). We decided to add an extra figure instead of simply
ifying Fig. 4 so that a ventral view of the complete articulated skull is still included.
eover, the authors took the time to segment all the individual skull bones from the three
elopmental stages, but then simply figure the whole skulls without showing the internal details of
of the elements. If the authors only wanted to provide colorized versions of the skulls, then Adobe
toshop could have provided the very same results in a fraction of the time. I suggest that the authors
advantage of the fact that they have digitally segmented individual elements in 3D and provide
ered images to illustrate internal anatomical details that at present are discussed but not figured
where (at least as supplementary figures).
greed. Surface mesh (.stl) files of each bone from the featured skulls were included in the
plementary data available to the reviewers
ps://datadryad.org/review?doi=doi:10.5061/dryad.n50st0n). We also included videos of the skulls
the reader could easily access to obtain this anatomical data. It is clear to us that Reviewer #1 did
refer to our supplementary data files as submitted. However, to ensure that readers are aware of
e files, we have added references to the supplementary data in the figure captions. We have also
ed a figure showing an internal view of the braincase (Fig. 6D-F) in order to illustrate pertinent
rnal anatomical features.
noticed an issue with tooth counts. The authors appear to have counted only those teeth that are
ally present and ankylosed to the dentigerous elements, when instead they should have provided
nts of tooth positions. This resulted in very inconsistent tooth counts (i.e. very low numbers in the
nile compared to the adult), when in fact the numbers of tooth positions are expected to be very
e, if not identical (at least for dentaries and msaxillae). Moreover, tooth counts could be affected by
aspecific variability (to a small extent), but the authors provide counts for only 3 of their eight
imens. This way it s not possible to tell whether different tooth counts could be caused by simple
om intraspecific variation rather than by ontogenetic change.
eed. While we do not consider this to be a major issue with the manuscript as written, we have
ified the tooth counts to reflect our best estimate regarding number of tooth positions, along
a count of fully ankylosed teeth.
here is confusion revolving around the concept of paedomorphosis and on how it is detected. The
ors assume that if a trait is retained from an embryonic or juvenile stage into the adult stage of a
n species then the adult of that species is paedomorphic. This is incorrect. See details below (e.g.
e 21, line 10). This misconception affects their interpretation of the lack of a CCF in Thamnophis as a
iomorphic feature, and also their interpretation of the scolecophidian skull as the result of
domorphosis. Because the authors cannot demonstrate that the lack of a CCF or the contact
ween quadrate and prootic are plesiomorphic embryonic/juvenile traits in snakes, then they cannot
h the conclusion that Thamnophis and scolecophidians are paedomorphic for these traits. The
ors can only raise the possibility (i.e. formulate a hypothesis that requires further data to be
ported).
have addressed these points in detail below and modified the manuscript text accordingly – see
vant comments (especially page 19 line 33 and page 21 line 10). It is true that an inference of
domorphosis in an evolutionary context depends on a comparison with a sister taxon or more.
ever, we believe nobody challenges the notion that the presence of a fully developed CCF is
espread among colubroids, and that ontogenetically, to get to a fully developed CCF condition an
vidual must pass through a stage where the CCF is still not fully developed. Even in the absence of
xplicit phylogenetic mapping of this particular character among species closely related to
mnophis, it is safe to assume that the condition in Thamnophis would necessarily be a
domorphic one compared to almost any other colubroid. We remind the Reviewer we are making
mparison at very broad phylogenetic levels, comparing Thamnophis to the generalized condition
ng colubroids and other families. This is not a low taxonomic level comparison or analysis (i.e.,
us level or species level). However, to try to meet this criticism we have provided the above
anation explicitly in the text and acknowledge that further studies within the genus Thamnophis
necessary to indicate if this pattern is specific to T. radix (therefore a paedomorphic event within
genus), or if it is widespread among other species of the genus (implying that the entire genus is
domorphic relative to others).
gure 7 is quite a problematic figure. It deceivingly suggests that the authors have way more
rmation on the distribution of the various modes of jaw suspension than they actually have. I have
nsively discussed the issues relating to this figure in one of my comments below.
ially disagreed. We have addressed the reviewer’s concerns regarding this figure and have
ified Fig. 7 and its figure caption accordingly – see our response to the comment for page 22 line
w I provide detailed comments on all major and minor issues as they present themselves in the
uscript:
e 1, line 53: than in most other (insert “most).
e. We have also made another revision to the abstract, modifying page 1 line 44 to specify that
e are the first complete micro-CT segmentations of any non-adult snake skull (at the time of initial
mission, these were the first complete segmentations of any snake skull, but since then a paper on
ecophidian skull anatomy included a completely segmented adult skull).

e 2, line 17: replace “many” with “some” (there aren’t really that many studies).
greed. Making this change would alter the meaning of this sentence. We have modified the
ding to: “Of these few studies on snake postnatal cranial ontogeny, many have focused on
nges in gape size and diet…”. As the reviewer indicates, there haven’t been many studies on this
c; however, what we’re conveying in this sentence is that, of the few studies that have been done,
mostly focus on gape size and diet. Our addition of the word “few” clarifies this point.
e 6, line 6: “increased integration of the premaxilla with the rest of the snout”. I would argue that
is not true. The images show that the premaxilla is very loosely connected to the rest of the snout in
hree specimens/stages, and the only contact is between premaxilla and anterior tip of the
omaxilla.
have no response to this point other to disagree with the Reviewer. We invite the reviewer to
ss the online supplementary videos and STL files to better observe the differences between the
ontogenetic stages.
e 6, line 6: the authors mistakenly use the term “incisive process” to refer to the premaxillary
ess of the vomer (the “incisive process” is a process on the ventral side of the premaxilla of some
amates other than snakes). Please replace “incisive process” with “premaxillary process” here and in
following instance (lines 17, 26).
e.
e 6, line 13: “posterior premaxillary notch which will eventually accommodate the septomaxilla and
er”. The notch does not accommodate any part of those bones.
Reviewer is in error – the premaxilla of all squamates, Thamnophis included, articulates with both
vomer and septomaxilla. The articulation is clearly articulated and the notch we are discussing is
le in our supplementary files (S4-S6), and in numerous illustrations provided in such works as
dall and Irish (2008:pg 404, fig. 2.25). Perhaps we are referring to different notches, but as
tioned, we illustrate what we mean by this.
e 6, line 22: “premaxilla’s nasal process expands both dorsoventrally and anteroposteriorly”.
ieve this is incorrect, it expands mediolaterally and anteroposteriorly. It is quite clear that the
tive height of the nasal process remains the same if compared to septomaxilla, nasal, and prefrontal.
greed. We made an absolute statement about the nasal process, through the ontogenetic stages
observed, becoming longer and deeper. The Reviewer is attempting to diminish this simple
ervation by taking our absolute statement of the nasal process in exclusion of all other elements
making it a relative statement by comparing it to other snout elements, something we did not do.
is a trivial distinction and represents the Reviewer’s approach to describing anatomy and
ogeny and not our own. We therefore have made no changes to our straightforward observation.
e 6, lines 24-31: “Extension of the anterior processes of the septomaxilla and incisive processes of
vomer relative to the rest of these bones creates stronger contact – and thus improved integration –
ween the premaxilla and the rest of the snout (Fig. 3C).”
is incorrect, see previous comment on line 6.
er line 6, we have changed our use of “incisive process”.
e 6, lines 35-36: “the dorsal laminae are only present as a cluster of unfused ossifications”.
is inaccurate, there is no cluster of unfused ossifications, which seems to imply the presence of
tiple centers of ossification, but only a weakly ossified surface that when rendered digitally appears
of holes, most likely as a rendering artifact.
have changed the wording to: “the dorsal laminae are present only as a very weakly ossified
ace”. Table 1 has been updated accordingly.
e 6, lines 38-39: “dorsal laminae distinctly present and fused to the vertical laminae”.
is inaccurate. The dorsal laminae are not individual elements separate from the vertical laminae,
are part of the same element (the nasal), which is in the process of being mineralised. It follows
there can be no fusion between parts of the same element.
have changed the wording to: “The juvenile nasal (Fig. 2B) shows improved ossification, with the
al laminae in particular showing increased mineralization, thus approaching the adult form.”
e 7, line 13: sutured (not “fused”). The frontals never fuse in snakes.
e.
e 7, line 22: The frontals are not completely sutured to each other (don’t write “fuse”).
have changed this sentence to: “The frontals are not completely sutured to each other until the
lt stage.”
e 7, line 24: please remove “at which point a deep sagittal sulcus is present.” (that is not a “sulcus”,
e suture between the bones).
e.
e 7, line 33: I would suggest using the term “optic fenestra” (not “foramen”, foramina are small
nd holes, fenestrae are large gaps, not necessarily round).
in, we feel this criticism is made in the absence of substance. We point to Cundall and Irish
8:351) who use “OF” throughout their classic work in all illustrations of snake skulls and describe
abbreviation as “optic foramen or fenestra”. The terminology for the frontal was based on
ock and Tanner (1966) and Cundall and Irish (2008), among many, who refer to this opening as the
tic foramen”.

e 7, line 36: Please replace the term “orbitosphenoidal plate” with “descending flange of the

description of a snake skull dates back to 1831 (and also refers to something different). Please
ace “orbitosphenoidal plate” with “descending flange of the frontal” also in the following instances

bove, this terminology was based on Bullock and Tanner (1966). However, we also recognize that
e is no defined orbitosphenoid in snakes, though the ventral process underlying the optic foramen
ten referred to as the orbitosphenoid process of the frontal. Recognizing inconsistencies and
sistencies in terminology, we have modified our term in this case as per the reviewer’s suggestion.

e 8, line 19: Add “(Fig. 1)” after “juvenile stages”.

in, trivial, but done.
e 9, line 22: “The palatine tooth row bears 15 teeth in the embryo, 14 teeth in the juvenile, and 16
h in the adult”.
palatines are hidden by the lower jaws, so it is impossible to verify the tooth counts from the figures
ided. In fact, the lower jaws hide a great deal of the ventral anatomy of the skulls; it would be
er to have them rendered separately next to the skulls, this way the authors could also illustrate the
ial view of the lower jaws, which at present is not shown.
ed on what argued below for the tooth counts on dentaries and maxillae (Page 15, lines 31 & 52), I
ld suggest the authors to double-check these counts as well, in order to make sure that they actually
ide counts of tooth positions and not just of preserved teeth.
er our above comment, the Reviewer did not refer to our surface mesh (.stl) files of each bone as
e available in the supplementary data. However, we have added a figure (new Fig. 5) rendering
lower jaws separately from the rest of the skull and displaying medial and dorsal views of the
er jaws, to assist our readers assuming they might also not refer to the supplementary data. We
e also modified all tooth counts to indicate both ankylosed teeth and likely number of tooth
tions.
lly, the numbers presented here, if correct, do not appear to follow an ontogenetic trend (15-14-16).
pect that there may be some intraspecific variation in there as well. In order to see if this is the case,
authors should provide tooth counts for all specimens that they CT scanned (3 embryos, 2 juveniles,
3 adults). With only one specimen per ontogenetic stage it is hard to discriminate between what is
ally ontogenetic change and what is simply random intraspecific variation. The same holds for the
h counts in dentaries and maxillae. Moreover, the authors should also provide the counts for left
right counterparts of each bone, in case the numbers are different.
mately, we did not speculate on the meaning of these tooth counts nor are they critical to any
clusions drawn in this paper; this observation was a simple one noting numbers of teeth, nothing
e. However, to acknowledge the reviewer’s suggestion of intraspecific variation, we have
oved references to tooth counts from our discussion and table. Beyond this modification, a
iled analysis of the dentition of Thamnophis is outside the scope of this project; we also feel that
extremely detailed counts that the reviewer is requesting would not meaningfully increase the
act of our results. We therefore have done nothing further.

roposteriorly elongated form in the adult (Fig. 3AC).”

ified what we mean in the text.

this sentence refers to the internal contact. We have changed it to: “The supraoccipital’s internal

adult condition. Within the adult otic capsule, internal contact between the supraoccipital and
cipital is almost complete, while internal contact with the prootic is stronger than in the juvenile

se tooth counts cannot be correct. I can count at least 25 tooth positions in the juvenile illustrated in

is inaccurate. In some booids, such as Calabaria, the quadrate is not elongated and remains upright;
ever, when the quadrate is elongated in the adult, then it does not remain upright; in fact, a longer
drate becomes tilted sideways, so that the condyles are approximately in the same vertical
sverse plane, but are not aligned vertically one above the other (i.e. the condyles appear to be one
ve the other only in lateral view). Obviously, a longer quadrate has to be displaced either laterally or
eriorly, or it will create a gap between upper and lower jaws.
lack of anteroposterior rotation of the quadrate is what we were referring to (i.e., the condition
reviewer discusses with the quadrate staying in the same vertical transverse plane). To clarify this,
have changed this to: “The quadrate, though also elongated, is laterally displaced at the
dibular condyle but remains in the same transverse plane (i.e., perpendicular to the skull in
ral view).”

l ontogeny, they refer to personal observations of this ontogenetic pathway in several other
nophidians, including representatives of the Colubridae, Elapidae, Homalopsidae, and Viperidae
6 herein]. As such, based on the current literature, this pathway is widespread within heretofore
pled caenophidians, hence our referral to it as the typical caenophidian mode. However, to clarify
point, we have modified this sentence to: “the typical caenophidian mode of jaw development as
posed by Palci et al. (2016) [6].”

curate, this is a very interesting observation. A contact between quadrate and otic capsule is
ght to be absent in snake embryos (see for example Kamal and Hammouda (1965:291), who studied
colubroid Psammophis: “It is of importance to notice that the quadrate during ontogeny is quite
rt from the neurocranium and bears no connection with the auditory capsule. This is correlated with
absence of the otic process and the subsequent loss of the crista parotica commonly present in
rtilia. Only in the fully formed chondrocranium, after the quadrate has reached its definitive
tion, its dorso-medial margin is attached to the hind end of the auditory capsule by the
atemporal (tabular) bone.”

ause of this, some readers may question the authors’ observation. The fact that the quadrate
rlaps the prootic in lateral view doesn’t mean that they are in contact, let alone in articulation.
hermore, in Fig. 6 the tilted perspective seems to suggest that the quadrate is only in articulation
the supratemporal in all three developmental stages, and has no contact with the prootic (but
d be an artifact of perspective). And finally, if an articulation between quadrate and prootic was
ent, then one may expect an articulatory facet on the prootic in fig. 5, but such facet is not

at) of all three embryos that have been CT-scanned, in order to unequivocally show that an
ulation between quadrate and prootic is indeed consistently present.

e coarse (enlarged tracings of chondrocranial anatomy in embryos, and thin sectioning following
alcification in late stage embryos) compared to the refined, detailed and non-invasive data we
ained with microCT scans. That the articulation/contact between the quadrate and prootic was not
ent to them comes as no surprise as a result. Additionally, we must question the Reviewer’s
rtion of the need for a facet to be found on the prootic for the quadrate. The articulation between
quadrate and prootic in scolecophidians, such as it is, bears no facet on the prootic. Why would an
ryo-neonate develop a facet in the absence of active or any movement at the joint?
etheless, to address this point, we note that we uploaded STL files in the supplementary data
ch provide a more versatile view of the quadrate’s dorsal articulation than is possible in the
res, and which show that the quadrate is indeed in strong contact with the prootic and
atemporal in the embryonic snake. As the Reviewer mentions, in Fig. 6 (now Fig. 7) the apparent
of articulation is a consequence of perspective; we have therefore added a reference to the
plementary data in the figure caption to point readers toward the STL files we’ve provided. We
that our current supplementary files provide ample detail to sufficiently support our observation,
do not see it necessary to upload STL files of all of our specimens.
e 19, lines 6-17: Here the authors speculate about the fact that the quadrate in earlier stages of
ryonic Thamnophis is likely in articulation with the braincase. As I mentioned above, this goes
nst what observed by Kamal and Hammouda (1956), and should therefore be discussed in more
il, pointing out the contradiction with that study.
uggested, we have expanded our discussion of this observed quadrate-neurocranium contact. See
first paragraph of 4.2 – Suspensorium: “Previous studies have observed a lack of contact between
quadrate and otic capsule in embryonic snakes, with the quadrate only ever articulating dorsally
the supratemporal (e.g., [28]). However, the new data reported here on the suspensorium (see
indicate that, through the observed ontogenetic stages, the suspension of the lower jaw shifts
a prootic-supratemporal articulation of the quadrate to a supratemporal-only articulation (Fig. 3
7). This quadrate-prootic contact – which is most prominent in the embryo – thus revises our
ent knowledge of this aspect of braincase development and indicates heretofore unrecognized
ation in the ontogeny of these structures.”

ryonic condition for snakes matches what described in Thamnophis rather than what described in
r snakes (such as Psammophis, the snake described by Kamal and Hammouda [1965]).
have expanded our discussion to acknowledge this point. See the second paragraph of 4.2 –
pensorium, where we have added the following explanation:
he plesiomorphic snake condition for the development of the quadrate is as observed in T. radix,
the quadrate changing from a prootic-supratemporal articulation in embryos and juveniles to a
atemporal-only articulation in adults – rather than as described by Kamal and Hammouda (1965),
hich the quadrate does not contact the chondrocranium – this condition in scolecophidians can be
rpreted as heterochronic. More specifically, the data present in T. radix embryos and juveniles
ld reveal the scolecophidian skull to be paedomorphic, as adult scolecophidians retain the
ative plesiomorphic embryonic condition in which the quadrate articulates with only the
ndrocranium.”
e 19, line 47: replace “juvenile” with “early embryonic”. Such anterior orientation in snakes is only
le in developmental stages occurring before those investigated here by the authors; see Kamal &

is a misinterpretation of the concept of paedomorphosis. Paedomorphosis is not inferred by the
ntion of a feature from juvenile to adult, but by the retention in an adult of what is generally
med to be a juvenile ancestral feature (i.e. the plesiomorphic juvenile condition). In order to say
the absence of a CCF is a juvenile feature, the authors should first show that (at least closely
ted) juvenile snakes typically lack it (not just Thamnophis). This would identify the plesiomorphic
dition (ideally with support from a phylogeny). Then, and only then, they could argue that the
nce of a CCF in adult Thamnophis is a paedomorphic feature. Otherwise anything could be a
domorphic feature, even the presence of two eyes.

ummary, paedomorphosis requires a phylogenetic context, and the ontogenetic trajectory of an
vidual species is not sufficient to come to any conclusion regarding heterochrony.

have responded this comment in the general remarks at the beginning of the review. The
iewer has in several places in this review expended a great deal of effort in suggesting we do not
erstand paedomorphosis. We have read the Reviewer’s lengthy ‘instructional’ text, replete with
tes from McNamara and Klingenberg, and have noted that our understanding matches that of the
ested mentors. To clarify what we had considered common knowledge, we have modified this
ence so as to accommodate the Reviewer’s discussion:
therefore suggest that, in the phylogenetic context of colubroids, the continued absence of a CCF
dults of T. radix (Fig. 3 and 6) can be seen as the derived condition, thus representing a
domorphic pattern when compared to other colubroids, i.e., retention of a plesiomorphic
ryonic or juvenile feature in an adult individual.”
e Reviewer thought we were comparing within a species to generate statements on
domorphic patterns in the absence of comparisons, constantly explicit or not, to other colubroids
ifically or other snakes and lizards generally, then the Reviewer missed the context of the paper –
ntext and point not missed by Reviewer #2. We have made several modifications throughout the
er to include a statement on states of juveniles in more basal/ancestral clades.
modified sentence is part of a larger justification we have added for our interpretation of
domorphosis in T. radix (see the 3rd paragraph of 4.3.):
hough we did not (nor did any other previous study) assess this character at a species level across
pecies of colubroids (a seemingly impossible task at the moment), the current consensus in the
ature is that presence of the CCF in adults is widespread among colubroids (e.g., [18,20,33]). In
er to achieve this adult condition, the organism must necessarily pass through an earlier
ogenetic stage in which the CCF is absent or undeveloped, as is characteristic of any endochondral
fication. As such, it is safe to infer that, for colubroids, the most frequent condition is to lack a CCF
e embryonic (and possibly also juvenile) stage and to possess a CCF in the adult stage. We
efore suggest that, in the phylogenetic context of colubroids, the continued absence of a CCF in
lts of T. radix (Fig. 3 and 6) can be seen as the derived condition, thus representing a
domorphic pattern when compared to other colubroids, i.e., retention of a plesiomorphic
ryonic or juvenile feature in an adult individual.”
le an explicit and thoroughly-sampled phylogenetic mapping of the CCF throughout ontogeny
ld be the ideal way to determine the plesiomorphic condition for colubroids, such an undertaking
eyond the scope of this paper. However, even without this explicit phylogenetic mapping, we can
nstruct absence of the CCF as the plesiomorphic juvenile condition for colubroids following the
of logic presented above. This supports our conclusions and addresses the issues raised by the
ewer regarding the need for phylogenetic context in interpretations of paedomorphosis.

authors referenced a study (their ref. 6) that provided descriptions of the types of macrostomy
ent in some booids and some colubroids. However, fig. 7 in this manuscript seems to extrapolate
data presented in that work to ALL booids and ALL colubroids, specifying even the condition for

ngly disagreed. We suggest the reviewer more closely examine the Discussion section (especially
49) of the paper whose data we used to illustrate Figure 7. While Palci et al. (2016) [ref. 6 herein]
s their discussion on 5 snake species, they refer to personal observations of SEVERAL other booid
caenophidian species which also display the respective hypothesized booid/caenophidian
ways, thus supporting these developmental trajectories as being widespread within these
ective groups (see Palci et al. (2016), pg 749). Our depiction of these pathways in Fig. 7 is simply a
rammatic representation of the evolution of macrostomy exactly as proposed by Palci et al.
6) – including extrapolation of these observations to the overall Booidea and Caenophidia – with
addition of Thamnophis. As such, this figure and its associated extrapolation of these ontogenetic
ectories is well-rooted in published studies of snake macrostomy.
hermore, our approach of taking the known distribution of character states and extrapolating it to
n “gaps” in the phylogeny is a common and well-accepted approach to ancestral state
nstruction used in almost every single study using phylogenetic comparative methods. For
mple, see Palci et al. (2014) – Fig. 6: not all species of Elapidae, for instance, were sampled in that
y, but, based on the elapids that were sampled, the condition of the CCF could be generalized to
family in their phylogeny. This same principle of extrapolation based on current data is what we
e employed in Fig. 7, and is what is widely accepted in the paleontological and phylogenetic
ature.
inclusion of colubrid subfamilies is not intended as an attempt to overgeneralize this hypothesis;
ead, we split Colubridae into its constituent subfamilies to: 1) provide a more specific phylogenetic
text/placement for Thamnophis, as it is the focus of this paper; and 2) visually highlight the
rsity of Colubridae, so as to emphasize the status of Thamnophis as the only colubrid currently
gnized as lacking a CCF.
t being said, we agree with the reviewer that this figure ultimately represents a hypothesis, and
further sampling of macrostomatan taxa is required to more definitively support or falsify it
ugh we note that thus far there is no evidence available in the literature nor provided by the
ewer to falsify this hypothesis, as initially proposed by Palci et al. 2016 and further supported by
findings). As such, we have modified Figure 7 (now Figure 8) so that families/subfamilies that
e directly sampled (either by Palci et al. (2016) or, in the case of Thamnophis, by us) are in green
; this provides transparency so that it is obvious which taxa have been directly observed to
orm to this hypothesis, vs taxa whose status we are extrapolating. We have also modified the
re caption to read: “Phylogeny of Serpentes, highlighting the distribution of presence of the crista
umfenestralis (CCF) and the hypothesized evolution of macrostomy (modified from the
utionary pathways proposed by [6])…” in order to emphasize that this is ultimately a hypothesis.

w examples:
ow do the authors know that all Dipsadinae show type B macrostomy? Did they personally observe
esentatives of all species from the subfamily Dipsadinae? If so, why there is no mention of that in
r material and methods?
is how phylogenetic bracketing works and as such generates hypotheses for investigation. The
orical question concerning the empirical requirement to view all members of Dipsadinae is
iously impossible to be done for a single study.
logenetic bracketing allows the extrapolation of type B macrostomy to Dipsadinae based on the
ent hypothesis of type B macrostomy as the typical caenophidian condition, as presented by Palci
l. (2016). This extrapolation is the typical approach to ancestral state reconstruction (see comment
ve), i.e., reconstruction of a condition within a bracketed clade. Our coloration of taxon names
figure caption for Fig. 8) provides transparency regarding which taxa have been observed and
ch are extrapolated.
he authors themselves seem to recognize the possibility that type C macrostomy may be more
espread than currently known, making the evolution of the macrostomatan condition more complex
previously anticipated (page 25, lines 6-12), and yet they provide a misleading figure where this is
the case, and type C macrostomy is limited to only two exceptions in a deceivingly very informative
ge (see also the comment on the caption for Fig. 6).
ngly disagreed. This pattern is known from only two species, which we indicate in the figure. We
to see how this is misleading or deceptive. To clarify that this distribution of type C macrostomy is
ed on current observations of snake taxa, we have modified the figure caption to include the
wing: “(C) Thamnophis and Homalopsis – both caenophidians – achieve macrostomy via both
tion of the quadrate and elongation of the supratemporal and quadrate. This pathway may be
e widespread than previously recognized, but has currently only been observed in these two
era.”
e A and B macrostomy have been observed in several booid and caenophidian species,
ectively [see Palci et al. (2016:749)], allowing our extrapolation of these pathways to booids and
nophidians in general (= the most frequently observed pattern). In contrast, type C macrostomy
only been observed in Thamnophis and Homalopsis; therefore, while it may turn out to be more
espread than currently recognized, it would not be accurate to definitively generalize this pathway
ther taxa given current observations and current hypotheses of macrostomy evolution. Instead, it
ost parsimonious to depict type B macrostomy as the typical caenophidian pathway, with type C
rostomy as the exception, based on current data.
onclusion, unless the authors really posses data on the type of suspensorium for all snakes, I would
mmend them to remove such level of detail from the figure, which is highly misleading about what
actually know about the distribution of types of macrostomy within specific snake lineages. The
ors should simplify this figure and make it very clear that it only represents a summary of their
onal hypothesis of the distribution of these traits within snakes. They should be more
ightforward about what represents actual data and what is only assumed to happen in the various
ages.
ngly disagreed. The reviewer cannot be serious on this comment. Again, establishing the
sense empirical constraint of having ALL data on ALL snakes does not make this requirement so, it
enforces the Reviewer’s misguided approach to this component of our manuscript. A case in
t, no phylogenetic hypothesis ever published, using genes or morphology, has ever once sampled
axa and all genes and all morphology – never once; according to the Reviewer’s expectations of
study, not a single phylogenetic or comparative study should ever have been published in the
ory of evolutionary biology. Yet these hypotheses of sister-group relationships and inferred
logeny exist and are used, clearly by the Reviewer (if in fact the reviewer is not guilty of generating
logenies from incomplete and imperfect data sampling) for second, third and fourth order
othesis constructions. It is ridiculous to make such statements and expect accommodation of
e extensive, misguided, and condescending criticisms.
ummary of the points discussed above, we have modified the figure caption to make it explicit
this is a hypothesis of macrostomy evolution, and have modified the figure itself to make it
icit which taxa have been directly observed and which have been extrapolated. We have also
uded references in the figure caption for our data sources regarding distribution of the CCF and of
rostomy-related ontogenetic pathways. These changes make this figure more transparent, as
uested by the reviewer. We have also provided justification above for dividing Colubridae into its
stituent subfamilies. Overall, this approach to ancestral state reconstruction – as discussed above
well-accepted in the literature.
e 22, line 33 and following: “However, this basal placement of Acrochordus based on CCF
phology was later rejected, due largely to the strong phylogenetic evidence placing Acrochordus at a
more derived position as the sister to Colubroidea [33]; again, this rejection parallels our rejection of
ario one in Thamnophis. This later analysis re-characterized the absence of the CCF as a
domorphic feature, making Acrochordus unique among snakes in retaining this embryonic state –
lar to our scenario two – though lacked ontogenetic data supporting this conclusion [33].”
e honest, Rieppel 1980 (ref. 33 herein) did not discuss the CCF of Acrochordus, but the undivided
ra metotica of this taxon (there is no mention of the CCF at all in that paper). In fact, the basal
ement of Acrochordus by McDowell (1979) and others was mostly based on its undivided fissura
otica (a well documented embryonic feature within squamata), and only partially on its lack of a CCF
ich according to some is still present in this snake but in rudimentary form, see authors’ ref. 27).
have modified this paragraph as follows: “The absence of the CCF in Acrochordus was therefore
sidered consistent with a basal placement of Acrochordus among snakes, similar to the first
ario proposed herein for Thamnophis [36]. However, this basal placement of Acrochordus was
r rejected, due largely to the strong phylogenetic evidence placing Acrochordus at a far more
ply nested position as the sister to Colubroidea [37]; again, this rejection parallels our rejection of
ario one in Thamnophis (i.e., lack of a CCF does not inherently indicate basal phylogenetic status).
later analysis re-characterized the otico-occipital region of the skull of Acrochordus – focussing on
persistent lack of division of the metotic fissure – as paedomorphic, making Acrochordus unique
ng snakes in retaining this embryonic morphology – similar to our scenario two – though lacked
ogenetic data supporting this conclusion [18,37].”
se changes address the reviewer’s comments by: 1) removing our previous emphasis on the CCF as
ct evidence for a basal placement of Acrochordus, as suggested by the reviewer; and 2) modifying
discussion of Rieppel (1980) to emphasize the metotic fissure rather than the CCF.
e that, while Rieppel (1980) focussed on the undivided metotic fissure as paedomorphic, his later
er with Zaher [ref. 18 herein] included the CCF in this hypothesis of paedomorphosis:
rochordus] appears to retain a number of surprisingly plesiomorphic features in its cranial
tomy. […] The most unusual features in the skull of Acrochordus are the apparent lack of the crista
umfenestralis and the undivided metotic fissure (McDowell, 1979), characteristics that have been
ained as a probably consequence of paedomorphosis.” (Rieppel and Zaher 2001: pg 252)
uch, our discussion of Rieppel (1980) similarly mentions the overall otico-occipital region of
chordus as paedomorphic, in line with Rieppel and Zaher’s (2001) discussion of this hypothesis.
lly, the reviewer mentions that, according to some authors, a rudimentary form of the CCF is still
ent in Acrochordus; however, a more recent large-scale sampling of the CCF among colubroids
20 herein] considered it to be absent in Acrochordus, which is the interpretation we have
ented herein (see Fig. 7).

pointed out above (comment on page 21, line 10), this is an incorrect statement based on a
nterpretation of what paedomorphosis is and how it is detected. Absence of a feature in all
elopmental stages of the same given species does not provide evidence of paedomorphosis. The
ors need to identify the plesiomorphic embryonic/juvenile snake condition via a comparison with
r embryonic/juvenile snakes.
our response to the comment on page 21, line 10. We have also modified this sentence to: “From
data, the persistent absence of the CCF throughout all three ontogenetic stages (a condition
ed with numerous non-ophidian lizards and with other more phylogenetically basal snakes such
crochordus [18]) demonstrates this condition in Thamnophis to be a case of paedomorphosis.”

e 25, line 27 and following: “Furthermore, the absence of a crista circumfenestralis in T. radix […]

iscussed above, the absence of a crista circumfenestralis in embryonic and adult Thamnophis does
demonstrate that paedomorphosis is the cause of this absence in the latter. Thamnophis alone does
tell us anything about which evolutionary developmental process is responsible for the absence of
CCF in adult snakes. The authors first need to verify that absence of a CCF is a plesiomorphic
dition in embryonic or juvenile snakes, if that is the case, then they can conclude that its
nce in adult Thamnophis can be interpreted as paedomorphic.

used a tilted perspective for this figure to provide a more direct view of the suspensorium
ulation than is visible in lateral or dorsal view. To more accurately display the change in angle of
quadrate, we have moved the angles to Fig. 3, and have added the following sentence to the Fig. 3
ion: “Note the posterior rotation of the quadrate from the juvenile to adult stages.”
figure caption contains a sentence that I find misleading: “this pathway of development is unique to
dix and one other, unrelated genus within the Caenophidia, indicating independent evolution of this
ern”. The sentence assumes that only Thamnophis and another caenophidian have a type C
rostomy (see fig. 7), while in fact those are simply the only two snakes where presence of this type
w suspension has been noted so far in the literature. There has been no systematic review of jaw
ension in all snakes, therefore making such generalizations is unjustified. The authors should
rase by writing that “this pathway of development has so far been observed only in …” (do not
e that it is unique to two species, we simply do not know that).

ments to the Author(s)
is a well-written paper and was a pleasure to read! I rarely review manuscripts that do not require
y grammatical and stylistic changes, so, thank you.
e are my comments:
erials and Methods section: Briefly explain why you only scanned 8 specimens of this widely
lable species (cost, local availability?). Were the two juveniles from the same mother or were they
lated? It is not fatal to your conclusions if the juveniles are related, but it would be good to
tion.
ve expanded the first paragraph of the Materials and Methods section to address these points.
arding relatedness among sampled individuals, we added the following explanation: “Specific
rmation regarding the parentage of the embryonic and juvenile snakes was unavailable. However,
n that all of the embryos were accessioned under the same specimen number, it is likely that they
from the same mother. The same line of reasoning also applies to the two juvenile snakes.”
arding our sample size, we added the following explanation: “Our sample size was limited to eight
viduals, as the only other embryonic or juvenile Thamnophis specimens in the UAMZ collections
e from other species and therefore would have introduced interspecific variation as a confounding
or in this ontogenetic analysis. This sample size is consistent with that used in other micro-CT-
ted studies of snake morphology (e.g., see [6,15]).”

ults section 3.1 (page 6, line 15): I think that the premaxillary notch is seen better in the ventral view
you should refer to Fig. 4, not Fig. 3.
ve added references to Fig. 4 and our new Fig. 5 in this sentence, and in the other figure
rences throughout that paragraph.
ults section 3.5. (page 10, lines 29ff): It would be good to add an illustration of the crista
umfenestralis in a different colubrid to allow direct comparison with your specimens. If that's
ossible, insert a citation where the reader could find such an illustration.

ussion section 4.1 (bottom of page 16): Briefly mention diets of juveniles vs adult T. radix. Since you
talking about ontogentic shifts in diet and gape, prey type is important.
e – we’ve added a sentence specifying this shift in diet: “Specifically, T. radix juveniles eat small
items such as annelids and small anurans, whereas adults consume a range of prey, including
er organisms such as small mammals [23]”.

ussion section 4.3 (page 22): Explain why you didn't examine other Thamnophis to see presence or
nce of CCF. This is one of the big points of your paper, you should tell the reader why you didn't
ck other species. Thamnophis are readily available in collections.
re are a few reasons for this: mainly, since we were focussing specifically on the ontogeny of T.
x, we focussed our sampling and CT-scanning efforts on individuals of that species. For logistical
ons, we weren’t able to CT-scan alcohol-preserved specimens of other species. We did compare
results to a skeletonized specimen of T. sirtalis parietalis (which we’ve modified the manuscript to
tion), but limited access to other skeletonized specimens also contributed to our limited
parisons. Of course, as you note, this observation is a key point in our paper, so we’ve also
ified the manuscript to highlight denser sampling and comparisons as a key avenue of future
arch. See our addition to the end of section 4.3:
liminary comparison to T. sirtalis parietalis reveals this taxon to also lack a CCF (CS, pers. obs.),
esting that this absence may be widespread within the genus Thamnophis as a whole. Since our
y focusses specifically on the ontogeny of T. radix, our sampling efforts were in turn focussed on
species. However, denser sampling of other colubroid species – including other species of
mnophis – is a key avenue of future research to further investigate the possibilities we have raised
in.”
e: Define LARST in table heading or inside table. In the row about the frontal, column 3 (adult), it
uld read "Complete contact with parietal", not with frontal.
ve added a definition for LARST in the table caption, and have also corrected “frontal” to
ietal.”
se are all the suggestions I have. I'm looking forward to seeing this in print.

ewer comments to Author:
ewer: 1
ments to the Author(s)
st confess that I am a bit disappointed by the tone of the authors’ replies, and especially that after
nding a considerable amount of time writing what I would consider a thorough and helpful review,
comments were considered “unrealistic, demanding, and often pedantic”. I can guarantee the
ors that it was not my intention “to create the impression that their manuscript was flawed
irically, conceptually, and grammatically.” A review is meant to provide comments and suggestions
ow to improve a manuscript, and my belief is that it needs to be rigorous when pointing out flaws,
matter how small.
ny case, the manuscript has now been significantly improved, and I have only a few additional
ments.
tated in our initial response to this review, we are grateful for the thoroughness of the provided
ments and criticisms. As you state (and we agree), the manuscript was much improved in light of
h reviewers’ comments. The above quote was not in reference to the entire review from Reviewer
ut only to those select aspects of this review which extensively characterized our paper as “highly
eading” and “deceptive” (e.g., the original Fig. 7) and which heavily disputed our understanding of
ain methodologies and concepts (e.g., phylogenetic bracketing and paedomorphosis,
ectively). We emphasize that we do respect the value of such a rigorous review and the detail
went into writing it, and are pleased to see that we have sufficiently addressed all of the points
ed therein.
y original comment on Page 6, line 13 was: “posterior premaxillary notch which will eventually
mmodate the septomaxilla and vomer”. The notch does not accommodate any part of those bones.
hich the authors replied: The Reviewer is in error – the premaxilla of all squamates, Thamnophis
ded, articulates with both the vomer and septomaxilla. The articulation is clearly articulated and the
h we are discussing is visible in our supplementary files (S4-S6), and in numerous illustrations
ided in such works as Cundall and Irish (2008:pg 404, fig. 2.25). Perhaps we are referring to different
hes, but as mentioned, we illustrate what we mean by this.
e it that the posterior notch in question is the notch between the two vomerine processes of the
maxilla, if so, it does not accommodate neither the vomer nor the septomaxilla. While the vomer and
omaxilla do articulate with the premaxilla in most squamates, these bones do not enter that notch
te obvious in Fig. 4). If the authors are referring to a different notch then please elaborate and be
e precise in your description.
are in fact referring to the notch between the vomerine processes ventrally and the nasal process
ally of the premaxilla. To clarify this, we have modified the description to read:
such, the space between the nasal process and vomerine processes of the premaxilla, which will
ntually accommodate the septomaxilla and vomer, is shallow and articulates only with the
omaxilla (Fig. 3A, 4A, 5A). In the juvenile, the vomer’s premaxillary processes become elongated
tive to the rest of the vomer, now extending to the vomerine processes of the premaxilla (Fig. 3B,
5B). From the juvenile to adult stages, the premaxilla’s nasal process expands both dorsoventrally
anteroposteriorly, thus making the space between the nasal and vomerine processes narrower
oventrally and deeper anteroposteriorly.”
y original comment on Page 12, line 12 was: What is the point of segmenting all the individual
es if then internal anatomical details like these are not properly figured and labeled? I would
mmend adding some additional figures, if not to the main text at least as supplementary
rmation.
hich the authors replied: We have added a figure showing an internal view of the braincase, with
inent features labelled (Fig. 6D-F). Had the Reviewer consulted the supplementary data he/she would
e noted we supplied the requested internal anatomy as STL files.
st admit that I missed the supplementary data in my first round of review, but in my defense there
no mention of such data in the main text (the link to the dryad repository was only presented at the
of the manuscript and could be easily missed). In any case, anatomical features are not labeled in
STL files, therefore the new figures certainly help illustrate what the authors are writing about.
are glad that our new figures increase the clarity of our descriptions. We hope that the added
rences to the supplementary files in the figure captions (added in the first round of reviews) will
ent the above issue for future readers. We also note that STL files are 3-D vector files which
not carry individual text labels for anatomical components as regular in-text figures can. Yet, these
are aimed for the specialist reader interested in snake anatomy, and by themselves provide the
t detailed visualization to this day of individual anatomical components of the skull. In
bination with any anatomical map of the snake skull (e.g., Cundall and Irish 2008), any dedicated
ent of squamate anatomy will be able to use these files to understand individual components of
snake skull in great detail.
oncerning Fig. 7, my original comment was: In conclusion, unless the authors really posses data on
type of suspensorium for all snakes, I would recommend them to remove such level of detail from
figure, which is highly misleading about what we actually know about the distribution of types of
rostomy within specific snake lineages. The authors should simplify this figure and make it very clear
it only represents a summary of their personal hypothesis of the distribution of these traits within
es. They should be more straightforward about what represents actual data and what is only
med to happen in the various lineages.
hich the authors replied: Strongly disagreed. The reviewer cannot be serious on this comment.
in, establishing the nonsense empirical constraint of having ALL data on ALL snakes does not make
requirement so, it only enforces the Reviewer’s misguided approach to this component of our
uscript. A case in point, no phylogenetic hypothesis ever published, using genes or morphology, has
once sampled all taxa and all genes and all morphology – never once; according to the Reviewer’s
ectations of our study, not a single phylogenetic or comparative study should ever have been
lished in the history of evolutionary biology. Yet these hypotheses of sister-group relationships and
rred phylogeny exist and are used, clearly by the Reviewer (if in fact the reviewer is not guilty of
erating phylogenies from incomplete and imperfect data sampling) for second, third and fourth order
othesis constructions. It is ridiculous to make such statements and expect accommodation of these
nsive, misguided, and condescending criticisms.
iously I would not expect anyone to sample all species of snakes to draw some general conclusions
hose presented in this manuscript, mine was a rhetorical point. The issue was that the authors’ Fig. 7
not make it explicit which taxa had been actually sampled and for which ones anatomical conditions
been extrapolated. A naïve reader (or just someone unfamiliar with the snake literature) looking at
r figure may have mistakenly concluded that all of those snake families and subfamilies had been
pled, at least partially if not thoroughly. I am pleased to see that the authors have modified their Fig.
that readers can now see which families/subfamilies have actually been sampled, and also made it
icit that the figure just represents their personal hypothesis of the evolution of macrostomy.
in, we’re glad to have sufficiently addressed and clarified the points raised regarding this figure.
My original comment on Page 22, line 33 was: To be honest, Rieppel 1980 (ref. 33 herein) did not
uss the CCF of Acrochordus, but the undivided fissura metotica of this taxon (there is no mention of
CCF at all in that paper).
hich the authors replied: Note that, while Rieppel (1980) focussed on the undivided metotic fissure
aedomorphic, his later paper with Zaher [ref. 18 herein] included the CCF in this hypothesis of
domorphosis: “[Acrochordus] appears to retain a number of surprisingly plesiomorphic features in its
ial anatomy. [...] The most unusual features in the skull of Acrochordus are the apparent lack of the
a circumfenestralis and the undivided metotic fissure (McDowell, 1979), characteristics that have
n explained as a probable consequence of paedomorphosis.” (Rieppel and Zaher 2001: pg 252). As
, our discussion of Rieppel (1980) similarly mentions the overall otico-occipital region of Acrochordus
aedomorphic, in line with Rieppel and Zaher’s (2001) discussion of this hypothesis.
n the authors should have referenced Rieppel and Zaher (2001) and not Rieppel (1980). However,
authors should know that Rieppel and Zaher (2001) also misquoted Rieppel (1980). In fact, the
plete quote from Rieppel and Zaher (2001:252) would be “In light of these phylogenetic
tionships, the most unusual features in the skull of Acrochordus are the apparent lack of the crista
umfenestralis and the undivided metotic fissure (McDowell, 1979), characteristics that have been
ained as a probable consequence of paedomorphosis (Rieppel, 1980).” The citation of Rieppel
0) at the end of the quote was conveniently left out by the authors in their reply. I suspect that this
case where a misquote is reiterated by someone (the authors) who simply trusted another paper (in
case Rieppel and Zaher, 2001) without actually verifying the accuracy of that quote by reading the
inal source (in this case Rieppel, 1980). Thus, a situation is created where two articles (Rieppel and
er, 2001 and this manuscript) make reference to the work of Rieppel (1980) as if it said something
ut the CCF of Acrochordus as being a paedomorphic feature, while in truth that work didn’t mention
CCF at all. I understand that it is common practice to trust what is written in the primary literature
take the references therein as accurate (especially when one of the authors is on both the
renced and the citing paper!). However, the authors should have checked the original paper by
pel to make sure that their statements are indeed accurate and avoid perpetuating a case of poor
larship.
pite all this, I am happy with the way the authors have modified the problematic paragraph so that a
rence to Rieppel (1980) implying that he wrote about the CCF of Acrochordus is now avoided:
have modified this paragraph as follows: “The absence of the CCF in Acrochordus was therefore
idered consistent with a basal placement of Acrochordus among snakes, similar to the first scenario
osed herein for Thamnophis [36]. However, this basal placement of Acrochordus was later rejected,
largely to the strong phylogenetic evidence placing Acrochordus at a far more deeply nested position
he sister to Colubroidea [37]; again, this rejection parallels our rejection of scenario one in
mnophis (i.e., lack of a CCF does not inherently indicate basal phylogenetic status). This later analysis
haracterized the otico-occipital region of the skull of Acrochordus – focussing on the persistent lack of
ion of the metotic fissure – as paedomorphic, making Acrochordus unique among snakes in retaining
embryonic morphology – similar to our scenario two – though lacked ontogenetic data supporting
conclusion [18,37].”
re glad that our revisions have addressed your concerns regarding this paragraph. To clarify what
d originally written, as you’ve discussed above: While Rieppel and Zaher (2001) technically
quoted Rieppel (1980), we interpreted these papers in light of the fact that the metotic fissure
omes subdivided into the jugular foramen and the lateral aperture of the recessus scalae tympani,
arated by the crista tuberalis (one of the components of the CCF). If the metotic fissure is
ivided as in Acrochordus, this necessarily means that the crista tuberalis is absent and therefore
the CCF must also be absent. This is a logical conclusion based on the anatomical definition of the
. Therefore, while Rieppel (1980) did not explicitly refer to the CCF, the absence of this structure is
cessary implication of the undivided metotic fissure present in Acrochordus. Furthermore, if the
otic fissure in Acrochordus is undivided due to paedomorphosis, then by extension the crista
eralis – and thus the CCF – are also absent due to paedomorphosis. We therefore view Rieppel and
er’s (2001) discussion of the previous paper and their added mention of the CCF as simply an
icit reference to an implicit point raised by Rieppel (1980). In this manner, Rieppel and Zaher
ectly cited Rieppel (1980), and so did we. We did in fact read both of these papers (rather than
dly trusting what Rieppel and Zaher had written, as per the erroneous claims offered here by
iewer 1), but we interpreted Rieppel and Zaher (2001) as having followed the same line of logic
ented above and therefore did not take issue with discussing Rieppel (1980) in relation to both
CCF and metotic fissure. We agree with the reviewer regarding the importance of verifying the
ary literature and hope that this elaboration has clarified our thinking in writing our original
graph.
ummary, I would recommend the authors to be more explicit about which “posterior premaxillary
h” (point 1 above) they are referring to, because at the moment the only posterior premaxillary
h I can think of is that between the vomerine processes of the premaxilla. This notch does not
mmodate the septomaxilla or the vomer (quite evident in their Fig 4). If the notch they are
ribing is another notch, then they need to be clearer in their description. Apart from this minor
e I am happy with the manuscript as it is.
iscussed above, we’ve clarified our description. Again, we thank the reviewers for their comments
ughout the review of this manuscript.
