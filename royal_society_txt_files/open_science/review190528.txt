The failure depth of the floor strata is of great significance for ensuring the safe mining over an
aquifer. In this paper, a multi-factor coupling orthogonal numerical tests on failure depth of floor
strata were performed, the factors impact was analyzed and a mathematics multi-factor
prediction model was established. Furthermore, the prediction model was validated by the in-
situ monitoring results. The results can provide important guidance to coal mining under water
pressure and offer a theoretical reference for failure depth control of floor rocks under similar
geophysical conditions. Thence, the paper is interesting, and the work of this manuscript is
practical and logical.
There are some problems to be further improved as follows:
1. The English of the manuscript must be improved seriously. We suggest you to get assistance
from colleagues who are well-versed in English.
2. There are too few overseas relevant research review in the Introduction part.
3. The words should be in unified font form in the Table 2.

The manuscript titled “A Multi-factor Coupling Prediction Model for the Failure Depth of Floor
Rocks in Fully-mechanized Caving Mining: A Numerical and In-situ Study” presents an
interesting work on the failure depth prediction of floor rocks in mining through the methods of
numerical tests and field monitoring. The prediction model that established in this paper works
well in describing the failure depth of floor rocks in mining under different geological conditions.
I would like to recommend this manuscript to be accepted for publication if the following small
issues could be settled.
1) In the numerical tests, how did you apply the aquifer water pressure to the coal seam and
why?
2) In Table 3, the failure depths of floor rocks in each numerical test are presented, but the data
lack of proper units, which makes me confusing.
3) In this field monitoring, how did you tell the floor rocks fail or not?
4) In section 5.1, how was the strain measured? The detailed measurement principle should be
clearly stated.
5) In the model validation, both the F-test and range test are used and what is the validation
difference between the two tests?
6) The English editing should be improved.
7) The figures should be provided with high-resolution.

Authors’ response: Thanks for your comments. We are sorry for our improper writing. The language editing in our
uscript have been improved by Springer Nature Author Service. Here is the language editing certification.
There are too few overseas relevant research reviews in the Introduction part.
Authors’ response: Thanks for your comments. We cite many high-quality papers published in international
nals reporting the failure of floor rocks in China because they are of great significant guidance for the failure of
r rocks control. According to your recommendation, we rewrote the introduction section and supplemented several
seas researches to enrich the literature review in our revised version. The detailed revision is listed below.
“Currently, many studies on the failure of floor rocks have been reported since a critical energy-release point was
duced to analyze the bearing capacity and stability principles of the floor rocks in long-term conditions by Santos
ieniawski [2,3]. Kumar and Das carried out plate loading tests on simulated <U+FB02>oor strata for varying geotechnical
ditions of weak <U+FB02>oor strata to evaluate the bearing strength characteristics of <U+FB02>oor strata during an excavation
ess while under heavy loads from an overlying rock mass [4]. The failure depth in a specific longwall gangue
filling mine was measured using the mine electricity profiling method by Yang et al. [5]. Yin et al. performed field
itoring of the stress state of the floor rocks during the mining process and revealed the relationship between the
ical/horizontal stress increments of the floor rocks with depth [6,7]. Based on the isotropic assumption of rocks,
ng determined the failure depth of floor rocks by comparing the flow rate of water in a borehole before and after
mining [8]. In combination with the methods of field measurement, theoretical analysis and numerical simulation,
et al. [9] and Wang et al. [10] developed analytical solutions of the support stress distribution of floor rocks to
ntify the failure depths of floor rocks. Jiang et al. performed an in-situ measurement by hollow inclusion strain
ors to investigate the mining-induced damage and failure characteristics of coal seam floor rocks at different depths
orking faces with different lengths [11]. Generally, among the above studies, many impact factors, such as in-situ
s, burial depth and isotropic rocks, were taken into accounts [12-15], while few studies that include aquifer water
e been reported. The failure depth of the floor rocks affected by the mining process is mainly composed of two parts:
direct failure zone formed by the mining stress field and the floor rising zone affected by the aquifer water. The sum
e two is the final failure depth of the floor rocks [16]. However, the effect of aquifer water on the direct failure zone
lways ignored. The high-pressure of the aquifer water will cause structural changes in the floor rocks and can
tually lead to the changes in failure depth of floor rocks [17]. Therefore, the influence of the aquifer water on the
re depth of the floor rocks cannot be ignored.
The in-situ measurement of the stress or strain of floor rocks under active mining is the most direct and effective
hod for determining the deformation and failure of floor rocks [18-20]. However, limited by the specific and
repeatable geophysical conditions in in-situ monitoring, only certain impact factors could be considered in field
surements. The failure of floor rocks is always the result of several impact factors, and numerical testing is an
ctive method to take multi-factor coupling into consideration. It is of great significance to study the failure depth of
r rocks affected by multiple impact factors and give the impact order of the factors.
Please see section 2 Introduction. The revisions are marked red.
The words should be in unified font form in the Table 2.
Authors’ response: Thanks for your comments. We are sorry for our improper writing. In our revised manuscript,
have checked the entire text carefully and corrected all the similar improper writings in tables and figures.
In Fig. 2, the damage zone in the floor is not clear.
Authors’ response: Thanks for your comments. As the review suggested, we supplied more high-resolution images
lear as possible to present our content in our revised manuscript. Please see the figures in our revised version. We
e these figures can meet your approval.
Does the impact factor influence order on failure depth applicable in the other similar conditions?
Authors’ response: Thanks for your comments. This is a valid issue. In our paper, the four impact factors (coal
m pitch, mining face length, burial depth and aquifer water pressure) were taken into consideration to study the
re depth of floor rocks in mining. From the 16 numerical simulation tests and in-situ field monitoring results, we
e to the conclusions of the impact factor order coal seam pitch>mining face length>burial depth>aquifer water
sure. The results can provide important guidance to coal mining under water pressure and offer a key theoretical
rence for failure depth control of floor rocks under similar geophysical conditions. In our revised version, we
lighted our results and meanings. Please see section 2 Introduction and section 6 Conclusions.
The paper should be revised following the format specification of the journal.
Authors’ response: Thanks for your comment. In our revised manuscript, we have carefully read the introductions
authors and prepared our resubmission according to the format specification of the journal. We hope our corrections
meet your approval.
ponses to reviewer #2:
iewer’s comments: The manuscript titled “A Multi-factor Coupling Prediction Model for the Failure Depth of Floor
ks in Fully-mechanized Caving Mining: A Numerical and In-situ Study” presents an interesting work on the failure
h prediction of floor rocks in mining through the methods of numerical tests and field monitoring. The prediction
el that established in this paper works well in describing the failure depth of floor rocks in mining under different
ogical conditions. I would like to recommend this manuscript to be accepted for publication if the following small
es could be settled.
In the numerical tests, how did you apply the aquifer water pressure to the coal seam and why?
Authors’ response: Thanks for your comments. In our paper, the impact factors including the burial depth, the
ing face length, coal seam pitch and the aquifer water pressure were taken into consideration. In the numerical tests,
ree-dimensional fluid-solid coupling numerical simulation model is established. The overlying rock strata (except
coal seam roof) are uniformly loaded to the upper surface. The aquifer water pressure is loaded to the coal seam at a
of -0.01 MPa/m downward along the coal seam. The detailed revision can be seen in section 3.1 numerical tests.
In Table 3, the failure depths of floor rocks in each numerical test are presented, but the data lack of proper
units, which makes me confusing.
Authors’ response: Thanks for your comments. In our revised version, the units of the failure depths of floor rocks
able 3 were supplemented. Please see Table 3.
In this field monitoring, how did you tell the floor rocks fail or not?
Authors’ response: Thanks for your comments. In the filed monitoring, the strain increment is de<U+FB01>ned as the
erence between the real-time strain and the initial strain of each sensor probe, and the evolution of the strain
ement is used to characterize the stress and deformation of the coal seam <U+FB02>oor rocks before and after mining. The
n increment curves with abrupt changes could be divided into two types: tensile-compressive strain mutations and
ormal mutations. From the strain increment curves of the seventeen sensor probes in the four monitoring boreholes,
floor rocks damage characteristics are listed in Table 5. In our revised version, we supplemented the damage
acteristics of floor rocks at the locations of each probe sensor to better reflect the failure depth of the floor rocks.
se see Table 5.
In section 5.1, how was the strain measured? The detailed measurement principle should be clearly stated.
Authors’ response: Thanks for your comments. In the field monitoring, the strain sensors are buried in holes at
erent depths, and the strain evolutions are recorded during the mining process. When the mining face is far away
the strain sensor, and the mining pressure has not reached the sensor, the strain evolution is steady. When the
or is a<U+FB00> ected by the mining pressure, the strain evolution changes synchronously with the advancement of mining.
en the mining face is worked near the strain sensor, the strains sharply increase due to the intense disturbance of the
ing pressure; speci<U+FB01>cally, if the rocks at the buried position are not yet damaged, the force of the probe is relatively
orm, and the sensor strains change regularly, <U+FB02>uctuating with deformation of the surrounding rocks during the entire
itoring process. Once the surrounding rocks at the buried positions are disturbed violently, strong plastic
lacement and deformation of the drilling hole inevitably occur and damaged plastic coating of the probe or even
functions of the probe are resulted; thus, the measured strains are highly discrete or <U+FB02>uctuate randomly. Therefore,
<U+FB01>eld strain evolutions measured can be used to determine whether the <U+FB02>oor rock is damaged or not. In our revised
uscript, the detailed measurement principle was supplemented and listed below,
“In field monitoring, the strain sensors are buried in holes at di<U+FB00> erent depths, and the strain evolutions are
rded during the mining process. Once the surrounding rocks at the buried positions are disturbed violently, strong
tic displacement and deformation of the drilling hole inevitably occur and damaged plastic coating of the probe or
malfunctions of the probe; thus, the measured strains are highly discrete or <U+FB02>uctuate randomly to reflect the
aged floor rocks [11].”
Please see section 5.1 In-situ monitoring.
In the model validation, both the F-test and range test are used and what is the validation difference between
the two tests?
Authors’ response: Thanks for your comments. In our paper, both the F-test and range analysis are conducted to
yze the sensitivity of each impact factor on the failure depth in multi-factor model. We intended to show the
istent validation results of the two methods. From the model validation, we can see, the influence order of the
act factor on failure depth of floor rocks is coal seam pitch>mining face length>burial depth>aquifer water
sure, which is consistent with the order results of F-test. There is no validation difference between the two different
