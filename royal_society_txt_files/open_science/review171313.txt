I recommend receiving this paper for publication with minor revision as following:
1: some statement should be corrected. For example, “All reaction products were characterized
through FT-IR and NMR spectroscopies and SEC analyses: should be changed as “All reaction
products were characterized by FT-IR, NMR, and SEC.
2: There are so many sub-title in section 3 (Material and methods), 3.2.2.1 and so on. I suggest that
the author use only “3.2.2 Synthesis of the monomers”, but not divided into 3.2.2.1 and so on.
3: It is the opposite for the results and discussion to that at section 3(materials and method), no
sub-title was used. I strongly suggest that the author should divide this section into three section:
monomer synthesis and characterization, polymer preparation and characterization, and
properties analysis.
4: Figure S1 (NMR spectrum of the prepared monomer) should be put in the main text rather
than in supporting information.

The manuscript by Salvini and colleagues described the usefulness of modified renewable
feedstocks a,a’-trehalose and D-glucose as monomers for the synthesis of some new type of
3
vinyl copolymers in methanol. These copolymers synthesis was designed without
protection/deprotection steps and used AIBN as radical initiator under nitrogen atmosphere.
These polymers were characterized by FT-IR and NMR spectroscopies, thermal (DSC) and SEC
analyses. The authors claimed the compatibility of methanol over water to avoid the use of
certain additives to obtain the pure copolymers. Besides, hydrolysis of these polymers provided
totally water-soluble vinyl alcohol copolymers.
Comments:
1) The authors are suggested to check the solvent effect. Is there any specific reason to use
methanol? Why not ethanol or higher alcohols?
2) Is it possible to investigate the role of catalyst to influence the reaction times and yields?
On the whole, the authors promoted the use of renewable feed-stocks, which indeed related to
the 12 principles of green chemistry.
I recommend this manuscript for a publication after the major revision.

I have reviewed the previous version of this manuscript and asked few questions concerning the
solvent effect and catalyst effect on the reaction. The authors provided adequate information in
the revised manuscript. I am convinced with the information provided by authors about the
usefulness of modified renewable feedstocks a,a’-trehalose and D-glucose as monomers for
the synthesis of some new type of vinyl copolymers in methanol.
I recommend this manuscript for a publication in the present form.

Dear Editor,
I send You a copy of our revised manuscript n.: ID: RSOS-171313, entitled
“Modified a,a’-trehalose and D-glucose: green monomers for the synthesis of
vinyl copolymers” by Alessandra Papacchini, Maria Rosella Telaretti Leggieri, Luca
Zucchini, Marco Aldo Ortenzi, Francesca Ridi, Donatella Giomi, Antonella Salvini,
that has been revised according to the referees’ suggestions.
The corrections suggested by Reviewers have been introduced, grammatical errors
have been removed and the points of clarification or other suggestions have been
evaluated and clarified.
In particular, the following changes have been made:
Reviewer 1
The authors are grateful to Reviewer 1 for the positive comment and his suggestions
have been introduced as following:
1: some statements have been corrected and they are highlighted in yellow in the
text. For example, “All reaction products were characterized through FT-IR and
NMR spectroscopies and SEC analyses: should be changed as “All reaction products
were characterized by FT-IR, NMR, and SEC.
2: Some sub-titles numbers in section 3 (Material and methods) have been
eliminated.
3: The section “Results and discussion” has been divided into three sub-sections: 4.1
Synthesis and characterization of the monomers, 4.2 Synthesis and characterization
of the vinyl acetate copolymers, 4.3 Synthesis and characterization of the vinyl
alcohol copolymers.
4: Figure S1 (NMR spectrum of the prepared monomer) has been moved from
supporting information to the main text.
Reviewer: 2
The authors are grateful to Reviewer 2 for the positive comment and concerning his
suggestion of major specific revision, these changes have been made:

1) The solvent effect has been evaluated using also ethanol obtaining comparable
results in terms of yield and structural characteristics. This result has been introduced
and discussed. In fact, ethanol is the best solvent in terms of green chemistry also for
the possibility of obtaining it from biomass. The choice of using an alcohol, such as
methanol or ethanol, was made because, as reported in the text, water could not be
used to obtain a pure polymer without the additives necessary to prepare a stable
suspension. Moreover, among the organic solvents generally used for the synthesis of
vinyl polymers in solution, alcohols are the most interesting. Higher alcohols are not
used because they do not seem to present advantages for these syntheses. Methanol
was used as preferred solvent in all the syntheses for a better work up for the
subsequent spectroscopic characterization.
2) The role of a different catalyst to influence the reaction times and yields for the
vinyl copolymers synthesis has been studied in several papers and patents and it was
not of specific interest for this research. Reaction time is standard while reaction
yield is mainly influenced by the allyl monomer rather than by the radical initiator.
However, the choice of the allyl derivative has already been explained in the text. We
have selected AIBN as a radical initiator for a comparison with analogous syntheses
of the polyvinylacetate homopolymer or other copolymers. A reference and a
comment have been included in the discussion.
Hoping to have addressed all the points and suggestions raised by the Reviewers, we
wish to thank the Referees for their comments that allowed the improvement of our
manuscript. We believe that the presented results represent an interesting topic for the
readers of the journal and thus we hope that our paper in worth to be considered for
publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Sincerely
Antonella Salvini*
