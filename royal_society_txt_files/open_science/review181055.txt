Review notes
October 2nd 2018
General comments
This work is fascinating, but perhaps the most difficult paper I’ve ever had to review. If I have
understood correctly, the scope of Dr. Fanelli’s ideas are wide-ranging and of fundamental
importance. However, this is a massive work, and I admit there are parts I found difficult to follow. I
think if clarity could be improved, the manuscript would be much more beneficial. It is entirely possible
too I have misunderstood aspects of the work at hand – while I am familiar with Shannon’s theorem
and AIT, I am certainly no expert and so I offer my comments in this vein, and could be very grateful if
these could be addressed.
Abstract
The abstract is a powerful statement of intent, and relatively clear – but QRP should be defined use.
Introduction section (a)
The initial introduction section is very clearly written, and I am happy this could be broadly followed
by any reader. I will break down minor criticisms of the subsequent sections here
1. Shannon’s entropy function is introduced quite rapidly in 2.1, but I think it requires a little
more elaboration. I think if I understand correctly, the formulation being invoked is the
Shannon entropy, typically given by
<U+0001D441>
<U+0001D43B>(<U+0001D44B>) = - <U+2211> <U+0001D443>(<U+0001D465><U+0001D456> ) log <U+0001D44F> <U+0001D443>(<U+0001D465><U+0001D456> )
<U+0001D456>=1
rewritten here in terms of Y, with the log base not specified (but presumably dependent on
number of possible states). It might be worth explaining what this means to the reader first,
potentially with a simple coin flip example, for as the author himself points out, AIT and
information theory are not commonly used in meta-research, and to encourage use requires
demystification so that others may see the merit of this approach.
2. RV is random variable presumably, but this should be defined.
3. My major issue with this section is that I do not see clearly how the pivotal equation 2.1 was
arrived at, and from whence it came. I do not dispute it’s rectitude, but I think as it’s so
fundamental to the work, it’s origin needs to be made clearer.
Introduction section (b)(i)
1. Is information still considered finite if something is entirely random? Say a radioactive decay.
I think it still is (it would just have very high entropy) but I wanted to check I understood
correctly.
2. In figure 1, (a), (b), (e) and (f) are functions of a single variable, X. But 1(c) is a function of two
variables (ie: it’s always multi-valued) as is the even more complex 1(d). Can we still straight-
forwardly apply the framework here with multiple dependence? Apologies if I’m
misunderstanding this.
3. My previous question might stem from a poor understanding the mutual information theorem
– as I understand it, MIT measures information shared by X and Y. In a circle above, X and Y
are not independent, so perhaps that’s fine. It would be worth clarifying this in the text, as
this will not be known to the typical meta-researcher.
Introduction section (b)(ii)
1. F and g here are not clearly defined; are these functions?
2. Figure 3: This is hard to interpret as I’m still unsure of where equation 2.1 arrived from, and
what values of K describe impressive ‘knowledge’ versus only middling. For example ,the co-
efficient of determination in the first figure suggests that for perfect correlation, K is still small
(~0.12): I think this might be easier to understand if the formal definition was clarified further.
Introduction section (b)(iii)
1. This alludes to the derivation of 2.1 – please make clearer. The rest of the section I quite like,
but there is some risk of tautology – equation 2.16 taken to limits of infinity yields a K of 0,
independent of tau, which is presented as a further argument for the postulate. But that is
only the case if we’re confident that K is well-derived. And again, while I am confident it is, I’d
like to see it’s derivation clearly presented so I might better understand.
section (c)(v)
1. The argument for the exponential form of 2.25 is quite technical, and not immediately clear
(S6).
section 3(b)(i)
1. The electron mass is taken from NIST data to be 9.10938356 x 10E-31 +/- 0.00000011 x 10E-
31 ; I am not sure where the current figure is from, or how the uncertainty is being reported?
Figure 1 - Simple examples of data points with no error perfectly described by an analytical relationship between x and y -
should these not have higher K than that suggested in figure 3?
section 3(b) (General)
The K’s here seem much higher than the K’s in figure 3. This is causing me some confusion; if I have a
perfected R2, it might quite likely be because I know the precise relationship between two things. For
example, above. Shouldn’t these two have high K scores?
Over all notes
I think this work is exceptionally promising, but as it stands I am still finding it difficult to ascertain
precisely how the pivotal relationship asserted was arrived at. Consequently I feel I would be in a
better place to interpret the work if this question (and the ones I have arrived at here) could be
answered.

Appendix B
Summary
This highly ambitious manuscript attempts to provide a general theory of
information as it applies to science that, the author hopes, can serve as a
foundational core for a theoretical approach to meta-research/meta-science
(the science of science). Drawing on information theory this manuscript
introduces the broadly applicable variable of K entailing knowledge
associated with a system, in particular the explanatory power that a body of
evidence provides in any given domain. K has many similarities to more
familiar constructs such as measures of effect sizes but the author argues has
many advantages including being independent of measurement form, and
sensitive to various factors such as sample size, accuracy of scale, and
Ockham’s razor. The author carefully explicates the central assumptions of
the model, delineates its mathematical formulation and then goes on to
illustrate its potential utility with respect to a number of pressing questions
in meta-science. These include: determining how much knowledge is
contained in a theoretical system, characterizing the amount of personality
information gained from learning of a person’s gender, providing an
alternative to meta-analysis in assessing the cumulative meaning of multiple
studies, evaluating reproducibility research, establishing the value of null
results, characterizing pseudoscience, and determining what makes a science
“soft”. The paper concludes that this basic approach provides a foundational
meta-theory for meta-science.
Evaluation
I must acknowledge at the outset that although I am familiar with
information theory I am nowhere near sufficiently well versed with it, nor
mathematically skilled enough to evaluate the details of its treatment here.
The author could very well have some major flaws in his logic or math that
would completely escape me. I thus find myself in the peculiar position of
being extremely enthusiastic about a paper that I cannot claim to entirely
understand. I do however understand the reason for my enthusiasm. The
author has taken on the daunting task of trying to quantitatively formalize
precisely what it is that we extract from science, and then to delineate how
this formal approach can illuminate the nascent yet burgeoning field of meta-
science. The general idea of using information theory to illuminate the
knowledge that we extract from science strikes me as extremely promising
and hitherto under explored, and the many distinct domains that the theory
is applied to is startling both in its breadth of topics and detail of analysis. I
genuinely believe that this paper has the prospect of being truly seminal.
Although I am genuinely excited about this paper I feel that it is important
that you find some reviewers who are sufficiently well versed in information
theory that they can carefully work through all of the equations, and the
details of their applications in the various domains. My expectation is that
the math works, but I worry that there are additional assumptions embedded
in the formalisms that the author may have neglected addressing. The devil
is in the details, and I am concerned that there may be other assumptions
(besides the two the author carefully defends) that might make this
approach less palatable.
If, as I hope, some version of this work is ultimately published, given its
remarkable breadth and potential significance, I would encourage the editors
to invite several commentaries on it. I personally would not feel qualified to
write a commentary, but I could happily suggest individuals who could.

I noticed a number of typos througout the manuscript that I am confident
would be caught by a good copy editor.

Summary
This highly ambitious manuscript attempts to provide a general

to meta-research/meta-science (the science of science). Drawing on

I thank the referee for a careful and accurate characterization of the
manuscript’s scope and content.
Evaluation
I must acknowledge at the outset that although I am familiar with
information theory I am nowhere near sufficiently well versed
with it, nor mathematically skilled enough to evaluate the details
of its treatment here. The author could very well have some major
flaws in his logic or math that would completely escape me. I thus
find myself in the peculiar position of being extremely enthusiastic

however understand the reason for my enthusiasm. The author

devil is in the details, and I am concerned that there may be other
assumptions (besides the two the author carefully defends) that
might make this approach less palatable.
I appreciate the reviewer’s positive assessment of the potential of the
manuscript, and I understand his concerns about the consistency of the
mathematics. Reviewer 2 has taken on this task to a remarkable extent.
However, I welcome the suggestion of additional mathematical review
and RSOS’ editors would be very welcome to solicit an additional
reviewer purely to check the soundness of the mathematics, to any
extent that they deem this appropriate.
I noticed a number of typos througout the manuscript that I am
confident would be caught by a good copy editor.
I thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The manuscript was revised
in some parts, and I hope to have caught a fair number of typos. I will
be pleased, if and when the manuscript is accepted, to have it checked
further for typos.
Reviewer 2:
This work is fascinating, but perhaps the most difficult paper I’ve
ever had to review. If I have understood correctly, the scope of Dr.
Fanelli’s ideas are wide-ranging and of fundamental importance.
However, this is a massive work, and I admit there are parts I

grateful if these could be addressed.
I thank the reviewer for the positive comments and the work that
he/she has thus far put into examining my manuscript. I appreciate that
its length and breadth may turn away readers, and I have extensively
revised the manuscript to improve its clarity, both in the passages
highlighted by the reviewers, as well as other passages.
Furthermore, I took the opportunity of this revision to add a few
paragraphs, in particular:
-the discussion section has been structured around subsections, and
includes a new section detailing testable predictions.
The abstract is a powerful statement of intent, and relatively clear
– but QRP should be defined use.
The acronym has been removed from the abstract
It might be worth explaining what this means to the reader first,
potentially with a simple coin flip example, for as the author
himself points out, AIT and information theory are not commonly
used in meta-research, and to encourage use requires
demystification so that others may see the merit of this approach.
I appreciate this suggestion and have modified the relevant section by
explaining in very simple and intuitive terms what information is, and
what Shannon’s entropy does.
Other parts of the text have been revised to ensure a broader
accessibility.
RV is random variable presumably, but this should be defined.
The nature of the abbreviation is now explained at the start of the
introduction.
My major issue with this section is that I do not see clearly how the
pivotal equation 2.1 was arrived at, and from whence it came. I do
not dispute it’s rectitude, but I think as it’s so fundamental to the
work, it’s origin needs to be made clearer.
The equation was originally derived following the “theoretical
argument” presented in section b. This point has now been made
clearer by adding: 1) further details in the last paragraph of the
introduction (where the various sections of the manuscript are listed),
2) in section b, with sentences explaining that this was how the
equation was arrived at.
Is information still considered finite if something is entirely
random? Say a radioactive decay. I think it still is (it would just
have very high entropy) but I wanted to check I understood
correctly.
Yes, it would be. The reviewer’s observation points to a genuine
element of potential confusion (and a source of considerable
philosophical discussion): the distinction between the nature of
phenomena and the nature of knowledge about those phenomena.
For the purposes of a theory of knowledge, what reality ultimately
looks like is irrelevant, because what counts is how the world is
represented to/by us.
The rate of radioactive decay, to be known, would need to be
measured to some finite level of accuracy, thereby generating a finitely
describable explanandum.
The description of this postulate has been modified to clarify this
distinction (it now talks more explicitly about “representation”), and
the relevant SI text has also been edited.
In figure 1, (a), (b), (e) and (f) are functions of a single variable, X.
But 1(c) is a function of two variables (ie: it’s always multi-valued)
as is the even more complex 1(d). Can we still straight- forwardly
apply the framework here with multiple dependence? Apologies if
I’m misunderstanding this.
Yes, absolutely, although I appreciate the potential for confusion.
In the figure, the “r” of the circle radius is actually a constant, and so I
replaced it with an actual value. That said, any number of variables, if
combined, just produce another variable. This point was made clearer
in the section that introduces the concept of information.
Moreover, some of the examples given in the results section show how
multivalued functions (e.g. the reproductive skew example) are
translated into K.
My previous question might stem from a poor understanding the
mutual information theorem – as I understand it, MIT measures
information shared by X and Y. In a circle above, X and Y are not
independent, so perhaps that’s fine. It would be worth clarifying
this in the text, as this will not be known to the typical meta-
researcher.
I may be misinterpreting the point, but the X and Y in all the figure’s
example are non-independent, except the first. The latter would be the
only case in which I(Y;X)=0. As mentioned above, I tried to make the
concept of information and mutual information more accessible, and
the reviewer is welcome to assess whether more background
introductory material is necessary.
F and g here are not clearly defined; are these functions?
Yes, they were intended to represent generic (non-specified, but
specifiable in principle) functions. The concept has now been
explained in the relevant text. At the same time, parts of this section
have been simplified and others (e.g. the SI about the Chi squared and
that about Akaike’s Information Criterion) have been removed to
avoid distracting complications. These analyses are better left to
future, dedicated articles.
Figure 3: This is hard to interpret as I’m still unsure of where
equation 2.1 arrived from, and what values of K describe
impressive ‘knowledge’ versus only middling. For example ,the co-
efficient of determination in the first figure suggests that for
perfect correlation, K is still small (~0.12): I think this might be
easier to understand if the formal definition was clarified further.
The value of K is “system-specific”, in the sense that its specific value
depends on numerous factors that, as was mentioned in the text
corresponding to this figure, modulate the value of K. For example, for
any given system, the R^2 can only vary between 0 and 1, depending
on total and residual variances but the values of K, albeit always in
one-to-one correspondence with the R^2, will vary depending on the
value of tau, n, and the entropy of explanandum (accuracy) and other
factors.
The value of 0.12 in the future is due to the arbitrary combination of
such values used to simulate the results. The details of such numbers
are provided in the R code provided with the article.
In order to facilitate understanding, the figure caption has been re-
created to have the same scale on the y axis, and the caption has been
modified to explain what the value of $\tau$ is.
This alludes to the derivation of 2.1 – please make clearer. The rest
of the section I quite like, but there is some risk of tautology –
equation 2.16 taken to limits of infinity yields a K of 0,
independent of tau, which is presented as a further argument for
the postulate. But that is only the case if we’re confident that K is
well-derived. And again, while I am confident it is, I’d like to see
it’s derivation clearly presented so I might better understand.
As I hope the text now explains better, the equation is indeed derived
from the same argument that this passage is referring to. i.e. the
“theoretical” argument.
This is not the only argument for the finiteness of information.
Another quantitative argument is given when discussing Ockham’s
razor and when discussing the relation between K and resolution.
More discursive arguments are also given in the SI.
The argument for the exponential form of 2.25 is quite technical,
and not immediately clear (S6).
I thank the referee for paying attention to these aspects of the text,
which are only apparently “supplementary”. In addition to being
admittedly a little obscure, the passage also contained a few regrettable
typos in the equations.
In addition to correcting the latter and generally revising the equations
and texts for typos throughout the text, I have entirely re-written the
section to make the argument more intuitive and pragmatic. The
section is now much longer, because this concept is particularly
important and deserves attention.
The electron mass is taken from NIST data to be 9.10938356 x
10E-31 +/- 0.00000011 x 10E- 31 ; I am not sure where the current
figure is from, or how the uncertainty is being reported?
The value reported came from the Particle Data Group 2014 edition
http://pdg.lbl.gov/2014/listings/rpp2014-list-electron.pdf
However, I am happy to go with the recommended value in NIST, and
I have amended the text accordingly. The corresponding K would be
slightly higher, as the error in this estimation is smaller.
More importantly, however, I have now slightly changed the analysis:
whereas before I was calculating the value for a nine-digit number, I
decided that the most general case and in fact the most conservative
approach ought to consider the entirety of the length of the number,
which has 39 digits. The calculations have been amended accordingly.
I have also added some text in this example to emphasize how the
value of K is “system specific” also in the sense that the scale of
measurement used – being part of how a system is defined – will make
a difference on the value of $K$.
The K’s here seem much higher than the K’s in figure 3. This is
causing me some confusion; if I have a perfected R2, it might quite
likely be because I know the precise relationship between two
things. For example, above. Shouldn’t these two have high K
scores?
It would depend on how the system is specified, and consequently on
the values of multiple factors.
Firstly, it would depend on the resolution, i.e. the number of partitions
in which Y and X are measured, as this determines their entropies.
Second, it would depend on the value of nY and nX.
Lastly, and most importantly, it would depend on what tau is assumed
to consist in, and the language (alphabet, grammar) used to encode it.
In the example given, assuming the tau is solely represented by the
mathematical relations, tau could be described as the number of
alphanumeric characters of, say, eight bits each (256 bits).
Assuming the resolution and n values are the same in the two figures,
the second curve would have a lower K compared to the first, because
the description length of the tau is at least one bite longer. The longer
description length of course reflects the slightly higher complexity of a
curve compared to a line.
This is also illustrated in the two examples of simulations with
different levels of resolution, shown in S5 appendix.
This system-specific dependence is one of the key novelties of K. If K
was identical to R2, then of course there would be no point in using it
and not the latter.
I think this work is exceptionally promising, but as it stands I am
still finding it difficult to ascertain precisely how the pivotal
relationship asserted was arrived at. Consequently I feel I would
be in a better place to interpret the work if this question (and the
ones I have arrived at here) could be answered.
I am extremely grateful to the reviewer for the through attention paid
in his/her assessment. I understand that this is an unusual paper and I
shall be looking forward to receiving more invaluable feedback.
Appendix D
Fanelli Revised manuscript.
I liked this manuscript very much the first time I reviewed it but was
concerned that my lack of mathematical depth precluded me from evaluating
the nuances of its mathematical elements. I am encouraged by the deep and
thoughtful review of the other referee, and the apparently thoughtful manner
in which the author addresses the many issues raised. I feel confident that if
the other reviewer approves of the revision that the technical arguments are
sufficiently compelling to deserve vetting by the larger scientific community.
As I read this manuscript over with fresh eyes, several ways in which I could
see it fruitfully developed came to mind. I will leave it to the editor whether
these should be addressed in the current version or considered at a later date.
Anomalous cognition. It is easy to dispense with an area (e.g. astrology) for
which there is only one credible study and it showed the domain had no merit
whatsoever. But what about other areas of study that are often disparaged as
pseudoscience but for which there are more regularly reported significant
effects. Specifically, how would this approach evaluate domains of
anomalous cognition (pre-cognition, psychokinesis and telepathy for which
there is more, if admittedly still questionable evidence (see Schooler et al,
2018 for a list of meta-analyses). It would be interesting to see how this
model handles the thorny issues of one of these domain.
Predictive coding- I was intrigued by the authors suggestion that this approach
relates to much of cognition, and in particular the capacity to make
predictions. Here it would be very interesting to learn how the author see his
project relating to Friston, (e.g. Friston (2010) approach to predictive coding
Integrated information theory. The reliance on information theory to address
the issues of meta-science has some parallels to its application to
understanding consciousness. I am very curious about the relationship
between this approach and that of IT theory of Tononi (e.g. Tononi’s 2008).
Again I believe that the present work has already covered more than enough
ground, though might be worthwhile briefly allude to some or all of these
areas.

Dear Madame/Sir,
I again wish to thank both referees for their helpful comments, which I have taken into
careful consideration and addressed as described below. I have also finalized the figures,
reshaping some illustrations and adding clarifying titles.
Kind regards,

Reviewer 1
I have very little to add since my last review - apologies for my tardiness. The
author has kindly addressed my major questions, and I am satisfied with the
response. The examples are very useful, and I wonder if there's merit in applying
these more early on, but this is a minor point given the manuscript is well laid out,
but highly information dense. I am satisifed the paper will make a valuable addition
to literature.
I thank the reviewer for helping improve the manuscript. Following the suggestion to
present the examples earlier on, I have moved the table presenting the summary of results
to the introduction, in order to give the reader an immediate sense of where the
(admittedly dense) methodological section is heading. The table now includes a column
with the section corresponding to each meta-scientific question, to point the reader to
results and example that he/she may find of interest.

I really appreciate the constructive suggestions for further developments of the
manuscript. As the reviewer noticed, the essay is very long and there is no space to
discuss the relation between the theories mentioned and K theory. Future work could
explore the connections, but it should be emphasized that K theory differs from that of
Friston and of Tononi both in its scope and in its mathematical structure. Therefore, I
have added the following sentence in the discussion:
“Finally, K theory was developed independently from other recent
attempts to give informational accounts of cognitive phenomena, for
example the free-energy principle (e.g. [79]) and the integrated
information theory of consciousness (e.g. [80]). Whereas these theories
bear little resemblance to that proposed in this essay, they obviously
share a common objective with it, and possible connections may be
explored in future research.”
For what concerns the field of anomalous cognition, addressing its status
is beyond the scope of this work. All I can say is that K theory offers
the theoretical and empirical tools to assess the epistemological status of
this and any other controversial research field.
The text has been proof-read once more, in the hope of catching other
typographical errors, and further edited for clarity.
