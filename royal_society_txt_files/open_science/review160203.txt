The manuscript entitled “Foot pressure distributions during walking in African elephants
(Loxodonta africana)” addresses a topic that is interesting, timely and in the scope of the journal.
The organization and the written of the manuscript is satisfactory.
However, the contributions attained from the work presented are somewhat difficult to identify;
additional, the study conducted has several limitations and drawbacks.
Therefore, the Reviewer recommends the following improvements/changes:
- The contributions achieved with this study relatively to the actual knowledge should be
properly identified and justified.
- Authors are comparing the actual results against the ones presented in a previous study of the
same authors; hence, the sample studied in that previous study should be described and the main
findings resumed in this manuscript so the reader can easily compare the two studies.
- The authors performed a manual registration of the images to be compared, which is very prune
to errors; however, several methods have been proposed for such a goal, there interesting reviews
about this issue are: 1) “Analysis of Biomedical Images based on Automated Methods of Image
Registration”, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol 8887, ISBN: 978-3-319-14248-7, DOI:

The authors should discuss the possibility of using these automatically methods in their study as
such methods are faster and less prune to errors.
- The limitations of the study should be identified and discussed, including due to the small and
heterogeneous sample study and to the manual registration performed.

I don’t have any knowledge about Elephants and therefore I might have missed some crucial
issues. However, I like watching elephants when I travel in south Africa. Nevertheless, the
introduction presents a lot of background regarding possible foot diseases in elephants.
However, it is unclear what the current study adds to the understanding of foot diseases in
elephants. I would suggest to focus more on the what pressure measurements (in particular the
current study) adds to the management of foot disease in elephants. Is peak pressure a risk factor
for pain, which might be in humans but has also not clearly proven in humans in the literature. Is
the roll-off important?
An important issue seems to be the trimming on the feet. I don’t think the current study can
answer if trimming on the feet reduces the risk factor. Although there was a difference in foot
care protocol between the Asian and African elephants, the differences found between these
elephants can be due to the natural difference between these elephants. Moreover, if the main
purpose of this study is to compare Asian and African elephants than this should be clear in the
introduction. However, different pressure plates are used and this might result in different
outcomes. Furthermore, the peak pressures seems to be 1.5 higher in the African elephants
because of the weight. Comparison between these elephants should take the body weight into
account. Moreover, is a number of 5 elephants enough to compare both elephants?
Many things are measured but these are also not mentenioned in the introduction why these
should be measured? For example, the position of the ROI in relation to the peak pressure found.
This has to do with the validity and reliability of the method. Is this also the purpose of the study.
Hence, the introduction should be more focused on the purpose of the study and in accordance to
the methods and results.
Why are the Asian elephants not described in the methods while results of these elephants are
presented in the results?
It is unclear why is chosen for such a small ROI’s? The peak pressure of this region is of interest
and the region are far from each other.
I doubt if data of 5 elephants has enough power for linear mixed effects model?
In the results section, the outcome variable has to be clearly indicated. Do not use ‘peak pressure’
or pressure for the same outcome and clearly define maximum peak pressure.
Data of the Asian elephants are presented in the results while nothing is described in the
methods. When a comparison is made in the results both measurements should be described.
Comparisons with the literature are usually described in the discussion.
For a clear comparison between the Asian and African elephants, statistically methods should be
used. However, is a number of 5 elephants enough for such a comparison?
The discussion should be related to a clear focus in the introduction. Because this is not clear
now, it is hard to review the discussion.
They conclude that peak pressure patterns do not alter between species. However, a 1.5x increase
in maximum peak pressures in the African elephants were found. Moreover, no clear (statistical)
5
comparison between the pressure pattern between African and Asian elephants have been
described.

Comments to the Author:
Three reviewers have evaluated your paper on foot pressures in elephants. While the reviewers
raise a number of concerns to be addressed in revision, I note that many of the limitations
highlighted by the reviewers have been acknowledged and discussed within the paper, and the
authors point out that the main focus of the current study is to evaluate the ‘overall similarities
and differences in pressure patterns between the two samples of elephants’. This seems to me to
be a reasonable approach, but the authors should revise the text in light of the reviewers’
comments to ensure that the limitations of the study and the main findings are communicated as
clearly as possible. Additionally, the authors should ensure that the broader implications of the
findings for elephant biology and husbandry are discussed. Are there any specific ways that the
current findings inform elephant foot care and husbandry?
The authors note that the walking speed was at a Fr = 0.07, which they state is indicative of a
‘normal walk’. I think it is worth noting that this is a fairly slow walk, and foot pressures would
be expected to increase substantially with speed. I would be useful if the authors could comment
on how representative the current findings at a slow walk are likely to be. Do the authors have
any data on how pressure distribution and COP trajectory changes with speed? How do the
speeds measured here compare to the locomotor speeds exhibited by the animals during their
normal daily activities?
I note that the authors have provided their supporting data in spreadsheets- thank you for
supporting the open data mission of RSOS. Please ensure that these files are labeled/annotated
with sufficiently descriptive names (including units of measurement) so that the reader and
future users of the data can fully interpret them. In ‘Supplementary_Data_2.xlsx’, the meaning of
the column labels ‘Data 1…Data 5’ is not clear. The same issue is present in the third file. While a
user could infer what the data should be from the text of the paper, the dataset should be labeled
so that it is clear enough without direct reference to the text.
If the authors feel that they can address the concerns raised by the reviewers, I will be happy to
see a revised version of this paper submitted to RSOS, along with a point by point response
addressing each of the points raised.

See Appendix A.
Dear Editors
We thank you, and the three anonymous reviewers, for constructive criticisms of our
manuscript (MS. No. RSOS-160203) “Foot pressure distributions during walking in African
elephants (Loxodonta africana)”. We have addressed all comments and we believe that the
quality of our study is now improved. We list each of the Reviewer's/Editor’s comments
below in turn, followed by our response and action. We have highlighted all changes in the
submitted revised manuscript in yellow.
Yours sincerely,
Olga Panagiotopoulou
Associate Editor
Comment 1: The Associate Editor noted that a number of concerns raised by the reviewers
have already been acknowledged and discussed within the paper. However, the editor
suggested we revise the text in light of the reviewers’ comments to ensure that the limitations
and main findings of our study are communicated in a clear manner.
Our response to Comment 1: We have revised the paper in light of the AE’s summary of the
reviewers’ main points and we feel we have addressed this issue of limitations and clarity
much better now.
Comment 2: The Editor asked us to discuss the implications of our findings for elephant
biology and husbandry.
Our response to Comment 2: We have now expanded on the implications of our study and
added lines 418-458.
Comment 3: The authors note that the walking speed was at a Fr = 0.07, which they state is
indicative of a ‘normal walk’. I think it is worth noting that this is a fairly slow walk, and foot
pressures would be expected to increase substantially with speed. It would be useful if the
authors could comment on how representative the current findings at a slow walk are likely
to be. Do the authors have any data on how pressure distribution and COP trajectory
changes with speed? How do the speeds measured here compare to the locomotor speeds
exhibited by the animals during their normal daily activities?
Our response to Comment 3: We have added commentary on this point in the MS. For an
elephant it is a fairly normal, casual walking speed, and a recent study (Lee et al. 2016; added
to text) noted that larger animals tend to prefer to walk at slower Fr values so this fits that
pattern. However, as noted (lines 324-331) the pressures would increase with speed (if
modestly during walking). Our subjects self-selected their speeds so we were unable to obtain
a broad range and detailed sample of data for different speeds as we might in a lab
environment (but with less wild animals and management conditions); this is an important
trade off of our study that we have added note of.
Comment 4: The Editors asked for a clearer labelling of our Supplementary files.
Our response to Comment 3: We have now edited all Supplementary files and have clarified
the headings.
Reviewer 1
Comment: “An identical study on hard substrate would be a very good addition to this
study”.
Our response to Comment: We agree with Reviewer 1 that a direct comparison between our
subjects and elephants kept in hard substrates and limited space would be a good addition to
our study. We deem that this would be another study altogether-- and far from simple to
arrange comparable and large samples for. However, our study is the first to measure
locomotor pressures in elephants kept in natural/semi-wild environments and our data
allowed us to draw some conclusions about the function of elephant feet during walking in
these conditions. We hope that our data will be used as preliminary controls by zoo keepers
and veterinarians to monitor the health of the feet in elephants reared in confined spaces with
hard (or other) substrates.
Reviewer 2
Comment 1: “The contributions achieved with this study relatively to the actual knowledge
should be properly identified and justified”.
Our response to Comment 1: We agree that our initial submission had not communicated the
novelty and implications of our findings for elephant biology and husbandry. We have now
expanded on our Discussion and added lines 418-458.
Comment 2: A description of the Asian sample from the Panagiotopoulou et al. 2012 study is
needed. Specifically the reviewer noted “Authors are comparing the actual results against the
ones presented in a previous study of the same authors; hence, the sample studied in that
previous study should be described and the main findings resumed in this manuscript so the
reader can easily compare the two studies”.
Our response to Comment 2: We agree with Reviewer 2 that inclusion of a brief description
of the Asian sample presented in our previous study is important for our comparisons to be
presented in a clearer manner. We have now edited the manuscript and added lines 162-166
“The Asian elephants in Panagiotopoulou et al. (2012, [4]) were reared in more typical
captive safari park environments from two zoological parks in Bedfordshire, UK (the
Zoological Society of London’s Whipsnade Zoo and Woburn Safari Park) and received
regular foot trimming for disease prevention. Their age and body mass at the time of data
collection varied from 31 days and 120 kg to 27 years and 3332 kg”.
Comment 3: The use of manual rather than automatic registration is a major limitation of
our study and asked us to reiterate this major limitation in the Discussion.
Our response to Comment 3: We appreciate the list of citations Reviewer 2 provided us with;
however, we disagree with this comment. We have found that existing pedobarographic
registration algorithms that have been developed for human feet (e.g. Pataky et al. 2008;
Oliveira et al. 2010) do not perform consistently well on elephant feet. Contrary to human
foot shapes, which possess consistently distinguishable asymmetries, elephant feet are very
symmetrical and this symmetry compromises both automatic registrations and automated foot
identification. Rather than developing a new elephant-specific registration algorithm, we
registered the images manually using a graphical-user interface. This approach has been
shown to perform equally well to optimal algorithmic registration in humans (Pataky et al.
2008).
To make this point clearer we edited lines 209-211 which now read “Existing automatic
pedobarographic registration algorithms that have been previously developed for human feet
[24] do not perform well on elephant data due to their symmetrical shapes”.
Comment 4: Discuss the limitations posed due to our small and heterogeneous sample size.
Our response to Comment 4: We accessed the maximum number of animals possible.
Nevertheless, despite the small sample size there was sufficient power to infer differences
amongst the ROI regions. Null results including ANOVA interactions could have been
secondary to small sample size and inadequate statistical power, but since our hypotheses did
not pertain directly to those effects we believe that sample size and power were adequate for
this study. To clarify sample size further we added lines 400-412 which now read “Our
sample size (as in [4]) was admittedly small; nevertheless, despite the small sample size there
was sufficient statistical power to infer differences amongst the ROIs. Null results including
ANOVA interactions could have been secondary to small sample size and inadequate
statistical power, but since our hypotheses did not pertain directly to those effects we believe
that sample size and power were adequate for this study. There are no currently published
data that indicate the optimal sample size to use in locomotor studies on foot pressures.
Sample size depends largely on a number of factors including variability of the traits
measured and accessibility of the animal participants. In this study we have measured the
maximum number of elephants available. Comparisons of small numbers of individuals are of
course limited statistically, constituting more of a descriptive/anecdotal sample than a truly
robust one in statistical terms, but we have reported the variability in our data, and are
conservative with our comparisons and conclusions. We seek to describe broad patterns of
movement in these species, and describe interesting similarities and differences”.
We recorded variations in pressure magnitudes within the African subjects which are likely
due to body mass, but as we highlight in lines 151-153, “The elephants’ weights could not be
measured during data collection and all body masses thus were based on anecdotal
approximations by the park keepers”. We also reported (Table 1) variations in pressure
magnitudes between species which are likely due to differences in age, body mass, and the
specifications of the hardware used. We believe we have sufficiently clarified this limitation
in Lines 347-351. See also our response below to Reviewer 3’s Comment 5.
Reviewer 3
Comment 1: Focus the introduction more to the scope of the study and suggested a list of
points to address such as the validity of the ROI approach, the effect of body weight on our
pressure findings, the link between our results and foot management and clarifications about
trimming.
Our response to Comment 1: ROI approaches are common in the foot pressure literature. In
particular the ROI approach in this study is more anatomically consistent (and thus more
anatomically valid) than standard approaches which consider much broader foot areas, and
thus poorer anatomical resolution. We disagree that these are points that need to be included
in the Introduction section since they mostly relate to the implications and limitations rather
than the scope of our study. We highlight the limitations of the ROI approach in Lines 338-
346 which read “Whilst the ROI approach is a useful technique to measure pressures on
specific foot regions, it overlooks intra-region variability by assuming that all zones are
functionally independent. Our sensitivity analysis showed a significant interaction between
the topological location of each ROI and the pressure magnitudes (Figure 2), confirming that
the ROI approach underestimates intra-region variability and can influence pressure
magnitudes, making the inclusion of sensitivity analysis to measure the degree of variation an
essential prerequisite. Nevertheless, this limitation did not influence the credibility of this
study, which is focused on the overall similarities and differences in pressure patterns
between the two samples of elephants, rather than the exact pressure magnitudes”.
Comment 2: Data from the Asian elephants are presented in the Results while nothing is
described in the Methods, but when a comparison is made in the Results both measurements
should be described.
Our response to Comment 2: Good point. Information about the Asian sample has now been
added in lines 162-166 “The Asian elephants in Panagiotopoulou et al. (2012, [4]) were
reared in more typical captive safari park environments from two zoological parks in
Bedfordshire, UK (the Zoological Society of London’s Whipsnade Zoo and Woburn Safari
Park) and received regular foot trimming for disease prevention. Their age and body mass at
the time of data collection varied from 31 days and 120 kg to 27 years and 3332 kg”.
Comment 3: Questions the choice of the ROIs since the peak pressure of this region is of
interest and the region is far from each other.
Our response to Comment 3: ROI is a standard approach to calculate pressure magnitudes but
has limitations which were discussed in our Methods and Discussion. However, these
limitations should not influence the conclusions of our study and the comparisons between
the two species since we are focused on patterns and not magnitudes. We report the pressure
magnitudes for the African elephants since the data will be useful for future research in this
area. Nevertheless, as discussed in lines 338-346 due to the limitations in our study, we are
focused on pressure patterns rather than magnitudes. For this reason, the significant
differences between the ROI locations do not influence our results but their reporting will
raise awareness for other researchers to be vigilant when using this technique for data
analysis.
Comment 4: Clearly indicate the outcome variable in the Results; reviewer advised against
the use of the term ‘peak pressure’ or pressure for the same outcome and to clearly define
maximum peak pressure.
Our response to Comment 4: We agree that ‘peak pressure’ is a non-ideal term, but it is one
that has become standard in the foot pressure literature, where it is understood to mean the
maximum pressure over time at a particular location. Introducing a new term like ‘maximum
pressure’ would create ambiguity between spatial and temporal maxima. To be consistent
with the literature we have decided to retain ‘peak pressure’ but have more clearly defined it
in the text.
Comment 5: For a clear comparison between the Asian and African elephants, statistically
robust methods should be used, but questions whether the number of 5 elephants is enough
for statistical comparison.
Our response to Comment 5: There are no currently published data that indicate the optimal
sample size to use in locomotor studies on foot pressures. Sample size depends largely on a
number of factors including variability of the traits measured and accessibility of the animal
participants. In this study we have measured the maximum number of elephants available.
This is similar to our previous in vivo studies in these groups, for example, Ren and
Hutchinson (2007) in their study published in J. Roy. Soc. Interface used only 5 elephants (3
Asian, 2 African) in their comparison. Comparisons of small numbers of individuals are of
course limited statistically, constituting more of a descriptive/anecdotal sample than a truly
robust one in statistical terms, but we have reported the variability in our data, and are
conservative with our comparisons and conclusions. We seek to describe broad patterns of
movement in these species, find interesting similarities and differences, and therefore feel
that the current study still provides a valid, novel contribution to science, especially
considering that obtaining data from elephants is far more difficult than gathering similar data
from human or other commonly studied subjects, and knowledge of elephants is thus
intrinsically more limited. Please also see our response in Reviewer 2, comment 4.
Comment 6: Better connect the Discussion with the Introduction.
Our response to Comment 6: Please see our response to Reviewer 2, Comment 1.
Comment 7: No clear (statistical) comparison between the pressure pattern between African
and Asian elephants has been described.
Our response to Comment 7: We attempted to avoid any direct comparison of mean peak
pressures between the species since these will depend on several variables including animal
mass, foot size, software threshold setting and hardware calibration procedures. Instead we
compared patterns of pressure distribution between species, which should be roughly
independent of these variables. Our results also indicated that the patterns of the COP
throughout the stride did not significantly vary between species. We contend that this is the
most scientifically robust way to treat the data we have under the prevailing limitations.
