This paper reports on the coupling of a thermochemical oscillator with a surface reaction that
leads to formation of biologically relevant dimers in a toy model used to imitate a porous
hydrothermal vent. The model consists of a series of CSTRs with porous walls through which
small species and heat are exchanged. Here the investigation revolves around the effect of non-
uniform crossflow of species and fluctuations on the concentration variations along the length of
the CSTR units.
The paper is thought-provoking and well written. It is interesting that the fluctuations, once
processed by the chemical reactions, take on a form that would favour the higher activation
energy reactions. However it’s not immediately obvious if the temporal oscillatory condition is
advantageous compared to steady state conditions as there may still be a spatial temperature
variation i.e. between CSTRs if the cross-flow is inhomogeneous. Would the latter not also suffice
as a diverse environment for polymerisation? What impact does operating under steady state
conditions with spatial variation have on the output fluctuation distribution? Similarly, on page
12, – it’s not clear that the relatively fast pH oscillations would facilitate a wide variety of
reactions, more than, for example, a spatially varying pH of similar magnitude. Do the authors
have any comment on that?
One interesting point mentioned at the start is that the cellular structure could serve for trapping
and enhancing polymer concentrations. This is worth exploring in future work.

I appreciate this paper about proposed models behind the events of the origin of life. I find it well
written with clear motivations I think the paper can be published as it is.

For a subject like this, there may be others with a more serious view, who are more critical
concerning the motivations. I accept the motivations here and the ideas of the toy model. But as
said, I like the suggestions here and the ideas about the turn of chemistry into biology.

account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Response to Reviewers’ comments
We thank the Reviewers for their thoughtful comments. Our response is as follows.
Comments of Reviewer 1:
1) "However it’s not immediately obvious if the temporal oscillatory condition is advantageous compared to
steady state conditions as there may still be a spatial temperature variation i.e. between CSTRs if the cross-
flow is inhomogeneous. Would the latter not also suffice as a diverse environment for polymerisation? What
impact does operating under steady state conditions with spatial variation have on the output fluctuation
distribution? Similarly, on page 12, – it’s not clear that the relatively fast pH oscillations would facilitate a wide
variety of reactions, more than, for example, a spatially varying pH of similar magnitude. Do the authors have
any comment on that?"
This is a fair comment. We discussed these questions quite thoroughly in ref. [40], therefore we decided to
take the well-stirred flow model and the necessity for temporal oscillations as given for this paper.
But briefly, a spatial temperature variation implies that the polymers themselves must cycle between a hot
alkaline side (or reservoir) and a cold acidic side (or reservoir). This thermoconvective cycling hypothesis has
been studied by several groups reviewed in refs. 20-22. Its major flaw is that it restricts the existence of proto-
life to the narrow environment between the hot and cold sides of hydrothermal rock pores. The temporal pH
and temperature oscillations of the THP oscillator that we have proposed liberates proto-life from this
restrictive environment.
In a spatially extended, bounded system the THP system is subject to diffusion and convection, and temporal
oscillations manifest as travelling waves and patterns. The gradients of a travelling thermo-pH wave provide a
proton motive force that may have driven primitive metabolic processes in the non-cellular RNA world.
In reality, both thermoconvection and temporal oscillations may have contributed to the dynamic, non-
equilibrium environment of life’s beginnings. However, simulation of a reactive, diffusive, convective,
randomly fluctuating system is a BIG computing project, indeed a series of big computing projects, for students
and postdocs who enjoy playing with pde solvers and boundary conditions and high-performance
computational ware.
Therefore, given that the reviewer’s question might be asked by other readers, we have inserted the following
sentence on page 7, line 7,
“The possible effects of inclusion of diffusion and convection, i.e., relaxation of the well-stirred assumption,
were canvassed in [40].”
2) "How long a time window was used for the int-av quantities?"
Thanks, we ought to have mentioned this explicitly. 50,000 seconds, in each case. We have indicated this
explicitly on page 8, line 8.
