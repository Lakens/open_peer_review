The present article describes a magnetic sorbent consisting of the combination of sporopollenin
and ß-cyclodextrin for the extraction of several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs from
water samples, the analytes being finally determined by HPLC-DAD. Although this reviewer is
not a native English speaker, I consider that the language must be revised to clarify some sections
of the manuscript. From the scientific point of view, the article is interesting, and the proposed
sorbent has potential, but the article requires a profound revision following some guidelines
which are listed below. They are organized in major and minor issues to make easier the review
of the article.
MAJOR ISSUES
1) The synthesis process should be better explained. Reading the procedure, one can infer that
sporopollenin is in-surface modified with ß-cyclodextrin, but it is not clear enough how the
MNPS are immobilized on the surface. Probably, the ions Fe (II) and Fe(III) are retained by ion
exchange in some functional groups (from sporopollenin or ß-cyclodextrin?) of the solid and
then transformed in NPs when the pH is changed. Regardless of this, the MNPs are formed over
the surface of the sporopollenin/ß-cyclodextrin and they may affect to the extraction abilities of
the sorbent. Therefore Figure 2 may be confusing as the sizes of each element is not consistent
with the reality. In summary, this part must be improved.
2) There is another fact that support the in-surface location of the MNPs. The surface area
increases dramatically when they are included in the sorbent. Due to that, please avoid the use of
the term “core” since it may be confusing. Core-shell NPs are the opposite of this proposal since
they define MNPs cores coated with a sorbent layer.
3) The characterization of the extraction procedure can be improved including the enrichment
factors and the absolute extraction recoveries of the technique.
4) In the introduction section, the authors stated that 1 ng/ml is the threshold limit established
for these compounds in waters. However, the proposed technique cannot determine ibuprofen
(the most used drug) as the LOQ is higher to this threshold. This aspect should be commented on
the paper.
5) The lower limit of a linear range should be the LOQ. Therefore, please correct the Table 2.
6) The chromatograms included in Figure are not too informative since the concentration limit is
very high (more than 100 times the LOQs). Please, select a lower concentration to demonstrate the
potential of your proposal.
MINOR ISSUES
1) The number of figures must be reduced transferring some of them to the supplementary
material
2) Please, use sorbent instead of adsorbent.
3) Line 13, Page 2. The determination of these drugs in water samples is not only limited by
sensitivity issues but also by selectivity ones.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In this work, the magnetic ß-cyclodextrin functionalized toluene diisocyanate modified bio-
polymeric spores of sporopollenin (MSp-TDI-ßCD) was prepared and used for the magnetic
solid phase extraction (MSPE) of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) namely
indoprofen (INP), ketoprofen (KTP), ibuprofen (IBP) and fenoprofen (FNP) from water samples
prior to their HPLC-DAD determination. The parameters affecting the extraction were
investigated in detail and the limits of detection of the developed method were in the range of
0.16-0.37 ng/ml for the target analytes. However, there are still some important issues need to be
addressed before the consideration of its publication.
Specific comments:
1. In the MSPE procedure, the stirring was used for the assist of both adsorption and elution, was
it mechanical stirring? Why did the authors use stirring instead of ultrasonication in MSPE? How
could the authors stir in 1.5 mL acetonitrile for elution?
2. For Figure 8-12, the Y-axis should be change to extraction efficiency other than peak area.
3. For the adsorbent dosage, as shown in Figure 9a, the peak areas of KTP and FNP decreased
with the increase of adsorbent dosage more than 10 mg, the peak area of INP decreased with the
increase of adsorbent dosage more than 20 mg, and the peak area of IBP decreased with the
increase of adsorbent dosage more than 30 mg. Why the adsorbent dosage has a different effect
on the different target analytes, the authors should explain the reasons in the manuscript.
4. As shown in Figure 9b, with the sample volume of 200 mL, the peak areas of target analytes
only increased less than 30% comparing with those of 100 mL sample solution, did it mean the
extraction efficiencies decreased sharply with the sample volume increasing from 100 to 200 mL?
The exact extraction efficiencies of the target analytes should be shown in the manuscript.
5. The effect of salt should be investigated in this work.
6. Why were the limits of quantification (LOQs) much lower than the lower limits of the linearity
range?
7. The comparison of prepared material with other adsorbents used for the extraction of target
analytes in other works should be provided in the manuscript.

label_comment_7
The authors have done a good work on the revision of the manuscript. However, two aspects
remain (see below). This reviewer intends to increase the potential of the research expanding the
impact of it on the scientific community as much as possible.
1) In the previous report, this reviewer asked for the introduction of the enrichment factor since
8
this parameter is usually considered by researchers on the sample treatment field to evaluate the
efficiency of a given sorbent material. However, this reviewer meant the real preconcentration
factor and not the potential one. The reported value (286) by the authors is obtained considering
an absolute extraction recovery of 100 % (dividing the sample volume, 200mL, by the final extract
volume, 0.7 mL). In fact, the absolute extraction recovery is usually different for diverse analytes.
I agree with the authors that, as they well stated, “relative extraction recoveries were sufficient to
be carried out when deals with real samples”. In other words, the relative extraction recoveries
demonstrate an excellent accuracy, but they do not inform about the efficiency of the extraction
procedures. This information is provided by the absolute extraction recovery and the
preconcentration factor.
This is not a critical aspect but the intention of this reviewer was (and it is) to strength the article
and to increase the impact of it in the analytical science community. I consider that the inclusion
of the real enrichment factor and the real absolute extraction recovery will make the article more
attractive for those scientists, like me, interested in new materials for sample treatment. This info
would increase the number of potential citations.
If the real enrichment factors are not finally calculated, please delete the “calculated enrichment
factor was 286” because it is not an exact data.
2) The authors admit that “our proposed technique was not precise and not accurate to
quantification of IBP below 1.22 ng/mL”. The authors also stated that “1 ng/ml is the threshold
limit established for these compounds in waters”. This info would deserve some discussion in the
conclusion section. This limitation does not reduce the merit of the study. The recognition of
limitations of the research on the conclusions is not a negative thing (it must be normal in
science), and it increases the reliance of the reader on the research developed.
In summary, the research is fascinating, and these two aspects may increase, even more, its
potential.

contradictory results were reported. Most previous reported, in
extraction procedures, the salt effect has given restricted effect either
no effect on the extraction efficiency of NSAIDs. Generally, the ion-
exchange interaction may be decreased between NSAIDs and sorbent
as the addition of salt increased. As the result, extraction efficiency
might decrease. Another aspect should take into consideration was the
addition of salt might change the physiochemical properties of
extraction. It can reduce the diffusion rates of NSAIDs into organic
solvent thus reducing extraction efficiency. Hence, the most of
previously published works have been studied without salt alteration.
As for this manuscript, we strongly believe that salt effect can be
excluded in this study and the parameters have been discussed in this
manuscript were sufficient for publication.

Appendix B
Dear Editor,
Thank you for your useful comments and suggestions on the structure of our
manuscript. We have revised the manuscript accordingly, and detailed corrections are listed
below point by point as well as highlighted in the revised manuscript.

Dear Reviewer #1
Comments:
1. In the previous report, this reviewer asked for the introduction of the enrichment factor
since this parameter is usually considered by researchers on the sample treatment field to
evaluate the efficiency of a given sorbent material. However, this reviewer meant the real
preconcentration factor and not the potential one. The reported value (286) by the authors is
obtained considering an absolute extraction recovery of 100 % (dividing the sample volume,
200mL, by the final extract volume, 0.7 mL). In fact, the absolute extraction recovery is usually
different for diverse analytes.
I agree with the authors that, as they well stated, “relative extraction recoveries were sufficient
to be carried out when deals with real samples”. In other words, the relative extraction
recoveries demonstrate an excellent accuracy, but they do not inform about the efficiency of
the extraction procedures. This information is provided by the absolute extraction recovery and
the preconcentration factor. This is not a critical aspect but the intention of this reviewer was
(and it is) to strength the article and to increase the impact of it in the analytical science
community. I consider that the inclusion of the real enrichment factor and the real absolute
extraction recovery will make the article more attractive for those scientists, like me, interested
in new materials for sample treatment. This info would increase the number of potential
citations.
If the real enrichment factors are not finally calculated, please delete the “calculated enrichment
factor was 286” because it is not an exact data.
Responds:
Thank you for valuable comments. We appreciate the comments and opinions by the reviewer
regarding this point. The sentence “calculated enrichment factor was 286” has been deleted
since the real enrichment factors was not finally calculated.
Comments:
2. The authors admit that “our proposed technique was not precise and not accurate to
quantification of IBP below 1.22 ng/mL”. The authors also stated that “1 ng/ml is the threshold
limit established for these compounds in waters”. This info would deserve some discussion in
the conclusion section. This limitation does not reduce the merit of the study. The recognition
of limitations of the research on the conclusions is not a negative thing (it must be normal in
science), and it increases the reliance of the reader on the research developed.
Responds:
Thank you for highlight regarding this issues to us.
For your information, we already added the explanation this limitation in conclusion section.
Please refer to page 10 with red highlighted sentences.
