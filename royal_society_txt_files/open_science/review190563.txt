The manuscript reports on an observational study of dance development in the Java sparrow.
Dance development in songbirds has been too little studied, and is potentially important
especially because of possible comparisons with song development. A limitation of the present
study is that only the simplest measurements of dance were made: whether dancing occurs,
whether dancing is paired with song, and whether dancing occurs in a duet with a partner.
Without more sophisticated measures of dance performance, the study cannot really show that
performance improves through the period of practice. By contrast, studies of song duets have
tested whether temporal coordination and duet code adherence improve over time. With dance
duets, some analog of temporal coordination presumably could be measured, but that was not
attempted here. A further step would be to study dance development experimentally, in the way
that has been with song development starting with the classic studies of Thorpe and Marler. For
example, one could isolate young birds and study dance development in the absence of external
models – but one would still have to have more sophisticated measures of the dance to decide
whether the form of the dance is altered by isolation.
The authors do provide convincing evidence of certain developmental trends: the frequency of
dancing goes up with age, co-occurrence of dancing with song increases with age, and duet
dancing increases with age. But given the limitations of the dance measurements that are made,
not a lot can be concluded from these results. There is very little indication on whether dancing
skill increases with age, on whether practice is necessary to dance properly, or on whether young
birds learn anything from observing others dance. The authors have no evidence on whether
dance in young birds has a communicative function or is necessary for coordinated singing and
dancing (hypotheses mentioned in their introduction). The developmental trends that are
observed could be due simply to changes in motivation to dance combined with the known
developmental patterns of song.
Lines 15-16: I don’t see what in the results suggests that early social experience is essential for the
development of courtship. The authors would have to make an explicit argument on this point if
they want to include this claim.
Lines 36-40: these statements are hypotheses, not predictions. I’m not sure why these hypotheses
are mentioned here since they are not tested in the paper.
Lines 58-59: the previous study does not show that duet dancing is crucial to mating success in
the sense of causing higher mating success. The authors might say that duet dancing is associated
with mating success in that study, but the results of that study do not show that duet dancing is
causal.
Line 91: to say that birds were “audibly isolated” means that one could hear that they were
isolated. A better wording would be to say is that the birds were not “acoustically isolated.”
Line 143: Can you give an estimate of time investment in dance practice? It does seem that you
have the data to do so.

This is a well written piece that touches on numerous aspects of important theory with respect to
the development and expression of courtship behaviour in birds. I find the introduction to be
very compelling, setting up the study nicely. The authors ask whether the ‘dancing’ aspects of
courtship develop over time, in a similar fashion to courtship song, showing convincingly that it
does. I am not a bird person so am not certain of their claims this is the first time this has been
shown, but nevertheless the data support the claim. Secondly the authors ask whether social
conditions affect the development of dance and the co-occurrence of song and dance. Here is
where the study and interpretation get a bit more tricky. First, the authors change the housing
conditions of juveniles for brief periods during development - keeping them with the family unit
(which is confusingly not defined in the main text, does it contain other juvenile birds?) or the
paired condition in which birds are kept with other juveniles (male or female). They ask whether
the onset of dance (confusingly called ‘occurrence’ but should probably be changed to ‘onset’),
the rate of dance (‘number of dance bouts’), and the co-occurrence of song and dance are affected
by these social contexts. From these treatments and measurements, my take away message is that
the number of dances increases in the paired condition, which may be a consequence of greater
opportunities or motivation when meeting a juvenile (because whether this is the only time is see
a juvenile or not I cannot tell as I don’t understand whether the family condition also contains
juveniles), or may be a function of the familiarity of the juvenile partner as the authors claim - the
frequency of dancing may be higher when the focal bird does not know its partner, at least
initially, but then becomes familiar and increases the frequency of bouts with better known birds.
The co-occurrence of dance and song increases with age, but not with social conditions.
While I have some reservations about how well the methodology addresses some of the points
raised in the introduction, I nevertheless think the paper warrants publication after some small
changes to better explain the differences in conditions and opportunity for courtship interactions
in the treatments. The main point I would like to see the authors address is how much evidence
they have that there is any aspect of social learning going on that cannot be explained by
developmental processes alone? For instance, I am not too convinced by the social aspect of
courtship learning. It rather seems that repeated interactions with the same individual (which can
4
be considered a requirement for the definition of sociality) suppress the development of the duet
dance rather than increase it (Table 3). That there are more individual dances with familiar
partners is interesting, but then we must be careful about how we discuss these results. Is this
‘social’ learning supposed to be for the development of the duet dance, which is claimed to be the
important aspect that leads to increased mating success? Or is it social facilitation of opportunity
for practice (which is not the same thing as learning e.g. from a model). Certainly the term
‘lessons’ in the title suggests one individual knows something about the dance and is teaching it
to the other, but the fact that more dances occur with familiar partners is not necessarily evidence
of this.
Aside from these conceptual points, the experiments are well controlled and statistical methods
appropriate. With some changes to the structure and argumentation I suggest this paper this can
be accepted after changes.
Minor points.
“However, this phenomenon might be explained by the fact that we lacked data on very young
birds in the paired condition (see methods).” This needs more explanation! Is there any way you
could explore the impact of these missing data points on your statistical models?
As above, does family condition also contain potential duetting partners?
What is the potential effect of familiarity arising through auditory cues alone? Are the partners
taken from within this connected auditory pool of animals?

This study aims to test for age-related and social factors influence on dance development in Java
sparrows. The idea of the manuscript is very interesting and scarce in current literature, therefore
5
I think the data should catch the attention of a wide audience. The authors provide a good
introduction which clearly justify their work, however I had several concerns regarding their
methods and, more specifically, their statistical analyses. I recommend they revise these points
and provide more details about their approach. I made several specific comments below.
Title: “Early life” should be “early-life”.
L 23: “but their developmental mechanisms have been identified only for vocalizations”. I agree
that this kind of information is lacking in literature, but later in this paragraph you’ve cited
Hoepfner & Goller (2013) in which body motions were also investigated. Please, revise.
L 37, 39: Citations could be included in the statements below, since there is evidence for these
ideas for other communication channels, such as the vocalization, and which are not necessarily
related to “animal play”.
- “communicative functions and is performed in front of conspecifics for socialization and future
pair formation”
- “it is also possible that young birds need to ‘practice’ dance for motor training, just as they do
for the acquisition of songs”
L 56: Replace “(Lonchura oryzivora; order: Passeriformes, family: Estrildidae)” by “(Lonchura
oryzivora; Passeriformes: Estrildidae)”
L 69: After reading the whole manuscript I think you did not test for “timing” changes in dance
practicing. If you intended to refer to “timing” as “age-related” changes, this is already
mentioned in this sentence.
L 87: “When the subject birds were young”: What do you mean by “young” here? How many
dph?
L 103: What is one bout of dance? More than one dance sequence (as described in lines 98 and 99)
or just one? Please, clarify.
L 106: This means that the previous GLMM included “number of dance bouts without songs”?
Also, later in the results section you use “song-dance cooccurrence” to refer to dance bouts that
accompanied song, please standardize the terms throughout the text to facilitate reading.
L 107: In L 87 you mentioned that “When the subject birds were young, we used the family
condition,”, therefore, I believe that your treatments in “age” and “experimental condition”
should be the same (i.e., correlated) . Did you test for this? How many replicates in each
treatment?
L 111: “repeated encounter with the same partner (order of pairing with the same partner)”. I did
not understand this variable, is this the number of times an individual met a specific partner or
the ordinal position in which he repeatedly met a specific partner? Please, clarify. How was your
experiment designed so that one male would repeatedly met another male? In lines 94-95 you
mentioned that “Overall, each focal male was paired with each partner 1–19 times throughout the
study.” But what was the mean number of repeated partners for all focal males?
L 116-117: Your model looks overfitted, how many samples do you have? You’ve included five
variables, but you have only nine focal males, this should be a problem and you statistical results
may not be robust. I was not clear about your sample size throughout the manuscript.
L 120: Please provide more details on your statistical approach. How did you test for model
6
validity, overdispersion in Poisson models and which R packages did you use? How did you test
for variables significance in models? There are several ways to do it using R. Please provide
references for statistical analyses. I have several concerns regarding these analyses, see also my
comments about Figure 2 (below).
L 140: The discussion needs to be revised after the appropriate statistical analyses, because results
may change.
L 277: Table 1: Estimates for categorical variables are usually presents relative to one reference
level. Here you presented “Condition (pair or family)”, which one is the reference level?
Tables 1 and 2: What is your total sample size in all models?
L 310: Y-axis in binomial distribution GLMM (c and d) is easier to understand if presented as
“probability of song-dance cooccurrence or duet dance occurrence”. This is what the line refers
to. Also, provide the y-axis scale (not only extreme values, 0 or 1).
Figure 2b. It looks like your data is “zero-inflated”, therefore your GLMM should not be valid in
its current presentation. You will probably need to use zero-inflated models in which a binomial
and zero-truncated Poisson model are built. See Zuur et al (2009) “Mixed effects models and
extensions in Ecology with R” for more details.
Figures 2b, c and d: You should present confidence intervals for all lines estimated from models
and the variance of the random factor (bird identity).

Comments to the Author:
The manuscript has been seen by three reviewers, who recommended it based on the interesting
research question but raised major concerns regarding the statistical methods and the fit of the
experimental design to the research question. It appears that some of these issues cannot be
resolved without further information, e.g. regarding sample size, possible overfitting of models,
exact specification of what was tested (for instance, there was uncertainty about the terms
“timing”, “occurrence”, “onset”). In your revision, please provide the necessary information and
clarifications and consider the suggested revision of the statistical analysis.

The authors have done an excellent job of addressing my criticisms of the previous version of
their manuscript. In particular, the addition of an analysis of dance speed and dance duration
answers my objection that dancing skill had not been measured; in my opinion this addition adds
substantially to the value of the paper.
At this stage I have only some minor suggestions on wording.
Line 10: perhaps it would make more sense to say “we propose that the practice is needed for
motor learning.”
Line 21: I find “courtship/mating dance/display” confusing. I suggest simplifying this phrase.
Line 26: I suggest “By contrast” rather than “Conversely.”
Line 38: “they” here has no obvious referent. I suggest substituting “practice dances” if that is
what you intend.
Line 41: “become” not “becomes”
Line 51: “the duets of adults” rather than “adults duets” – though you could use “adults’ duets”
Line 87: do you mean “temporary isolation” rather than “temporal isolation”?
Line 92: “raised in a different family”
Line 93: “isolated from others” rather than “isolated by others”
Lines 119-120: I am unsure of the meaning of “ordinal position in which he repeatedly met a
specific partner.” Can you clarify?
Line 155: perhaps you mean “elicited” rather than “solicited”
Line 175: I suggest “call” rather than “called”

This is my second review of this manuscript and I consider that authors did a very good job by
taking into account almost all comments provided by reviewers. My questions were almost
completely answered and I recognize author’s effort when dealing with their analyses, which
required a more advanced method giving the data nature.
Although authors were not able to use a Zero-inflated model, because of their sample size and
techniques implemented in statistical software, I was almost convinced that the zero-inflated
approach is not necessary. However, I was curious if their current models were validated,
because 95% Confidence Intervals in Figures 2b and 2c look wrong to me. They are too wide and,
if that are the correct CIs, then I think the models have serious problems and do not reflect the
best analyses for this data. Please check these CI and provide convincing information that these
models are validated. When fitting the CI, be sure you are using the correct link function of the
model (and please provide information about which one is this link function). The CI should be

Also, given the fact that sample size (number of different individuals) is small, I would leave this
information even more clear in the text, so authors may conclude by theirselves about data
quality. Therefore, I recommend you specify the number of sampled birds in Tables 1, 2 and 4
similarly as you did in Table 3.

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have done an excellent job of addressing my criticisms of the previous version of
their manuscript. In particular, the addition of an analysis of dance speed and dance duration
answers my objection that dancing skill had not been measured; in my opinion this addition adds
substantially to the value of the paper.
At this stage I have only some minor suggestions on wording.
Line 10: perhaps it would make more sense to say “we propose that the practice is needed for
motor learning.”
Line 21: I find “courtship/mating dance/display” confusing. I suggest simplifying this phrase.
Line 26: I suggest “By contrast” rather than “Conversely.”
Line 38: “they” here has no obvious referent. I suggest substituting “practice dances” if that is
what you intend.
Line 41: “become” not “becomes”
Line 51: “the duets of adults” rather than “adults duets” – though you could use “adults’ duets”
Line 87: do you mean “temporary isolation” rather than “temporal isolation”?
Line 92: “raised in a different family”
Line 93: “isolated from others” rather than “isolated by others”
Lines 119-120: I am unsure of the meaning of “ordinal position in which he repeatedly met a
specific partner.” Can you clarify?
Line 155: perhaps you mean “elicited” rather than “solicited”
Line 175: I suggest “call” rather than “called”
Line 192: I suggest “it also remains unknown why…”
Lines 203-204: “is improvised rather than stereotyped”

Comments to the Author(s)
This is my second review of this manuscript and I consider that authors did a very good job by
taking into account almost all comments provided by reviewers. My questions were almost
completely answered and I recognize author’s effort when dealing with their analyses, which
required a more advanced method giving the data nature.
Although authors were not able to use a Zero-inflated model, because of their sample size and
techniques implemented in statistical software, I was almost convinced that the zero-inflated
approach is not necessary. However, I was curious if their current models were validated,
because 95% Confidence Intervals in Figures 2b and 2c look wrong to me. They are too wide and,
if that are the correct CIs, then I think the models have serious problems and do not reflect the
best analyses for this data. Please check these CI and provide convincing information that these
models are validated. When fitting the CI, be sure you are using the correct link function of the
model (and please provide information about which one is this link function). The CI should be
relative to model fitted values and not the raw data.
Also, given the fact that sample size (number of different individuals) is small, I would leave this
information even more clear in the text, so authors may conclude by theirselves about data
quality. Therefore, I recommend you specify the number of sampled birds in Tables 1, 2 and 4
similarly as you did in Table 3.

sponse to associate editor comment (Dr Kristina Sefc):
manuscript has been seen by three reviewers, who recommended it based on the interesting research
stion but raised major concerns regarding the statistical methods and the fit of the experimental design to
research question. It appears that some of these issues cannot be resolved without further information,
regarding sample size, possible overfitting of models, exact specification of what was tested (for instance,
e was uncertainty about the terms “timing”, “occurrence”, “onset”). In your revision, please provide the
essary information and clarifications and consider the suggested revision of the statistical analysis.
We carefully revised the manuscript in response to all the reviewers’ concerns. Thanks to their
inputs, we believe that the revised manuscript gained clarity and necessary evidence. Detailed
revisions are explained below.
sponse to reviewer 1 comments:
manuscript reports on an observational study of dance development in the Java sparrow. Dance
elopment in songbirds has been too little studied, and is potentially important especially because of
sible comparisons with song development. A limitation of the present study is that only the simplest
asurements of dance were made: whether dancing occurs, whether dancing is paired with song, and
ther dancing occurs in a duet with a partner. Without more sophisticated measures of dance performance,
study cannot really show that performance improves through the period of practice. By contrast, studies
ong duets have tested whether temporal coordination and duet code adherence improve over time. With
ce duets, some analog of temporal coordination presumably could be measured, but that was not
mpted here. A further step would be to study dance development experimentally, in the way that has been
song development starting with the classic studies of Thorpe and Marler. For example, one could isolate
ng birds and study dance development in the absence of external models – but one would still have to
e more sophisticated measures of the dance to decide whether the form of the dance is altered by
ation.
authors do provide convincing evidence of certain developmental trends: the frequency of dancing goes
with age, co-occurrence of dancing with song increases with age, and duet dancing increases with age.
given the limitations of the dance measurements that are made, not a lot can be concluded from these
ults. There is very little indication on whether dancing skill increases with age, on whether practice is
essary to dance properly, or on whether young birds learn anything from observing others dance. The
hors have no evidence on whether dance in young birds has a communicative function or is necessary for
rdinated singing and dancing (hypotheses mentioned in their introduction). The developmental trends
are observed could be due simply to changes in motivation to dance combined with the known
elopmental patterns of song.
It is a great honor for us to have a chance to get our work reviewed by Prof. Searcy. Thank you.
The reviewer’s main concerns raised here are sorted into three aspects and discussed as below.
nce measurements] We totally agree with the reviewer that dance performance should be
measured precisely. We focused on three subject birds, for which we have abundant dance
samples throughout the observation period, and examined age-related changes in dance speed
(hop rate and bill-wipe rate) and dance bout duration. In accordance with our prediction that
practicing dance would contribute to motor performance, we observed age-related increase in
dance tempo and bout duration. We believe that this new finding would add scientific value. The
manuscript was revised accordingly (L10-12, 133-140, 167-173, 183, Table 4, Figure 3).
mporal measurement of duetting] We admit that it is crucial to determine ‘duetting’ for better
understanding of courtship communication in the Java sparrow. However, there are several
methodological issues that cannot be easily solved. As mentioned in the manuscript, temporal
1
structure of dancing is not fixed, which is the main difference between dance of the Java sparrow
and well-known examples of song duetting. We will definitely need a sophisticated modeling
approach to describe temporal structures of dancing, for which we will need a large number of
dance samples per individual. Only after establishing the methodology that can be applicable to
adults, we will be able to look at developmental aspects. We are very careful because we would
like to avoid type I error (erroneously detecting the presence of duet). The new results on dance
performance revealed that the birds show higher dance speed, and longer dance duration as they
get older. These changes can increase the chance that their dance motions apparently coincide
with those of their partners, where it is difficult to tell whether they actually improved their
ability to do ‘duet’. The present definition of duet is rather rough, but is robust under the
situation described above.
cial isolation] We are aware that more experimental approach, such as social isolation, would
be needed for explicit test of experience-based development of courtship dancing, but
unfortunately it is not feasible. Actually, we already had a chance to observe the behavior of the
Java sparrows that were raised under social isolation in our colleague’s lab. Socially isolated
Java sparrows show strong tendency of social phobia and behave extremely abnormally, where it
is practically impossible to observe normal courtship interactions. Even if we managed to get
some behavioral data from them, we could not tell if the poor courtship is merely due to the lack
of performance skill or reflects psychological problems. Unlike songs that can be produced in
solitary conditions, dancing always has to involve social interactions, which makes this problem
difficult. For ethical reasons, currently we do not have a plan to have socially isolated Java
sparrows. In the present manuscript, we explained that our study does have a limitation (L15-17),
and needs experimental controls of social experience (L209-219). We expect that moderate
manipulation, such as the control of the number of siblings or adults (parent), might work.
s 15-16: I don’t see what in the results suggests that early social experience is essential for the
elopment of courtship. The authors would have to make an explicit argument on this point if they want to
ude this claim.
We agree that the sentence lacked evidence. The last part of the summary was revised and now
says “our results do not show how much social experiences account for the development of
dance communication” (L15-16).
s 36-40: these statements are hypotheses, not predictions. I’m not sure why these hypotheses are
ntioned here since they are not tested in the paper.
[*1] Among the three hypotheses that we mentioned in the previous manuscript, the first one
(possible role for communication) was deleted. As the reviewer said, the present study did not
test this aspect. For the remaining two (song-dance coordination, motor performance), our
2
study presents relevant findings (figure 2b & newly added figure 3). These results are far from
conclusive because they are descriptive and lack experimental manipulations, but at least we
can say that the phenomena we observed were consistent with what we could expect form these
ideas. Just like the classic (and descriptive) birdsong studies in early time that served as a
foundation of the science of vocal learning, we hope and believe that this work could contribute
to the future development of the research area.
The word ‘predictions’ was substituted with ‘hypotheses’.
s 58-59: the previous study does not show that duet dancing is crucial to mating success in the sense of
sing higher mating success. The authors might say that duet dancing is associated with mating success in
study, but the results of that study do not show that duet dancing is causal.
We revised the misleading sentence (L57-58). Now it just says that duet dancing precedes
successful mating. We appreciate the reviewer’s effort to read our previous paper for this
review.
91: to say that birds were “audibly isolated” means that one could hear that they were isolated. A better
ding would be to say is that the birds were not “acoustically isolated.”
Thank you for the clarification. We revised the part as suggested (L94).
143: Can you give an estimate of time investment in dance practice? It does seem that you have the data
o so.
As aforementioned, we conducted additional detailed analyses on dance, which enabled us to
estimate the time investment. At peak, one male danced for 13.7 minutes (= 823.4 sec) in total
during 5-hour observation. We mentioned it in the result section (L168-169). In addition, the
fact that the Java sparrows start dancing early in life could also be seen as a time investment.
sponse to reviewer 2 comments:
s is a well written piece that touches on numerous aspects of important theory with respect to the
elopment and expression of courtship behaviour in birds. I find the introduction to be very compelling,
ing up the study nicely. The authors ask whether the ‘dancing’ aspects of courtship develop over time, in a
ilar fashion to courtship song, showing convincingly that it does. I am not a bird person so am not certain
heir claims this is the first time this has been shown, but nevertheless the data support the claim. Secondly
authors ask whether social conditions affect the development of dance and the co-occurrence of song and
ce. Here is where the study and interpretation get a bit more tricky. First, the authors change the housing
ditions of juveniles for brief periods during development - keeping them with the family unit (which is
fusingly not defined in the main text, does it contain other juvenile birds?) or the paired condition in which
s are kept with other juveniles (male or female). They ask whether the onset of dance (confusingly called
urrence’ but should probably be changed to ‘onset’), the rate of dance (‘number of dance bouts’), and the
occurrence of song and dance are affected by these social contexts. From these treatments and
asurements, my take away message is that the number of dances increases in the paired condition, which
y be a consequence of greater opportunities or motivation when meeting a juvenile (because whether this
he only time is see a juvenile or not I cannot tell as I don’t understand whether the family condition also
tains juveniles), or may be a function of the familiarity of the juvenile partner as the authors claim - the
3
uency of dancing may be higher when the focal bird does not know its partner, at least initially, but then
omes familiar and increases the frequency of bouts with better known birds. The co-occurrence of dance
song increases with age, but not with social conditions.
We really appreciate that the reviewer sees some scientific values in our study.
We added information on the family members that the subject birds grew up with (L76-77). The
subject birds were always with 1-2 siblings (brood size = 2-3) in addition to the parents
throughout their developmental period except when they were temporarily separated for the
observation under paired condition (L85-86). This means that the subjects did have abundant
chances to dance with juveniles (and actually did so in their family cages, with less frequency
than in the paired condition though), and that the paired condition was not their first time to see
juvenile birds.
We believe that the term ‘occurrence’ is relevant for describing the measurements that we took.
To avoid confusion, we also added an explanation that it means presence/absence (L107-108)
le I have some reservations about how well the methodology addresses some of the points raised in the
oduction, I nevertheless think the paper warrants publication after some small changes to better explain
differences in conditions and opportunity for courtship interactions in the treatments. The main point I
ld like to see the authors address is how much evidence they have that there is any aspect of social
ning going on that cannot be explained by developmental processes alone? For instance, I am not too
vinced by the social aspect of courtship learning. It rather seems that repeated interactions with the same
vidual (which can be considered a requirement for the definition of sociality) suppress the development of
duet dance rather than increase it (Table 3). That there are more individual dances with familiar partners is
resting, but then we must be careful about how we discuss these results. Is this ‘social’ learning supposed
e for the development of the duet dance, which is claimed to be the important aspect that leads to
eased mating success? Or is it social facilitation of opportunity for practice (which is not the same thing as
ning e.g. from a model). Certainly the term ‘lessons’ in the title suggests one individual knows something
ut the dance and is teaching it to the other, but the fact that more dances occur with familiar partners is not
essarily evidence of this.
de from these conceptual points, the experiments are well controlled and statistical methods appropriate.
h some changes to the structure and argumentation I suggest this paper this can be accepted after
nges.
This issue is very important, but hard to be addressed from the framework of this study. It’s true
that social facilitation alone could explain the phenomena we observed, but we suspect that
there might be more.
Songbirds (including Java sparrows and their related species like zebra finches) practice
singing when alone. They learn (memorize) songs from social stimuli, but do not necessary
need social interactions for sensory-motor training. They seem to prefer quiet environment
without interrupting conspecifics for practice singing. In contrast, we hardly (almost never)
observed Java sparrows’ practicing dancing when they are alone. It seems that they always
need partners for dancing. If dance practice were just for motor training, Java sparrows would
practice dancing alone just like they do so for singing.
We know that this evidence is too weak, but explained it in the manuscript (L194-196). We also
clearly stated that what is learned is yet to be determined (L15-16, 209-211).
4
wever, this phenomenon might be explained by the fact that we lacked data on very young birds in the
ed condition (see methods).” This needs more explanation! Is there any way you could explore the impact
hese missing data points on your statistical models?
Unfortunately, it is practically impossible to add data points under pair condition in young age,
because of the reason described in the manuscript. However, we could add a supplemental
analysis. For the four birds that constituted pilot study, we have data points under both family
and paired conditions between 60-180 dph (L89-92). So, we extracted the data from the later
period (i.e., 60-180dph) of these birds (L110-116), and ran the same analysis as Table 1a. As
shown in Table 1b, the outcomes are quite consistent between Table 1a and b.
above, does family condition also contain potential duetting partners?
Yes. As mentioned earlier, we specified that the subject birds grew up with their siblings
(L76-77).
at is the potential effect of familiarity arising through auditory cues alone? Are the partners taken from
in this connected auditory pool of animals?
All the birds in our study are kept in one room, where they share the same auditory environment,
which is now explained in the manuscript (L77, 93). Though we cannot discuss anything about
auditory-based individual recognition in this study, we speculate that it is not a simple story. In
the song-learning period, juveniles of Lonchura species learn both songs and calls. Therefore,
the acoustic structures of contact calls change dramatically even within individuals during the
developmental period (cf. Yoneda & Okanoya 1991, J Ethol).
sponse to reviewer 3 comments:
s study aims to test for age-related and social factors influence on dance development in Java sparrows.
idea of the manuscript is very interesting and scarce in current literature, therefore I think the data should
h the attention of a wide audience. The authors provide a good introduction which clearly justify their work,
ever I had several concerns regarding their methods and, more specifically, their statistical analyses. I
ommend they revise these points and provide more details about their approach. I made several specific
ments below.
We are grateful to the reviewer for giving us many useful suggestions especially on statistics.
We reanalyzed the data in accordance with those suggestions, and revised the manuscript
accordingly.
: “Early life” should be “early-life”.
Title was revised as suggested.

3: “but their developmental mechanisms have been identified only for vocalizations”. I agree that this kind
formation is lacking in literature, but later in this paragraph you’ve cited Hoepfner & Goller (2013) in which
y motions were also investigated. Please, revise.
We agree that the expression was overly strong in the previous manuscript. We revised it (L23).
7, 39: Citations could be included in the statements below, since there is evidence for these ideas for other
munication channels, such as the vocalization, and which are not necessarily related to “animal play”.
ommunicative functions and is performed in front of conspecifics for socialization and future pair formation”
is also possible that young birds need to ‘practice’ dance for motor training, just as they do for the
uisition of songs”
The paragraph was revised in response to the reviewer 1’s comment (please see [*1]), and does
not include the sentence on communicative functions any more. We added citations for the
second sentence (L38).
6: Replace “(Lonchura oryzivora; order: Passeriformes, family: Estrildidae)” by “(Lonchura oryzivora;
seriformes: Estrildidae)”
Revised as suggested (L55).
9: After reading the whole manuscript I think you did not test for “timing” changes in dance practicing. If you
nded to refer to “timing” as “age-related” changes, this is already mentioned in this sentence.
As suggested, “timing”’ was deleted.
7: “When the subject birds were young”: What do you mean by “young” here? How many dph?
We added age information (L92)
03: What is one bout of dance? More than one dance sequence (as described in lines 98 and 99) or just
? Please, clarify.
Yes, the definition of one dance bout is as is given in the previous section. We specified it by
saying “One dance bout was defined as…”(L102).
However, as will be explained later, we removed the poisson-GLMM result, which was turned
out to be seriously affected by overdispersion. The corresponding parts in the method section
were changed accordingly (L107-108).
06: This means that the previous GLMM included “number of dance bouts without songs”? Also, later in
results section you use “song-dance cooccurrence” to refer to dance bouts that accompanied song,
se standardize the terms throughout the text to facilitate reading.
We revised the part to use consistent terminology and careful description of the dependent
variable (L114-116).
07: In L 87 you mentioned that “When the subject birds were young, we used the family condition,”,
efore, I believe that your treatments in “age” and “experimental condition” should be the same (i.e.,
elated) . Did you test for this? How many replicates in each treatment?
We agree that the two explanatory variables (age and pair/family condition) are confounding.
6
To deal with this, we repeated the same analysis on the subset data (please see L111-), because
pilot study birds were observed under both paired and family conditions between 60–180 dph
(L89-92). Table 1a and b show that the results are consistent, and so we think that our
conclusion was not biased by undesirable set of predictor variables.
11: “repeated encounter with the same partner (order of pairing with the same partner)”. I did not
erstand this variable, is this the number of times an individual met a specific partner or the ordinal position
hich he repeatedly met a specific partner? Please, clarify. How was your experiment designed so that one
e would repeatedly met another male? In lines 94-95 you mentioned that “Overall, each focal male was
ed with each partner 1–19 times throughout the study.” But what was the mean number of repeated
ners for all focal males?
This variable means the latter. To clarify it, we borrowed the reviewer’s expression (L120-121).
We also showed the average number of the times that each pair met (L97-98).
16-117: Your model looks overfitted, how many samples do you have? You’ve included five variables, but
have only nine focal males, this should be a problem and you statistical results may not be robust. I was
clear about your sample size throughout the manuscript.
This analysis is based on 46 data points taken from 6 subjects (the other 3 did not dance in the
paired condition), which is now explained in the manuscript. We understand that such analysis
would generate concern about overfitting. To deal with it, we repeated the analyses using
simpler models. Specifically, we built four models, each containing age and one explanatory
variable, and confirmed that the outcomes were consistent (L131-132). Age was always
included as an explanatory variable in the above models because we would like to clarify
whether increase in duetting is dependent on age, or some other explanatory factors (i.e.
number of dance, song) that vary with age.
In addition, we also checked for multicollinearity by calculating VIF (Variance Inflation Factor).
VIFs were all < 5, showing no sign of multicollinearity (L129-130).
20: Please provide more details on your statistical approach. How did you test for model validity,
rdispersion in Poisson models and which R packages did you use? How did you test for variables
ificance in models? There are several ways to do it using R. Please provide references for statistical
lyses. I have several concerns regarding these analyses, see also my comments about Figure 2 (below).
Following the advice, we ran overdispersion test for each model. Overdispersion was detected
for only count-data analyses (poisson GLMM). As this seems to be caused by zero-inflated data,
and extremely high values for a few data points, we took the following two approaches
(1) We used binary data instead of counts (e.g. presence/absence of dance instead of dance
counts), which was effective because such binomial GLMM showed no severe
overdispersion at least with our data.
(2) We also tried several zero-inflated poisson (ZIP) models, which is explained in detail as
a response to the later comment (please see [*2] below).

As ZIP modeling had some limitations and was not ideal, we decided to adopt (1) to be shown
in the manuscript. Therefore Table 1b and Fig 2b in the previous manuscript were deleted, and
Table 2 shows binomial model instead of poisson.
All necessary information, such as R package, references, and statistical significance, is now
added in the method section (L106, 139,142-146, reference #32-35).
40: The discussion needs to be revised after the appropriate statistical analyses, because results may
nge.
As explained above and below, main findings did not change after we had carefully
reconsidered statistical procedures and made some modifications on them.
77: Table 1: Estimates for categorical variables are usually presents relative to one reference level. Here
presented “Condition (pair or family)”, which one is the reference level?
It is explained in the table legend: “Positive values for the coefficient of condition indicate
increases in paired condition.” We also used the bold fonts for ‘pair’ to stress it in the present
manuscript.
les 1 and 2: What is your total sample size in all models?
We added sample size for each table.
10: Y-axis in binomial distribution GLMM (c and d) is easier to understand if presented as “probability of
g-dance cooccurrence or duet dance occurrence”. This is what the line refers to. Also, provide the y-axis
le (not only extreme values, 0 or 1).
Y axis labels and scales were changed exactly as suggested.
ure 2b. It looks like your data is “zero-inflated”, therefore your GLMM should not be valid in its current
sentation. You will probably need to use zero-inflated models in which a binomial and zero-truncated
sson model are built. See Zuur et al (2009) “Mixed effects models and extensions in Ecology with R” for
e details.
[*2] Yes, the data contain many zeros, which is because some subject birds hardly showed
dance during the observation. Following the advice, we struggled with several zero-inflated
poisson (ZIP) models described in Zuur et al. (2009) and elsewhere. The problem with the
model in Zuur et al. (2009) (package ‘pscl’) is that it does not allow the entry of random effects
(controlling for bird ID effect in our case). We searched for packages that can handle ZIP and
random effects, and found ‘GLMMadaptive’. However, this package frequently returned errors
seemingly due to the difficulty in model convergence, and we could not enter two explanatory
variables at the same time. So, we had to build models as follows:
- ‘pscl’ model [fixed effect: age, cage condition, ID]
- ‘GLMMadaptive’ model [fixed effect: age or cage condition, random effect: ID]
As shown below, ZIP model outcomes fit with the result of binomial GLMM (Table 1a).

sponse to reviewer 1 comments:
authors have done an excellent job of addressing my criticisms of the previous version of their manuscript.
articular, the addition of an analysis of dance speed and dance duration answers my objection that
cing skill had not been measured; in my opinion this addition adds substantially to the value of the paper.
his stage I have only some minor suggestions on wording.
10: perhaps it would make more sense to say “we propose that the practice is needed for motor
ning.”
21: I find “courtship/mating dance/display” confusing. I suggest simplifying this phrase.
26: I suggest “By contrast” rather than “Conversely.”
38: “they” here has no obvious referent. I suggest substituting “practice dances” if that is what you intend.
41: “become” not “becomes”
51: “the duets of adults” rather than “adults duets” – though you could use “adults’ duets”
87: do you mean “temporary isolation” rather than “temporal isolation”?
92: “raised in a different family”
93: “isolated from others” rather than “isolated by others”
s 119-120: I am unsure of the meaning of “ordinal position in which he repeatedly met a specific partner.”
you clarify?
155: perhaps you mean “elicited” rather than “solicited”
175: I suggest “call” rather than “called”
192: I suggest “it also remains unknown why…”
s 203-204: “is improvised rather than stereotyped”
We are really grateful to the reviewer for giving us detailed suggestions. Every part was revised
exactly as suggested.
sponse to reviewer 3 comments:
is my second review of this manuscript and I consider that authors did a very good job by taking into
ount almost all comments provided by reviewers. My questions were almost completely answered and I
ognize author’s effort when dealing with their analyses, which required a more advanced method giving
data nature.
ough authors were not able to use a Zero-inflated model, because of their sample size and techniques
lemented in statistical software, I was almost convinced that the zero-inflated approach is not necessary.
ever, I was curious if their current models were validated, because 95% Confidence Intervals in Figures
and 2c look wrong to me. They are too wide and, if that are the correct CIs, then I think the models have
ous problems and do not reflect the best analyses for this data. Please check these CI and provide
vincing information that these models are validated. When fitting the CI, be sure you are using the correct
function of the model (and please provide information about which one is this link function). The CI should
elative to model fitted values and not the raw data.
We may have used a wrong method for calculating CI, as CI estimation for mixed models is
complicated and require advanced techniques. Now we plotted them based on GLM as shown
in the manuscript.
o, given the fact that sample size (number of different individuals) is small, I would leave this information
n more clear in the text, so authors may conclude by theirselves about data quality. Therefore, I
ommend you specify the number of sampled birds in Tables 1, 2 and 4 similarly as you did in Table 3.
Required sample size (number of birds) is added.
29 Indicates what terms in bold mean (=reference level).
le 1: briefly explain in the legend what is “subset data”.
Revised following the advices (L323-324)
