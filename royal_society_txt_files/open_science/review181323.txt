Vocal behaviour predicts mating success in giant pandas
This research describes the calls and their acoustic properties used by male and female pandas
prior to (and during) successful and unsuccessful copulations. This well-written study has found
a number of vocal indicators which can be used by animal breeding managers to predict which
matings might be most successful. The use of non-linear phenomena as a suggested way to attract
and maintain attention is an interesting potential function.
The paper would benefit from a few large clarifications, and I have several smaller comments
below.
First, it is unclear whether for cases where ‘aggression’ was observed, and mating was aborted by
animal handlers, if those cases were included in the data set. This should be clarified.
Secondly, I could not determine if for analyses the gross duration or a proportion were used for
duration-analysis. If it was a gross duration, of bleats for example, were the durations of
mating/stages accounted for in some way? From pair to pair pre-copulation and copulation
duration may differ, and accounting for these differences would be important for interpretation.
Other minor comments:
It is unclear how source-filter theory would determine the information content. This could be
clarified. Lines 65

calls, state that. If they could not be measured due to high F0 or some other factor – that
information should be in results.
221 – comma needed after closed parenthesis
229 – put this in results.
2.4 – it is unclear whether instances where there was aggression, and animals were separated,
were used in the analyses as ‘non-successful’ copulations. This should be clarified
304 – NLP has not been defined
328 – the table has not rendered in the proof, so I cannot evaluate it.
344 – as above, numbering might be better as 3.3.1
345- are durations calculated as proportions of time during the stage, or as gross duration? If they
are gross duration, are the total duration of pre-copulatory phases (which, presumably would
vary among individuals and breeding sessions) accounted for in the model?

Review for
Vocal behaviour predicts mating success in giant pandas.
This manuscript is scientifically sound in its present form. It is a very important contribution
because giant pandas are highly endangered and natural breeding in captivity is still a challenge.
some minor suggestions: In the title, in my opinion, it should be reflected that it is a study about
captive animals;
Vocal behaviour predicts mating success in captive giant pandas.
I had some difficulties reading the tables … (maybe a problem when converting the document?)
The only problem I have is that it should be stated that the behavior might be restricted to the
specific conditions that we find in these Chinese breeding centers; the pandas there are raised and
kept under very unnatural conditions; most zoos keep their pandas differently; and in my
opinion it is not correct to conclude without any doubt that observations made at these Chinese
breeding centers can be transferred to other keeping conditions. These potential limitations
should be mentioned in the discussion.
And give more basic information on the keeping conditions (not just in the references, but in the
paper). Any information on offspring that resulted from the observed matings?
4
Line 38: out of curiosity: are male pandas aggressive towards females during non-breeding
season (in the wild)?
Line 101 and 102; could you just add one or two sentences to explain what kind of aggression
(male towards female of vice versa?)? Is this observed more in captivity, or also in the wild? In
general; do we have most information about breeding behavior from captive situations?
Line 107: .. if you need to ensure the safety of the animal, please give some details: what is
happening in captivity during mating? Are females seriously injured? Is this natural or due to
captivity?
Also you might just briefly review that natural breeding is very rare in captivity (zoos); and in
fact every singly information we get is important in order to increase breeding success.
data collection/acoustic recordings and analysis are methodologically correct, very detailed and
up to date;
line 258: what does “genetic recommendation” mean? Based on what? Just add some more
information for those of us not familiar with the breeding aims or plans; (since you mention it).
Line 262 … really; I still wonder if this is normal or due to unnatural keeping conditions (a male
would kill a female during mating …. ?)
Also; since I am a bit irritated by this aggression; and I am still not getting information whether
this is a natural or unnatural behavior; I start wondering how representative the behavior of the
pandas would be in these breeding centers; I know that they do breed well there, but I also know
that what is happening there is very unnatural (concerning the keeping of the cubs, they are
removed from the mothers at very young age and kept in these “kindergardens”.
So just by reading through the paper until know I wonder whether the results can just be relevant
for the China breeding center, or for pandas in captivity in general? this is not really a problem,
but it needs to be discussed and addressed and the limitation of the conclusion that can be drawn
need to be considered.
Line 382; I have difficulties reading the tables … any difference in the type of NLP?
line 400: yes, but under captive and very unnatural conditions. I would ask the authors to really
mention that and to tone down conclusions; the mating behavior of pandas might be different in
zoos (which do usually have quite different keeping conditions – that are in fact much more
natural).
411: … should be: … were strongly predictive of a successful breeding outcome in our study (or
… somehow in these specific keeping and breeding conditions)…

Vocal behaviour predicts mating success in giant pandas
This research describes the calls and their acoustic
properties used by male and female pandas prior to (and
during) successful and unsuccessful copulations. This
well-written study has found a number of vocal indicators
which can be used by animal breeding managers to predict
which matings might be most successful. The use of non-
linear phenomena as a suggested way to attract and
maintain attention is an interesting potential function.
The paper would benefit from a few large clarifications, and
I have several smaller comments below.
First, it is unclear whether for cases where ‘aggression’
was observed, and mating was aborted by animal handlers,
if those cases were included in the data set. This should be
clarified.
Inevitably all unsuccessful breeding encounters end with the
keepers interjecting to separate the animals. We now make it
clear on lines 273-275 of the “Mating procedures and
reproductive performance” section that the general husbandry
protocol dictates that introductions are only aborted when
physical aggression, such as biting and lunging, is observed:
“If physical aggression between male and female was observed, such as
biting or lunging, then the animals were immediately separated.”
None of the unsuccessful breeding introductions in the current
study were aborted due to physical aggression. It is worth
noting, however, that aggressive behavior towards other adult
conspecifics is normal for wild and captive giant pandas outside
of mating contexts. Hence, when giant pandas are not ready to
mate, then aggressive behavior is a natural consequence. All of
the unsuccessful introductions were therefore characterized by
aggressive behaviour, as evidenced by the production of
vocalizations like roars.
Secondly, I could not determine if for analyses the gross
duration or a proportion were used for duration-analysis. If
it was a gross duration, of bleats for example, were the
durations of mating/stages accounted for in some way?
From pair to pair pre-copulation and copulation duration
may differ, and accounting for these differences would be
important for interpretation.
The durations reported were not total durations across the entire
pre-copulation or copulation periods. The duration of each
separate call was measured and the statistics were based on
mean values across recording conditions. We now make this
clear in the text:
Line 195 – “The duration of individual bleats was measured
directly from the waveform…”
Line 234 – “The duration of each call was taken directly from the
waveform…”
Line 260-1 – “The duration of each roar was taken directly from
the waveform…”
Table 1 presents mean ± SD values for each acoustic measure.
Other minor comments:
It is unclear how source-filter theory would determine the
information content. This could be clarified. Lines 65
A source-filter theory approach allows researchers to categorize
spectral features according to whether they are produced by
vocal fold vibration or the resonance properties of the vocal
tract. This then provides a direct link to the anatomical and
physiological attributes of the caller. Theory alone would not
provide information content, it is the application of the theory i.e.
using a source filter theory approach.
We now make this clear on lines 66-67 by removing “and
determine the information content”
“More recent studies have used a source-filter theory [13] approach to
describe the acoustic structure of giant panda vocal signals.”
Lines 114 – less -> ‘fewer’
This has now been changed.
140 – wartin-wintle – is this citation supposed to be in this
format, instead of the numbered sequential?
No. This was an oversight on our part. The citation is now
changed to the journal format.
141- perhaps cite the ASM guidelines (Sikes)
We now cite Sikes (2016) here.
Line 180 – Figure 1 should be presented in the results, not
here in the methods
Figure 1 is presented in the results (line 332). We have now
removed the reference to it in the methods.
183 – numbering scheme is odd – perhaps 2.3.1 would be
better?
Yes we agree. This is now changed.
192 – again, results in the methods
The sentence “Bleats were not found to contain non-linear
phenomena” has been removed.
214 – keep results in results not in methods. If you
attempted to measure formants in all types of calls, state
that. If they could not be measured due to high F0 or some
other factor – that information should be in results.
We respectfully disagree with this comment. In our opinion, it is
perfectly fine to state that certain features could not be
measured and briefly provide the reason. The observation that
F0 or formants were not consistently found in certain call types
does not relate to any of our hypotheses, and should therefore
not be considered a result.
221 – comma needed after closed parenthesis
Done.
229 – put this in results.
The sentence “F0-related features were not extracted from giant
panda roars because they consist of broadband frequency noise
without an observable F0” supports our methodological
approach. It should therefore be in the methods.
2.4 – it is unclear whether instances where there was
aggression, and animals were separated, were used in the
analyses as ‘non-successful’ copulations. This should be
clarified
As previously stated, all unsuccessful introductions are
characterized by some degree of aggressive behavior. We
have re-worded the mating procedures section to make it clear
to the reader that only severe physical aggression would lead to
an introduction being aborted (lines 273-5).
“If physical aggression between male and female was observed, such as
biting or lunging, then the animals were immediately separated.”
304 – NLP has not been defined
This should read “non-linear phenomena” and has now been
changed accordingly.
328 – the table has not rendered in the proof, so I cannot
evaluate it.
It is a shame that the table did not render.
344 – as above, numbering might be better as 3.3.1
This has now been changed.
345- are durations calculated as proportions of time during
the stage, or as gross duration? If they are gross duration,
are the total duration of pre-copulatory phases (which,
presumably would vary among individuals and breeding
sessions) accounted for in the model?
No. We measured the duration of each of the calls separately:
this is now made clear in the methods:
Line 195 – “The duration of individual bleats was measured
directly from the waveform…”
Line 234 – “The duration of each call was taken directly from the
waveform…”
Line 260-1 – “The duration of each roar was taken directly from
the waveform…”
353 – similarly table 2 and 3 have not rendered in the proof
That is a shame.
Discussion:
491- do you have the ability to test this from your dataset?
This is an interesting hypothesis concerning chirps in
unsuccessful encounters.
No, it is not possible to test whether female chirps reduce male
aggression with the current data.
If you do not have the ability to test this, it would be good
to clarify that this still needs to be adequately tested and is
only speculative.
We were actually linking our observations to Morton’s
motivation-structural rules, which state that higher pitched
sounds are expected during friendly/appeasing contexts.
Hence, we now state on lines 504-7:
“According to Morton’s motivation-structural rules [2], the increased F0 of
chirps produced during unsuccessful breeding introductions could reflect an
effort to appease a male showing incipient signs of aggression in breeding
introductions that ultimately failed
521 – I would either rephrase the colloquial ‘attention-
grabber’ or place the term in quotations. You could use
attracting attention or sustaining attention as alternate
word use.
We have now changed line 533-4 to “attract and maintain the
attention of conspecific receivers…”

Review for
Vocal behaviour predicts mating success in giant pandas.
This manuscript is scientifically sound in its present form.
It is a very important contribution because giant pandas are
highly endangered and natural breeding in captivity is still
a challenge.
some minor suggestions: In the title, in my opinion, it
should be reflected that it is a study about captive animals;
Vocal behaviour predicts mating success in captive giant
pandas.
In response to this comment we now state that the giant pandas
were captive in the abstract (line 15). The methods section also
describes the origins of the giant pandas in our study. In our
opinion, it is not necessary to state that the animals were
captive in the title because we believe we have discovered a
biological phenomenon that generalizes to the species (wild and
captive).
I had some difficulties reading the tables … (maybe a
problem when converting the document?)
We are sorry to hear this.
The only problem I have is that it should be stated that the
behavior might be restricted to the specific conditions that
we find in these Chinese breeding centers; the pandas
there are raised and kept under very unnatural conditions;
most zoos keep their pandas differently; and in my opinion
it is not correct to conclude without any doubt that
observations made at these Chinese breeding centers can
be transferred to other keeping conditions. These potential
limitations should be mentioned in the discussion.
We respectfully disagree with the reviewer. In our opinion it is
extremely unlikely that this species mating behavior, which has
evolved over a large time span, would differ across captive
institutions, or even between captive and wild animals. Further,
the giant pandas at CCRCGP (where the research was
conducted) have been kept in relatively large and naturalistic
enclosures for many years now, and their conditions surpass
those of many zoos. We do, however, agree that some degree
of caution is warranted when generalizing the results. As a
result we have re-worded lines 415-8 to read:
“Based on the assumption that our findings generalise to free-ranging
animals, the results of the current study represent the first systematic
contribution to understanding how giant pandas employ vocal signals during
the copulatory phase of mating.”
And give more basic information on the keeping conditions
(not just in the references, but in the paper).
We now state the following in the “Study site and animals”
section of the methods (lines 143-152):
“During breeding introductions, giant pandas were housed in concrete
walled, open-air enclosures (6 x 15m) with an indoor enclosure area (3 x
8m). All enclosures had one barred ‘howdy’ window and a circular barred
gate located on the long sides of the enclosure (four potential interaction
windows, two per side). Enclosures were arranged in a large circle so giant
pandas could be moved freely between pens for mate pairings. In this
configuration, giant pandas shared walls with two other animals, except for
animals residing in the end enclosures, which only had one neighbour. Giant
pandas were exposed to natural light conditions and were fed a diet of local
bamboo supplemented with bread, high-fiber biscuits, carrots and apples.”
Any information on offspring that resulted from the
observed matings?
This information is not yet available.
Line 38: out of curiosity: are male pandas aggressive
towards females during non-breeding season (in the wild)?
Observations of wild giant pandas indicate that adult
conspecifics are aggressive towards one another, but more
often simply avoid one another (Schaller 1985). No data on
whether male aggression predominates is available, however,
captive females are certainly known to be aggressive towards
males (see Owen et al. 2013. The dynamics of male-female
multi-modal signaling and behaviour in the giant panda
(Ailuropoda melanoleuca). Ethology 119: 869-880). Limited
aggression is seen between males and females throughout the
year in captivity. Behavioral observations of social interactions
outside the breeding season are notably rare. It therefore
seems likely that males and females are aggressive and
intolerant of other adult conspecifics outside of the breeding
season.
Line 101 and 102; could you just add one or two sentences
to explain what kind of aggression (male towards female of
vice versa?)?
We now state that “male and female giant pandas can be
aggressive towards one another during mating attempts” on line
103.
We also state the following on lines 547-550:
“..observations of breeding introductions confirm that it is common for the
female giant pandas to be aggressive immediately after copulation,
expressed as breaking away from the male, barking, roaring and lunging [3].”
Is this observed more in captivity, or also in the wild?
It is impossible to say with any degree of certainty if aggression
is more prevalent in captivity than in the wild. Observations of
captive (Zhang et al 2004) and wild animals (Schaller 1985)
suggest that interactions between males and females can be
highly aggressive. It is clear that aggression in captivity is in part
derived from lack of proper communication opportunities
(Swaisgood et al. 2000. The effects of sex, reproductive
condition and context on discrimination of conspecific odours by
giant pandas. Animal Behaviour, 60, 227-237), but this has
largely been addressed and aggression is less common.
In general; do we have most information about breeding
behavior from captive situations?
Yes. Breeding behavior is very difficult to observe in free-
ranging animals. Nonetheless, courtship vocalizations and the
general form of behaviour during mating is largely the same as
seen in the wild (cf. Schaller et al. 1985; Nie et al. 2012.
Reproductive competition and fecal testosterone in wild male
giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). Behavioral Ecology and
Sociobiology. 66: 721-730.), with the exception that wild females
often remove themselves from males by climbing a tree; it is
believed they do this to avoid aggression until they are receptive
to mating.
Line 107: .. if you need to ensure the safety of the animal,
please give some details: what is happening in captivity
during mating?
More information is now provided in the “Mating procedure &
reproductive performance” section of the methods.
Are females seriously injured?
Females (and males) can be injured during breeding attempts.
Lines 103-106 have now been re-written accordingly:
“Furthermore, because male and female giant pandas can be aggressive
towards one another during mating attempts [4], the occurrence of certain
vocal signals and/or characteristics could also signify whether a breeding
encounter is moving towards copulation or a potentially serious injury to one
or both of the animals…”
Is this natural or due to captivity?
It is not possible to say whether this is due to captivity or not.
Observations that wild females climb trees to avoid males
suggest that females are trying to avoid aggression and injury
(Schaller et al. 1985; Nie et al., 2012).
Also you might just briefly review that natural breeding is
very rare in captivity (zoos); and in fact every singly
information we get is important in order to increase
breeding success.
Natural breeding in captivity is not as rare as it once was
(Swaisgood et al. 2006. The science of behavioral
management: creating biologically relevant living environments
in captivity. In: Giant pandas: biology, veterinary medicine and
management (Ed. by Wildt, D. E., Zhang, A. J., Zhang, H.,
Janssen, D. & Ellis, S.). Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press. pp. 274-298; Li et al. 2017. Analyzing the past to
understand the future: natural mating yields better reproductive
rates than artificial insemination in the giant panda. Biological
Conservation 216, 10-17.
We discuss the recent focus on natural breeding and how the
findings of the current study inform conservation efforts in the
last paragraph of the discussion.
data collection/acoustic recordings and analysis are
methodologically correct, very detailed and up to date;
line 258: what does “genetic recommendation”
mean? Based on what? Just add some more information
for those of us not familiar with the breeding aims or plans;
(since you mention it).
This means that individuals are paired up to promote
heterozygosity and prevent inbreeding i.e. close relatives are
not paired.
We now state the following on lines 267-270:
“Female giant pandas in peak oestrous [verified using hormonal assays: 5]
were selected for breeding introductions during the breeding season
(February to June), and subsequently paired with a genetically compatible
partner as determined by inbreeding coefficients obtained from pedigree
analysis”
Line 262 … really; I still wonder if this is normal or due to
unnatural keeping conditions (a male would kill a female
during mating …. ?)
The death of an animal is extremely unlikely given the current
procedures at the captive breeding institutions. If animals show
signs of aggression, such as biting and lunging, they will
immediately be separated before escalation to more serious
(and potentially fatal) physical aggression can occur.
We have now removed the sentence referring to extreme
aggression and death because we believe it is not pertinent to
the current study.
Also; since I am a bit irritated by this aggression; and I am
still not getting information whether this is a natural or
unnatural behavior; I start wondering how representative
the behavior of the pandas would be in these breeding
centers; I know that they do breed well there, but I also
know that what is happening there is very unnatural
(concerning the keeping of the cubs, they are removed
from the mothers at very young age and kept in these
“kindergardens”.
As previously detailed, aggression is part of giant panda mating
behavior, both in the wild and in captivity. Aggression per se is
certainly not an artifact of captivity, and there is no doubt that
giant pandas, like most Ursidae, need to overcome their natural
avoidance and aggressive tendencies to mate. Also, the
removal of cubs at an early age is a practice that is being
discontinued by the Chinese breeding centers, so they are on
the path to encouraging more natural behavior.
Most importantly, however, these issues do not impact on our
results or the interpretation of them—giant panda vocalizations
are a key part of mating and there are cues in the structure of
calls that predict whether a mating is likely to succeed or not,
which is useful for managers to improve mating success.
To make it clearer to the reader that giant pandas are naturally
intolerant and aggressive towards other conspecifics, we have
now revised the first part of the second paragraph of the
introduction so that it now reads:
“Relatively solitary by nature, free-ranging giant pandas occupy distinct
seasonal ranges [6] and typically avoid other conspecifics outside of the
annual breeding season [7]. Effective communication is therefore not only
crucial for male and female giant pandas to locate opposite-sexed individuals
for mating purposes, but also to overcome their natural avoidance and
aggressive tendencies in order to negotiate the delicate courtship process
leading to mating once close contact is established [8, 9].”
So just by reading through the paper until know I wonder
whether the results can just be relevant for the China
breeding center, or for pandas in captivity in general? this
is not really a problem, but it needs to be discussed and
addressed and the limitation of the conclusion that can be
drawn need to be considered.
We can think of no a priori reason why breeding behavior would
be different in a Chinese breeding center than it is in other
captive settings. Our findings merely indicate that in the course
of courtship vocalizations must be affected by underlying
motivation that predicts whether or not the mating will be
successful. It is of course closely tied to captive breeding
management because of its application, but there must be
cases of courtship in the wild that are more likely to succeed
than others, and we would anticipate vocal cues to have
predictive ability here too.
Line 382; I have difficulties reading the tables … any
difference in the type of NLP?
It is a shame that the table has not converted correctly.
Significant differences in the amount of non-linear phenomena
were observed across the recording contexts.
line 400: yes, but under captive and very unnatural
conditions. I would ask the authors to really mention that
and to tone down conclusions; the mating behavior of
pandas might be different in zoos (which do usually have
quite different keeping conditions – that are in fact much
more natural).
We now state the following at the end of the first paragraph of
the discussion (lines 415-8):
“Based on the assumption that our findings generalise to free-ranging
animals, the results of the current study represent the first systematic
contribution to understanding how giant pandas employ vocal signals during
the copulatory phase of mating.”
411: … should be: … were strongly predictive of a
successful breeding outcome in our study (or … somehow
in these specific keeping and breeding conditions)…
We have re-written these two sentences so they now read as
follows (419-424):
“In line with our predictions, the context-related differences in call usage
revealed that considerably more bleats were produced during the pre-
copulatory phase of successful breeding introductions when compared to
unsuccessful introductions. These findings confirm that bleats are
nonaggressive calls that function to promote contact between male and
female conspecifics during the breeding season [10].”
