In "The broiler chicken as a signal of a human reconfigured biosphere" the authors measured
tibiotarsi collected from archaeological sites to create a timeline of size changes in the
domesticated broiler chicken. Using this, the authors suggest that the broiler chicken is
representative of the changes in the global biosphere due to humans.
The authors present an interesting story of how contemporary broiler chickens are much larger
than their wild ancestor, and since the 1950s, have rapidly increased in size and biomass to meet
the demands of human consumption. While I find the information reviewed in this manuscript
interesting, I am not sure what the motivation for this study is. The authors state that the broiler
chicken represents major changes in the global biosphere, but I am left wondering why do we
need something to represent these changes? Furthermore, all the changes to the broiler chicken
have been artificially selected for, yet the changing biosphere is a combination of (unprecedented)
human influence and natural selection. Thus, is the boiler chicken an appropriate representation
of global biosphere changes? I recognize the authors incorporate the impact of human
consumption of chickens into this representation.
My other big question is the analysis. Why was pair-wise Mann Whitney used and not some kind
of time series analysis since that is what this is? The pair-wise analysis will increase your chance
of a Type I error. I also found the results reported in Supp. Table 1 confusing. What is the top
right portion of the pairwise comparisons?
Minor comments:
Given the mass difference between large domesticated animals and chickens, perhaps it's best to
refer to mass instead of counts of the animals?
Is the distal width of the tibiotarsus commonly used? In contemporary studies of birds, it's
typically tarsus length.
It appears you have data from 1950-2000 (Figure 5) so why not include it in Figure 3?
How did you control for age differences in the historical measurements?

This contribution presents a compelling case of a vertebrate species has become completely
dependent on human intervention and in some ways humans have become heavily dependent on
a vertebrate species for a rising protein need. The paper is indeed interesting to a variety of
researchers and integrates data and information across a number of disparate research
disciplines. From my view (not an archaeologist or poultry scientist), I think the paper is pretty
well reasoned and techniques appear sound, but there needs to be a better documentation of the
isotope methods. I think the paper should be accepted after a round of heavy revision to the
presentation/writing of the data (see below).
Major comments: My biggest concern with the paper is presentation style and writing. The
writing and data presentation is OK overall, but the points could be much more stream-lined
throughout the MS by better connecting the main points and deleting some of the facts sprinkled
throughout the MS that don’t entirely fit.
-There needs to better flow between the sentences in the background – connect the
sentences together better because currently it is jumpy and sounds like a collection of facts in
some places (e.g., the number of bird individuals in the species). Some of this information is
distracting and detracts from the progression of the section.
-The second paragraph needs a topic sentence that helps direct the reader
-The background needs a ‘Here, we….’ statement to help the reader.
-The Methods section should be before the Results section, right?
-Results section
-focus this section on the results obtained from the measurements in the Methods section; the
entire first paragraph is background not Results.
-I don’t see what the following line adds “Molecular-clock estimates place the origin of the order
Galliformes (pheasants, jungle fowl and relatives) in the early Cretaceous15 , although the fossil
record of the red jungle fowl is poorly known.
-integrate better to the story or delete.
-The paragraph starting with ‘A surge in chicken production from the 1950s onwards’ should be
in the discussion of the results section
-Discussion section
-focus on the results and integration with other information.
-there seems to be a mix of repeated information from the background section
that can be cut (e.g., individuals in bird species comparison)
-Paragraph starting with “Bird carcasses…” – I am not sure this fits into the
discussion and may be better in the background.
Methods section – why was the breadth of the tibiotarsus measured? Justify this.
4
-Where are the isotope extraction and methods section? This all needs to be detailed here.
-need a table of the specimens and their isotope values
Minor comments: Abstract – It is better to state the body size of the chicken has significantly
increased through time instead of saying that the tibiotarsus is getting bigger – the bone is a
proxy for overall bodysize.
Figures – Overall effective, but can be presented in a more professional way
Figure 2 - Good use of color, but it looks like it was done quickly. Use solid, but
transparent shapes to outline your three areas.
Figure 3 – Label y axis in a traditional patter to the left of the axis
Figure 4 – I think this figure is OK, but could be much more effective by providing a
silhouette of a chicken with the leg bones presented and labelled showing differences in body
size. There is not much information as presented, but this can be much more powerful through a
different approach.

This paper contains lots of data, but it is essentially a philosophical argument, focused on the
Anthropocene. It was certainly a very interesting read, and many of the numerical figures
presented are breathtaking (and useful to know). Overall, it is a terrific paper. Arguments could
be made for any number of domesticated or pet species as being candidates for being living
caricatures of the Anthropocene, but the argument for the broiler chicken is well made by the
authors, and it might as well be the one, especially given the C and biomass figures described on
p4, L9-16.
I think the conclusion is a little weak. There is scope, in a few sentences, to wrap up this flood of
remarkable statistics on the chicken with a conclusion that looks back more directly to the
5
Anthropocene. Is the buried broiler-chick biomass (of carcasses) --- probably written indelibly in
the fossil record --- a biological ‘bomb spike’ that future generations could be used to mark the
start of the Anthropocene? Is it as good as any other measure that has recently been proposed as a
marker?
Some minor points:
P3, L17-20: Regarding growth pathologies, given that the archaeological record is so sparse
compared to modern data, can anything more than a binary occurrence (or not) of a phenomenon
like this really be inferred? Are the authors trying to say that such pathologies have increased in
the modern chicken? If so, the argument would only make sense in terms of % terms, which
cannot be given. As such, I’m not convinced that this statement tells us anything useful.
P3, L46-47: I’m not sure that this is a fair comparison. Domestic free-range hens can live 5-10
years on average, and the 30-year estimate for a jungle fowl would be at the extreme upper end
(and inferred, not measured). I doubt the evidence for longevity differences is convincing, other
than for those chickens slaughtered prior to their natural senescence, which economic not
biological.
P4, L4-7: Repetitive with the Introduction.
P4, L45-47: This is debatable. The vast majority of domestic animals would perish without human
aid, albeit perhaps not as rapidly and decisively as the global broiler flock.
P5, L4-5: “is significant” is an empty statement – relative to what?
Fig 5: I think a significance test on an arbitrary polynomial is unneeded here. A lowess smoothing
spline or similar would illustrate the point as well.
Fig 6. A non-parametric test is no really suitable here. Better to apply a simple classifier like naïve
Bayes. The separation on pre- vs post-industrial isotopes would be perfect (i.e., zero classification
error). That speaks volumes (visually and statistically).

Response to Reviewer Comments
Associate Editor's comments (Dr Jake Socha):
The reviews for this manuscript were mixed — there was some enthusiasm, but reviewer 1
had major questions about the motivation and relevance of the data for the broader questions
related to changes in the biosphere. Please consider those comments carefully; if they are not
addressed satisfactorily, the manuscript can’t move forward. We look forward to receiving
your revised manuscript.
Thank you for the thorough reviews of the manuscript which we found of great value in
revising the manuscript. The responses to reviewer comments are detailed below in red, with
changes to the manuscript text shown in yellow highlight.

Comments to the Author(s)
In "The broiler chicken as a signal of a human reconfigured biosphere" the authors measured
tibiotarsi collected from archaeological sites to create a timeline of size changes in the
domesticated broiler chicken. Using this, the authors suggest that the broiler chicken is
representative of the changes in the global biosphere due to humans.
The authors present an interesting story of how contemporary broiler chickens are much
larger than their wild ancestor, and since the 1950s, have rapidly increased in size and
biomass to meet the demands of human consumption. While I find the information reviewed
in this manuscript interesting, I am not sure what the motivation for this study is. The authors
state that the broiler chicken represents major changes in the global biosphere, but I am left
wondering why do we need something to represent these changes?
Many current research publications document wild species extinctions, large reductions in
wild species population numbers, and significant changes to the structure of Earth’s
biosphere due to human influence, for example the marked increase in biomass of humans
and their domesticated animals as compared to wild terrestrial animals. So if the biomass of
wild animals is reduced, what has taken its place? The strikingly distinctive post-war new
morphospecies of chicken has become by some way the most numerous domesticated animal
and avian species (wild or domesticated). This manuscript is unique in examining current
biosphere change from a geological perspective, to see if the changes will be reflected in the
physical stratigraphical record.
Therefore, the motivation for the study is to document a species that is a prime example of
human-induced changes to the biosphere, and which also has great potential to be preserved
in rock strata as a biostratigraphical index species of the Anthropocene Series.
These points are made in the Background section, which has now been expanded to better
explain the rationale of the study.
Furthermore, all the changes to the broiler chicken have been artificially selected for, yet the
changing biosphere is a combination of (unprecedented) human influence and natural
selection. Thus, is the boiler chicken an appropriate representation of global biosphere
changes? I recognize the authors incorporate the impact of human consumption of chickens
into this representation.
Natural selection is still operating, of course. Nonetheless, it is difficult to find an
environment at the surface of the Earth that is not subject to some form of human impact, and
this is the main emphasis of the manuscript.
Broiler chickens make up the majority of avian biomass and have by far the highest
population count of any avian species (as we explain in the Discussion, p4, L9-16). They are
a good example [potential fossil proxy] of a modern biosphere now dominated (on land) by
humans and livestock, so they are an appropriate species to represent biosphere changes.
We agree that human influence is the only reason that the broiler chicken exists in its current
form. The human modified biology of the broiler chicken makes the species both a
potentially useful marker fossil for the Anthropocene and a striking example of how humans
have reconfigured the biosphere.
The additions to the Background section (paragraphs 1 and 2) and the new sentences added
to the last paragraph in the Discussion section address these points.
My other big question is the analysis. Why was pair-wise Mann Whitney used and not some
kind of time series analysis since that is what this is? The pair-wise analysis will increase
your chance of a Type I error. I also found the results reported in Supp. Table 1 confusing.
What is the top right portion of the pairwise comparisons?
A time series analysis is not appropriate here because it is commonly used to examine
periodicities over time in large datasets. The Mann Whitney analysis is routinely used in
zooarchaeology to test changing animal bone measurements through time. It is appropriate to
examine if there is a significant difference in the size of the chicken tibiotarsus measurements
from each time period. The top right portion of the tables contain the test statistics (the U
values), this information has been added to the table caption.
Minor comments:
Given the mass difference between large domesticated animals and chickens, perhaps it's best
to refer to mass instead of counts of the animals?
The article is focused on the population numbers of broiler chickens, so it is vital to include
the number slaughtered counts in Figure 1. The mass difference between large domesticated
animals and chickens is indirectly illustrated in Figure 1 in terms of the global production
data. It is clear that due to their greater body mass the amount of pig meat eaten across the
globe in 2014 in greater than that of chicken. We do not feel that this needs to be referred to
more directly in the text of the manuscript.
Is the distal width of the tibiotarsus commonly used? In contemporary studies of birds, it's
typically tarsus length.
The distal breadth of the tibiotarsus measurement is used here instead of length (most often
recorded in modern publications) because the tibiotarsus is a very slender bone (in traditional
breeds and ancient chickens) and in archaeological material it is often recovered broken,
therefore the greatest length is unavailable. The distal end is relatively robust and survives
well and consequently many more distal breadths are recorded than greatest lengths. A
statement has been added to explain this in the Methods section.
It appears you have data from 1950-2000 (Figure 5) so why not include it in Figure 3?
This is not possible because the data are not available to do so. The data in Figure 5 are of the
growth rate of the tibiotarsus and the papers which provide these data do not give the distal
breadth measurements for the bone. Instead the growth rate is usually measured from the
length or width of the tibiotarsus at the midpoint (but not the distal end).
How did you control for age differences in the historical measurements?
Only bones from skeletally mature birds were measured. A sentence has been added to
explain this in the Methods section.

This has been defined in the Methods section, where is it now first mentioned.

Comments to the Author(s)
This contribution presents a compelling case of a vertebrate species has become completely
dependent on human intervention and in some ways humans have become heavily dependent
on a vertebrate species for a rising protein need. The paper is indeed interesting to a variety
of researchers and integrates data and information across a number of disparate research
disciplines. From my view (not an archaeologist or poultry scientist), I think the paper is
pretty well reasoned and techniques appear sound, but there needs to be a better
documentation of the isotope methods. I think the paper should be accepted after a round of
heavy revision to the presentation/writing of the data (see below).
Major comments: My biggest concern with the paper is presentation style and writing. The
writing and data presentation is OK overall, but the points could be much more stream-lined
throughout the MS by better connecting the main points and deleting some of the facts
sprinkled throughout the MS that don’t entirely fit.
The manuscript has been revised to have a better flow between sections and to be more
stream-lined.
-There needs to better flow between the sentences in the background – connect the sentences
together better because currently it is jumpy and sounds like a collection of facts in some
places (e.g., the number of bird individuals in the species). Some of this information is
distracting and detracts from the progression of the section.
The Background has been revised to have a better connectivity between sentences.
-The second paragraph needs a topic sentence that helps direct the reader
This sentence has been added.
-The background needs a ‘Here, we….’ statement to help the reader.
This sentence has been added.
-The Methods section should be before the Results section, right?
Yes this is correct, the methods section has now been moved to before the Results section.
-Results section
-focus this section on the results obtained from the measurements in the Methods section; the
entire first paragraph is background not Results.
This first paragraph has been moved into the Background section.
-I don’t see what the following line adds “Molecular-clock estimates place the origin of the
order Galliformes (pheasants, jungle fowl and relatives) in the early Cretaceous15 , although
the fossil record of the red jungle fowl is poorly known. -integrate better to the story or
delete.
It is important to discuss the completeness of the archaeological and fossil record of domestic
chickens and their jungle fowl ancestors. This is the treatment that a palaeontological
analysis would identify. This sentence has been moved into the Background section so as to
integrate it better into the flow of the paper.
-The paragraph starting with ‘A surge in chicken production from the 1950s onwards’ should
be in the discussion of the results section
This paragraph should remain in the results section because it describes data which are
shown in Figure 5, and Supplementary Information figures 1 and 2. The paragraph has been
revised to make clear what the findings of this study are in comparison to other work.
-Discussion section
-focus on the results and integration with other information.
The results have been better integrated into this section.
-there seems to be a mix of repeated information from the background section that can be cut
(e.g., individuals in bird species comparison)
Some information from this section has been moved into the Background section.
-Paragraph starting with “Bird carcasses…” – I am not sure this fits into the discussion and
may be better in the background.
We consider that this paragraph is suitable in the Discussion rather than the Background
because it examines the potential for broiler chickens to be a marker fossil for the
Anthropocene, a matter of some importance given the ongoing formal analysis of this term
by the relevant international body; this is only logical to discuss after the evidence of their
distinct biology has been presented.
Methods section – why was the breadth of the tibiotarsus measured? Justify this.
Please see comments about this to a query from reviewer 1. A sentence explaining this has
been added to the Methods.
-Where are the isotope extraction and methods section? This all needs to be detailed here.
-need a table of the specimens and their isotope values
The isotope plot is generated from a synthesis of data presented in three published studies.
The data tables and methodologies are available in full in the studies referenced.
A new paragraph has been added to the Methods section which explains that data used here
to produce several figures is a synthesis of results from multiple publications.
Minor comments:
Abstract – It is better to state the body size of the chicken has significantly increased through
time instead of saying that the tibiotarsus is getting bigger – the bone is a proxy for overall
bodysize.
Yes, this has been amended in the abstract.
Figures – Overall effective, but can be presented in a more professional way
Figure 2 - Good use of color, but it looks like it was done quickly. Use solid, but transparent
shapes to outline your three areas.
The figure has been amended.
Figure 3 – Label y axis in a traditional patter to the left of the axis
This figure has been amended, as has SI Figure 1 for consistency.
Figure 4 – I think this figure is OK, but could be much more effective by providing a
silhouette of a chicken with the leg bones presented and labelled showing differences in body
size. There is not much information as presented, but this can be much more powerful
through a different approach.
To show the chicken silhouette to scale with the photographed leg bone specimens inside it
would hinder the clarity of the photographs. Instead we have shown a silhouette of each bird
on the figure with limb bones highlighted, with each species at a proportionate size.

Comments to the Author(s)
This paper contains lots of data, but it is essentially a philosophical argument, focused on the
Anthropocene. It was certainly a very interesting read, and many of the numerical figures
presented are breathtaking (and useful to know). Overall, it is a terrific paper. Arguments
could be made for any number of domesticated or pet species as being candidates for being
living caricatures of the Anthropocene, but the argument for the broiler chicken is well made
by the authors, and it might as well be the one, especially given the C and biomass figures
described on p4, L9-16.
Thank you for acknowledging the importance of the paper.
I think the conclusion is a little weak. There is scope, in a few sentences, to wrap up this
flood of remarkable statistics on the chicken with a conclusion that looks back more directly
to the Anthropocene. Is the buried broiler-chick biomass (of carcasses) --- probably written
indelibly in the fossil record --- a biological ‘bomb spike’ that future generations could be
used to mark the start of the Anthropocene? Is it as good as any other measure that has
recently been proposed as a marker?
The Conclusions section has been extended to address these questions.
Some minor points:
P3, L17-20: Regarding growth pathologies, given that the archaeological record is so sparse
compared to modern data, can anything more than a binary occurrence (or not) of a
phenomenon like this really be inferred? Are the authors trying to say that such pathologies
have increased in the modern chicken? If so, the argument would only make sense in terms
of % terms, which cannot be given. As such, I’m not convinced that this statement tells us
anything useful.
Osteo-pathologies are potentially important in terms of distinguishing modern broilers from
older domesticated breeds and could be useful as a biostratigraphic character. However it is
unknown how the occurrence of osteo-pathologies may have developed over the 20th century
and you are right in saying that we cannot give % terms at this time. A statement explaining
how osteo-pathologies can be useful has been included.
P3, L46-47: I’m not sure that this is a fair comparison. Domestic free-range hens can live 5-
10 years on average, and the 30-year estimate for a jungle fowl would be at the extreme
upper end (and inferred, not measured). I doubt the evidence for longevity differences is
convincing, other than for those chickens slaughtered prior to their natural senescence, which
economic not biological.
We agree that the 30 year age limit is a one off case (and is reported from an old publication:
Mitchell, P. C., 1911). On longevity and relative viability in mammals and birds: With a note
on the theory of longevity. Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, 81. 425-528),
so cannot be verified. A more recent study (Collias et al., 1994) reported a longevity of 3
years for red jungle fowl, but this is considered to be an underestimate by Professor
Tommaso Pizzari who leads a long-term study of a captive red jungle fowl population (~200
individuals) at the John Krebs Research Station, University of Oxford. Professor Pizzari has
recorded a maximum longevity of 11 years (unfortunately this is not published).
The manuscript has been amended to reflect these updated age estimates and the importance
of the short lifespan of broilers has been expanded on.
P4, L4-7: Repetitive with the Introduction.
These sentences have been moved to the Background section.
P4, L45-47: This is debatable. The vast majority of domestic animals would perish without
human aid, albeit perhaps not as rapidly and decisively as the global broiler flock.
We argue that we have presented convincing evidence that broiler chickens are unable to
survive without human intervention. As discussed in the paper, the most compelling evidence
is that their biology has been altered so that rapidly maturing broilers are likely to die before
reaching sexual maturity. This is a result of several health problems such as skeletal
deformities, lameness, heart failure and ascites. Skeletal deformities occur because the bone
density is much reduced compared to a 'normal' chicken and cannot support the extra weight.
Heart failure is caused by the heart being much smaller relative to the increased muscle mass
- it just can't keep the blood sufficiently oxygenated and gives out under the strain. Ascites is
related to the increased pectoral muscles reducing the amount of room in the body cavity for
the lungs. There are few publications available to support this (due to the ethical implications
of conducting such studies) but we do cite Baéza (et al. 2012) who show that a seven-fold
increase in mortality rates occurs in broilers that lived to 9 weeks old. Anecdotal evidence
from animal rescue organisations indicates that at most broilers can live for a few months,
compared to a lifespan in years for rescued egg-laying chickens.
The other main domesticated animals may have problems with breeding naturally, but they
have not been selectively modified to such an extent that they would perish within months.
The majority would manage considerably better in an imagined scenario where they were left
to fend for themselves.
P5, L4-5: “is significant” is an empty statement – relative to what?
This has been amended to specify that it is significantly higher relative to the production of
plant food staples.
Fig 5: I think a significance test on an arbitrary polynomial is unneeded here. A lowess
smoothing spline or similar would illustrate the point as well.
The best fit line has been amended from a polynomial to a smoothing spline.
Fig 6. A non-parametric test is no really suitable here. Better to apply a simple classifier like
naïve Bayes. The separation on pre- vs post-industrial isotopes would be perfect (i.e., zero
classification error). That speaks volumes (visually and statistically).
Thank you for this suggestion, the classifier is more appropriate for portraying the data. A
discriminant analysis has been run and it classifies the two groups (archaeological Vs modern
broiler isotope compositions) as distinct from each other. A histogram of the analysis has
been included as Supplementary Information, Figure 3. Please note that Supplementary
Information, Table 2 has been deleted.
