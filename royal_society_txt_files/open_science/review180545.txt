The manuscript' Facile synthesis of palladium nanoparticles on hierarchical hollow silica spheres
(HHSS) and its catalytic properties in Suzuki-reaction is rejected due to following.
1. Introduction begins like , "Since Wilkinson developed RhCl(PPh3)3
[1], a large number of homogeneous transition metal catalysts, especially
Palladium [2-5], have been widely developed [6-8]". I am unable to understand correlation of
present work with RhCl(PPh3)3
2.Introduction has not covered earlier work properly and critically.
3 Is Pd sitting on surface and inside both are contributing to catalysis ? Not commented
adequately. Is Pd leached and homogeneous pathway is contributing ?
4. XPS is essential to know the state of Pd.
5 Is catalyst reusable ?
6. Selected substrates are common ones.
7. Reaction time is 22 h for some substrate. Can it be reduced by higher Pd loading?
8. Claim of optimum Pd loading is doubtful. It needs comparison with other similar reports and
an explanation.
9 Some Schemes and Figures are not numbered.
Overall paper is done half heartedly

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the synthesis of palladium nanoparticles on
hierarchical hollow silica spheres (HHSS) that was first developed by the authors and its catalytic
properties in Suzuki-reaction. It discusses an interesting topic based on several characterization
methods. The authors have succeeded in synthesis of the palladium nanoparticles with a size of
5-10 nm and it shows high catalytic activity in Suzuki-reaction with very low amount of catalyst.
The presented work is interesting. I think this work is suitable for Royal Society Open Science
published after a minor revision as indicated below.

The revised version is better than the first one but not of publication standard in a RSC journal.
The revisions in the light of earlier comments are not thorough. For example , "The substrates we
chose are used to illustrate both the electron-withdrawing group and the electron-donating group
can be tolerated" Is it a new discovery by authors ?
Performance of present catalyst with earlier reports is not carried out. Hundreds of catalysts are
known for Suzuki reaction. The present catalyst looks very ordinary. What is the need of present
work is is not clear ? I can not recommend its publication

Dear Editor:
Thanks a lot for your letter and the reviewers’ comments concerning our
manuscript. The comments are valuable and helpful for revising and improving our
paper. Enclosed please find a revised manuscript entitled: Facile synthesis of
palladium nanoparticles on hierarchical hollow silica spheres (HHSS) and its
catalytic properties in Suzuki-reaction (RSOS-180545). We have revised the
manuscript carefully according to the reviewers’ comments, and these changes are
highlighted in the text (blue) and our point-to-point responds to the reviewer’s
comments are listed as follows:
Referee: 1
1. a large number of homogeneous transition metal catalysts, especially
Palladium [2-5], have been widely developed [6-8]". I am unable to understand
correlation of present work with RhCl(PPh3)3
Response: Based on reviewer 1’s suggestion, we have changed the introduction and
rewritten the earlier work.
2. Introduction has not covered earlier work properly and critically.
Response: Based on reviewer’s suggestion, we have changed the introduction and
rewritten the earlier work.
3. Is Pd sitting on surface and inside both are contributing to catalysis? Not
commented adequately. Is Pd leached and homogeneous pathway is contributing?
Response:
According to reviewer 1’s first question, an appropriate explanation is as follows: The
Pd@HHSS catalysts are evenly dispersed into the reaction solution, and the reactants
can freely enter the surface and internal cavity of the catalysts. At the same time, the
Pd@HHSS catalysts have high surface area, which can adsorb reactants. Therefore, the Pd
nanoparticles sitting on surface and inside both are contributing to catalysis.
According to reviewer 1’s second question, we have done the hot filtration test. The
coupling reaction carried out with p-Bromotoluene and Phenylboronic acid was
stirred for 20 min at 75 oC and the conversion was checked, and then filtered off the
catalyst while it's hot. The filtration remained stirring for another 3 h at 75 oC and
then the conversion was checked. Both the conversions were 11% (determined by 1H
NMR), and no conversion change was observed. It indicated that the reaction was
running without Pd leached into solution, but it still needs further systematical
experiments to confirm according to the review (Chem. Rev. 2018, 118, 2249). The
systematical study will be included in our next article.
3. XPS is essential to know the state of Pd.
Response: Based on reviewer 1’s suggestion, we have added the corresponding XPS
in this paper, which shows the state of Pd is 0.
Fig. 4 XPS spectra for the as-prepared Pd@HHSS (Pd/SiO2 = 10:100) .(a) full XPS spectra,
(b)
Pd3d states.
As shown in Fig. 4a, full XPS spectra consist of Pd, Si, O and C elements. Among
them, C can be excluded from the product as base materials. The Pd 3d
high-resolution XPS (Fig. 4b) displays two peaks at 340.68 and 335.58 eV, which are
attributed to Pd0 nanoparticles with the peaks of Pd 3d in Pd@HHSS[42,43]<U+3002>
5. Is catalyst reusable?
Response: Based on reviewer 1’s question, we have tested the reusability of the
catalyst, and it was investigated with p-Bromotoluene and Phenylboronic acid as the
substrates. After each run, the catalyst was recovered by filtration. The catalytic
activity did not change considerably after four cycles. The conversion of fourth
catalytic reaction was still 95% (determined by 1H NMR). This has been added in
the paper.
6. Selected substrates are common ones.
Response: The substrates we chose are used to illustrate both the
electron-withdrawing group and the electron-donating group can be tolerated.
7. Reaction time is 22 h for some substrate. Can it be reduced by higher Pd loading?
Response: Based on reviewer 1’s question, we have retested the reaction (Table 1,
entry 5). When the amount of catalyst was doubled, 92% yield was obtained after
stirring for 8 h.
8. Claim of optimum Pd loading is doubtful. It needs comparison with other similar
reports and an explanation.
Response: The optimum Pd loading was decided by the conversion (determined by
1
H NMR).
9. Some Schemes and Figures are not numbered.
Response: Based on reviewer 1’s suggestion, the mistakes have been modified.
Referee: 2
1. In Figure 2, what do 5%, 10%, 20% Pd@HHSS mean? Are they molar ratios?
Response: It is the molar ratio and we have changed the caption in Fig. 2
2. Page 3, Line 1: “amount of HHSS used” not “amout of HHSS used”
3. Page 3, Line 6: “be affected by” not “be effected by”
Response: We have made the corresponding changes as suggested by reviewer 2.
We hope that the above changes have met the requirement and thank you very much
again for considering this manuscript.
Sincerely yours,
Mao Liu
