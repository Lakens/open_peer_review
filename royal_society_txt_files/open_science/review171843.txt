Comments to the authors,
Gonzalez-Espinosa examined differences in skeletal morphology among individuals of different
sexes in the coral Porites panamensis. The authors present a very tidy account of the supporting
literature, gaps in understanding and the ramifications of their findings, making for a quick and
informative read. The sampling design, so far as I can tell appears sound, but the statistical
analysis of the data is severely lacking in detail and rigour. Accordingly, the recommendations
that follow will centre on this aspect of the work as it is difficult to assess overall impact when the
analysis are not appropriate for the data collected.
If I am not mistaken, the authors collected fragments of individual corals from three locations,
each coral was then sexed and eleven traits measured on each fragment. The way the authors
have tackled the data analysis is to break the dataset down to the most minimal form – analysis of
sex specific differences for single traits at single sites. Unfortunately, by ignoring the fact that the
11 traits were measured on the same individual they ignored the repeated measures component
of their study and are guilty of pseudoreplication. Furthermore, in the analysis where they
pooled the data for all three sites the differences among sexes became were non-significant (lines
106-107). Finding significant differences among sexes when sites were separated vs when sites
were pooled suggests one of two things to me 1) the differences among sexes the authors report
are not real or 2) sites were not properly accounted for in the analysis of the pooled data. Overall,
what I would recommend is that the authors fit a linear mixed effects model to ALL of their data
where: Sex (fixed effect, with 2 levels), trait (fixed effect, with 11 levels) and Site (random effect,
with 3 levels) are crossed and individual is fitted as a nested random effect with random
intercepts for each trait. From this model they would then be able to make robust inferences
about their data while avoiding pseudoreplication and the need for 33 different analyses (one
analysis for each site by trait combination). A significant Sex × Trait interaction would support
their hypothesis that some traits differ among the sexes.
Another downfall of the current analyses is that the environmental variables are treated as
independent when they are almost certainly correlated – again leading to problems with
pseudoreplication because they presume they have more variables than they actually have. One
possible solution would be to calculate principal component (PC) scores for the environmental
variables and include these PC scores as a covariate in the above analysis.
Information on how fit these models is widely available for the statistics package lme4 in R.
Minor recommendations
Line 36: delete “marine invertebrates” there are many marine invertebrates where sexual
dimorphism has been examined to death e.g. fiddler crabs
Line 45: insert “often” between “are” and “considered”
Methods: in table 1 or in a separate table, include the numbers of male and female corals collected
for each site.
Lines 93-95: what is meant by different spatial extent? Did you have sites within locations? If not,
you have one spatial extent defined by your three sites….
Lines 167-172: revise, this makes very little sense to me and there are a number of grammatical
mistakes.
Figure 3: In a box and whisker you display medians and quantiles, yet your analyses test for
3
differences in means given their standard errors. If you are going to test for differences in means
then plot the means and the standard errors! Delete and start again.

Your ms addresses the rarely examined topic of whether or not sexual dimorphism is ever
expressed in the coral skeleton and you are correct in proposing that if it were, this could be of
value in interpreting fossil populations (however you need to be clear that the finding only
occurred in one of three locations). This is timely in relation to the integrative taxonomy
approaches (genetics, micromorphology and microstructure) that are currently revolutionizing
our understanding of phylogeny and nomenclature of coral taxa. Your exploration of the
requirements for accommodating the large developing larvae in gonochoric coral polyps is also
very interesting and relevant. The location of your work, in the eastern Pacific and along a
gradation from tropical to high latitude marginal reefs, adds to the interest. I feel you could
expand your references a little to indicate how your findings relate to the broader literature on

If I am not mistaken, the authors collected fragments of individual corals from three locations,
each coral was then sexed and eleven traits measured on each fragment. The way the authors

what I would recommend is that the authors fit a linear mixed effects model to ALL of their data
where: Sex (fixed effect, with 2 levels), trait (fixed effect, with 11 levels) and Site (random effect,
with 3 levels) are crossed and individual is fitted as a nested random effect with random

about their data while avoiding pseudoreplication and the need for 33 different analyses (one

their hypothesis that some traits differ among the sexes.
Another downfall of the current analyses is that the environmental variables are treated as

pseudoreplication because they presume they have more variables than they actually have. One
possible solution would be to calculate principal component (PC) scores for the environmental

Information on how fit these models is widely available for the statistics package lme4 in R.

broadcasting species, namely the need to accommodate large developing larvae in female polyps.
In relation to this, it refers to the environmentally marginal nature of the northerly vs southern
locations in your study. I feel you miss the opportunity to go a little further and refer to the
potential for population genetics studies to reveal cryptic lineages in similar geographic
gradients, e.g. around the Kuroshio current at similar latitudes in the NW Pacific (Suzuki et al.
Coral Reefs 2016) which indicate low genetic variability and possible development of cryptic
species.
Line 122 – Take out “in” from “least in three”. After “traits” add something like “in one of three
populations”.
Introduction
Lines 34 “little is known…etc” While this is certainly true, it would be worth citing one or two
papers on other marine invertebrates, (e.g. Son and Hughes J. Moll. Stud. 2000 (molluscs), Evans
and Sherman Biol. Bull. 2013 (echinoderms), to indicate the scope.
Line 42 Change “of” to “to “.
Line 42 change “cope” to “copes”
Material and methods
Line 67 add (“see Figure 2”) after the bracket.
Figure 2 : You could help the reader with this figure. Try rotating the top image 90 degrees
clockwise so that the dorsal and ventral septa are positioned in a dorsal-ventral direction and
listing the initials of the characters either alphabetically or in order from top to bottom.
Results
Lines 106-7 There’s something missing from this sentence – maybe it’s an “and” after the
brackets?

Comments to the authors
The authors have made a significant effort to implement a more appropriate set of analyses for
their data. However, while they have been able to account for some of my concerns they have still
failed to account for the pseudoreplication introduced by not accounting for having multiple
measures of corallite morphology from the same individual. Most importantly, given the results
presented, there is no proof that there are relevant differences in corallite morphology among the
sexes, calling into question the entire premise of the study. Nevertheless, given the numbers of
samples presented in Table I (new addition to the manuscript) I would recommend reducing the
paper to focus only on the results for Bahia de la Paz and removing any reference to spatial or
environmental differences. Perhaps if the data were limited to the only site with proper
replication, the authors may find (while properly accounting for repeated measures in a
multivariate model) a significant difference among the sexes, and the premise of the study can
remain intact. Alternatively, I am sorry, but I don’t see how the data could support the author’s
primary conclusions.
Response to the comments in the author’s response letter:
Regarding with the linear model suggested from the package lme4, we would like to clarify that it was not
possible to fit a linear mixed effects model to all of the data as suggested, where: Sex (fixed effect, with 2
14
levels), trait (fixed effect, with 11 levels) and Site (random effect, with 3 levels) are crossed and individual is
fitted as a nested random effect with random intercepts for each trait. This is because in the linear mixed
effects model “trait” cannot be the response variable and the fixed effect with 11 levels at the same time as
each “trait” has each own numeric value and different scale, and it cannot be combined with its categorical
“trait” name.
This is not true – repeated measures analyses are a routine procedure, and lme4 is more than
capable of dealing with these designs. I would not have recommended it had I not known, from
personal experience, that it is possible or that there are many tutorials on the subject.
Furthermore, with 10 measurements of each trait for each individual (Line 70-71: “11 traits were
measured in 10 corallites selected haphazardly per fragment”) there is more than sufficient
replication. The authors comment “and different scale” regarding their traits is very true, nice
catch – the data need to be centred and scaled before including them in a linear mixed effects
model or MANOVA.
Instead, we applied a MANOVA test to account for differences in “sex” + “site” vs “traits”, a significate
p-value would support the result of non-significative sexual dimorphism when data is pooled.
I suspect they mean a non-significant p-value for the fixed effect of sex would support the result
of non-significant sexual dimorphism.
The discriminant analysis performed in this study is a useful follow-up procedure to MANOVA.
LDA and MANOVA are so closely related that it is redundant to include both – delete either the
MANOVA or the LDA.
Importantly, I agree the MANOVA is a more appropriate analysis than the original univariate
models, but it does not account for repeated measures and therefore the results are still
confounded by pseudoreplication: the 10 corallites measured on each individual are being treated
as though they are random sample from the population, which is not true, as they are measures
from the same individual.
A quick solution would be to include only one randomly sampled (use a random number
generator!) corallite from each individual or to include only the mean corallite values for each
individual in the current MANOVA framework. If the authors choose to use either of these quick
and dirty fixes, I would recommend they make explicit statements acknowledging that they have
ignored within individual variation in corallite morphology. Alternatively, they should use a
linear mixed effects model or a mixed effects MANOVA (which do exist!) with individual
included as a random effect.
Comments regarding the content of the new manuscript:
Line 106-109 A MANOVA test showed significant differences among sites + sex vs traits (Table III), so
that, a discriminate analysis was performed separately by site, finding, in this case, sexual dimorphism
(Wilks' Lambda 0.635 approx. F(11,51)=2.665, p= 0.008844) at Bahía de La Paz only.
I am sorry but this is not true. The significant difference indicated in Table III is for the fixed
effect of site, indicating there is spatial variation in corallite morphology, nowhere does it indicate
that there is any evidence of sexual dimorphism. Nonetheless, if the authors chose to limit their
dataset and inference to only Bahia de la Paz then, given they properly account for repeated
measures, they may have evidence for sexual dimorphism given the result indicated above.
Lines 95-97 A Welch´s t-test was used to assess statistical differences between individual traits among
sexes. If the data for a trait was not normally distributed, a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test was applied.
If the MANOVA indicated that there was no significant difference among the sexes in corallite
morphology then it not appropriate to continue breaking the dataset down and fishing for p-
values! Moreover, and again, without properly accounting for repeated measures the per trait per
site analyses are pseudoreplicated.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_4
Comments to the authors,
The authors have made a significant effort to improve their manuscript in accordance with
previous recommendations though I have two remaining recommendations.
1) The way the authors have incorporated the information on the morphology of corals at Bahia
Concepcion and Bahia de Los Angeles as well as the environmental information is completely
inappropriate and has the potential to mislead readers. They have attempted to hide these results
in the discussion, presenting these data as quantitative analyses though they ignore the
significant limitations outlined in previous submissions, by using the guise of “exploratory
results”. Please delete lines 117 to 144 as well as tables III, IV and V these have no place in a
discussion and instead include observational results as pers. obs. to reflect the fact that they are
observations and not quantitative, albeit exploratory, results. Furthermore, the authors need to
remove the panels in Figure 3 that show among site comparisons as well as the locations of the
additional sites in Figure 4. Lines 146 to 165 are, in my opinion, the proper way to summarise
observational results in a discussion, giving the broader context for the work without misleading
the reader about the reliability of the data.
2) If the authors are going to continue to ignore within individual variation by analysing on the
trait means, then they need to show the magnitude of the within individual trait variation relative
to the among sex trait variation. Particularly, if they wish to make statements about using
corallite diameter, corallite density and the number of neighbouring corallites as a diagnostic
measurement in the field (Lines 102-105). I still strongly recommend that the authors repeat their
analyses with a single randomly chosen corallite from each fragment, rather than using trait
means as the samples this more accurately reflects natural levels of trait variation instead of
variation in the trait mean.

jor review:
ank you very much for your comments; we carefully read all of them and appreciate
r suggestions. We made the corresponding corrections as follow:
nding significant differences among sexes when sites were separated vs when sites
re pooled suggests one of two things to me 1) the differences among sexes the authors
ort are not real or 2) sites were not properly accounted for in the analysis of the pooled
a. Overall, what I would recommend is that the authors fit a linear mixed effects model
ALL of their data where: Sex (fixed effect, with 2 levels), trait (fixed effect, with 11 levels)
d Site (random effect, with 3 levels) are crossed and individual is fitted as a nested
dom effect with random intercepts for each trait. From this model they would then be
e to make robust inferences about their data while avoiding pseudoreplication and the
ed for 33 different analyses (one analysis for each site by trait combination). A
nificant Sex × Trait interaction would support their hypothesis that some traits differ
ong the sexes”.
garding with the linear model suggested from the package lme4, we would like to clarify
t it was not possible to fit a linear mixed effects model to all of the data as suggested,
ere: Sex (fixed effect, with 2 levels), trait (fixed effect, with 11 levels) and Site (random
ect, with 3 levels) are crossed and individual is fitted as a nested random effect with
dom intercepts for each trait. This is because in the linear mixed effects model “trait”

h “trait” has each own numeric value and different scale, and it cannot be combined
h its categorical “trait” name. Instead, we applied a MANOVA test to account for
erences in “sex” + “site” vs “traits”, a significate p-value would support the result of
n-significative sexual dimorphism when data is pooled. The discriminant analysis
formed in this study is a useful follow-up procedure to MANOVA.
ally, we included the PCA scores for the environmental variables as a covariate in
previous analysis.
or recommendations:
made the suggested changes and will be included in the manuscript as follows:

orphism has been examined to death e.g. fiddler crabs
added (not deleted) “marine invertebrates” examples and cites where sexual
orphism has been examined.

corrected and clarified that we have one spatial extent (Gulf of California) defined by
ee sites (BLA, BCO and BLA).
es 167-172: revise, this makes very little sense to me and there are a number of
mmatical mistakes.
revised and changed these lines.

means then plot the means and the standard errors! Delete and start again.
run a function in R that calculates the mean, SD and SEM, and forced that the boxplot

appreciate so much your valuable comments, we read carefully all of them and
de the adequate corrections as follow:

es 34 “little is known…etc” While this is certainly true, it would be worth citing one or
papers on other marine invertebrates, (e.g. Son and Hughes J. Moll. Stud. 2000
olluscs), Evans and Sherman Biol. Bull. 2013 (echinoderms), to indicate the scope.

changed the order for presenting the results to make them clearer.
cussion
ragraph starting line 146 - this discussion highlights a dramatic difference between
oding vs broadcasting species, namely the need to accommodate large developing
ae in female polyps. In relation to this, it refers to the environmentally marginal
ure of the northerly vs southern locations in your study. I feel you miss the
portunity to go a little further and refer to the potential for population genetics studies
eveal cryptic lineages in similar geographic gradients, e.g. around the Kuroshio
rent at similar latitudes in the NW Pacific (Suzuki et al. Coral Reefs 2016) which
icate low genetic variability and possible development of cryptic species”.
extended this part of the discussion stressing out the possibility of presence of cryptic
cies in the northern sites and that could be the reason to consider for the non-
nificance findings.
e 122 – Take out “in” from “least in three”. After “traits” add something like “in one of

took out “in” from “least in three”, and added “ in one out of three sites” after “traits”.

appreciate so much your comments; we carefully read all of them and followed your
gestions. We made the corresponding corrections as follow:
ould recommend reducing the paper to focus only on the results for Bahia de la Paz
d removing any reference to spatial or environmental differences. Perhaps if the data
re limited to the only site with proper replication, the authors may find (while properly
ounting for repeated measures in a multivariate model) a significant difference among
sexes, and the premise of the study can remain intact.”.
decided to follow the suggestions of the reviewer to focus only on Bahia de La Paz
ce is the site with more samples available and in fact, the study began there. The other
sites (BCO and BLA) and any environmental measurement were sent to discussion
d mentioned as an exploratory analysis only in order to avoid any cause/effect
tements in the results.
rthermore, with 10 measurements of each trait for each individual (Line 70-71: “11
ts were measured in 10 corallites selected haphazardly per fragment”), there is more
n sufficient replication”
arify this part in the manuscript. Since the beginning of the research and to avoid
udoreplication we averaged the measurement of each trait as follow: from each coral
ony we selected 10 corallites haphazardly, from each corallite we measured 11
erent traits, each trait measurement was then averaged. For example, from a single
ony (PpamH1) and a single trait (diameter; D1) we have 10 measurements if we had
d this raw measurement we had commit pseudoreplication, but we averaged them
d therefore we only have a single averaged value for colony´s 1 diameter, we repeated
for each colony and for the next independent 10 traits. Thus, at the end we have a

e main aim of the study is to find differences between sexes in any of the traits or using

uced number of samples. Interestingly we did not find differences and that was no
prise at all, the sites are completely different (environmentally) and are considered, in
t, out of the “normal” range of distribution for corals. The colonies are smaller in size
the corallites seem bigger. This (differences in sites) was confirmed with the MANOVA

lowing your recommendation, we ran a “Lmer” test by taking Sex (2 levels), trait (11
