This manuscript reports about "A Lateral Flow Immunochromatographic Strip Test for Rapid
Detection of Hexoestrol in Fish Samples". The work is interesting and exhibits a certain degree of
innovation. However, the manuscript in this format is not innovation enough to publish in Royal
Society Open Science. Thus I would suggest the manuscript in this format could be rejected
unless some major revisions as indicated.
1. The formats of some figures (e.g. Figure 1A, B and Figure 2A, B, C) of this manuscript are
coarse and should be revised carefully. These sections of the two Figures should be merged
together. The icons and graphs of all figures are not clear enough and should be blacken and
improved, and the units of horizontal and vertical coordinates should be modified carefully.
2. Please carefully check and modify the consistency of Journal Title abbreviations, some
abbreviations and some no abbreviations. Please pay more attention to the unity of units and
symbols, there are too many errors.
3. This manuscript is poorly written in English and difficult to read. The English composition
requires many improvements. The authors should proofread the manuscript carefully to
minimize typographical, grammatical, and bibliographic errors.

The manuscript describes the development of a lateral flow immunochromatographic test for the
detection of hexoestrol (HES) in fish samples. Preparation of antigens, production of mouse
monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against HES, labelling of anti HES MAb with colloidal gold,
assembly of the immunostrips, and evaluation of the test performance is described.
The manuscript is not scientifically sound in its present form because:
a) there is a lack of sufficient detail in the Material and Methods part to repeat the study. For
example: 1) there is no detail on the ELISA tests used to select mice for generating hybridomas
and screening of the supernatants for the presence of HES specific MAb-s; 2) hybridoma cell line
generation refers to the study by Waldmann and Raud (2016) (line 122 in the manuscript),
however, this paper does not describe generation of hybridomas and Mab-s; 3) there is no
information on the HES measurement protocol for HPLC; 4) it is not clear how specificity was
calculated after adding 1000 µg/kg of the competitors.
b) in the Results and Discussion section, the paper does not give information on the
characteristics of the Mab-s generated (ie. ELISA results to select the best antibody). There are
also no data on the LFT optimization such as titration curve results for optimal HES-OVA and
colloidal gold labelled MAb concentrations.
c) the paper is lacking broader discussion of the results in the context of development of LFA-s.
There is only one reference in the Discussion section.
d) the interpretations and conclusions are written in a form of statements. The manuscript does
not demonstrate how the results were obtained (i.e. evidence based LFT optimization results are
lacking).
e) the study has a very small proof of evidence (only 3 samples) on the comparison between the
LFT and HPLC.
The authors have used previously developed and well-known approach and techniques for
production of MAb-s against HES, labelling of anti HES MAb with colloidal gold, assembly of the
immunostrips. From this aspect, the manuscript lack novelty.

However, the manuscript gives some information about a LFT for measurement of HES in fish
samples.
It is stated in the manuscript that all relevant data are within the paper and the electronic
supplementary files. However, the reviewer had no access to electronic supplementary files.
The manuscript needs editing for English language.

manuscript will be sent back to one or more of the original reviewers for assessment. If the
original reviewers are not available we may invite new reviewers.
To revise your manuscript, log into http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been
appended to denote a revision. Revise your manuscript and upload a new version through your
Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you must respond to the comments made by the
referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". Please use this to
document how you have responded to the comments, and the adjustments you have made. In
order to expedite the processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in
your response.
Please also include the following statements alongside the other end statements. As we cannot
publish your manuscript without these end statements included, if you feel that a given heading
