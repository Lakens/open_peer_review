Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The authors have satisfactorily addressed the majority of my concerns; I think it is a much
stronger paper now. I have a few additional comments to further improve clarity and/or correct
omissions.
Line 101 – insert "relatively" before "little"
120 – insert comma after "after"
148 – There were no common garden conditions described in the previous section. Was a
paragraph accidentally omitted?
150-152 – was there any anesthesia used while the fish were being measured?
153 – Was there any difference between the lines?
155 – insert "and" before "then", replace "breaking" with "cutting", as I assume scissors were used
to do this.
160 – start new paragraph at "On Day 2…"
176 – at least provide the duration of time and volume of water here.
178-180 – simply provide the mean and range for the individual intra-assay variations. Also,
provide the actual hormone name before each abbreviation.
189 – explain what "processed" means
190 – "individuals" should be "an individual"
201, 207, 209, 232, 271 – "hormones" should be "hormone levels"
209 – insert "level" after "hormone"
211 – "effect" should be "correlation", "on" should be "with"
215 – "Hormone responses" needs to be defined here at first use of the term. Move up the
definition from lines 230-232.
230 – "were represented as" should be "represent"
331 – should read "challenge between hermaphrodites and secondary males that we revealed in
our study" to keep the relevant parts of the sentence together.
342 – start new paragraph here
350 – should be "provided"
359 – start new paragraph at "Similar phenomena…"
366 – should be "Our results suggest…"
367 – "was" should be "is"
369-370 – start second sentence at "however"
Table 1 – legend should explain hormone abbreviations. F is likely to be particularly cryptic to
many readers.
All figures – delete the tick marks on the x-axis – they add unnecessary visual clutter.
Fig 1 – Write out GSI and testosterone in legend. Legend should explain hormone abbreviations.
Add sample sizes.
Fig 2 – delete key at top of panel B because it is unnecessary. Add sample sizes.
Fig 3 - Add sample sizes. Add units to y-axis.
Fig 4 - Add units to y-axis. The two group names can be written out – there is enough space.

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript. Make sure it is clear in your data accessibility statement how the data
can be accessed;

5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article
so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Please note that Royal Society Open Science will introduce article processing charges for all new
submissions received from 1 January 2018. Charges will also apply to papers transferred to Royal
Society Open Science from other Royal Society Publishing journals, as well as papers submitted
as part of our collaboration with the Royal Society of Chemistry

ase find below the comments followed by the author responses (in bold) to each reviewers’ question.
Response to Editor:
lease note that we cannot publish your manuscript without these end statements included…
ponse: We have included the complete end statements in the revision. Please see line 361-412
Responses to Reviewer:
101 – insert "relatively" before "little"
ponse: This has been changed in the revision. Please see line 95.
– insert comma after "after"
ponse: This has been changed in the revision. Please see line 114.
– There were no common garden conditions described in the previous section. Was a paragraph
dentally omitted?
ponse: The common garden conditions were described in the paragraph of “Study organism”;
se see line 124-133.
-152 – was there any anesthesia used while the fish were being measured?
ponse: Fish was taken out of the maintenance container and transferred to a transparent plastic
with little water, and then the standard length was measured with calipers. In this standard protocol,
spent less than 10 seconds (on average) measuring the length of fish, so there was no anesthesia
d during the measurements. Mangrove rivulus can survive out of water for more than a month;
efore, being out of water for such a short period time should not result in any negative impacts on
avior and physiology. We add the description of the method in the revision. Please see line 145-146.
– Was there any difference between the lines?
ponse: The standard length of RHL was significantly larger than DAN2K (RHL: 28.73±0.03 mm;
N2K: 27.37±0.02 mm; t142 = 4.38, p < 0.001). This information was added in the revision. Please see
149-151.
– insert "and" before "then", replace "breaking" with "cutting", as I assume scissors were used to do this.

– start new paragraph at "On Day 2…"
ponse: This has been changed in the revision. Please see line 158.
– at least provide the duration of time and volume of water here.
ponse: The duration of time and volume of water which was used in hormone collection has been
ed in the revision. Please see line 173-174.
-180 – simply provide the mean and range for the individual intra-assay variations. Also, provide the actual
mone name before each abbreviation.
ponse: This has been revised in the revision, and the actual hormone names were also added in
paragraph. Please see line 177-181.
– explain what "processed" means
ponse: This sentence has been changed to “…If fish did not engage in a contest, they were
sferred to hormone collection beakers after 20 minutes…” Please see line 188-189.
– "individuals" should be "an individual"
ponse: This has been changed in the revision. Please see line 191.
, 207, 209, 232, 271 – "hormones" should be "hormone levels"
ponse: All these “hormones” have been changed to “hormone levels” in the revision.
– insert "level" after "hormone"
ponse: This has been changed in the revision.
– "effect" should be "correlation", "on" should be "with"
ponse: This has been changed in the revision. Please see line 212-213.
– "Hormone responses" needs to be defined here at first use of the term. Move up the definition from lines
-232.
ponse: The definition of “hormone response” has been moved to line 217-218, at first use of the
.
– "were represented as" should be "represent"
