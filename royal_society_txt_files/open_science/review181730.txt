Plastic multicellular development of Myxococcus xanthus: genotype-environment interactions in
a physical gradient
This manuscript focuses on how abiotic conditions affect the multicellular development
phenotypes of the social bacteria M. xanthus. Moreover, the authors test how development across
the range of agar stiffnesses vary across genotypes, and statistically test for interactions between
the abiotic and genetic treatments in a multitude of fruiting body morphologies. In general, the
manuscript was easy to follow and clearly presented. The figures do a good job of showing the
results of the experiment. It seems that the expeirmental procedures and the statistical analyses
were done correctly. However, I outline some broad concerns below.
What are these M. xanthus mutants? There needs to be a more full explanation of why these
mutants in particular were tested, and if there were any expectations with regard to the specific
mutations and development across the abiotic gradient.
The authors also do not offer clear explanations or interpretations for the observed patterns. For
example, is there any explanation for why the genotypes become less clustered on more soft
agar? Similarly, any reason why you would expect agar stiffness to not have a major effect within
a given genotype?
Is there any information or broader significance to the fruiting body traits that you measured?
Many population level studies of Myxococcus xanthus focus on the fitness of strains by
measuring spore production (e.g., work of the Velicer lab). Here, the authors do not measure any
componenets of fitness (ie spore production). Do the authors expect that the phenotypic
differences shown here correspond to any differences in spore production? If not, what is the
importance of these results?
Overall, I think that this study was performed and presented well, and that there may be some
interesting results. However, as it is currently written, interpreting what is interesting about the
results is not clear. I believe that this could be published in Royal Society Open Science, but first I
recommend that the authors revise the manuscript for resubmission focusing more on framing
the study to make it more clear (1) why the particular mutants were used for the experiment, (2)
the expectations/hypotheses for the experiment (3) the importance/significance of M. xanthus
fruiting body morphology, and (4) some explanatation of the broader relevance of this paper.

Plastic multicellular development of Myxococcus xanthus: genotype-environment interactions in
a physical gradient
Summary:
The work carried out by Rivera-Yoshida et al. points to a fascinating question in evolutionary
developmental biology: how different physical environments may affect cellular aggregation in
the formation of multicellular structures, and whether the phenotypic variation of these
structures that is caused by the changing environment have a similar magnitude and trajectory
when different genotypic backgrounds are compared.
To address this question, the authors used the soil bacterium M. xanthus. They established and
defined the changes in the environment by varying the agar concentration in the media on which
the cells were plated to form starvation-induced multicellular fruiting bodies. That different
substrates can influence fruiting body development was already known (e.g. (Escalante AE, et al.
2012, PLoS One), but Rivera-Yoshida et al. expand on previous work to study morphology in M.
xanthus and designed an experiment that analyses environmental differences with a more
rigorous and quantitative approach. The central result that both genotype and physical substrate
(and their interaction) contribute to variation in both individual fruiting-body and broader
population-level developmental phenotypes is clearly demonstrated. We were pleased to review
this paper and hope that the authors find our comments helpful.
Major points:
The variation in genotypes is examined with one control strain DZF1 and four different mutants
of DZF1 that are defective in the same signaling pathway known to affect fruiting body
development. However, the mutants’ biology is never discussed, particularly in light of how each
mutation alters phenotypic plasticity. The paper therefore misses the opportunity to speculate
regarding possible behavioral mechanisms underlying variable plasticity. If the authors consider
such speculation to be insufficiently informed by what is known about the mutants, this could be
explicitly noted.
The authors note that the paper’s main result is partially expected from previous theoretical
studies as well as from other papers that weren’t specifically addressing the same question. For
4
example, differences in agar concentration are known to influence swarming rate differently
across genotypic backgrounds. Since swarming ability is fundamental for proper fruiting body
development, it is of interest for the authors to address whether the mutants show differences in
motility and whether such variability in might contribute to the observed plasticity . As briefly
mentioned previously, the primary strength of the work is the approach they use to study
morphological properties and their variations in different experimental conditions. Although
these methods have been introduced long ago to implement the study of phenotypes (e.g.
reaction norms, morphospaces), they still have been poorly used and applied on bacterial
developmental and morphological properties.
In general, we support the publication of the scientific content that the reviewed paper contains.
However, we would strongly suggest the authors to address all the major points, if not all the
points we have listed, before publication.
We were glad to be able to review the paper from Rivera-Yoshida et al. and hope that our
contribution with this revision will help the publishing processes.
Major points:
On the images processing and quantification:
For the following image reported in Fig 2a:
– 0.5% seems to have more fruiting bodies that are not included in the
image’s frame. Are those fruiting bodies all included in the analysis or are they cropped out? Are
these the fruiting bodies outside the initial spot?
For the following images reported in Fig 2a:
– from 1.0% to 2.5%
– 2.0% and 2.5%
– from 1.0% to 2.5%
All these grey-scale images show white regions mostly evident on the larger fruiting bodies,
especially the larger ones, which. These white spots seem tomay be caused by the light reflection
from the illumination system. The presence of these spots could have a strongly bias on the
quantification of geometrical parameters (e.g. area, circularity) that could in turn affect the
following multivariate analyseis as well. To control for the data accuracy, weI would suggest the
authors to show area quantifications that were done using the automated system and manual
quantification of a subset of fruiting bodies that show such white features. In case of significant
discrepancyordancy, the images should be taken again with an illumination system that comes
from below the plate and provides a homogeneous light throughout the entire sample.
Line 75 - Strains that are used in the manuscript – Throughout the entire manuscript, there is not
a single reference to the physiological differences of that the selected mutants strains have if
comparedrelative to the reference DZF1 parental strain. WeI strongly suggest that the authors
describe to make clear what are the mutants they selected and why they were selected them.
Nayar VT. and Inouye S. have shown strong effects of these mutants on fruiting body
development and sporulation compared to the reference strain DZF1. Given such associations, a
better contextualization of the mutants and their biological relevance to the paper is
desiredneeded.
Line 86 – Here the authors refer to a FB as “fully developed” when it completes the process of
darkening. Are there any known quantifiable correlates to darkening (e.g. spore counts, size) or
precedents of this definition that could be cited? If this definition is unique to this manuscript,
5
this could be noted.This definition needs to be followed by a reference or a better explanation of
what a fully developed FB is (spore counts? Size?). However, in case the authors are only
presenting their definition of what a fully developed FB is (which is totally legit), I would suggest
to be more direct and clear.
Line 96 – (FB out) it is hard to understand how the quantification was done here given the
difficulties ofto tracking the spot margin after 96h. Was the spot margin quantified right after the
culture dried at 0 h? How? The spot size can be very different after 96h on TPM plates.
Line 97 - (Maturation) see comment for Line 86. AlsoMoreover, in table S1, “Maturation” is
defined as a binary population trait (0 and 1). Therefore, I wWould one expect to see
“Maturation” and “Scars” to show symmetric but opposite patterns to one another, as seems to
be the case for only DZF1? If not, why not? And the definition of “Scars” could be clearer -
(transparent, immature fruiting bodies?) - clear and not mature fruiting bodies(?) - to be
symmetrical to one another, which is true only for DZF1 (Fig S2).
Line 97 – (Dev. time) Given the explanation in table S1, “Dev. Time” and “Maturation” seem to
overlap. What distinguishes them is not clear from the definition that has been provided.
Line 128 –
verlap is as important as the one which would point tojust as significant as thean
Why the emphasis on the latter?. However, this aspect raises the question on the biological
meaning of such similarities/dissimilarities that could be discussed.
Line 130 – The location of the DZF1 ellipse is interesting and could be discussed more. The
relative position of DZF1 position seems to change drastically from 0.5% to any the other agar
concentrations. The position that the DZF1 ellipse occupies atin higher agar concentrations
doesn’t vary asso dramatically as the authors seem to suggestreported. However, it is striking
that a similar trend, yet almost symmetrical to the one o
the previous comment, the biological relevance of this trend could be addressedexpanded in the
discussion.
Line 148 – The authors mentions “sShape” but it is not clear to what parameter/s they are
referring to in Ffigure 3. If they are referring to “Circularity”, it would help tothey should be
consistent with the nomenclature present in the figure. Also, we suggest using ‘linear’ iIn the
same sentence, the author use the adjective ‘lineal’ instead of linear? If so, linear would be a more
appropriate term in this case. Thus, when the author use the adjective linear in the next sentence
when commenting on the trend of the trait “Area” the comparison will result to be clearer. for
consistency with the next sentence.
One very surprising result piece of data that I have found particularly surprising is the reported
relationship between number of fruiting bodies in the light of the variation of the “Area” and the
“area” parameter. trait. Interestingly, DZF1 shows an almost steady increasegrowth in the
number of FBs asif agar concentration increases. Yet, especially when compared to the mutant
strains, the area is not increasing nor decreasing without any corresponding change in the
average area of individual FBs. This observation seemsis quite unexpected. Given the same
number of cells (cell density is kept consistent in all experimental conditions), DZF1 forms up to
1000 FBs and yet averagethe FB area is barely decreased if not at all. Moreover, the measurement
“Distance” parameter is also behaving unexpectedly. One expects that anWith an increase in FBs
number and anwith relatively constant “Area”Area should cause that doesn’t show differences,
the variable “Distance” variable to should decrease - or at least not increase at all -– yet this does
not appear to be the case as the current plot doesn’t show (for DZF1). We think In case these
6
quantifications will should be rechecked be confirmed by the authors. If they are confirmed as
accurate,, they should be discussed with possible explanations due to their surprising character,
as they developed further within the paper discussion. In fact, such observations canmay be of
interest to the study of the development of multicellular structures in a changing environments.
Additional points:
Line 36-38 - The reference from Sultas S. 2015 (ref #1 in the paper), could go at the end of the
sentence given its relevance to all expressed concepts. I wouldWe suggest to adding more
experimental paper references to the first part of the introduction (e.g. Monteiro et al 2013,
Matsumoto et al 2013, Mayakawa et al 2010, Gilbert SF 2016) and not limit the material references
source almost to reviews only.
Here few suggestions: - Monteiro et al 2013, Matsumoto et al 2013, Mayakawa et al 2010, Gilbert
SF 2016,
Line 44 – I would stronglyWe suggest recommend the authors to cite West-Eberhard MJ’s book
“Developmental Plasticity and Evolution. 2005” since this book (and other publications from the
same author during the same years) brought to debate and research more extensively the concept
the authors express in this paragraph.
Line 46 – the authors write “The origin of multicellularity is a major evolutionary transition.” I
would be more specific adding that it is a “[…] major evolutionary transition in organismal
development”.
Line 52 – “Importantly, physical processes and mechanical forces associated…”. I would suggest
toPlease rephrase this sentence. Right now, it is not clear whyto clarify what distinction between
mechanical forces are distinguished and not consideredand physical processes is intended (or are
they?).
Line 93 – The authors refer to ImageJ v2.0.0 in the text butand cite FIJI (ref.# 16 in the
manuscript).
Line 108 – It seems would find more appropriate to refer to Sup. Table 2 and notrather than Sup.
Table 1. Scree plots and a plot showing the contribution per dimensions would greatly help the
reader in accessing the information present in Sup. Table 2.
Line 113 – Do all the measured traits have a symmetric distribution around the mean? If some are
skewed, it maywould be better to use medians instead.
Figures - Color codes in figures could be chosen to be more “color-blind friendly”. Specifically,
Fig. 2b and Fig. 2c are very hard to navigate if the reader is affected by deuteranopia (same for
Sup Fig 1). The authors may find useful the software Color Oracle (colororacle.org) to help testing
the images for color- blind readers. In addition, since the author are using ggplot2 package in R to
generate images, they can make use of the colorblind_pal() function:

Line 183 – It would be interesting to visualize such data in a representative panel (no
quantifications needed).

Plastic multicellular development of Myxococcus xanthus: genotype-environment interactions in
a physical gradient
Summary:
The work carried out by Rivera-Yoshida et al. points to a fascinating question in evolutionary
10
developmental biology: how different physical environments may affect cellular aggregation in
the formation of multicellular structures, and whether the phenotypic variation of these
structures that is caused by the changing environment have a similar magnitude and trajectory
when different genotypic backgrounds are compared.
To address this question, the authors used the soil bacterium M. xanthus. They established and
defined the changes in the environment by varying the agar concentration in the media on which
the cells were plated to form starvation-induced multicellular fruiting bodies. That different
substrates can influence fruiting body development was already known (e.g. (Escalante AE, et al.
2012, PLoS One), but Rivera-Yoshida et al. expand on previous work to study morphology in M.
xanthus and designed an experiment that analyses environmental differences with a more
rigorous and quantitative approach. The central result that both genotype and physical substrate
(and their interaction) contribute to variation in both individual fruiting-body and broader
population-level developmental phenotypes is clearly demonstrated. We were pleased to review
this paper and hope that the authors find our comments helpful.
Major points:
The variation in genotypes is examined with one control strain DZF1 and four different mutants
of DZF1 that are defective in the same signaling pathway known to affect fruiting body
development. However, the mutants’ biology is never discussed, particularly in light of how each
mutation alters phenotypic plasticity. The paper therefore misses the opportunity to speculate
regarding possible behavioral mechanisms underlying variable plasticity. If the authors consider
such speculation to be insufficiently informed by what is known about the mutants, this could be
explicitly noted.
The authors note that the paper’s main result is partially expected from previous theoretical
studies as well as from other papers that weren’t specifically addressing the same question. For
example, differences in agar concentration are known to influence swarming rate differently
across genotypic backgrounds. Since swarming ability is fundamental for proper fruiting body
development, it is of interest for the authors to address whether the mutants show differences in
motility and whether such variability in might contribute to the observed plasticity . As briefly
mentioned previously, the primary strength of the work is the approach they use to study
morphological properties and their variations in different experimental conditions. Although
these methods have been introduced long ago to implement the study of phenotypes (e.g.
reaction norms, morphospaces), they still have been poorly used and applied on bacterial
developmental and morphological properties.
In general, we support the publication of the scientific content that the reviewed paper contains.
However, we would strongly suggest the authors to address all the major points, if not all the
points we have listed, before publication.
We were glad to be able to review the paper from Rivera-Yoshida et al. and hope that our
contribution with this revision will help the publishing processes.
Major points:
On the images processing and quantification:
For the following image reported in Fig 2a:
– 0.5% seems to have more fruiting bodies that are not included in the

Why the emphasis on the latter?. However, this aspect raises the question on the biological
meaning of such similarities/dissimilarities that could be discussed.

Line 130 – The location of the DZF1 ellipse is interesting and could be discussed more. The
relative position of DZF1 position seems to change drastically from 0.5% to any the other agar

number of FBs asif agar concentration increases. Yet, especially when compared to the mutant
strains, the area is not increasing nor decreasing without any corresponding change in the
average area of individual FBs. This observation seemsis quite unexpected. Given the same
number of cells (cell density is kept consistent in all experimental conditions), DZF1 forms up to
1000 FBs and yet averagethe FB area is barely decreased if not at all. Moreover, the measurement
“Distance” parameter is also behaving unexpectedly. One expects that anWith an increase in FBs
number and anwith relatively constant “Area”Area should cause that doesn’t show differences,
the variable “Distance” variable to should decrease - or at least not increase at all -– yet this does
not appear to be the case as the current plot doesn’t show (for DZF1). We think In case these
quantifications will should be rechecked be confirmed by the authors. If they are confirmed as
accurate,, they should be discussed with possible explanations due to their surprising character,
as they developed further within the paper discussion. In fact, such observations canmay be of

lastic multicellular development of Myxococcus xanthus: genotype-environment
teractions in a physical gradient
his manuscript focuses on how abiotic conditions affect the multicellular development
henotypes of the social bacteria M. xanthus. Moreover, the authors test how development
cross the range of agar stiffnesses vary across genotypes, and statistically test for
teractions between the abiotic and genetic treatments in a multitude of fruiting body
orphologies. In general, the manuscript was easy to follow and clearly presented. The
gures do a good job of showing the results of the experiment. It seems that the
xperimental procedures and the statistical analyses were done correctly. However, I
utline some broad concerns below.
. What are these M. xanthus mutants? There needs to be a more full explanation of why
hese mutants in particular were tested, and if there were any expectations with regard to
he specific mutations and development across the abiotic gradient.
his is indeed an important issue. DZF1 is one of the Myxococcus xanthus standard
boratory strains. <U+0394>mkapC, <U+0394>mkapA/<U+0394>mkapC, <U+0394>mkapA, <U+0394>pktC2/<U+0394>pktD1 are DZF1
erived in-frame deletion mutants of the network of PSTKs and the associated scaffold
roteins Mkaps, which participate during the development of FBs (Arias Del Angel et al.,
017, 2018). An interesting feature of these mutants is that they do not arrest development
nd thus allow phenotypic changes to be tracked at the multicellular scale. Previous
tudies suggest that deletion of the pktC2, pktD1 and other components of this network
pktA2, pktD9) impact development and fruiting body formation (Escalante et al., 2015;
ariya & Inouye, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006). MkapA and MkapC are scaffold proteins in this
etwork, but there are not previous reports regarding the phenotypic consequences of
heir deletion.
his information has now been included in the description of the biological material in the
ethods section.
. The authors also do not offer clear explanations or interpretations for the observed
atterns. For example, is there any explanation for why the genotypes become less
lustered on more soft agar? Similarly, any reason why you would expect agar stiffness to
ot have a major effect within a given genotype?
hank you for your insightful questions.
order to further understand why genotypes behave differently on different substrates, we
ssessed the colony growth rate on nutrient-rich substrates by measuring the diameter of
he colony in different time points (but please note that FBs do not develop in the presence
f nutrients). We considered this rate as a proxy to motility and observed a much lower
otility rate on 0.5% compared to the rest of the agar concentrations. However, our
bservations at the single-cell level suggest that motility is not arrested in low agar
oncentrations. This behaviour on soft agar is in line with previous reports (Shi & Zusman,
992).
verall, when we track the colony growth in nutrient-rich substrate we observe that the
trains slightly differentiate and that, as development proceeds, strains form two groups
DZF1 and <U+0394>mkapA form one group and the rest of the strains another one). However, we
ound that in such nutrient-rich substrates, it is the agar concentration that mostly drives
he colony expansion rates (see new Figure 4 in the main text). Since the growth rate of
he colony in nutrient-rich substrates somehow reflects the individual or collective motility
the specific strains, we could speculate that the motility in the developmental process
ccurring in nutrient-poor substrates is mainly affected by the agar concentration.
evertheless, the multicellular phenotypes at the FB and population scales are certainly
xplained by a significant contribution the agar concentration, but also of by the genotype
nd the genotype-substrate interaction (Table 1 and Figure 4(c) in the main text).
inally, it is important to note that specific environmental conditions have trait- and scale-
pecific effects. For instance, the substrate seems to play a much stronger role in certain
anges of agar concentration and for particular traits. We report a strain-independent ring
ormation at the edge of the colony at 0.5%. This could be explained by a higher cellular
ensity at the edge of the drop forming when it dries at time 0 h, as in the coffee-ring
ormation physical phenomenon (Andac et al., 2019). It is possible that at this agar
oncentration, cells cannot glide inwards easily, developing a ring of FBs at the edge,
here there is a higher cellular density, and leaving immature aggregates at the center of
he drop. This hypothesis, and the precise mechanisms behind different phenotypes
emain to be tested.
he genetic identity of the strains and the results regarding their motility have now been
cluded in the Methods section, as a new figure (Figure 4), a new table (Table 2) and as
hole new paragraph at the end of the Results section and in the Discussion.
egarding your second question, the relative location of the DZF1 with respect to other
enotypes is very interesting and has led us to speculate about the potential canalization
r domestication of the strain. Indeed, other work has suggested that standard laboratory
trains exhibit canalization (low plasticity) in important traits (Palková, 2004). This could be
he case for DZF1, but at this point we have too little evidence to even suggest it. It would
e necessary to compare it with wild strains -not mutants derived from the same strain- in
rder to further test this idea. In the current version we prefer to just say that “...plasticity is
ften studied in lab-adapted strains, and at least in this work, the parental lab-strain is not
epresentative of the plastic responses for the rest of the genotypes (figures 1 and 2).”
. Is there any information or broader significance to the fruiting body traits that you
easured? Many population level studies of Myxococcus xanthus focus on the fitness of
trains by measuring spore production (e.g., work of the Velicer lab). Here, the authors do
ot measure any components of fitness (i.e. spore production). Do the authors expect that
he phenotypic differences shown here correspond to any differences in spore production?
not, what is the importance of these results?
hank you for your insightful comment. In this study we focus on the potential for
orphologic phenotypic changes, but we do observe changes ranging from modest to
ramatic upon which selection may subsequently act. These include changes in
evelopment time, spore maturation and, more indirectly, FB size and number. Moreover,
has been reported that mutants of the same regulatory network exhibit statistically
ignificant phenotypic differences when comparing mutants with parental strain (DZF1),
cluding differences in spore count and viability (Escalante et al., 2012). This suggests
hat the joint effect of the physical environmental and the genetic background on
orphologic and developmental traits may also be of evolutionary relevance. We now
ention this in the Discussion section.
. Overall, I think that this study was performed and presented well, and that there may be
ome interesting results. However, as it is currently written, interpreting what is interesting
bout the results is not clear. I believe that this could be published in Royal Society Open
cience, but first I recommend that the authors revise the manuscript for resubmission
ocusing more on framing the study to make it more clear (1) why the particular mutants
ere used for the experiment, (2) the expectations/hypotheses for the experiment (3) the
mportance/significance of M. xanthus fruiting body morphology, and (4) some explanation
f the broader relevance of this paper.
hank you very much for your positive feedback. We have addressed all of these issues in
he (1) methods section, (2) introduction (next-to-last paragraph), (3) discussion (first
aragraph), and (4) along the revised text.
eviewer: 2
he work carried out by Rivera-Yoshida et al. points to a fascinating question in
volutionary developmental biology: how different physical environments may affect
ellular aggregation in the formation of multicellular structures, and whether the phenotypic
ariation of these structures that is caused by the changing environment have a similar
agnitude and trajectory when different genotypic backgrounds are compared.
o address this question, the authors used the soil bacterium M. xanthus. They
stablished and defined the changes in the environment by varying the agar concentration
the media on which the cells were plated to form starvation-induced multicellular fruiting
odies. That different substrates can influence fruiting body development was already
nown (e.g. (Escalante AE, et al. 2012, PLoS One), but Rivera-Yoshida et al. expand on
revious work to study morphology in M. xanthus and designed an experiment that
nalyses environmental differences with a more rigorous and quantitative approach. The
entral result that both genotype and physical substrate (and their interaction) contribute to
ariation in both individual fruiting-body and broader population-level developmental
henotypes is clearly demonstrated. We were pleased to review this paper and hope that
he authors find our comments helpful.
ajor points:
. The variation in genotypes is examined with one control strain DZF1 and four different
utants of DZF1 that are defective in the same signaling pathway known to affect fruiting
ody development. However, the mutants’ biology is never discussed, particularly in light
f how each mutation alters phenotypic plasticity. The paper therefore misses the
pportunity to speculate regarding possible behavioral mechanisms underlying variable
lasticity. If the authors consider such speculation to be insufficiently informed by what is
nown about the mutants, this could be explicitly noted.
hank you for this important observation. This is indeed an important issue. DZF1 is one of
he Myxococcus xanthus standard laboratory strains. <U+0394>mkapC, <U+0394>mkapA/<U+0394>mkapC,
mkapA, <U+0394>pktC2/<U+0394>pktD1 are DZF1 derived in-frame deletion mutants of the network of
STKs and the associated scaffold proteins Mkaps, which participate during the
evelopment of FBs (Arias Del Angel et al., 2017, 2018). An interesting feature of these
utants is that they do not arrest development and thus allow to track phenotypic changes
t the multicellular scale. Previous studies suggest that deletion of the pktC2, pktD1 and
ther components of this network (pktA2, pktD9) impact development and fruiting body
ormation (Escalante et al., 2015; Nariya & Inouye, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006). MkapA and
kapC are scaffold proteins in this network, but there are not previous reports regarding
he phenotypic consequences of their deletion.
his information has now been included in the description of the biological material in the
ethods section.
. The authors note that the paper’s main result is partially expected from previous
heoretical studies as well as from other papers that weren’t specifically addressing the
ame question. For example, differences in agar concentration are known to influence
warming rate differently across genotypic backgrounds. Since swarming ability is
undamental for proper fruiting body development, it is of interest for the authors to
ddress whether the mutants show differences in motility and whether such variability in
ight contribute to the observed plasticity . As briefly mentioned previously, the primary
trength of the work is the approach they use to study morphological properties and their
ariations in different experimental conditions. Although these methods have been
troduced long ago to implement the study of phenotypes (e.g. reaction norms,
orphospaces), they still have been poorly used and applied on bacterial developmental
nd morphological properties.
his is a very interesting point. In order to address this question, we assessed the colony
rowth rate on nutrient-rich substrates by measuring the diameter of the colony in different
me points (but please note that FBs do not develop in the presence of nutrients). We
bserved a much lower motility on 0.5% compared to the rest of the agar concentrations.
his is in line with previous reports (Shi & Zusman, 1992).
verall, when we track the colony growth in nutrient-rich substrate we observe that the
trains slightly differentiate according to their expansion rate. As development proceeds,
trains form two groups (DZF1 and <U+0394>mkapA form one group and the rest of the strains
nother one). However, we found that in such nutrient-rich substrates, it is the agar
oncentration that mostly drives the colony expansion rates (see new Figure 4 in the main
ext). Since the expansion rate of the colony in nutrient-rich substrates somehow reflects
he individual or collective motility in the specific strains, we could speculate that the
otility in the developmental process occurring in nutrient-poor substrates is mainly
ffected by the agar concentration. Nevertheless, the multicellular phenotypes at the FB
nd population scales are certainly explained by a significant contribution the agar
oncentration, but also of by the genotype and the genotype-substrate interaction (Table 1
nd Figure 4 in the main text).
inally, it is important to note that specific environmental conditions have trait- and scale-
pecific effects. For instance, the substrate seems to play a much stronger role in certain
anges of agar concentration and for particular traits. We report a strain-independent ring
ormation at the edge of the colony at 0.5%. This could be explained by a higher cellular
ensity at the edge of the drop forming when it dries at time 0 h, as in the coffee-ring
ormation physical phenomenon (Andac et al., 2019). It is possible that at this agar
oncentration, cells cannot glide inwards easily, developing a ring of FBs at the edge,
here there is a higher cellular density, and leaving immature aggregates at the center of
he drop. This hypothesis, and the precise mechanisms behind different phenotypes
emain to be tested.
he identity of the strains and these results have now been included in the Methods
ection, as a new figure (Figure 4) and as whole new paragraph at the end of the Results
ection and in the Discussion.
general, we support the publication of the scientific content that the reviewed paper
ontains. However, we would strongly suggest the authors to address all the major points,
not all the points we have listed, before publication. We were glad to be able to review
he paper from Rivera-Yoshida et al. and hope that our contribution with this revision will
elp the publishing processes.
e truly appreciate your insightful and thorough review, which has certainly helped the
ublishing and research process.
ajor points:
n the images processing and quantification:
. For the following image reported in Fig 2a:
ZF1 and mkapC – 0.5% seems to have more fruiting bodies that are not included in the
mage’s frame. Are those fruiting bodies all included in the analysis or are they cropped
ut? Are these the fruiting bodies outside the initial spot?
s you noticed, DZF1 and <U+0394>mkapC - 0.5% do show bacterial activity outside the drop.
owever, fruiting bodies (seen as dark spots) are formed just in the case of DZF1. We do
ot know the reason why this phenomenon occurs, but it has been observed in all of our
eplica. These fruiting bodies are formed during development from cells migrating from
ithin the drop, and are not an artefact of spilled bacteria outside the drop at the initial
me. In order to analyze the images systematically, we cropped the fruiting bodies placed
utside the drop, but recorded their presence under the variable “FB out”, which was
onsidered as a categorical variable in the FAMD analysis. This feature was also
onsidered in the supplementary reaction norms. This has now been clarified in the
ethods section.
. For the following images reported in Fig 2a:
kapC – from 1.0% to 2.5%
kapA/C – 2.0% and 2.5%
ktC2/D1 – from 1.0% to 2.5%
ll these grey-scale images show white regions mostly evident on the larger fruiting
odies, especially the larger ones, which. These white spots seem to be caused by the
ght reflection from the illumination system. The presence of these spots could have a
trongly bias on the quantification of geometrical parameters (e.g. area, circularity) that
ould in turn affect the following multivariate analysis as well. To control for the data
ccuracy, we would suggest the authors to show area quantifications that were done using
he automated system and manual quantification of a subset of fruiting bodies that show
uch white features. In case of significant discrepancy ordancy, the images should be
aken again with an illumination system that comes from below the plate and provides a
omogeneous light throughout the entire sample.
ndeed, images were taken with an illumination system in which light comes from below.
e adapted this system to minimize light reflection. However, in the cases you mention, a
hite dot still appears in the top of the fruiting bodies. We do not know if this is a
onsequence of our setup or a biological property of those FBs. To avoid bias on the
uantification we considered these fruiting bodies as fully darkened in the binarized
mages (see example below).
riginal picture Binarized image Binarized corrected image
. Line 75 - Strains that are used in the manuscript – Throughout the entire manuscript,
here is not a single reference to the physiological differences of that the selected mutants
trains have if compared relative to the reference DZF1 parental strain. We strongly
uggest that the authors describe to make clear what are the mutants they selected and
hy they were selected them. Nayar VT. and Inouye S. have shown strong effects of these
utants on fruiting body development and sporulation compared to the reference strain
ZF1. Given such associations, a better contextualization of the mutants and their
iological relevance to the paper is desired needed.
his is indeed an important issue. Please see our response to your points 1 and 2.
his information has now been included in the description of the biological material in the
ethods section.
lso, In this study we focus on the potential for morphologic phenotypic changes to occur,
ut we do observe changes ranging from modest to dramatic upon which selection may
ubsequently act. These include changes in development time, spore maturation and,
ore indirectly, FB size and number. Moreover, it has been reported that mutants of the
ame regulatory network exhibit statistically significant phenotypic differences when
omparing mutants with parental strain (DZF1), including differences in spore count and
iability (Escalante et al., 2012). This suggests that the joint effect of the physical
nvironmental and the genetic background on morphologic and developmental traits may
lso be of evolutionary relevance. We now mention this in the Discussion section.
. Line 86 – Here the authors refer to a FB as “fully developed” when it completes the
rocess of darkening. Are there any known quantifiable correlates to darkening (e.g. spore
ounts, size) or precedents of this definition that could be cited? If this definition is unique
this manuscript, this could be noted.This definition needs to be followed by a reference
r a better explanation of what a fully developed FB is (spore counts? Size?). However, in
ase the authors are only presenting their definition of what a fully developed FB is (which
totally legit), I would suggest to be more direct and clear.
uring FB development, some cells differentiate into spores while vegetative ones
ontinue moving toward immature aggregates. Conventionally, full development and
arkening of these aggregates is considered to occur at 72-96 h, when FBs attain a stable
hape, size and darkness (e.g. Escalante et al., 2012 and O’Connor & Zusman, 1991). We
id not consider the spore count and are not aware of how it precisely relates to darkness.
his association is conventionally accepted in the work we have revised, and we clarify
his definition based on phenotype and include the two references where full development
considered at complete darkening at 72-96 h (Escalante et al., 2012 and O’Connor &
usman, 1991).
. Line 96 – (FB out) it is hard to understand how the quantification was done here given
he difficulties of tracking the spot margin after 96h. Was the spot margin quantified right
fter the culture dried at 0 h? How? The spot size can be very different after 96h on TPM
lates.
he drop is seen as a flat drop without any roughness at time 0 h, right after the culture
ries. We visually established the edge and measured the drop diameter at this time using
IJI (ImageJ). From this moment, cells begin to move and develop FB, but the spot
iameter does not change (see example below). Only FBs within this diameter were
onsidered for the FB count. “FB out” is a categorical variable with value equal to 1 if
atured FBs are observed outside the drop. We have briefly clarified this in the Methods
ection.
kapAC 0.5% . 0 h (5184x3456 pixels) mkapAC 0.5% . 96 h (5184x3456 pixels)
rop diameter = 6795.80 µm Drop diameter = 6732.57 µm
. Line 97 - (Maturation) see comment for Line 86. Moreover, in table S1, “Maturation” is
efined as a binary population trait (0 and 1). Therefore, I would one expect to see
Maturation” and “Scars” to show symmetric but opposite patterns to one another, as
eems to be the case for only DZF1? If not, why not? And the definition of “Scars” could
e clearer -(transparent, immature fruiting bodies?) - clear and not mature fruiting
odies(?) - to be symmetrical to one another, which is true only for DZF1 (Fig S2).
hank you. We have now noticed that not all the meanings of the phenotypic traits were
learly explained, but have corrected this in our revision. The “Maturation” variable with
alue equal to one refers to complete darkening of clearly defined aggregates, while
Scars” equal to one refers to those drops presenting marks or vestiges of undefined
ggregates (see illustrative close up below). These variables do not necessary correlate,
s maturation seems to be more related with agar concentration, conversely to scars
ormation, which seems to be associated with the genotype. <U+0394>pktC2/<U+0394>pktD1 - 1.0% is an
xample of Maturation=0, Scars=0, while <U+0394>mkapA/<U+0394>mkapC illustrates the case of
aturation=1, Scars=1. To clarify this, we have now modified these definitions in the
ethods section and added panels in Figure 1.
cars = 1 Scars = 0
. Line 97 – (Dev. time) Given the explanation in table S1, “Dev. Time” and “Maturation”
eem to overlap. What distinguishes them is not clear from the definition that has been
rovided.
icrographs were taken at 96 h when FBs have fully developed (completely matured) in
ost cases. However, some aggregates do not present complete darkening at 96 h (e.g.
mkapC2/<U+0394>mkapD1 at 0.5 %), which we indicate with the “Maturation” variable. On the
ther hand, even in the cases where complete maturation occurred, developmental time
iffers among genotypes and agar concentrations. For example, in general, development
eems to occur slower at 0.5% than another agar concentration. The quantification of
hese differences in development time is expressed in the variable “Dev Time”, in which
alues go from 1 (fast development) to 5 (slow development). Below, we compare
evelopment of <U+0394>mkapA for two moments, 36 h and 96 h. By 96 h both have reached
omplete development, but development of <U+0394>mkapA 1.0% is faster than <U+0394>mkapA 2.5%, as
ggregates are already mature at 36 h. We have now clarified these definitions in the
ethods section.
36 h 96 h
mkapA 1.0%
mkapA 2.5%
0. Line 128 – Given the molecular background, isn’t the overlap of observation that
kapC and mkapA/C overlap is as important as the one which would point to just as
ignificant as the absence of overlap between mkapA/C and mkapA in low agar
oncentration (0.5% to 1.5%)? Why the emphasis on the latter?. However, this aspect
aises the question on the biological meaning of such similarities/dissimilarities that could
e discussed.
hank you for highlighting this issue. It is indeed interesting that the double mutant
esembles one of the single mutants, but not the other. This shows that the double
utation does not have an additive effect, which is expected from the complexity of the
etwork in which these proteins are involved (Arias Del Angel, et al. 2018). At this point we
annot propose any precise mechanism behind these non-additive phenotypes, beyond
tating that our results demonstrate the complex control of M. xanthus development. In the
eviewed version we now mention this non-additivity and contrast the similarity with the
mkapC mutant against the dissimilarity with the <U+0394>mkapA mutant (first paragraph in the
esults section).
1. Line 130 – The location of the DZF1 ellipse is interesting and could be discussed
ore. The relative position of DZF1 seems to change drastically from 0.5% to any the
ther agar concentrations. The position that the DZF1 ellipse occupies at higher agar
oncentrations doesn’t vary asso dramatically as the authors seem to suggest reported.
owever, it is striking that a similar trend, yet almost symmetrical to the one of DZF1, is
hown by pktC2/D1. As for the previous comment, the biological relevance of this trend
ould be addressed expanded in the discussion.
es, the relative location of the DZF1 with respect to other genotypes is very interesting
nd has led us to speculate about the potential canalization or domestication of the strain.
ndeed, other work has suggested that standard laboratory strains exhibit canalization (low
lasticity) in important traits (Palková, 2004). This could be the case for DZF1, but at this
oint we have too little evidence to even suggest it. It would be necessary to compare it
ith wild strains -not mutants derived from the same strain- in order to further test this
ea. In the current version we prefer to just say that “...plasticity is often studied in lab-
dapted strains, and at least in this work, the parental lab-strain is not representative of the
lastic responses for the rest of the genotypes (figures 1 and 2).”
egarding the position of the DZF1 ellipse in the 0.5 %, it does seem that this agar %
ffects the phenotypes so strongly that it surpasses the genotype arrangements
aintained in all other agar %. We describe this in the results and also mention that, apart
om 0.5 %, DZF1 relative location remains almost constant (first paragraph in the results
ection). As for the location of the pktC2/D1 ellipse, it is very difficult to advance a potential
xplanation at this point, so we have decided not to comment it further in the main text.
2. Line 148 – The authors mentions “Shape” but it is not clear to what parameter/s they
re referring to in Figure 3. If they are referring to “Circularity”, it would help to they should
e consistent with the nomenclature present in the figure. Also, we suggest using ‘linear’ in
he same sentence, the author use the adjective ‘lineal’ instead of linear? If so, linear
ould be a more appropriate term in this case. Thus, when the author use the adjective
near in the next sentence when commenting on the trend of the trait “Area” the
omparison will result to be clearer. for consistency with the next sentence.
hank you for the observations. Indeed, we were referring to “Circularity” instead of
Shape” and we also meant to say “linear”. We have corrected these mistakes.
3. One very surprising result piece of data that I have found particularly surprising is the
eported relationship between number of fruiting bodies in the light of the variation of the
Area” and the “area” parameter. trait. Interestingly, DZF1 shows an almost steady
crease growth in the number of FBs as agar concentration increases. Yet, especially
hen compared to the mutant strains, the area is not increasing nor decreasing without
ny corresponding change in the average area of individual FBs. This observation seems
uite unexpected. Given the same number of cells (cell density is kept consistent in all
xperimental conditions), DZF1 forms up to 1000 FBs and yet average the FB area is
arely decreased if not at all. Moreover, the measurement “Distance” parameter is also
ehaving unexpectedly. One expects that With an increase in FBs number and an with
elatively constant “Area” should cause that doesn’t show differences, the variable
Distance” variable to should decrease - or at least not increase at all -– yet this does not
ppear to be the case as the current plot doesn’t show (for DZF1). We think In case these
uantifications will should be rechecked be confirmed by the authors. If they are
onfirmed as accurate, they should be discussed with possible explanations due to their
urprising character, as they developed further within the paper discussion. In fact, such
bservations may be of interest to the study of the development of multicellular structures
a changing environments.
hank you for this observation. We were also puzzled by this result. We have revised all
he calculations and graphs and the results hold. The distance is calculated as the average
uclidean distance among all the fruiting bodies in the population. Our explanation for this
urprising behaviour of the variable “Distance” is that the FBs are not evenly distributed on
he surface. Overall, they sometimes form clusters, rings or worm-like structures, which
an affect the behaviour of the “Distance” variable. In the specific case you note, DZF1 at
.5 % tend to accumulate FBs in the edge (ring), probably augmenting the distance
ecause the FBs in the ring increase the distance to those in the colony slightly more than
hey decrease the distance to other FBs in the ring. Indeed, the median in the DZF1
Distance” variable ranges from 2.75 to 3.0, while the number of FBs almost triples. We
hink that given the heterogeneous location of FBs, the “Distance” variable might exhibit
light but significant changes in unexpected directions, especially in the extreme substrate
onditions, and we now mention this in the Methods section (subsection measurement of
henotypic traits).
dditional points:
4. Line 36-38 - The reference from Sultas S. 2015 (ref #1 in the paper), could go at the
nd of the sentence given its relevance to all expressed concepts. We suggest to adding
ore experimental paper references to the first part of the introduction (e.g. Monteiro et al
013, Matsumoto et al 2013, Mayakawa et al 2010, Gilbert SF 2016) and not limit the
aterial references source almost to reviews only.
ere few suggestions: - Monteiro et al 2013, Matsumoto et al 2013, Mayakawa et al 2010,
ilbert SF 2016,
hank you for the references. They are indeed of major importance and we have included
riginal sources.
5. Line 44 – I would strongly recommend the authors to cite West-Eberhard MJ’s book
Developmental Plasticity and Evolution. 2005” since this book (and other publications
om the same author during the same years) brought to debate and research more
xtensively the concept the authors express in this paragraph.
hank you for the suggestion. We have included it in the main text.
6. Line 46 – the authors write “The origin of multicellularity is a major evolutionary
ansition.” I would be more specific adding that it is a “[…] major evolutionary transition in
rganismal development”.
K, we have changed the sentence according to your suggestion.
7. Line 52 – “Importantly, physical processes and mechanical forces associated…”. I
ould suggest to rephrase this sentence. Right now, it is not clear why to clarify what
istinction between mechanical forces are distinguished and not considered and physical
rocesses is intended (or are they?).
hank you. We have rephrased the sentence using only “physical processes”.
8. Line 93 – The authors refer to ImageJ v2.0.0 in the text butand cite FIJI (ref.# 16 in the
anuscript).
IJI (Fiji Is Just ImageJ) is a distribution of ImageJ including some specific plugins. We left
oth names for a better reference.
9. Line 108 – It seems would find more appropriate to refer to Sup. Table 2 and not rather
han Sup. Table 1. Scree plots and a plot showing the contribution per dimensions would
reatly help the reader in accessing the information present in Sup. Table 2.
hank you for the observation. We have now corrected this mistake and included the
uggested graphic summary.
0. Line 113 – Do all the measured traits have a symmetric distribution around the mean?
some are skewed, it may would be better to use medians instead.
hank you for the suggestion. We have now used the medians and the results stayed the
ame. We updated the figure and associated tables considering the median instead of the
ean.
1. Figures - Color codes in figures could be chosen to be more “color-blind friendly”.
pecifically, Fig. 2b and Fig. 2c are very hard to navigate if the reader is affected by
euteranopia (same for Sup Fig 1). The authors may find useful the software Color Oracle
colororacle.org) to help testing the images for color- blind readers. In addition, 20. since
he author are using ggplot2 package in R to generate images, they can make use of the
olorblind_pal() function: https://rdrr.io/cran/ggthemes/man/colorblind.html
hank you, we checked the colors we used in the first version and changed those which
epresented as difficulties for color-blind readers.
2. Line 183 – It would be interesting to visualize such data in a representative panel (no
uantifications needed).
es, we have now included this figure in the Supplementary material (no dark points
orresponding to mature FBs are observed).
3. Fig 3 – We suggest reporting in this case, an inferential error (e.g. standard error or CI)
hould be preferred to rather than the standard deviation error (descriptive error).
hank you for the suggestion. We have updated the figure using the standard error instead
he deviation error. The general observations from the results stayed the same. Overall,
hen we considered the median and the standard error (regarding point 20), the error bars
ere considerably shrank.
4. Fig S1 – Legend text explaining graph features, e.g. the meaning of colors, is missing.
hank you, we have explained graph features this in all figure legends.
5. Fig S2 – No explanation of missing error bars. exp.
hank you for the observation. We have completed the missing information.
6. Table S1 – “Circularity” should be noted as dimensionless.
hank you for noticing this error. We have corrected it.
