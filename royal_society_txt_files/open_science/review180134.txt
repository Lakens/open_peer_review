This research work is aimed to prepare ultra-high molecular weight of high branching poly-lactic
with glycerol by ring-opening polymerization and investigate the preparation of the high
branching Poly-lactic electrospun porous fibers. This is a very important work for biomaterials
development and the results are very encouraging. However, some questions still need to be
addressed as below:
1. In “2.2. Synthesis methods”, the author gives the react condition of the ROP polyerization. This
reaction should be carried out under the protection such as nitrogen and the sovent should be
anhydrous. Please add these in the manuscript.
2. In “3.3. Surface properties of high branching PLA”. the author gives “From the analysis of DSC,
the degree of intermolecular interlacing is greater. So the surface of the high branching PLA
materials was quite smooth”. Please explain this sentence in more detail.
3. In this article there is a different description of one pot, such as “in a tank”,” in a mechanical
churning tank” and “one pot”. These descriptions are chaotic, and can they be unified?
In addition, there are some obvious printing and formatting errors in manuscript, please revise
them carefully.

1. The paper shows the interesting results of highly branched PLA nanofibers . However, the
detail analysis and explanation for the results are not enough over an entire manuscript for
3
publication.
2. To support the conclusions, additional results need to be included, particularly for the porous
nanofibers and their characterization.
3. The highly branched nanofibers show a big deviation in fiber diameter. Why is it? It results in
poor electrospinning ability. In addition, how about the pores for very thin nanofibers of the
highly branched nanofibers? Also, the mechanism for pore forming of the nanofibers should be
explained in more reasonably, and compared to other nanofibers.
4. Table 2 shows the water contact angles of films, NOT nanofibers. How about the nanofibers?
There is no result for the nanofibers, in spite that this paper is focused on the nanofibers.
5. The images for the water contact angle results should be included to prove Table 2 results.
6. English of the paper should be improved.

The paper shows the improved mechanical properties of bioresorbable tubes by using the BAE
method. However more reasonable explanation for the key results is need for publication.
1. Figure 2b and c shows the change of slope in the stress-strain curves of PCL-5BAE. However
there is no explanation for it. Why is it? What is the mechanism for the sharp slope change?
2. The authors mentioned the honey comb structure from the SEM images. What is the
mechanism for it? The reasonable explanation should be added, NOT description of the
phenomenon.
3. Why was the 5 wt% PCL used for the study?

Appendix A
To Reviewer #1
1. In “2.2. Synthesis methods”, the author gives the react condition of
the ROP polymerization. This reaction should be carried out under the
protection such as nitrogen and the solvent should be anhydrous.
Please add these in the manuscript.
Thank you for your suggestion. We have made amendments in the
manuscript in 2.2 synthesis method. And described as“The reaction
was carried out under reflux in a mechanical churning tank under the
protection of nitrogen”.
2. In “3.3. Surface properties of high branching PLA”. the author gives
“From the analysis of DSC, the degree of intermolecular interlacing is
greater. So the surface of the high branching PLA materials was quite
smooth”. Please explain this sentence in more detail.
Thank you. “From the analysis of DSC, the degree of intermolecular
interlacing is greater.” This sentence is used to prove the possible
extension of the molecular arm with the result of DSC. I'm sorry; I think
it's because of a clerical error. We have made a revision in the
manuscript in 3.3 Surface proterties of high branching PLA. And
described as “From the analysis of DSC, the degree of intermolecular
interlacing is stronger. The surface of the high branching PLA materials
was quite smooth (figure 6c), which indicates that it has an obvious
influence on water contact angle”.
3. In this article there is a different description of one pot, such as “in a
tank”,” in a mechanical churning tank” and “one pot”. These
descriptions are chaotic, and can they be unified?In addition, there are
some obvious printing and formatting errors in manuscript, please
revise them carefully.
Thank you for your suggestion. We have made a revision in the
manuscript.

Comments to the Author(s)
1. The paper shows the interesting results of highly branched PLA
nanofibers . However, the detail analysis and explanation for the
results are not enough over an entire manuscript for publication.
Thank you for your suggestion, we revised some manuscript analysis
and added some experiments. Furthermore, we added the changes in
the morphology of three kinds of PLA electrospinning fibers in high
humidity environment and strong electric field, and discussed the
relationship between the PLA configuration and the phase separation
in forming the surface pores, and the hydrophilicity of the mats.
2. To support the conclusions, additional results need to be included,
particularly for the porous nanofibers and their characterization.
Thank you for your suggestion, We added more SEM data to illustrate
the formation of porous fibers.
3.The highly branched nanofibers show a big deviation in fiber
diameter. Why is it? It results in poor electrospinning ability. In addition,
how about the pores for very thin nanofibers of the highly branched
nanofibers? Also, the mechanism for pore forming of the nanofibers
should be explained in more reasonably, and compared to other
nanofibers.
Thank you for your question. As the degree of PLA branching
increases, the difference of fiber diameter increases. This is indeed
due to the poor electrospinning ability of the high branching PLA
polymer. But under the same conditions, the branched PLA fibers have
good pore forming ability. We added some figures to confirm that pores
on the surface of very thin nanofibers formed of branching PLA could
be also observed by SEM in figure 8. To study the factor and
mechanism for pore forming, we improved the spinning humidity and
the tensile force of the jet, and we still find pores in the surface of
fibers.In wet environment, the phase separation induced pores on the
surface of materials are not only related to solvents, but also closely
related to the properties of materials.
4. Table 2 shows the water contact angles of films, NOT nanofibers.
How about the nanofibers? There is no result for the nanofibers, in
spite that this paper is focused on the nanofibers.
This is a very good suggestion. We measured the water contact angle
of mat and found that the results were consistent with the water
contact angle of film. It shows that the porous morphology does not
change the properties of the material itself. We add this to the
manuscript in 2.5. Thank you very much.
5. The images for the water contact angle results should be included to
prove Table 2 results.
Thank you for your suggestion. We added the result of water contact to
figure 6.
6. English of the paper should be improved.
Thank you. We have modified the grammar and English expression of
the manuscript.
