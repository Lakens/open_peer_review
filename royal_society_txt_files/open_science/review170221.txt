Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
This is an elegant and well performed study of the sergestoid shrimps that nicely brings together
knowledge of their phylogeny and evolution. The results are well supported and the horizontal-
vertical evolutionary scenarios make sense. The analysis of the relative contributions of
morphological character types, analogous to examining the effects of partitioning in molecular
analyses adds useful insights.
Although principally a phylogenetic study, the author also makes important changes to the
classification including naming new families. Although sufficient information is included in the
tables and in different parts of the remarks to support the new taxonomy, the reader must search
the remarks in conjunction with Table 2 to develop a satisfactory picture of these changes.
Therefore, I suggest that the author also include a diagnosis accompanied by remarks and
taxonomic comparisons in the appendix. This will greatly improve the taxonomic utility of the
work. Additionally inclusion of keys to the major taxa is mentioned (page 2, line 52) but not
presented. Again, keys to the families and genera in the appendices will be of great use and
improve the citation of the paper.

General comments
This is a fascinating paper on the phylogeny and evolution of pelagic shrimps. However, the
following points should be reconsidered. First, Fig. 5 is based on the phylogenetic analysis shown
in Fig. 4, but vertical and horizontal colonizations of the taxa are not sufficiently supported by C.
Secondly, the author should infer the geological timings for colonizations. Supposedly, these
might have occurred since the end of the Mesozoic, when deep-waters were well ventilated. For
example, Omori mentioned when the colonization of Acetes in the new world occurred. See the
attached paper in reconsideration of this issue. In addition, you used the new familial names
before you defined them in Discussion. Any molecular data supports your conclusion?
Specific comments
L32. Explain the reason why the taxonomy was entangled.
L53-56. These seems to be strange in consideration of the context.
L60. You may replace invasion by colonization.
L78. Larval characters are involved here (249-252) rather than photophores.
L91. Concerning C, any software was employed? if so, cite its name.
L1138. Explain the reason why only some characters were included in the matrix? That is, why
contribution?
L163. Estuarine was not shown in Figs.

L164. Mention clearly that the habitats were illustrated on the basis of the vertical distribution
during the daytime.
L211. Show such a similar example in other animals if any.

This is a very interesting paper pulling together much previous work on the phylogeny of the
Sergestoidea. The analysis, which involves over 250 characters, is well executed and
demonstrates that it is mainly in the external morphology that the various clades can be
separated. Specific taxa are resolved through copulatory organ morphology or photophore
presence / morphology. I found the description of the invasion of the deep sea and coastal
ecosystems consistent with other studies and quite robust and logical.
There are a few areas of English that need improving.
The use of downward-pointing photophores is called bioluminescent countershading.
The presence of visual predators rather than just carnivores in the epipelagic have driven the
evolution of defensive structures and swimming in this zone. Metabolic rates of animals that live
in this zone also tend to be high (visual predation hypothesis). I note there appears to be several
instances of convergent evolution here driven by adaptation to the same environmental drivers. It
might be nice to note this.
Corrections to English and other comments have been noted on the pdf as highlighted comments.

My name is Richard Webber and I work as a Curator of Invertebrates, specialising in Crustacea,
at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington, New Zealand.
The responses of the author to the comments of Reviewers 1 and 2 are clear and reasoned, all
their comments are considered and used thoughtfully, and most suggestions are followed.
I wholeheartedly agree with Reviewer 1 that this is a very good and useful study. It brings
together and makes available previous work, much of it involving the author himself. It
considerably advances our knowledge of the Sergestoidea, historically one the most difficult
decapod groups to resolve systematically. The manuscript is almost ready for publication but
revisions and additions made following the assessments by Reviewers 1 & 2 have generated some
mistakes and omissions that need to be corrected or clarified.

s is an elegant and well performed study of the sergestoid shrimps that nicely brings together
wledge of their phylogeny and evolution. The results are well supported and the horizontal-
tical evolutionary scenarios make sense. The analysis of the relative contributions of
rphological character types, analogous to examining the effects of partitioning in molecular
lyses adds useful insights.
thor: Thank you.
hough principally a phylogenetic study, the author also makes important changes to the
sification including naming new families. Although sufficient information is included in the
es and in different parts of the remarks to support the new taxonomy, the reader must search
remarks in conjunction with Table 2 to develop a satisfactory picture of these changes.
refore, I suggest that the author also include a diagnosis accompanied by remarks and
onomic comparisons in the appendix. This will greatly improve the taxonomic utility of the
rk. Additionally inclusion of keys to the major taxa is mentioned (page 2, line 52) but not
sented. Again, keys to the families and genera in the appendices will be of great use and
rove the citation of the paper.
thor: I agree, Table 2 is now replaced by a more informative Appendix 8 (5 single-
ced pages) where emended diagnoses, composition, and keys to major taxa (genera and
ilies) of Sergestoidea are presented. I also make references to recent papers, where keys
ll valid species may be found (inclusion of key to species would inflate the appendix to
pages and unnecessary repeat available information).

neral comments
s is a fascinating paper on the phylogeny and evolution of pelagic shrimps.
wever, the following points should be reconsidered. First, Fig. 5 is based on the phylogenetic
lysis shown in Fig. 4, but vertical and horizontal colonizations of the taxa are not sufficiently
ported by C.
thor: Fig. 5 is based (1) on the phylogenetic data shown in Fig. 3 where all clades are
tistically supported (not Fig. 4) and (2) on my knowledge about vertical distribution of
cies, which has been published in Galathea Report monographs in 2000 and 2009
ference now inserted in the figure caption). Fig. 4 refers to the phylogenetic support by
erent character types and is not a basis for Fig. 5.
ondly, the author should infer the geological timings for colonizations. Supposedly, these
ht have occurred since the end of the Mesozoic, when deep-waters were well ventilated. For
mple, Omori mentioned when the colonization of Acetes in the new world occurred. See the
ched paper in reconsideration of this issue.
thor: I inserted the following paragraphs in the discussion (and added necessary
erences):
act geological timings for colonization of different biotopes are difficult to assess due to
ence of the molecular clock data and poor fossilization of planktonic shrimps.
onization of the meso- and bathypelagic more likely occurred since the end of the
sozoic, when deep waters were well ventilated. High primary productivity followed
p-ocean ventilation since the Eocene–Oligocene boundary [22, 23] and favored
onization of the deep sea. Recent studies have shown that the deep-sea mesoplankton
shrimps respond to variations in surface productivity and their biomass in the meso-
even bathypelagic is correlated with the averaged surface chlorophyll [24, 25]. Thus,
onization of the deep sea could be promoted by both oxygenization and increased flux of
anic matter from the euphotic zone. The end of the Mesozoic was important for
onization of the pelagic by other groups such as shallow-living cetaceans [26, 17] and
p-sea copepods [28].
onization of the epipelagic could be influenced by climate change more directly. For
mple, climate change after middle of Eocene in American side could cause immigration
ropical and subtropical species of Acetes to equatorial latitudes and forced the
atorial species to take refuges in fresh waters [29].
ddition, you used the new familial names before you defined them in Discussion.
thor: Please check, before Discussion I considered Acetidae, Luciferidae, Sicyonellidae
Sergestidae only as clades. In Discussion (not before) I designated them as families and
e reference to Appendix 8, where emended diagnoses, composition, and keys to major
a are presented. This is usual and most convenient way to introduce new taxa.
y molecular data supports your conclusion?
thor: Comparison of all available molecular and morphological data has been done (see
. after my response). You can see that molecular data generally support the new clades
material is too scant to include it at this stage. Now I am collecting new material all
r the World Ocean to enrich molecular tree and publish them in the future. Please use
information privately.
cific comments
. Explain the reason why the taxonomy was entangled.
thor: I have made a reference in the text to the papers where the whole story is
cribed in detail.
-56. These seems to be strange in consideration of the context.
thor: this is to show that I will try to assess the contribution of different character types
he sergestid phylogeny (see the new metrics below) that is one of my objectives.
. You may replace invasion by colonization.
thor: done.
. Larval characters are involved here (249-252) rather than photophores.
thor: corrected.
. Concerning C, any software was employed? if so, cite its name.
thor: comments added to the end of section 2.2. “Clade support was calculated using
e combination of programs and same settings as in morphological analysis”. C was
culated arithmetically as a difference between supports: for example, (Csi = Si+-Si).
38. Explain the reason why only some characters were included in the matrix? That is, why
tribution?
thor: I added in the section 2.2 (Methods) the following explanations: “For example, we
contribution of external characters (G). Step 1: we include only this character type in
matrix and calculate a clade support SG+. Step 2: we use another matrix with all BUT
ernal characters included and calculate the clade support SG-. Step 3: we calculate CSG
G+ - SG- and thus see how the clade support has changed. If the clade support decreases
G negative), external characters contribute positively. If the clade support increases,
ernal characters contribute negatively and erode the phylogenetic tree”.
3. Estuarine was not shown in Figs.
thor: corrected
4. Mention clearly that the habitats were illustrated on the basis of the vertical distribution
ing the daytime.
thor: done
1. Show such a similar example in other animals if any.
thor: no example
5. Much less well?
thor: corrected
8-260. These are redundant.
thor: I party agree with the referee, who is greatly versed in marine biology. At the same
e, RSOS has a wide auditory and I have decided to keep this short introduction to the
an vertical zonality. My experience suggests that many taxonomists (whom this paper is
o addressed to) have dim idea about this.
5-266. Cite any proper reference.
thor: done.
le 2. Show what characters are synapomorphies.
thor: They are different for different clades. Synapomorphies for each clade are shown
Fig. 3 with reference to this table
. 1. Show homologous parts in the clasping organs.
thor: done.
. 1. Which are lens-less organs?
thor: now arrows show lens-less photophores better.
. 4. The outer group is excluded from the figure.
thor: Yes, because as outgroups I tested two different species, one pelagic Gennadas
vus and one benthic Penaeus monodon. Position if the outgroup on this ecological figure
hus uncertain and unnecessary.

16
17 8 The phylogenetic analysis of Sergestoidea based on 253 morphological characters and
18
19
20
9 encompassing all 99 valid species confirmed all previously recognized genus-level clades.
21
22 10 Analysis retrieved five major robust clades, which correspond to families Luciferidae,
23
24 11 Sergestidae, Acetidae fam.n., Sicyonellidae fam.n., and Petalidiumidae fam.n. Synonymy,
25
26 12 emended diagnoses, and composition of revealed family-level clades were provided. Three types
27
28
13 of morphological characters were important in phylogeny of Sergestoidea: general external
29
30
31 14 characters, copulatory organs, and photophores. Novel metrics to quantify the contribution of
32
33 15 these character types were tested. General external characters were significant in a support of the
34
35 16 major clades (80 % families and nearly half of genera). Copulatory characters and photophores
36
37 17 greatly supported the medium-level clades: Lucifer, Belzebub, Petalidium, Neosergestes,
38
39
40 18 Challengerosergia (copulatory characters) and Lucensosergia, Challengerosergia,
41
42 19 Gardinerosergia, Phorcosergia (photophores). An evolutionary model of Sergestoidea showing
43
44 20 their pathways into their principal biotopes is proposed: the major clades evolved in a vertical
45
46 21 direction (from epi- to bathypelagic); further divergence at the genus level occurred within a
47
48
22 vertical zone in horizontal direction, with the invasion of the benthopelagic and neritic (shelf and
49
50
51 23 estuarine) habitats and speciation within these domains.

2 27 1. Introduction
3
4 28 The order Decapoda includes two suborders, Pleocyemata and Dendrobranchiata, the latter
5
6 29 encompassing two superfamilies, Sergestoidea and Penaeoidea. Sergestoidea hereby represents a
7
8
30 significant part of the decapod phylogenetic tree, whilst phylogeny and even taxonomy (e.g., the
9
10
11 31 proper position of Lucifer) within this superfamily remains unclear [1], partly because of
12
13 32 entangled systematics of two speciose groups (see details in [2-4]), previously known as
14
15 33 Sergestes and Sergia (over 70 species). Species of the Sergestidae are among the most common
16
17 34 in many marine ecosystems and important objects of fisheries in some areas [5-7]. Despite their
18
19
20
35 importance, Sergestoidea are still poorly understood with regard to higher level classification and
21
22 36 phylogenetic relationships.
23
24 37 During last two decades, intensive studies of these two groups have resulted in two
25
26 38 morphological revisions [2, 3] and further phylogenetic revisions, which have yielded 8 new
27
28
39 genera [4, 8]. The revision of the other genera of Sergestidae, e.g. Petalidium, Acetes, Peisos,
29
30
31 40 and Sicyonella, was made later and showed the monophyly of these genera and the synonymy of
32
33 41 Acetes and Peisos [9, 10]. Finally, scanning electron microscopy of Luciferidae has allowed
34
35 42 estimation of homologies between copulatory structures of this family and the rest of
36
37 43 Sergestoidea that has resulted in a phylogenetic revision of the genus Lucifer and splitting this
38
39
40 44 into monophyletic genera Lucifer and Belzebub [11]. The phylogenetic study of the whole
41
42 45 Sergestoidea at species level needs to be completed to assemble the rich dataset of
43
44 46 morphological characters (~250) that have been coded during previous studies. The phylogenetic
45
46 47 analysis of the whole family at species level is the first objective of this paper.
47
48
48 Most previous phylogenetic analyses in various groups of Sergestoidea have led to changes in
49
50
51 49 the classification and taxonomy at the genus level. The robustness of the revealed genus clades
52
53 50 may now be tested on a richer material and new clades of the genus or family level may be
54
55 51 found. Therefore, the second objective of this paper is to establish a natural phylogenetic
56
57 52 classification of the superfamily and to provide emended diagnoses/keys for the major taxa.

2 53 Previous studies have shown that Sergestoidea is a group exhibiting independent phylogenetic
3
4 54 traits in three types of morphological characters [4, 10, 11]: (1) general external characters
5
6 55 typical for most crustaceans, (2) copulatory characters related to a spermatophore transfer and
7
8
56 fixing female (male clasping organ and petasma), and (3) photophores. The third objective of the
9
10
11 57 paper is to assess the contribution of these character types to the robustness of the clades.
12
13 58 Finally, Sergestoidea is a group widely distributed in all temperate and tropical waters and at
14
15 59 different depth strata, from epi- to bathypelagic. The last objective of this paper is to assess
16
17 60 evolutionary scenarios including colonization of principal oceanic biotopes.

22 62 2. Material and methods.
23
24 63 2.1. Morphological analysis
25
26 64 The material used for this study is from the extensive collections of pelagic crustaceans taken
27
28
65 during the Danish “Dana I” (1920-22) and “Dana II” (1928-30) Expeditions stored at the Natural
29
30
31 66 History Museum of Denmark; some type specimens were requested from other Museums
32
33 67 (Appendix 1). All valid species of Sergestoidea have been included as terminal taxa, with
34
35 68 updated synonymy (Appendix 2). As outgroups we tested two species of the sister superfamily
36
37 69 Penaeoidea, pelagic Gennadas parvus Spence Bate, 1881 (family Benthesicymidae) and benthic
38
39
40 70 Penaeus monodon Fabricius, 1798 (Penaeidae). Character state scoring for each species derived
41
42 71 from examination of the type material (Appendix 1).
43
44 72 We used the characters described and figured in a series of preceding papers [4, 9-11], a total of
45
46 73 253 edited characters (Appendix 3) for 101 terminal taxa, the data matrix is presented in
47
48
74 Appendix 4.
49
50
51 75 Characters were divided into three groups (Fig. 1): (1) general external characters (0-115, here
52
53 76 and below numbers in the parenthesis after characters indicate the position of characters in
54
55 77 Appendix 3), (2) copulatory organs (116-189) including the petasma and the clasping organ

2 78 (modified part of Antenna I) y, and (3) photophores (190-248). All characters were unordered
3
4 79 (non-additive) and equally weighted, missing data were scored unknown.
5
6 80 Data were handled and analyzed using a combination of programs and maximum parsimony
7
8
81 (MP) settings: Winclada/Nona, NDE (Nexus Data Editor), and TNT [12-14].Trees were
9
10
11 82 generated in TNT with 30000 trees in memory, under the "traditional search" mode with the
12
13 83 following settings: 150 replicates, 200 trees to save per replication and 10000 replicates, 200
14
15 84 trees to save per replication. Relative stability of clades was assessed by standard bootstrapping
16
17 85 (sample with replacement) with 10000 pseudoreplicates and by Bremer support (algorithm TBR,
18
19
20
86 saving up to 10000 trees up to 3 steps longer). We considered the clades statistically significant
21
22 87 if they were simultaneously supported by the bootstrap values 80 % and by the Bremer values 3.
23
24 88
25
26 89 2.2. Novel metrics to quantify contribution of a character type to the clade support and
27
28
90 divergence within a clade.
29
30
31 91 In order to quantify the contribution (C), of a character type i to a support (S) of a selected clade,
32
33 92 a new metric Csi = Si+ - Si-, (Fig. 2) is offered, where Si+ is a support of the clade, if only the type
34
35 93 i characters are included in the matrix, Si- is the support of the clade, if all but the type i
36
37 94 characters are included in the matrix. If Csi is positive, the type i characters positively contribute
38
39
40 95 to the clade support; greater Csi values indicate greater contribution. We use the Csi metric to
41
42 96 assess contribution of different character types to support of the clades at the genus and family
43
44 97 levels: CsG for general (G) external characters, CsC for copulatory (C) organs, and CsPh for
45
46 98 photophores (Ph).
47
48
99 For example, we test contribution of external characters (G). Step 1: we include only this
49
50
51 100 character type in the matrix and calculate a clade support SG+. Step 2: we use another matrix
52
53 101 with all BUT external characters included and calculate the clade support SG-. Step 3: we
54
55 102 calculate CsG = SG+ - SG- and thus see how the clade support has changed. If the clade support

1
2 103 decreases (CsG negative), external characters contribute positively. If the clade support increases,
3
4 104 external characters contribute negatively and erode the phylogenetic tree.
5
6 105 In order to quantify contribution (C), of a character type i to a divergence (D) within a clade, a
7
8
106 new metric Cdi = Di+/(n-1) - Di-/(n-1) is offered (Fig. 2), where Di+ is a sum of support in
9
10
11 107 resolved branches within the clade, if only the type i characters are included in the matrix, Di- is
12
13 108 a sum of support in resolved branches within the clade, if all but the type i characters are
14
15 109 included in the matrix, n is a number of terminal taxa within the clade. If Cdi is positive, the type
16
17 110 i characters positively contribute to divergence within the clade; greater Cd values indicate
18
19
20
111 greater contribution. We use the Cdi metric to assess contribution of different character types to
21
22 112 the divergence of the clades at the genus levels, e.g. to speciation: CdG for general external
23
24 113 characters, CdC for copulatory organs, and , CdPh for photophores. Both Csi and Cdi metrics are
25
26 114 calculated on the basis of the Bremer and bootstrap support. If any of calculations gives a
27
28
115 positive result, a contribution of a type i characters is considered to be positive.
29
30
31 116 Clade support was calculated using same combination of programs and same settings as in
32
33 117 morphological analysis.

40 120 3.1. The consensus tree and supported clades.
41
42 121 Both analyses with Gennadas parvus and Penaeus monodon as outgroups retrieved 240 minimal
43
44 122 length trees, with 470 and 467 steps, respectively. The topologies of both strict consensus trees
45
46 123 were identical and support of the clades were also identical or very similar (Fig. 3). Two major
47
48
124 sister clades were revealed: Acetidae + Luciferidae and Sicyonellidae + Petalidiumidae +
49
50
51 125 Sergestidae. The first clade received high Bremer (20) and bootstrap (83 %) support, whilst the
52
53 126 second clade received only Bremer support (12/13).
54
55 127 The clade Luciferidae was sister to Acetidae, both were robust: 33/34 Bremer and 100 %
56
57 128 bootstrap support versus 12/14 Bremer and 94 % bootstrap support, respectively. The clade

2 129 Luciferidae was divided into Lucifer (9 Bremer and 99 % bootstrap support) and Belzebub (7
3
4 130 Bremer and 99 % bootstrap support). Within Acetidae, a single clade Acetes marinus + Acetes
5
6 131 paraguayensis received high Bremer (4) and bootstrap (92 %) support.
7
8
132 Within the clade Sicyonellidae + Petalidiumidae + Sergestidae, Sicyonellidae was sister to
9
10
11 133 Petalidiumidae + Sergestidae, both were robust: 6 Bremer and 80 % bootstrap support versus 25
12
13 134 Bremer and 99 % bootstrap support, respectively. Within Sicyonellidae, the clade Sicyonella
14
15 135 antennata + Sicyonella maldivensis received high Bremer (6) and bootstrap (98 %) support.
16
17 136 Petalidiumidae was sister to Sergestidae, both were robust: 12 Bremer and 100 % bootstrap
18
19
20
137 support versus 12 Bremer and 91 % bootstrap support, respectively. Petalidiumidae was not
21
22 138 resolved, whilst the Sergestidae received significant resolution.
23
24 139 Sergestidae included several robust major clades (Fig. 3): (1) Neosergestes + Parasergestes, (2)
25
26 140 Allosergestes + Deosergestes, (3) eight genera of the former Sergia [4] with the root "sergia", (4)
27
28
141 seven genera of the former Sergia [4]) with the exception of Sergia, and (5) Lucensosergia+
29
30
31 142 Challengerosergia. All generic clades were robust (15 genera with minimal Bremer and
32
33 143 bootstrap support 3 and 86 %, respectively) but not further resolved at species levels. Inter-
34
35 144 generic phylogenetic relationships were resolved only partly.

40 146 3.2. The contribution of different character types into the clade support and speciation.
41
42 147 If only general external characters were included in the matrix, the clades corresponding to
43
44 148 Acetidae, Luciferidae, Sicyonellidae, Petalidiumidae were robust; all genus-level clades were
45
46 149 supported except Belzebub. Sergestidae and approximately half of included genus-level clades
47
48
150 were not resolved (Appendix 5). If all but general external characters were included,
49
50
51 151 Petalidiumidae and Sergestidae with most included genus-level clades were robust (Appendix 5).
52
53 152 Acetidae, Luciferidae, and Sicyonellidae were not supported; both genera of Luciferidae were
54
55 153 robust. The CsG values, indicating contribution of general external characters in the clade
56
57 154 support, were positive for Acetidae, Luciferidae, Sicyonellidae and for two genera of

2 155 Sergestidae: Parasergestes and Allosergestes (Fig. 4). The CdG metrics, showing contribution of
3
4 156 general external characters to speciation within the genera, were positive for Deosergestes and
5
6 157 Petalidium (Fig. 4).
7
8
158 If only copulatory characters were included in the analysis, Petalidiumidae and both genera of
9
10
11 159 Luciferidae were supported (Appendix 6). If all but copulatory characters were included, all the
12
13 160 clades were robust except Belzebub, Challengerosergia, and Robustosergia (Appendix 6). The
14
15 161 CsC values were positive only for both genera of Luciferidae, while the CdC metrics were
16
17 162 positive for Acetes, Lucifer, Belzebub, Neosergestes, and Challengerosergia (Fig. 4).
18
19
20
163 If only photophores were included in the analysis, only four genera of Sergestidae were robust:
21
22 164 Challengerosergia, Lucensosergia, Gardinerosergia, and Phorcosergia (Appendix 7).
23
24 165 Conversely, these clades were the only unsupported clades, if all characters but photophores are
25
26 166 included (Appendix 7). The CsPh values were positive for the same four genera of Sergestidae,
27
28
167 whilst the CdPh metric was positive for Lucensosergia only (Fig. 4).

33 169 3.3. The distribution of the clades in the main oceanic habitats.
34
35 170 The retrieved clades Acetidae, Luciferidae, Sicyonellidae and part of Sergestidae
36
37 171 (Cornutosergestes) are epipelagic [3, 4, 10, 11], three generic clades within these clades (Acetes,
38
39
40 172 Belzebub, and Sicyonella) are neritic and one species of Acetes is even freshwater [10, 11] (Fig.
41
42 173 4).
43
44 174 Most sergestids are mesopelagic oceanic interzonal species, which migrate diurnally. Three
45
46 175 genera, Challengerosergia, Lucensosergia, and Scintillosergia are benthopelagic and associated
47
48
176 with continental slopes and seamounts [2-4] (Fig. 4).
49
50
51 177 Petalidiumidae and the genus Sergia of Sergestidae are bathypelagic [2, 4, 9] (Fig. 4).

58

https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 8 of 50
1
2 181 Many previously tested genus-level clades receive even better statistical support than before [4,
3
4 182 9-11].Our data show that the family Luciferidae is a natural group, whilst the remainder of
5
6 183 Sergestoidea, previously considered as the family Sergestidae, is not monophyletic and includes
7
8
184 four basal monophyletic clades with a good support: Acetidae, Sicyonellidae, Petalidiumidae,
9
10
11 185 and Sergestidae (Fig. 3).
12
13 186 Here we designate three new families of Sergestoidea (in addition to the previously established
14
15 187 Luciferidae and Sergestidae): Acetidae, Sicyonellidae, and Petalidiumidae. Their emended
16
17 188 diagnoses, composition, and keys to genera and families are given in Appendix 8. From the
18
19
20
189 carcinological viewpoint, these families most remarkably differ in the morphology of the
21
22 190 copulatory structures. Luciferidae have no clasping organ at all, Acetidae have two clasping
23
24 191 tubercles (one may be reduced) and opposed claw-like setae, Sergestidae have a single clasping
25
26 192 tubercle and opposed serrated bristles, Sicyonellidae have a row of serrated bristles and no
27
28
193 tubercle, while Petalidiumidae have two opposed rows of serrated bristles (one of each replaces
29
30
31 194 the tubercle). The general topology of petasma is very characteristic for each family. Luciferidae
32
33 195 have a petasma without pars astringens, pars externa is transformed into a sheath around
34
35 196 processus ventralis. In Acetidae, the petasma is often lacking pars astringens, the capitulum has
36
37 197 no developed lobes and processes. Sergestidae have all parts of the petasma developed and
38
39
40 198 usually undivided. Sicyonellidae (with an exception of S. inermis) and Petalidiumidae have the
41
42 199 most complex petasma with all parts present and the secondarily divided processus ventralis.
43
44 200 Other significant distinguishing characters include widely separated labrum and antennae and the
45
46 201 absence of true chela in Luciferidae; rudimentary chelae of first to third pereopods and very
47
48
202 reduced/absent natatory pereopods in Acetidae; well-developed chelae on first to third pereopods
49
50
51 203 and a complete set of segments on natatory pereopods in Sicyonellidae; luminous organs (in
52
53 204 fourteen of fifteen genera) in Sergestidae.

1
2 207 External body characters are mostly homoplasious and have evolved independently: the armature
3
4 208 of the carapace and grasping appendages, reduction of the natatory pereopods, etc. Membranous
5
6 209 integument also independently evolved in such distant deep-sea clades as Petalidium and Sergia,
7
8
210 probably as an adaptation to the deep-sea life of these genera (Fig. 3).
9
10
11 211 The clasping copulatory organ represents homoplasy: this organ independently evolved in
12
13 212 Acetidae, Sicyonellidae, Petalidiumidae, and Sergestidae and morphologically differs between
14
15 213 these clades. The elaborated petasma is a synapomorphy of Sergestoidea; further evolution of
16
17 214 this organ, including elaboration or loss of numerous lobes and processes, occurs in all clades
18
19
20
215 and is linked to the synapomorphies supporting families and genera.
21
22 216 Such photophores as the organs of Pesta are homoplasious: they evolved independently in
23
24 217 several genera and have different histological structure [3, 4]. Conversely, dermal photophores
25
26 218 evolved once in a single clade and were further either lost (reversal in Sergia) or elaborated and
27
28
219 possessed lens (homoplasies) in Prehensilosergia, Scintillosergia, Lucensosergia, and
29
30
31 220 Challengerosergia, probably as an adaptation to the benthopelagic habitat of these genera.
32
33 221
34
35 222 4.3. Contribution of different character types to the phylogeny of Sergestoidea.
36
37 223 All character types have significantly contributed to the support of revealed clades, as exclusion
38
39
40 224 of any character type significantly impacts the resolution of the tree.
41
42 225 General external characters are the most important for support of the major (family-level)
43
44 226 clades: four families remain supported if only this type is used in the analysis (Appendix 5).
45
46 227 General external characters, however, are insufficient to support Sergestidae. Acetidae,
47
48
228 Luciferidae, and Sicyonellidae are especially sensitive to the absence of general external
49
50
51 229 characters and collapse if this type is not included in the analysis.
52
53 230 General external characters significantly contribute to support of nearly half of the genera
54
55 231 (Appendix 5). They are most important (positive CsG) for the Parasergestes and Allosergestes, in
56
57 232 which synapomorphies are associated with the catching appendages (third maxilliped and the
58
59

https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 10 of 50
1
2 233 second to third pereopods) and illustrate offensive strategy of Sergestidae [4]. Further speciation
3
4 234 within these genera (negative CdG) is not dependant on this type of characters.
5
6 235 General external characters are significant in speciation of Petalidium and Deosergestes and
7
8
236 associated with development of branchs (Petalidium occurs in waters with significantly different
9
10
11 237 oxygen concentrations [4]) or catching appendages (Deosergestes illustrating offensive strategy
12
13 238 [4]).
14
15 239 Copulatory characters do not provide significant support for any of the five major clades. Only
16
17 240 three genera, Lucifer, Belzebub, and Petalidium, receive statistical support if only this type is
18
19
20
241 included in the analysis (Appendix 6). The absence of copulatory characters in the analysis does
21
22 242 not change the robustness of the tree significantly (Appendix 6). Positive CsC values confirm the
23
24 243 contribution of copulatory characters in the support of Lucifer and Belzebub. The copulatory
25
26 244 characters (positive CdC) significantly contribute to speciation within Lucifer, Belzebub,
27
28
245 Neosergestes, and Challengerosergia. The copulatory characters appear not to be critical in the
29
30
31 246 colonization of the major pelagic habitats; instead, they may promote sexual isolation during
32
33 247 invasion of different parts of the epipelagic (oceanic Lucifer and neritic Belzebub) and
34
35 248 mesopelagic (pelagic Neosergestes and benthopelagic Challengerosergia) biotopes.
36
37 249 Photophores, like copulatory characters, do not provide significant support of any family-level
38
39
40 250 clades. Four genera, Lucensosergia, Challengerosergia, Gardinerosergia, and Phorcosergia,
41
42 251 receive statistical support if only this type is included in the analysis (Appendix 73). The absence
43
44 252 of photophores in the dataset does not change the robustness of the consensus tree significantly
45
46 253 (Appendix 7). Positive CsPh and CdPh values confirm the contribution of photophores to the
47
48
254 support of the four genera above and to speciation within Lucensosergia.

51 255
52
53 256 4.4. The pathways into principal oceanic biotopes.
54
55 257 The classical schema of vertical zonation of the pelagic ocean includes several vertical zones
56
57 258 [15]. First is the epipelagic (0 – 200 m), in which there is enough sunlight during daytime to
58
59
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 11 of 50 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2 259 support primary production. Second is the mesopelagic zone, that receives enough solar
3
4 260 illumination for the fauna to differentiate diurnal and nocturnal cycles, but not enough to support
5
6 261 photosynthesis; in the plankton research, this zone is usually associated with the main pycnocline
7
8
262 with the lower boundary normally ranging from 500 to 900 m [7, 16]. Third is the bathypelagic
9
10
11 263 zone below the main pycnocline, with relative invariance of light, temperature, and salinity [15]
12
13 264 and a lower boundary at a depth of 3000 m. These zones may be further divided in horizontal
14
15 265 direction. The epipelagic is traditionally divided into the oceanic zone and the neritic zone
16
17 266 including the shallow waters from the littoral zone to the edge of the continental shelf. The
18
19
20
267 meso- and bathypelagic zones around continental slopes and seamounts are replaced by the
21
22 268 benthopelagic zone, where specific bottom-related fauna makes up over 50% of the total
23
24 269 plankton biomass [17].
25
26 270 Each major (family-level) clade occurs only within one of these basic vertical zones (Fig. 4).
27
28
271 Acetidae, Luciferidae, and Sicyonellidae are epipelagic and the main synapomorphies supporting
29
30
31 272 these clades are linked to spination/shape of body and to natatory appendages. Spination of the
32
33 273 body is assumed to have defensive function, while body shape and natatory appendages favour
34
35 274 escape function [4]; both are critical in the epipelagic where shelters are absent and carnivores
36
37 275 are abundant [4].
38
39
40 276 Sergestidae is mesopelagic and encompasses genera, which are supported by synapomorphies
41
42 277 linked to luminous organs (the organ of Pesta or dermal photophores). The photophores tilt to
43
44 278 maintain their downward orientation no matter which way the animal is swimming [18] and may
45
46 279 thus provide ventral camouflage [19]. The photophores in mesopelagic Sergestidae may also be
47
48
280 of schooling aid: adults have well-developed photophores and form shoals [4] and their visual
49
50
51 281 systems are tuned to detect bioluminescence [20, 21], while earlier stages are lacking
52
53 282 photophores, scattered, and have different characteristics of visual systems [20]. The evolution of
54
55 283 the photophores may thus be critical for the invasion of the mesopelagic.

2 284 Petalidiumidae and Sergia (Sergestidae) are bathypelagic (Fig.4). They have membranous
3
4 285 integument and fatty tissues, they lack photophores (not evolved in Petalidiumidae and lost in
5
6 286 Sergia) that may illustrate possible adaptations to minimization of energy loss in the deep-sea
7
8
287 depleted in food.
9
10
11 288 Some major (family-level) clades further diverge and colonize different habitats within the same
12
13 289 vertical zone. The epipelagic Luciferidae is split into the oceanic Lucifer and the neritic
14
15 290 Belzebub. The mesopelagic Sergestidae encompasses eleven oceanic and three benthopelagic
16
17 291 genera (Fig. 4), which form a robust monophyletic clade Challengerosergia+Lucensosergia+
18
19
20
292 Lucensosergia. The clade is supported by such a synapomorphy as thick lens on dermal
21
22 293 photophores, which may favour communication in the dim nepheloid layer associated with the
23
24 294 benthopelagic habitat [17].
25
26 295 Exact geological timings for colonization of different biotopes are difficult to assess due to
27
28
296 absence of the molecular clock data and poor fossilization of planktonic shrimps. Colonization of
29
30
31 297 the meso- and bathypelagic more likely occurred since the end of the Mesozoic, when deep
32
33 298 waters were well ventilated. High primary productivity followed deep-ocean ventilation since the
34
35 299 Eocene–Oligocene boundary [22, 23] and favored colonization of the deep sea. Recent studies
36
37 300 have shown that the deep-sea mesoplankton and shrimps respond to variations in surface
38
39
40 301 productivity and their biomass in the meso- and even bathypelagic is correlated with the
41
42 302 averaged surface chlorophyll [24, 25]. Thus, colonization of the deep sea could be promoted by
43
44 303 both oxygenization and increased flux of organic matter from the euphotic zone. The end of the
45
46 304 Mesozoic was important for colonization of the pelagic by other groups such as shallow-living
47
48
305 cetaceans [26, 17] and deep-sea copepods [28].
49
50
51 306 Colonization of the epipelagic could be influenced by climate change more directly. For
52
53 307 example, climate change after middle of Eocene in American side could cause immigration of
54
55 308 tropical and subtropical species of Acetes to equatorial latitudes and forced the equatorial species
56
57 309 to take refuges in fresh waters [29].

2 310 In conclusion, we propose an evolutionary model of Sergestoidea showing their pathways into
3
4 311 their principal biotopes (Fig. 5). The basal (family level) clades appear to have diverged in
5
6 312 vertical direction, colonized water column from surface to a depth of nearly 3000 m. Further,
7
8
313 each of these clades evolved within the same vertical range; the divergence at the genus level, if
9
10
11 314 any, occurred only within a vertical zone in horizontal direction, with the invasion of the
12
13 315 benthopelagic and neritic (shelf and estuarine) habitats. The speciation within the genera
14
15 316 occurred mainly within vertical and horizontal habitats (Fig. 5), mostly sympatrically [4].
16
17 317 Greatly elaborated copulatory morphology (clasping organ and petasma) could favor sexual
18
19
20
318 isolation between sympatric species.

This is an elegant and well performed study of the sergestoid shrimps that nicely brings together
12 knowledge of their phylogeny and evolution. The results are well supported and the horizontal-
13 vertical evolutionary scenarios make sense. The analysis of the relative contributions of
14 morphological character types, analogous to examining the effects of partitioning in molecular
15 analyses adds useful insights.
16
Author: Thank you.
17
18
19 Although principally a phylogenetic study, the author also makes important changes to the
20 classification including naming new families. Although sufficient information is included in the
21 tables and in different parts of the remarks to support the new taxonomy, the reader must search
22 the remarks in conjunction with Table 2 to develop a satisfactory picture of these changes.
23
24
Therefore, I suggest that the author also include a diagnosis accompanied by remarks and
25 taxonomic comparisons in the appendix. This will greatly improve the taxonomic utility of the
26 work. Additionally inclusion of keys to the major taxa is mentioned (page 2, line 52) but not
27 presented. Again, keys to the families and genera in the appendices will be of great use and
28 improve the citation of the paper.
29
30
31 Author: I agree, Table 2 is now replaced by a more informative Appendix 8 (5 single-
32 spaced pages) where emended diagnoses, composition, and keys to major taxa (genera and
33 families) of Sergestoidea are presented. I also make references to recent papers, where keys
34 to all valid species may be found (inclusion of key to species would inflate the appendix to
35 30 pages and unnecessary repeat available information).

7 General comments
8 This is a fascinating paper on the phylogeny and evolution of pelagic shrimps.
9
10
11
However, the following points should be reconsidered. First, Fig. 5 is based on the phylogenetic
12 analysis shown in Fig. 4, but vertical and horizontal colonizations of the taxa are not sufficiently
13 supported by C.
14 Author: Fig. 5 is based (1) on the phylogenetic data shown in Fig. 3 where all clades are
15 statistically supported (not Fig. 4) and (2) on my knowledge about vertical distribution of
16
species, which has been published in Galathea Report monographs in 2000 and 2009
17
18 (Reference now inserted in the figure caption). Fig. 4 refers to the phylogenetic support by
19 different character types and is not a basis for Fig. 5.
20
21 Secondly, the author should infer the geological timings for colonizations. Supposedly, these
22 might have occurred since the end of the Mesozoic, when deep-waters were well ventilated. For
23
24
example, Omori mentioned when the colonization of Acetes in the new world occurred. See the
25 attached paper in reconsideration of this issue.
26 Author: I inserted the following paragraphs in the discussion (and added necessary
27 references):
28
29
30
Exact geological timings for colonization of different biotopes are difficult to assess due to
31 absence of the molecular clock data and poor fossilization of planktonic shrimps.
32 Colonization of the meso- and bathypelagic more likely occurred since the end of the
33 Mesozoic, when deep waters were well ventilated. High primary productivity followed
34 deep-ocean ventilation since the Eocene–Oligocene boundary [22, 23] and favored
35 colonization of the deep sea. Recent studies have shown that the deep-sea mesoplankton
36
37 and shrimps respond to variations in surface productivity and their biomass in the meso-
38 and even bathypelagic is correlated with the averaged surface chlorophyll [24, 25]. Thus,
39 colonization of the deep sea could be promoted by both oxygenization and increased flux of
40 organic matter from the euphotic zone. The end of the Mesozoic was important for
41 colonization of the pelagic by other groups such as shallow-living cetaceans [26, 17] and
42
43
deep-sea copepods [28].
44 Colonization of the epipelagic could be influenced by climate change more directly. For
45 example, climate change after middle of Eocene in American side could cause immigration
46 of tropical and subtropical species of Acetes to equatorial latitudes and forced the
47 equatorial species to take refuges in fresh waters [29].
48
49
50 In addition, you used the new familial names before you defined them in Discussion.
51 Author: Please check, before Discussion I considered Acetidae, Luciferidae, Sicyonellidae
52 and Sergestidae only as clades. In Discussion (not before) I designated them as families and
53 gave reference to Appendix 8, where emended diagnoses, composition, and keys to major
54 taxa are presented. This is usual and most convenient way to introduce new taxa.

Any molecular data supports your conclusion?
4
5 Author: Comparison of all available molecular and morphological data has been done (see
6 Fig. after my response). You can see that molecular data generally support the new clades
7 but material is too scant to include it at this stage. Now I am collecting new material all
8
9 over the World Ocean to enrich molecular tree and publish them in the future. Please use

19 L53-56. These seems to be strange in consideration of the context.
20
21 Author: this is to show that I will try to assess the contribution of different character types
22 to the sergestid phylogeny (see the new metrics below) that is one of my objectives.
23
24 L60. You may replace invasion by colonization.
25 Author: done.

32 Author: comments added to the end of section 2.2. “Clade support was calculated using
33
34 same combination of programs and same settings as in morphological analysis”. C was
35 calculated arithmetically as a difference between supports: for example, (Csi = Si+-Si).
36
37 L1138. Explain the reason why only some characters were included in the matrix? That is, why
38 contribution?
39
40
Author: I added in the section 2.2 (Methods) the following explanations: “For example, we
41 test contribution of external characters (G). Step 1: we include only this character type in
42 the matrix and calculate a clade support SG+. Step 2: we use another matrix with all BUT
43 external characters included and calculate the clade support SG-. Step 3: we calculate CSG
44 = SG+ - SG- and thus see how the clade support has changed. If the clade support decreases
45 (CSG negative), external characters contribute positively. If the clade support increases,
46
47 external characters contribute negatively and erode the phylogenetic tree”.

Author: I party agree with the referee, who is greatly versed in marine biology. At the same

19
8 The phylogenetic analysis of Sergestoidea based on 253 morphological characters and
20
21 9 encompassing all 99 valid species confirmed all previously recognized genus-level clades.
22
23 10 Analysis retrieved five major robust clades, which correspond to familieswere considered as Formatted: English (U.S.)
24
25 11 monophyletic families: Luciferidae, Sergestidae, Acetidae fam.n., Sicyonellidae fam.n., and
26
27 12 Petalidiumidae fam.n. Synonymy, emended diagnoses, and composition of revealed family-level
28
29 13 clades were provided. Three types of morphological characters were important in phylogeny of
30
31 14 Sergestoidea: general external characters, copulatory organs, and photophores. Novel metrics to
32
15 quantify the contribution of these character types were tested. General external characters were
33
34 16 significant in a support of the major clades (80 % families and nearly half of genera). Copulatory
35
36 17 characters and photophores greatly supported the medium-level clades: Lucifer, Belzebub,
37
38 18 Petalidium, Neosergestes, Challengerosergia (copulatory characters) and Lucensosergia,
39
40 19 Challengerosergia, Gardinerosergia, Phorcosergia (photophores). An evolutionary model of
41
42 20 Sergestoidea showing their pathways into their principal biotopes was is proposed: the major
43
44 21 clades evolved in a vertical direction (from epi- to bathypelagic); further divergence at the genus
45
22 level occurred within a fixed vertical zone in horizontal direction, with the invasion of the
46
47 23 benthopelagic and neritic (shelf and estuarine) habitats and speciation within these fixed
48
49 24 domains.

8 28 1. Introduction
9
10 29 The order Decapoda includes two suborders, Pleocyemata and Dendrobranchiata, the latter
11
12 30 encompassing two superfamilies, Sergestoidea and Penaeoidea. Sergestoidea hereby represents a
13
14 31 significant part of the decapod phylogenetic tree, whilst phylogeny and even taxonomy (e.g., the
15
16 32 proper position of Lucifer) within this superfamily remains unclear [1], partly because of
17
18 33 entangled systematics of two speciose groups (see details in [2-4]), previously known as
19
34 Sergestes and Sergia (over 70 species). Species of the Sergestidae are among the most common
20
21 35 in many marine ecosystems and important objects of fisheries in some areas, such as Sergestes
22
23 36 lucens in Japan [2-45-7]. Despite their importance, Sergestoidea are still poorly understood with
24
25 37 regard to higher level classification and phylogenetic relationships.
26
27 38 During last two decades, intensive studies of these two groups have resulted in two
28
29 39 morphological revisions [5, 62, 3] and further phylogenetic revisions, which have yielded 8 new
30
31 40 genera [74, 8]. The revision of the other genera of Sergestidae, e.g. Petalidium, Acetes, Peisos,
32
41 and Sicyonella, was made later and showed the monophyly of these genera (except Peisos) and
33
34 42 the synonymy of Acetes and Peisos [89, 910]. Finally, scanning electron microscopy of
35
36 43 Luciferidae has allowed estimation of homologies between copulatory structures of this family
37
38 44 and the rest of Sergestoidea that has resulted in a phylogenetic revision of the genus Lucifer and
39
40 45 splitting this into monophyletic genera Lucifer and Belzebub [1011]. The phylogenetic study of
41
42 46 the whole Sergestoidea at species level needs to be completed, to assemble the rich dataset of Formatted: English (U.S.)
43
44 47 morphological characters (~250) that have been coded as a significant basis including a rich
45
48 dataset of morphological characters (nearly a quarter thousand) has been coded during previous
46
47 49 studies. The phylogenetic analysis of the whole family at species level is the first objective of
48
49 50 this paper.
50
51 51 Most previous phylogenetic analyses in various groups of Sergestoidea have led to changes in
52
53 52 the classification and taxonomy at the genus level. The robustness of the revealed genus clades

53 may now be tested on a richer material and new clades of the genus or family level may be
7
8 54 found. Therefore, the second objective of this paper is to establish a natural phylogenetic
9
10 55 classification of the superfamily and to provide emended diagnoses/keys for the major taxa.
11
12 56 Previous studies have shown that Sergestoidea is a group exhibiting independent phylogenetic
13
14 57 traits in three types of morphological characters [4, 10, 11]: (1) general external characters
15
16 58 typical for most crustaceans, (2) copulatory characters related to a spermatophore transfer and
17
18 59 fixing female (male clasping organ and petasma), and (3) photophores. The third objective of the
19
60 paper is to assess the contribution of these character types to the robustness of the clades.
20
21 61 Finally, Sergestoidea is a group widely distributed in all temperate and tropical waters and at
22
23 62 different depth strata, from epi- to bathypelagic. The last objective of this paper is to assess
24
25 63 evolutionary scenarios including invasion colonization of principal oceanic biotopes.

29 65 2. Material and methods.
30
31 66 2.1. Morphological analysis
32
67 The material used for this study is from the extensive collections of pelagic crustaceans taken
33
34 68 during the Danish “Dana I” (1920-22) and “Dana II” (1928-30) Expeditions stored at the Natural
35
36 69 History Museum of Denmark; some type specimens were requested from other Museums
37
38 70 (Appendix 1). All valid species of Sergestoidea according to De Grave & Fransen (2011) have
39
40 71 been included as terminal taxa, with updated synonymy (Table Appendix 12). As outgroups we
41
42 72 tested two species of the sister superfamily Penaeoidea, pelagic Gennadas parvus Spence Bate,
43
44 73 1881 (family Benthesicymidae) and benthic Penaeus monodon Fabricius, 1798 (Penaeidae).
45
74 Character state scoring for each species derived from examination of the type material
46
47 75 (Appendix 1).
48
49 76 We used the characters described and figured in a series of preceding papers [7-104, 9-11], a
50
51 77 total of 253 edited characters (Appendix 23) for 101 terminal taxa, the data matrix is presented in
52
53 78 Appendix 34.

79 All cCharacters were divided into three groups (Fig. 1): (1) general external characters (0-115,
7
8 80 here and below numbers in the parenthesis after characters indicate the position of characters in
9
10 81 Appendix 23), (2) copulatory organs (116-189) including the petasma and the clasping organ
11
12 82 (modified part of Antenna I) y, and (3) photophores (190-252248). All characters were
13
14 83 unordered (non-additive) and equally weighted, missing data were scored unknown.
15
16 84 Data were handled and analyzed using a combination of programs and maximum parsimony
17
18 85 (MP) settings: Winclada/Nona, NDE (Nexus Data Editor), and TNT [11-1312-14].Trees were
19
86 generated in TNT with 30000 trees in memory, under the "traditional search" mode with the
20
21 87 following settings: 150 replicates, 200 trees to save per replication and 10000 replicates, 200
22
23 88 trees to save per replication. Relative stability of clades was assessed by standard bootstrapping
24
25 89 (sample with replacement) with 10000 pseudoreplicates and by Bremer support (algorithm TBR,
26
27 90 saving up to 10000 trees up to 3 steps longer). We considered the clades statistically significant
28
29 91 if they were simultaneously supported by the bootstrap values 80 % and by the Bremer values 3.

31 92
32
93 2.2. Novel metrics to quantify contribution of a character type to the clade support and
33
34 94 divergence within a clade.
35
36 95 In order to quantify the contribution (C), of a character type i to a support (S) of a selected clade,
37
38 96 a new metric Csi = Si+ - Si-, (Fig. 2) is offered, where Si+ is a support of the clade, if only the type
39
40 97 i characters are included in the matrix, Si- is the support of the clade, if all but the type i
41
42 98 characters are included in the matrix. If Csi is positive, the type i characters positively contribute
43
44 99 to the clade support; greater Csi values indicate greater contribution. We use the Csi metric to
45
100 assess contribution of different character types to support of the clades at the genus and family
46
47 101 levels: CsG for general (G) external characters, CsC for copulatory (C) organs, and CsPh for
48
49 102 photophores (Ph). Formatted: Font: Not Bold

7
Formatted: Font: Not Bold, English (U.S.)

Formatted: Font: Not Bold, English (U.S.)
10 107 decreases (CsG negative), external characters contribute positively. If the clade support increases, Formatted: Font: Not Bold, English (U.S.)
11
Formatted: Font: Not Bold, English (U.S.)
12 108 external characters contribute negatively and erode the phylogenetic tree.
Formatted: Font: Not Bold, English (U.S.)
13
14 109 In order to quantify contribution (C), of a character type i to a divergence (D) within a clade, a
15
16 110 new metric Cdi = Di+/(n-1) - Di-/(n-1) is offered (Fig. 2), where Di+ is a sum of supportssupport
17
18 111 in resolved branches within the clade, if only the type i characters are included in the matrix, Di-
19
112 is a sum of supportssupport in resolved branches within the clade, if all but the type i characters
20
21 113 are included in the matrix, n is a number of terminal taxa within the clade. If Cdi is positive, the
22
23 114 type i characters positively contribute to divergence within the clade; greater Cd values indicate
24
25 115 greater contribution. We use the Cdi metric to assess contribution of different character types to
26
27 116 the divergence of the clades at the genus levels, e.g. to speciation: CdG for general external
28
29 117 characters, CdC for copulatory organs, and , CdPh for photophores. Both Csi and Cdi metrics are
30
31 118 calculated on the basis of the Bremer and bootstrap support. If any of calculations gives a
32
119 positive result, a contribution of a type i characters is considered to be positive.
33
34 120 Clade support was calculated using same combination of programs and same settings as in
35
36 121 morphological analysis.

43
44 125 Both analyses with Gennadas parvus and Penaeus monodon as outgroups retrieved 240 minimal
45
126 length trees, with 470 and 467 steps, respectively. The topologies of both strict consensus trees
46
47 127 were identical and supportssupport of the clades were also identical or very similar (Fig. 3). Two
48
49 128 major sister major clades were revealed: Acetidae + Luciferidae and Sicyonellidae +
50
51 129 Petalidiumidae + Sergestidae. First The first clade received high Bremer (20) and bBootstrap (83
52
53 130 %) supportssupport, whilst the second clade received only Bremer support (12/13).

131 The clade Luciferidae was sister to Acetidae, both were robust: 33/34 Bremer and 100 %
7
8 132 bootstrap support versus 12/14 Bremer and 94 % bootstrap support, respectively. The clade
9
10 133 Luciferidae was divided into Lucifer (9 Bremer and 99 % bootstrap supportssupport) and
11
12 134 Belzebub (7 Bremer and 99 % bootstrap supportssupport). Within Acetidae, a single clade Acetes
13
14 135 marinus + Acetes paraguayensis received high Bremer (4) and bootstrap (92 %) supportssupport.
15
16 136 Within the clade Sicyonellidae + Petalidiumidae + Sergestidae, Sicyonellidae was sister to
17
18 137 Petalidiumidae + Sergestidae, both were robust: 6 Bremer and 80 % bootstrap support versus 25
19
138 Bremer and 99 % bootstrap support, respectively. Within Sicyonellidae, the clade Sicyonella
20
21 139 antennata + Sicyonella maldivensis received high Bremer (6) and bootstrap (98 %)
22
23 140 supportssupport.
24
25 141 Petalidiumidae was sister to Sergestidae, both were robust: 12 Bremer and 100 % bootstrap
26
27 142 support versus 12 Bremer and 91 % bootstrap support, respectively. Petalidiumidae was not
28
29 143 resolved, whilst the Sergestidae received significant resolution.
30
31 144 Sergestidae included several major robust major clades (Fig. 3): (1) Neosergestes +
32
145 Parasergestes, (2) Allosergestes + Deosergestes, (3) eight genera of the former Sergia
33
34 146 (Vereshchaka et al., 2014)[4] with the root "sergia", (4) seven genera of the former Sergia
35
36 147 (Vereshchaka et al., 2014[4]) with the exception of Sergia, and (5) Lucensosergia+
37
38 148 Challengerosergia. All generic clades were robust (15 genera with minimal Bremer and
39
40 149 bootstrap support 3 and 86 %, respectively) but not further resolved at species levels. Inter-
41
42 150 generic phylogenetic relationships were resolved only partly.

157 Petalidiumidae and Sergestidae with most included genus-level clades were robust (Appendix

8 158 5Suppl. 1). Acetidae, Luciferidae, and Sicyonellidae were not supported; both genera of
9
10 159 Luciferidae were robust. The CsG values, indicating contribution of general external characters in
11
12 160 the clade support, were positive for Acetidae, Luciferidae, Sicyonellidae and for two genera of
13
14 161 Sergestidae: Parasergestes and Allosergestes (Fig. 4). The CdG metrics, showing contribution of
15
16 162 general external characters to speciation within the genera, were positive for Deosergestes and
17
18 163 Petalidium (Fig. 4).
19
164 If only copulatory characters were included in the analysis, Petalidiumidae and both genera of
20
21 165 Luciferidae were supported (Appendix 6Suppl. 2). If all but copulatory characters were included,
22
23 166 all the clades were robust except Belzebub, Challengerosergia, and Robustosergia (Appendix
24
25 167 6Suppl. 2). The CsC values were positive only for both genera of Luciferidae, while the CdC
26
27 168 metrics were positive for Acetes, Lucifer, Belzebub, Neosergestes, and Challengerosergia (Fig.
28
29 169 4).
30
31 170 If only photophores were included in the analysis, only four genera of Sergestidae were robust:
32
171 Challengerosergia, Lucensosergia, Gardinerosergia, and Phorcosergia (Appendix 7Suppl. 3).
33
34 172 Yet cConversely, these clades were the only unsupported clades, if all characters but
35
36 173 photophores are included (Appendix 7Suppl. 3). The CsPh values were positive for the same four
37
38 174 genera of Sergestidae, whilst the CdPh metric was positive for Lucensosergia only (Fig. 4).

44 177 The retrieved clades Acetidae, Luciferidae, Sicyonellidae and part of Sergestidae
45
178 (Cornutosergestes) are epipelagic [3, 4, 10, 11], three generic clades within these clades (Acetes,
46
47 179 Belzebub, and Sicyonella) are neritic/estuarine and one species of Acetes is even freshwater [10,

181 Most clades of Sergestidae encompasssergestids are mesopelagic oceanic interzonal species,
7
8 182 which migrate diurnally. Three genera, Challengerosergia, Lucensosergia, and Scintillosergia
9
10 183 are benthopelagic and associated with continental slopes and seamounts [2-4] (Fig. 4).
11
12 184 The clade Petalidiumidae and the clade genus Sergia of Sergestidae are bathypelagic [2, 4, 9]

18 187 4. Discussion.
19
188 4.1. The major clades and a new classification of Sergestoidea
20
21 189 All generic clades, which have been phylogenetically tested in previous studies; mMany of
22
23 190 previously tested genus-level clades receive even better statistical support than before [7-104, 9-
24
25 191 11].
26
27 192 Our data show that the family Luciferidae is a natural taxongroup, whilst the remainder rest of Formatted: English (U.S.)
28
29 193 Sergestoidea, previously considered as the family Sergestidae, is not monophyletic and includes
30
31 194 four basal monophyletic clades with a good support: Acetidae, Sicyonellidae, Petalidiumidae,
32
195 and Sergestidae (Fig. 3).
33
34 196 Here we designate three new families of Sergestoidea (in addition to the previously established
35
36 197 Luciferidae and Sergestidae): Acetidae, Sicyonellidae, and Petalidiumidae. Their type genera,
37
38 198 emended diagnoses, synapomorphies, and composition are provided in Table 2. Their emended
39
40 199 diagnoses, composition, and keys to genera and families are given in Appendix 8. From the
41
42 200 carcinological viewpoint, these families most remarkably differ in the morphology of the
43
44 201 copulatory structures. Luciferidae have no clasping organ at all, Acetidae have two clasping
45
202 tubercles (one may be reduced) and opposed claw-like setae, Sergestidae have a single clasping
46
47 203 tubercle and opposed serrated bristles, Sicyonellidae have a row of serrated bristles and no
48
49 204 tubercle, while Petalidiumidae have two opposed rows of serrated bristles (one of each replaces
50
51 205 the tubercle). The general topology of petasma is very characteristic for each family. Luciferidae
52
53 206 have a petasma without pars astringens, pars externa is transformed into a sheath around

207 processus ventralis. In Acetidae, the petasma is often lacking pars astringens, the capitulum has
7
8 208 no well-developed lobes and processeslobi and processi. Sergestidae have all parts of the Formatted: English (U.S.)
9
10 209 petasma developed and usually undivided. Sicyonellidae (with an exception of S. inermis) and
11
12 210 Petalidiumidae have the most complex petasma with all parts present and the secondarily divided
13
14 211 processus ventralis.
15
16 212 Other significant distinguishing characters include widely separated labrum and antennae and the
17
18 213 absence of true chela in Luciferidae; rudimentary chelae of first to third pereopods and very
19
214 reduced/absent natatory pereopods in Acetidae; well-developed chelae on first to third pereopods
20
21 215 and a complete set of segments on natatory pereopods in Sicyonellidae; luminous organs (in
22
23 216 fourteen of fifteen genera) in Sergestidae.

26
27 218 4.2. The distribution of characters.
28
29 219 External body characters are mostly homoplasious homoplasies and have evolved independently: Formatted: English (U.S.)
30
31 220 the armature of the carapace and grasping appendages, reduction of the natatory pereopods, etc.
32
221 Membranous integument also independently evolved in such distant deep-sea clades as
33
34 222 Petalidium and Sergia, probably as an adaptation to the deep-sea life of these genera (Fig. 3).
35
36 223 The clasping copulatory organ represents homoplasy: this organ independently evolved in
37
38 224 Acetidae, Sicyonellidae, Petalidiumidae, and Sergestidae and morphologically differs between
39
40 225 these clades. The elaborated petasma is a synapomorphy of Sergestoidea; further evolution of
41
42 226 this organ, including elaboration or loss of numerous lobes and processeslobi and processi, Formatted: English (U.S.)
43
44 227 occurs in all clades and is linked to the synapomorphies supporting families and genera.
45
228 Such photophores as the organs of Pesta are homoplasioushomoplasies: they evolved Formatted: English (U.S.)
46
47 229 independently in several genera and have different histological structure [63, 74]. Conversely,
48
49 230 dermal photophores evolved once in a single clade and were further either lost (reversal in
50
51 231 Sergia) or elaborated and possessed lens (homoplasies) in Prehensilosergia, Scintillosergia,

11
12 235 4.3. Contribution of different character types to the phylogeny of Sergestoidea.
13
14 236 All character types have significantly contributed into to the support of revealed clades, as an
15
16 237 exclusion of any character type significantly impacts the resolution of the treemakes the tree Formatted: English (U.S.)
17
18 238 much less well resolved.
19
239 General external characters are the most important for support of the major (family-level)
20
21 240 clades: four families remain supported if only this type is used in the analysis (Appendix 5Suppl.
22
23 241 1). General external characters, however, are insufficient to support Sergestidae. Acetidae,
24
25 242 Luciferidae, and Sicyonellidae are especially sensitive to the absence of general external
26
27 243 characters and collapse if this type is not included in the analysis.
28
29 244 General external characters significantly contribute to support of nearly half of the genera
30
31 245 (Appendix 5Suppl. 1). They are most important (positive CsG) for the Parasergestes and
32
246 Allosergestes, in which synapomorphies are associated with the catching appendages (third
33
34 247 maxilliped and the second to third pereopods) and illustrate offensive strategy of Sergestidae
35
36 248 [74]. Further speciation within these genera (negative CdG) is not dependant on this type of
37
38 249 characters.
39
40 250 General external characters are significant in speciation of Petalidium and Deosergestes and
41
42 251 associated with development of branchs (Petalidium occurs in waters with significantly different
43
44 252 oxygen concentrations [74]) or catching appendages (Deosergestes illustrating offensive strategy
45
253 [74]).
46
47 254 Copulatory characters do not provide significant support for any of the five major clades. Only
48
49 255 three genera, Lucifer, Belzebub, and Petalidium, receive statistical support if only this type is
50
51 256 included in the analysis (Appendix 6Suppl. 2). The absence of copulatory characters in the
52
53 257 analysis does not change the robustness of the tree significantly (Appendix 6Suppl. 2). Positive

258 CsC values confirm the contribution of copulatory characters in the support of Lucifer and

8 259 Belzebub. The copulatory characters (positive CdC) significantly contribute to speciation within
9
10 260 Lucifer, Belzebub, Neosergestes, and Challengerosergia. The copulatory characters appear not to
11
12 261 be critical in the colonization of the major pelagic habitats; instead, they may provide promote
13
14 262 sexual isolation during invasion of different parts of the epipelagic (oceanic Lucifer and neritic
15
16 263 Belzebub) and mesopelagic (pelagic Neosergestes and benthopelagic Challengerosergia)
17
18 264 biotopes.
19
265 Photophores, like copulatory characters, do not provide significant support of any family-level
20
21 266 clades. Four genera, Lucensosergia, Challengerosergia, Gardinerosergia, and Phorcosergia,
22
23 267 receive statistical support if only this type is included in the analysis (Appendix 7Suppl. 3). The
24
25 268 absence of photophores in the dataset does not change the robustness of the consensus tree
26
27 269 significantly (Appendix 7Suppl. 3). Positive CsPh and CdPh values confirm the contribution of
28
29 270 photophores to the support of the four genera above and to speciation within Lucensosergia.
30
31 271
32
272 4.4. The pathways into principal oceanic biotopes.
33
34 273 The classical schema of vertical zonation of the pelagic ocean includes several vertical zones
35
36 274 [1415]. First is the epipelagic (0 – 200 m), in which there is enough sunlight during daytime to
37
38 275 support primary production. Second is the mesopelagic zone, that receives enough solar
39
40 276 illumination for the fauna to differentiate diurnal and nocturnal cycles, but not enough to support
41
42 277 photosynthesis; in the plankton research, this zone is usually associated with the main pycnocline
43
44 278 with the lower boundary normally ranging from 500 to 900 m [47, 1516]. Third is the Formatted: Not Highlight
45
279 bathypelagic zone below the main pycnocline, with relative invariance of light, temperature, and
46
47 280 salinity [1415] and a lower boundary at a depth of 3000 m. These zones may be further divided
48
49 281 in horizontal direction. The epipelagic is traditionally divided into the oceanic zone and the
50
51 282 neritic zone including the shallow waters from the littoral zone to the edge of the continental
52
53 283 shelf. The meso- and bathypelagic zones around continental slopes and seamounts are replaced

284 by the benthopelagic zone, where specific bottom-related fauna makes up over 50% of the total
7
8 285 plankton biomass [1617].
9
10 286 Each major (family-level) clade occurs only within one of these basic vertical zones (Fig. 4).
11
12 287 Acetidae, Luciferidae, and Sicyonellidae are epipelagic and the main synapomorphies supporting
13
14 288 these clades are linked to spination/shape of body and to natatory appendages. Spination of the
15
16 289 body is assumed to have related to defensive defense function, while shape of body shape and Formatted: English (U.S.)
17 Formatted: English (U.S.)
18 290 natatory appendages favour escape function [74]; both are critical in the epipelagic where
19
291 shelters are absent and carnivores are abundant [4].
20
21 292 Sergestidae is mesopelagic and encompasses genera, which are supported by synapomorphies
22
23 293 linked to luminous organs (the organ of Pesta or dermal photophores). The photophores tilt to
24
25 294 maintain their downward orientation no matter which way the animal is swimming [1718] and
26
27 295 may thus provide ventral camouflage [1819]. The photophores in mesopelagic Sergestidae may
28
29 296 also be of schooling aid: adults have well-developed photophores and form shoals [74] and their
30
31 297 visual systems are tuned to detect bioluminescence [19, 2020, 21], while earlier stages are
32
298 lacking photophores, scattered, and have different characteristics of visual systems [1920]. The
33
34 299 evolution of the photophores may thus be critical for the invasion of the mesopelagic.
35
36 300 Petalidiumidae and Sergia (Sergestidae) are bathypelagic (Fig.4). They have membranous
37
38 301 integument and fatty tissues, they lack photophores (not evolved in Petalidiumidae and lost in
39
40 302 Sergia) that may illustrate possible adaptations to minimization of energy loss in the deep-sea
41
42 303 depleted in food.
43
44 304 Some major (family-level) clades further diverge and colonize different habitats within the same
45
305 vertical zone. The epipelagic Luciferidae is split into the oceanic Lucifer and the neritic
46
47 306 Belzebub. The mesopelagic Sergestidae encompasses eleven oceanic and three benthopelagic
48
49 307 genera (Fig. 4), which form a robust monophyletic clade Challengerosergia+Lucensosergia+
50
51 308 Lucensosergia. The clade is supported by such a synapomorphy as thick lens on dermal

309 photophores, which may favour communication in the dim nepheloid layer associated with the
7
8 310 benthopelagic habitat [1617].
9
10 311 Exact geological timings for colonization of different biotopes are difficult to assess due to
11
12 312 absence of the molecular clock data and poor fossilization of planktonic shrimps. Colonization of
13
14 313 the meso- and bathypelagic more likely occurred since the end of the Mesozoic, when deep
15
16 314 waters were well ventilated. High primary productivity followed deep-ocean ventilation since the
17
18 315 Eocene–Oligocene boundary [22, 23] and favored colonization of the deep sea. Recent studies
19
316 have shown that the deep-sea mesoplankton and shrimps respond to variations in surface
20
21 317 productivity and their biomass in the meso- and even bathypelagic is correlated with the
22
23 318 averaged surface chlorophyll [24, 25]. Thus, colonization of the deep sea could be promoted by
24
25 319 both oxygenization and increased flux of organic matter from the euphotic zone. The end of the
26
27 320 Mesozoic was important for colonization of the pelagic by other groups such as shallow-living
28
29 321 cetaceans [26, 17] and deep-sea copepods [28].
30
31 322 Colonization of the epipelagic could be influenced by climate change more directly. For
32
323 example, climate change after middle of Eocene in American side could cause immigration of
33
34 324 tropical and subtropical species of Acetes to equatorial latitudes and forced the equatorial species Formatted: Font: Italic
35
36 325 to take refuges in fresh waters [29].
37
38 326 In conclusion, we propose an evolutionary model of Sergestoidea showing their pathways into
39
40 327 their principal biotopes (Fig. 5). The basal (family level) clades appear to have diverged could Formatted: English (U.S.)
41
42 328 diverge in vertical direction, colonized water column from surface to a depth of nearly 3000 m.
43
44 329 Further, each of these clades evolved within the same vertical range; the divergence at the genus
45
330 level, if any, occurred only within a fixed vertical zone in horizontal direction, with the invasion
46
47 331 of the benthopelagic and neritic (shelf and estuarine) habitats. The speciation within the genera
48
49 332 occurred mainly within fixed vertical and horizontal habitats (Fig. 5), mostly sympatrically [74].
50
51 333 Greatly elaborated copulatory morphology (clasping organ and petasma) could favor sexual
52
53 334 isolation between sympatric species.

7 Abstract
8 The phylogenetic analysis of Sergestoidea based on 253 morphological characters and
9 encompassing all 99 valid species confirmed all previously recognized genus-level clades.
10 Analysis retrieved five major robust clades, which correspond to families Luciferidae,
11 Sergestidae, Acetidae fam.n., Sicyonellidae fam.n., and Petalidiumidae fam.n. Synonymy,
12 emended diagnoses, and composition of revealed family-level clades were provided. Three types
13 of morphological characters were important in phylogeny of the Sergestoidea: general external
14 characters, copulatory organs, and photophores. Novel metrics to quantify the contribution of
15 these character types were tested. General external characters were significant in a supporting of
16 the major clades (80 % of the families and nearly half of the genera). Copulatory organ Comment [RW1]: Suggest insert organ so this
won’t be interpreted as behaviour.
17 characters and photophores greatly supported the medium-level clades: Lucifer, Belzebub,
18 Petalidium, Neosergestes, Challengerosergia (copulatory organ characters) and Lucenso sergia,
19 Challengerosergia, Gardinerosergia, Phorcosergia (photophores). An evolutionary model of the
20 Sergestoidea showing their pathways into their principal biotopes is proposed: the major clades
21 evolved in a vertical direction (from epi- to bathypelagic); further divergence at the genus level
22 occurred within a vertical zones in a horizontal direction, with the invasion of the benthopelagic
23 and neritic (shelf and estuarine) habitats and speciation within these domains.

27 1. Introduction
28 The order Decapoda includes two suborders, Pleocyemata and Dendrobranchiata, the latter
29 encompassing two superfamilies, Sergestoidea and Penaeoidea. The Sergestoidea hereby
30 represents a significant part of the decapod phylogenetic tree, whilst phylogeny and even
31 taxonomy (e.g., the proper position of Lucifer) within this superfamily remains unclear [1], ].
32 This is partly because of the entangled systematics of two speciose groups (genera) in the family
33 Sergestidae (see details in [2-4]), previously known as Sergestes and Sergia (over 70 species).
34 Species of the Sergestidae are among the most common in many marine ecosystems and
35 important objects of fisheries in some areas [5-7]. Despite their importance, the Sergestoidea are
36 still poorly understood with regard to higher level classification and phylogenetic relationships.
37 During the last two decades, intensive studies of these two the Sergestes and Sergia groups have
38 resulted in two morphological revisions [2, 3] and further phylogenetic revisions, which have
39 yielded 8 new genera [4, 8]. The revision of the other genera of Sergestidae, e.g. i.e. Petalidium,
40 Acetes, Peisos, and Sicyonella, was made later and showed the monophyly of these genera and
41 the synonymy of Acetes and Peisos [9, 10]. Finally, scanning electron microscopy of the
42 Luciferidae has allowed an estimation of homologies between copulatory structures of this
43 family and the rest of the Sergestoidea that has in turn enabled resulted in a phylogenetic
44 revision of the genus Lucifer and splitting this genus into two monophyletic genera, Lucifer and
45 Belzebub [11].
46 The phylogenetic study of the whole Sergestoidea at species level needs to can now be
47 completed to by assemble assembling the rich dataset of morphological characters (~250) that
48 have been coded during previous studies,. The phylogenetic analysis of the whole family at
49 species level and this is the first objective of this paper.
50 Most previous phylogenetic analyses in various groups of Sergestoidea have led to changes in
51 the classification and taxonomy at the genus level. The robustness of the revealed genus clades
52 may now be tested on a richer material and new clades of the genus or family levels may be
53 found. Therefore, the second objective of this paper is to establish a natural phylogenetic
54 classification of the superfamily and to provide emended diagnoses/keys for the major taxa.
55 Previous studies have shown that the Sergestoidea is a group exhibiting independent
56 phylogenetic traits in three types of morphological characters [4, 10, 11]: (1) general external
57 characters typical for most crustaceans, (2) copulatory characters related to a spermatophore
58 transfer and fixing grasping of the female (male clasping organ and petasma), and (3)
59 photophores. The third objective of the paper is to assess the contribution of these character
60 types to the robustness of the clades.
61 Finally, the Sergestoidea is a group widely distributed in all temperate and tropical waters and at
62 different depth strata, from epi- to bathypelagic. The last objective of this paper is to assess
63 evolutionary scenarios including the colonization of principal oceanic biotopes.

65 2. Material and methods.
66 2.1. Morphological analysis
67 The material used for this study is from the extensive collections of pelagic crustaceans taken
68 during the Danish “Dana I” (1920-22) and “Dana II” (1928-30) Expeditions stored at the Natural
69 History Museum of Denmark; some type specimens were requested from other Museums
70 (Appendix 1). All valid species of Sergestoidea have been included as terminal taxa, with
71 updated synonymyies (Appendix 2). As outgroups we tested two species of the sister
72 superfamily Penaeoidea, pelagic Gennadas parvus Spence Bate, 1881 (family Benthesicymidae)
73 and benthic Penaeus monodon Fabricius, 1798 (Penaeidae). Character state scoring for each
74 species was derived from examination of the type material (Appendix 1).
75 We used the characters described and figured in a series of preceding papers [4, 9-11], a total of
76 253 edited characters (Appendix 3) for 101 terminal taxa, . tThe data matrix is presented in
77 Appendix 4.
78 Characters were divided into three groups (Fig. 1): (1) general external characters (0-115,; here Comment [RW2]: NB: Fig 1 F is missing.
79 and below, numbers in the parenthesis after characters indicate the position of characters in Comment [RW3]: Useful comma
80 Appendix 3), (2) copulatory organs (116-189) including the petasma and the clasping organ
81 (modified part of Antenna I) y, and (3) photophores (190-248). All characters were unordered
82 (non-additive) and equally weighted, missing data were scored unknown.
83 Data were handled and analyzed using a combination of programs and maximum parsimony
84 (MP) settings: Winclada/Nona, NDE (Nexus Data Editor), and TNT [12-14].Trees were
85 generated in TNT with 30000 trees in memory, under the "traditional search" mode with the
86 following settings: 150 replicates, 200 trees to save per replication and 10000 replicates, 200
87 trees to save per replication. Relative stability of clades was assessed by standard bootstrapping
88 (sample with replacement) with 10000 pseudoreplicates and by Bremer support (algorithm TBR,
89 saving up to 10000 trees up to 3 steps longer). We I considered the clades statistically Comment [RW4]: Only one author
90 significant if they were simultaneously supported by the bootstrap values 80 % and by the
91 Bremer values 3.
92
93 2.2. Novel metrics to quantify contribution of a character type to the clade support and
94 divergence within a clade.
95 In order to quantify the contribution (C), of a character type i to a support (S) of a selected clade,
96 a new metric Csi = Si+ - Si-, (Fig. 2) is offered, where Si+ is a support of the clade, if only the type
97 i characters are included in the matrix, Si- is the support of the clade, if all but the type i
98 characters are included in the matrix. If Csi is positive, the type i characters positively contribute
99 to the clade support; greater Csi values indicate greater contribution. We I use the Csi metric to
100 assess the contribution of different character types to support of the clades at the genus and
101 family levels: CsG for general (G) external characters, CsC for copulatory (C) organs, and CsPh
102 for photophores (Ph).
103 For example, we I tested the contribution of external characters (G) as follows. - Step 1: we I
104 include only this character type in the matrix and calculate a clade support SG+. Step 2: we I use
105 another matrix with all BUT external characters included and calculate the clade support SG-.
106 Step 3: we I calculate CsG = SG+ - SG- and thus see how the clade support has changed. If the
107 clade support decreases (CsG negative), external characters contribute positively. If the clade
108 support increases, external characters contribute negatively and erode the phylogenetic tree.
109 In order to quantify the contribution (C), of a character type i to a divergence (D) within a clade,
110 a new metric Cdi = Di+/(n-1) - Di-/(n-1) is offered (Fig. 2), where Di+ is a sum of support in
111 resolved branches within the clade, if only the type i characters are included in the matrix, Di- is
112 a sum of support in resolved branches within the clade, if all but the type i characters are
113 included in the matrix, n is a number of terminal taxa within the clade. If Cdi is positive, the type
114 i characters positively contribute to divergence within the clade; greater Cd values indicate
115 greater contribution. We I use the Cdi metric to assess the contribution of different character
116 types to the divergence of the clades at the genus levels, e.g. to speciation: CdG for general
117 external characters, CdC for copulatory organs, and , CdPh for photophores. Both Csi and Cdi
118 metrics are calculated on the basis of the Bremer and bootstrap support. If any of calculations
119 gives a positive result, a contribution of a type i characters is considered to be positive.
120 Clade support was calculated using the same combination of programs and the same settings as
121 in morphological analysis.

123 3. Results
124 3.1. The consensus tree and supported clades.
125 Both analyses with Gennadas parvus and Penaeus monodon as outgroups retrieved 240 minimal
126 length trees, with 470 and 467 steps, respectively. The topologies of both strict consensus trees
127 were identical and support of the clades was ere also identical or very similar (Fig. 3). Two
128 major sister clades were revealed: Acetidae + Luciferidae and Sicyonellidae + Petalidiumidae +
129 Sergestidae. The first clade received high Bremer (20) and bootstrap (83 %) support, whilst the
130 second clade received only Bremer support (12/13).
131 The clade Luciferidae was sister to Acetidae, both were robust: 33/34 Bremer and 100 %
132 bootstrap support versus and 12/14 Bremer and 94 % bootstrap support, respectively. The clade
133 Luciferidae was divided into Lucifer (9 Bremer and 99 % bootstrap support) and Belzebub (7
134 Bremer and 99 % bootstrap support). Within Acetidae, a single clade Acetes marinus + Acetes
135 paraguayensis received high Bremer (4) and bootstrap (92 %) support.
136 Within the clade Sicyonellidae + Petalidiumidae + Sergestidae, Sicyonellidae was sister to
137 Petalidiumidae + Sergestidae, and both were robust: 6 Bremer and 80 % bootstrap support versus
138 25 Bremer and 99 % bootstrap support, respectively. Within Sicyonellidae, the clade Sicyonella
139 antennata + Sicyonella maldivensis received high Bremer (6) and bootstrap (98 %) support.
140 Petalidiumidae was sister to Sergestidae, and both were robust: 12 Bremer and 100 % bootstrap
141 support versus 12 Bremer and 91 % bootstrap support, respectively. Petalidiumidae was not
142 resolved, whilst the Sergestidae received significant resolution.
143 The Sergestidae included several robust major clades (Fig. 3): (1) Neosergestes + Parasergestes,
144 (2) Allosergestes + Deosergestes, (3) eight genera of the former Sergia [4], seven with the root
145 "sergia", (4) seven genera of the former Sergia [4]) with the exception of Sergia, and (5)
146 Lucensosergia+ Challengerosergia. All generic clades were robust (15 genera with minimal
147 Bremer and bootstrap support 3 and 86 %, respectively) but not further resolved at species levels.
148 Inter-generic phylogenetic relationships were resolved only partly.
149
150 3.2. The contribution of different character types in to the clade support and speciation.
151 If only general external characters were included in the matrix, the clades corresponding to
152 Acetidae, Luciferidae, Sicyonellidae and, Petalidiumidae were robust; all genus-level clades
153 were supported except Belzebub. The Sergestidae and approximately half of the included genus-
154 level clades were not resolved (Appendix 5). If all but general external characters were included,
155 Petalidiumidae and Sergestidae with most included genus-level clades were robust (Appendix 5). Comment [RW5]: Correct bold/non-bold support
numbers in Appendixes 5 – 7
156 Acetidae, Luciferidae, and Sicyonellidae were not supported; both genera of Luciferidae were
157 robust. The CsG values, indicating contribution of general external characters in the clade
158 support, were positive for Acetidae, Luciferidae, Sicyonellidae and for two genera of
159 Sergestidae: Parasergestes and Allosergestes (Fig. 4). The CdG metrics, showing the
160 contribution of general external characters to speciation within the genera, were positive for
161 Deosergestes and Petalidium (Fig. 4).
162 If only copulatory organ characters were included in the analysis, Petalidiumidae and both
163 genera of Luciferidae were supported (Appendix 6). If all but copulatory characters were
164 included, all the clades were robust except Belzebub, Challengerosergia, and Robustosergia
165 (Appendix 6). The CsC values were positive only for both genera of Luciferidae, while the CdC
166 metrics were positive for Acetes, Lucifer, Belzebub, Neosergestes, and Challengerosergia (Fig.
167 4).
168 If only photophores were included in the analysis, only four genera of Sergestidae were robust:
169 Challengerosergia, Lucensosergia, Gardinerosergia, and Phorcosergia (Appendix 7).
170 Conversely, these clades were the only unsupported clades, if all characters but photophores are
171 included (Appendix 7). The CsPh values were positive for the same four genera of Sergestidae,
172 whilst the CdPh metric was positive for Lucensosergia only (Fig. 4).
173
174 3.3. The distribution of the clades in the main oceanic habitats.
175 The retrieved clades Acetidae, Luciferidae, Sicyonellidae and part of Sergestidae
176 (Cornutosergestes) are epipelagic [3, 4, 10, 11], three generic clades within these clades (Acetes,
177 Belzebub, and Sicyonella) are neritic and one species of Acetes is even freshwater [10, 11] (Fig.
178 4).
179 Most sergestids are mesopelagic oceanic interzonal species, which migrate diurnally (Fig 4).
180 Three genera, Challengerosergia, Lucensosergia, and Scintillosergia are benthopelagic and Comment [RW6]: New paragraph?
181 associated with continental slopes and seamounts [2-4] (Fig. 4).
182 Petalidiumidae and the genus Sergia of Sergestidae are bathypelagic [2, 4, 9] (Fig. 4).
183
184 4. Discussion.
185 4.1. The major clades and a new classification of Sergestoidea
186 Many previously tested genus-level clades receive even better statistical support than before [4,
187 9-11]. Our The present data show that the family Luciferidae is a natural group, whilst the
188 remainder of the Sergestoidea, previously considered as called the family Sergestidae, is not
189 monophyletic and includes four basal monophyletic clades with a good support: Acetidae,
190 Sicyonellidae, Petalidiumidae, and Sergestidae (Fig. 3).
191 Here we designate t Three new families of Sergestoidea are designated here (in addition to the
192 previously established Luciferidae and Sergestidae): Acetidae, Sicyonellidae, and
193 Petalidiumidae. Their emended diagnoses, composition, and keys to genera and families are
194 given in Appendix 8. From the carcinological viewpoint, these families most remarkably differ
195 in the morphology of the copulatory structures. Luciferidae have no clasping organ at all,
196 Acetidae have two clasping tubercles (one may be reduced) and opposed claw-like setae,
197 Sergestidae have a single clasping tubercle and opposed serrated bristles, Sicyonellidae have a
198 row of serrated bristles and no tubercle, while Petalidiumidae have two opposed rows of serrated
199 bristles (one of each replaces the tubercle). The general topology of the petasma is very
200 characteristic for each family. The Luciferidae have a petasma without pars astringens, the pars
201 externa is transformed into a sheath around processus ventralis. In the Acetidae, the petasma is
202 often lacking a pars astringens, and the capitulum has no developed lobes and processes. The
203 Sergestidae have all parts of the petasma developed and usually undivided. The Sicyonellidae
204 (with an the exception of S. inermis) and the Petalidiumidae have the most complex petasma
205 with all parts present and the a secondarily divided processus ventralis.
206 Other significant distinguishing characters include widely separated labrum and antennae and the
207 absence of true chela in the Luciferidae; rudimentary chelae of the first to third pereopods and
208 very reduced/absent natatory pereopods in the Acetidae; well-developed chelae on the first to
209 third pereopods and a complete set of segments on the natatory pereopods in the Sicyonellidae;
210 luminous organs (in fourteen of fifteen genera) in the Sergestidae.
211
212 4.2. The distribution of characters.
213 External body characters are mostly homoplasious and have evolved independently: the armature
214 of the carapace and grasping appendages, reduction of the natatory pereopods, etc. The M
215 membranous integument also independently evolved in such distant deep-sea clades as
216 Petalidium and Sergia, probably as an adaptation to the deep-sea life of these genera (Fig. 3).
217 The clasping copulatory organ also represents homoplasy: this organ independently evolved in
218 Acetidae, Sicyonellidae, Petalidiumidae, and Sergestidae and morphologically differs between
219 these clades. On the other hand, Tthe elaborated petasma is a synapomorphy of Sergestoidea;
220 further evolution of this organ, including elaboration or loss of numerous lobes and processes,
221 occurs in all clades and is linked to the synapomorphies supporting families and genera.
222 Such photophores as the organs of Pesta are homoplasious: they evolved independently in
223 several genera and have different histological structures [3, 4]. Conversely, dermal photophores
224 evolved once in a single clade and were further subsequently either lost (reversal in Sergia) or
225 elaborated and possessed lenses (homoplasies) in Prehensilosergia, Scintillosergia,
226 Lucensosergia, and Challengerosergia, probably as an adaptation to the benthopelagic habitat of
227 these genera.
228
229 4.3. Contribution of different character types to the phylogeny of Sergestoidea.
230 All character types have significantly contributed to the support of the revealed clades, as
231 exclusion of any character type significantly impacts upon the resolution of the tree.
232 General external characters are the most important for support of the major (family-level)
233 clades: four families remain supported if only this type is used in the analysis (Appendix 5).
234 General external characters, however, are insufficient to support the Sergestidae. Acetidae,
235 Luciferidae, and Sicyonellidae are especially sensitive to the absence of general external
236 characters and collapse if this type is not included in the analysis.
237 General external characters significantly contribute to support of nearly half of the genera
238 (Appendix 5). They are most important (positive CsG) for the Parasergestes and Allosergestes, in
239 which synapomorphies are associated with the catching appendages (third maxilliped and the
240 second to third pereopods) and illustrate offensive strategy of Sergestidae [4]. Further speciation
241 within these genera (negative CdG) is not dependant on this type of characters.
242 General external characters are significant in the speciation of Petalidium and Deosergestes and
243 associated with development of branchsiae (Petalidium occurs in waters with significantly
244 different oxygen concentrations [4]) or catching appendages (Deosergestes illustrating offensive
245 feeding strategy [4]).
246 Copulatory characters do not provide significant support for any of the five major clades. Only
247 three genera, Lucifer, Belzebub, and Petalidium, receive statistical support if only this type is
248 included in the analysis (Appendix 6). The absence of copulatory characters in the analysis does
249 not change the robustness of the tree significantly (Appendix 6). Positive CsC values confirm the
250 contribution of copulatory characters in the support of Lucifer and Belzebub. The c Copulatory
251 organ characters (positive CdC) significantly contribute to speciation within Lucifer, Belzebub,
252 Neosergestes, and Challengerosergia. The copulatory characters appear not to be critical in the
253 colonization of the major pelagic habitats; instead, they may promote sexual isolation during
254 invasion of different parts of the epipelagic (oceanic Lucifer and neritic Belzebub) and
255 mesopelagic (pelagic Neosergestes and benthopelagic Challengerosergia) biotopes.
256 Photophores, like copulatory characters, do not provide significant support of any family-level
257 clades. Four genera, Lucensosergia, Challengerosergia, Gardinerosergia, and Phorcosergia,
258 receive statistical support if only this type is included in the analysis (Appendix 73). The absence
259 of photophores in the dataset does not change the robustness of the consensus tree significantly
260 (Appendix 7). Positive CsPh and CdPh values confirm the contribution of photophores to the
261 support of the four genera above and to speciation within Lucensosergia.
262
263 4.4. The pathways into principal oceanic biotopes.
264 The classical schema of vertical zonation of the pelagic ocean includes several vertical zones
265 [15]. First is the epipelagic (0 – 200 m), in which there is enough sunlight during daytime to
266 support primary production. Second is the mesopelagic zone, that receives enough solar
267 illumination for the fauna to differentiate diurnal and nocturnal cycles, but not enough to support
268 photosynthesis; in the plankton research, this zone is usually associated with the main pycnocline
269 with the lower boundary normally ranging from 500 to 900 m [7, 16]. Third is the bathypelagic
270 zone below the main pycnocline, with relative invariance of light, temperature, and salinity [15]
271 and a lower boundary at a depth of 3000 m. These zones may be further divided in horizontally.
272 direction. The epipelagic is traditionally divided into the oceanic zone and the neritic zone
273 including the shallow waters from the littoral zone to the edge of the continental shelf. The
274 meso- and bathypelagic zones around continental slopes and seamounts are replaced adjacent to
275 the sea-floor by the benthopelagic zone, where specific bottom-related fauna makes up over 50%
276 of the total plankton biomass [17].
277 In the Sergestoidea E each major (family-level) clade occurs only within one of these basic main
278 vertical zones (Fig. 4). Acetidae, Luciferidae, and Sicyonellidae are epipelagic and the main
279 synapomorphies supporting these clades are linked to spination/shape of body, and to natatory
280 appendages. Spination of the body is assumed to have a defensive function, while body shape
281 and natatory appendages favour an escape function [4]; both are critical in the epipelagic where
282 shelters are absent and carnivores are abundant [4].
283 The Sergestidae is mesopelagic and encompasses genera, which are supported by
284 synapomorphies linked to luminous organs (the organ of Pesta or dermal photophores). The
285 photophores tilt to maintain their downward orientation no matter which way the animal is
286 swimming [18] and may thus provide ventral camouflage [19]. The photophores in mesopelagic
287 Sergestidae may also be of a schooling aid: adults have well-developed photophores and form
288 shoals [4] and their visual systems are tuned to detect bioluminescence [20, 21], while earlier
289 stages are lacking photophores, are scattered, and have different characteristics of their visual
290 systems [20]. The evolution of the photophores may thus be critical for the invasion of the
291 mesopelagic zone.
292 Petalidiumidae and Sergia (Sergestidae) are bathypelagic (Fig.4). They have membranous
293 integument and fatty tissues, they lack photophores (not evolved in Petalidiumidae and lost in
294 Sergia) that may illustrate possible adaptations to minimization of energy loss in the areas of
295 deep-sea depleted in food in the deep-sea.
296 Some major (family-level) clades further diverge and colonize different habitats within the same
297 vertical zone. The epipelagic Luciferidae is split into the oceanic Lucifer and the neritic
298 Belzebub. The mesopelagic Sergestidae encompasses eleven oceanic and three benthopelagic
299 genera (Fig. 4), which form a robust monophyletic clade Challengerosergia+Lucensosergia+
300 Lucensosergia Scintillosergia. The clade is supported by such a synapomorphy as thick lenses on
301 dermal photophores, which may favour communication in the dim nepheloid layer associated
302 with their benthopelagic habitat [17].
303 Exact geological timings for colonization of different biotopes are difficult to assess due to the
304 absence of the molecular clock data and poor fossilization of planktonic shrimps. Colonization
305 of the meso- and bathypelagic more most likely occurred since the end of the Mesozoic, when
306 deep waters were well ventilated. High primary productivity followed this deep-ocean
307 ventilation since the Eocene–Oligocene boundary [22, 23] and favored colonization of the deep
308 sea. Recent studies have shown that the deep-sea mesoplankton and shrimps respond to
309 variations in surface productivity and their biomass in the meso- and even bathypelagic is
310 correlated with the averaged surface chlorophyll [24, 25]. Thus, colonization of the deep sea
311 could be promoted by both oxygenization and an increased flux of organic matter from the
312 euphotic zone. This is supported by by the findings that T the end of the Mesozoic was important
313 for colonization of the pelagic by other groups such as shallow-living cetaceans [26, 17] and
314 deep-sea copepods [28].
315 Colonization of the epipelagic could be influenced by climate change more directly. For
316 example, climate change after the middle of the Eocene in the American side could cause
317 immigration of tropical and subtropical species of Acetes to equatorial latitudes and forced the
318 equatorial species to take refuges in fresh waters [29]. Comment [RW7]: Don’t understand this; is it the
American side of the Atlantic Ocean?
319 In conclusion, we I propose an evolutionary model of Sergestoidea showing their pathways into
320 their principal biotopes (Fig. 5). The basal (family level) clades appear to have diverged in
321 vertically direction, colonizeding the water column from the surface to a depth of nearly 3000 m.
322 Further, each of these clades evolved within the same vertical range; the divergence at the genus
323 level, if any, occurred only within a vertical zone, in horizontal directions, with the invasion of
324 the benthopelagic and neritic (shelf and estuarine) habitats. The speciation within the genera
325 occurred mainly within vertical and horizontal habitats (Fig. 5), mostly sympatrically [4].
326 Greatly elaborated copulatory morphology (clasping organ and petasma) could favor sexual
327 isolation between sympatric species.

s is a very interesting paper pulling together much previous work on the phylogeny of the
gestoidea. The analysis, which involves over 250 characters, is well executed and
onstrates that it is mainly in the external morphology that the various clades can be
arated. Specific taxa are resolved through copulatory organ morphology or photophore
sence / morphology. I found the description of the invasion of the deep sea and coastal
systems consistent with other studies and quite robust and logical.
thor: thank you.
re are a few areas of English that need improving.
thor: all suggested improvements are made.
use of downward-pointing photophores is called bioluminescent countershading. The
sence of visual predators rather than just carnivores in the epipelagic have driven the
lution of defensive structures and swimming in this zone. Metabolic rates of animals that live
his zone also tend to be high (visual predation hypothesis). I note there appears to be several
ances of convergent evolution here driven by adaptation to the same environmental drivers. It
ht be nice to note this.
thor: agree, and I have even published something on this subject. I feel deeper
ments on that is unnecessary within the present paper; instead, I am preparing a
cial paper where I consider evolutionary process on the basis of the phylogeny of
ious planktonic groups (made by me in recent years). Would be happy to be in touch
h you.
rections to English and other comments have been noted on the pdf as highlighted comments.

mments to the Author(s)
name is Richard Webber and I work as a Curator of Invertebrates, specialising in Crustacea,
he Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington, New Zealand. The responses
he author to the comments of Reviewers 1 and 2 are clear and reasoned, all their comments
considered and used thoughtfully, and most suggestions are followed.
holeheartedly agree with Reviewer 1 that this is a very good and useful study. It brings
ether and makes available previous work, much of it involving the author himself. It
siderably advances our knowledge of the Sergestoidea, historically one the most difficult
apod groups to resolve systematically. The manuscript is almost ready for publication but
isions and additions made following the assessments by Reviewers 1 & 2 have generated
e mistakes and omissions that need to be corrected or clarified.
thor: thank you.
rections and suggestions are provided in a Word copy of the manuscript and Appendixes 1 -
ttached) using tracked changes. Some comments also follow here along with notes on the
s.
thor: all suggested improvements are made.
1 F (uropodal exopod Allosergestes sargassi) is missing from Fig. 1.
thor: inserted
1 L label - note that the plural of lens is lenses.
thor: OK in this context, as considers a single organ with a single lens. Note you’re your
int friend Dr. Yaldwin used this term in his outstanding paper in 1957 and I completely
ow him (however, I used the plural in other cases in the text)
3. caption should include the group depicted e.g. 'The strict consensus tree and supported
des of species of Sergestoidea retrieved after analysis..' Also, last sentence needs a semicolon
napomorphies are identical and in blue; numbers refer to Appendix 3'.
thor: corrected
: as indicated elsewhere the boostrap values are bolded in Fig 3 but the opposite is the case in
pendixes 5 - 7
thor: OK
pendix 2. Lucifer species (Nos 5 - 7) authorities corrected. Suggest you check this for the
er spp. in this table.
thor: done
pendix 8. in title suggest 'New and emended diagnoses and keys....'
thor: done
remaining comments and suggestions are in tracked changes in the attached documents.
thor: everything is corrected
