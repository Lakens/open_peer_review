Dear Professor R. Kerry Rowe,

We have made a significant revision to the manuscript according to the
reviewers and editors comments. Some points have been highlighted and some
have been re-written. All the changes in the revised manuscript are highlighted
in yellow, with some of the line numbers listed below in the corresponding
answers. Meanwhile, we upload the manuscript and comments file in the system.
Corresponding answers to the reviewers comments:
Reviewer #1
This paper reports the synergistic dust removal by the WFGD system, which has
a certain practical significance. Besides, the following contents need to be explained
further:
1. It is not mentioned in this paper that the effect of temperature as well as pH to
removal efficiency. In addition, please explain how to keep pH of the solution in a
constant range?
In commercial power plants, the outlet temperature and PH of WFGD
systems are mostly between 50-60°C and 5.5~6.0 in a stable level , we also
controlled them at a stable level in order to study other factors of particles
removal, which is usually the changeable running parameters in different power
plants.
The PH is controlled by a combined system with a PH meter and peristaltic
pump. The PH meter measured the PH value of the slurry in the tank in real
time, meanwhile, the peristaltic pump transport the CaO slurry from the
MT(Mixing tank) to ST(Slurry tank), if the PH exceed 6.05 in the experiment,
the pump was stopped, and was started while the PH dropped to 5.95. In the
experience, we controlled the CaO slurry in a stable value, the PH value can also
be kept in a stable level, because the consumption of the CaO slurry is stable. It
is specially to notice is that the MT and ST should be mixing with a stirrer,
otherwise the PH is hardly to be controlled because of the uneven distribution.
2. It is recommended to add the effect of the liquid gas flow rate ratio (liquid-gas
ratio) on the removal efficiency in the sections 4.1.1.2 and 4.2.1.2, which will be more
convinced.
L/G (liquid-gas ratio) is the ratio of gas flow rate to liquid flow rate. There
are usually two ways to change the L/G, the first one is to fix the liquid flow rate
and adjust the gas flow rate, another one is to fix the gas flow rate and adjust the
liquid flow rate. In this study, we found the change of gas flow rate or slurry flow
rate have a different effect in removing particles form WFGD system. In order to
avoid confusing the L/G changed with the changes of gas flow rate or slurry flow
rate, we use them directly to analysis the effect of the particles removal, not the
L/G directly.
3. Please explain effect of gas residence time on the removal effect and the liquid
level in the reactor?
The gas residence time is equals to the high of the scrubber divided to the
gas velocity and the liquid level also can be expressed with the slurry flow rate.
We analyzed the gas flow rate and slurry flow rate in the article directly.
4. What does “efficiency” specifically means in all charts? The dust removal rate
or the desulfurization rate?
The dust removal rate, we have pointed out it again in the article and mark
out of them in every figures title.
Reviewer #2
The work deals with evaluating the dust removal efficiency in a wet SO2
removal system as a complementary removal system to the traditional electrostatic
precipitator. The work is not easy to follow since the theory is later not connected to
the experimental part. Furthermore, the model use must be clearly presented due to
the fact that it is based on lab scale experiments, in spite of the use of dimensionless
numbers.
1.- There are two removal mechanisms, nsp and ns. But later over the
development of the empirical model only nsp is considered. Can you elaborate on the
reasons? Can you obtain data only for one particular efficiency. How do you decouple
the removal efficiency of the foam layer in the experiments?
<U+0001D6C8><U+0001D412><U+0001D40F> is the overall efficiency of spray scrubber, <U+0001D6C8><U+0001D412> is theoretical efficiency of
foam layer. In the section of 4.2.2, in order to compare the efficiency of the
sieve-tray scrubber to spray scrubber, we use the enhanced efficiency <U+03B7>e to
express the enhanced efficiency of the foam in the sieve-tray scrubber. <U+0001D6C8><U+0001D41E> is the
revised efficiency of the <U+0001D6C8><U+0001D412> in the sieve-tray scrubber. We have described the
relationship between <U+0001D6C8><U+0001D412> and <U+0001D6C8><U+0001D41E> in the section 4.2.2 with color.
The overall dust removal efficiency of spray scrubber is only decided by
<U+0001D6C8><U+0001D412><U+0001D40F>, but the overall dust removal efficiency of sieve-tray scrubber is connected
with <U+0001D6C8><U+0001D412><U+0001D40F> and <U+0001D6C8><U+0001D41E> ( revised of <U+0001D6C8><U+0001D412> in sieve-tray scrubber).
In the experiments, a sieve-tray is installed in the scrubber (ST shown in
Figure 1), which can be installed or take off for the experiments on the sieve-tray
scrubber or spray scrubber. The dust removal efficiency of the foam layer is the
difference value of them.
2.- The form of eq 27 is not the same as that in the theoretical part, eqs.
(12)-(13). Why didn’t you use the same form to obtain the fitting?
Eqs. (12)-(13) is an theoretical model with the method of discrete material
balance equation in a cell volume, many parameters that effect the dust removal,
such as <U+0001D479><U+0001D495>,<U+0001D746><U+0001D46E>,<U+0001D746><U+0001D473>,<U+0001D46A><U+0001D7CE>,<U+0001D741><U+0001D488>,<U+0001D741><U+0001D473> are missing, and the results cannot effectively reflect the
effect of the parameters in the experiments (we compared the equations results
as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig.3). The form of eq 27 is the better way we found to
construct the model for simulating the dust removal efficiency for different
parameters of the WFGD system.
3.-The models you compare to should be described in the text. A fitting model
may be better in a particular case but with less fundamental meaning.
We added the descriptions of the models in the text, and mark out of them
with color (lines 221-226).
4.- A general comparison on the fitting of the model to experimental data with
error bars is needed and a discussion of the usefulness of the correlation.
We added the comparison of the experimental data to model’s results, and
marked out of them with color (lines 226-231 for spray scrubber, 304-308 for
sieve-tray scrubber).
5.-In the comparison of the results, if the ones provided in the work are use,
please cite the equation number in the figures.
We have revised this in the conclusion.
With best regards,
Sincerely yours,
Gu Min, Qirong Wu

not easy to follow since the theory is not connected to the experimental part. I will
summarize the question What is the point in presenting all the model if in the end you

We add a table in the article to reveal the connection of the theory models to
the predicted efficiency, and compares results of the predicted efficiency and
experimental data are shown in Figures 4 and 5. In the model analysis, we
introduced a corrected parameter into the models to describe the enhanced
efficiency (<U+0001D73C>'<U+0001D412><U+0001D408> ) of forth layer in the sieve-tray scrubber, which is the dominant
for <U+03B7>e. The dedusting efficiency of sieve-tray spray scrubber is a combination
efficiencies contributed by spray layer and enhanced efficiency of foam layer (<U+03B7>e).
Based on of this, the dedusting efficiency of sieve-tray scrubber can be predicted.
We add the descriptions of above in the article with green.
