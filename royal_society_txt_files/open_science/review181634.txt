The authors tried to evaluate how to effectively divert the fluids into porous media the way they
want to have. The emulsion is used for achieving such purpose. Due to following concerns, I do
not feel comfortable with recommending publishing this manuscript.
1) The definition of class III reservoir is not given and this makes the purpose of the article blurry.
2) Emulsions have been proposed as a kind of diversion fluids long time ago in the industry.
After reviewing the manuscript, I am getting confused with the novelty of the work. Many
concepts are well known in the textbooks on enhanced oil recovery.
3) How to upscale the results to field? No dimensionless analysis is performed, making it hard to
upscale it to field scale.
4) Emulsions are normally classified according to the Winsor phase diagrams. I do not see
authors have done such a job to classify the emulsions prepared by them. They simply classify
them as weak, strong or medium strong emulsion, which is not quite useful in terms of
engineering use. More careful experimental design and problem statement is lacking in the
current manuscript.
5) Overall, the writing of the manuscript is not acceptable. There are a lot of grammar errors and
confusing statements. A thorough revision should be in place to make it more readable and
suitable for journal publication.

The authors presented a study of the effect of oil emulsification on the migration performance.
They did a series of work to elucidate the matching relations between stable emulsion and oil
layer and made a matching chart to predict parallel-core displacement results with different
permeability contrasts. This paper encompasses a noticeable amount of experimental results, it
can contribute to the literature at these conditions. I suggest the minor revision for publishing this
paper.
(1) It is better to revise the abstract to give a better description. Specifically, the sentence
“Through core displacement experiment, the pressure, diversion rate, water cut and recovery
factor of the parallel core in different contrasts are measured” is very confusing and in fact, in this
paper, no displacement experiment is found.
(2) Para 2 of section 2.2.3 should be simplified and the core permeability is not match with section
3.2, please check it carefully.
(3) In section 3.5, the prediction of profile control with different permeability contrasts is
confusing. Please check it carefully.
(4) The language of this article is suggested to be improved.

Appendix A
Response to the Comments of Reviewer 1:
First of all, thank you very much for your comments on this article. We tried our
best to improve the manuscript according to your comments and made some changes
in the manuscript. And the replies to your comments are as follows. We appreciate for
your warm work earnestly, and hope that the correction will meet with approval. Once
again, thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.
The authors tried to evaluate how to effectively divert the fluids into porous media
the way they want to have. The emulsion is used for achieving such purpose. Due to
following concerns, I do not feel comfortable with recommending publishing this
manuscript.
Point 1: The definition of class III reservoir is not given and this makes the purpose of
the article blurry.
Response 1: Special thanks to the problems which you proposed. According to your
suggestion, we have given the definition of class III reservoir in the abstract: reservoir
with permeability less than 100 mD, so as to make the purpose of the article clearer.
The emulsification in formation is often weak and unstable, the emulsification of
displacement agent is intermittent, and the regularity is not obvious enough, which
brings some difficulties to the research. Especially in the low permeability formation
(class III reservoir), the study of emulsification is more difficult. Therefore, we
prepared a stable emulsion made by surfactant and kerosene to magnify the
emulsification and studied its migration process in class III reservoir, then predicted the
emulsification effect of displacement agent in formation, and analyzed the profile
control effect of class III reservoir. We hope you will be satisfied with our reply and
reconsider our article.
Point 2: Emulsions have been proposed as a kind of diversion fluids long time ago in
the industry. After reviewing the manuscript, I am getting confused with the novelty of
the work. Many concepts are well known in the textbooks on enhanced oil recovery.
Response 2: It is really true as you proposed that It is really true as you proposed that
emulsions have been proposed as a kind of diversion fluids long time ago, and many
concepts are well known about enhanced oil recovery. But our research still has the
following three innovations.
First of all, we prepared a stable emulsion made by surfactant and kerosene to
magnify the emulsification and studied its migration process in class III reservoir, then
predicted the emulsification effect of displacement agent in formation, and analyzed
the profile control effect of class III reservoir. The emulsion is milky white and stable,
it did not occur oil-water separation within 72 hours, and oil droplet coalescence was
not found under microscopic observation, which is very helpful to study the migration
resistance of the emulsion in the core.
Secondly, we defined two concepts, one is the ratio (the ratio of emulsion droplet
diameter to core pore throat diameter), the other is the resistance coefficient (the ratio
of emulsion to water migration pressure in core). It is found that the closer the ratio is
to 1, the larger the resistance coefficient is, which indicates that the matching
relationship between emulsion droplet diameter and core pore throat diameter is great.
Finally, we classify the stable emulsion into three grades according to the
resistance coefficient of the emulsion on account of the commonly used classification
criteria of an oil production plant in Daqing: weak emulsion, medium emulsion and
strong emulsion. The grading plant of surfactant concentration, water content and
emulsification level was made, the emulsification level when injecting surfactant with
different concentration into different permeability formation and driving the formation
to different water content was predicted, and the profile control effect of emulsification
on heterogeneous formation was analyzed. We hope you will be satisfied with our reply
and reconsider our article.
Point 3: How to upscale the results to field? No dimensionless analysis is performed,
making it hard to upscale it to field scale.
Response 3: Special thanks to the problems which you proposed. The reference value
of this paper for the field is not the dosage of surfactant, but the prediction of
emulsification caused by displacement agent in formation, and the analysis of profile
control of class III reservoir.

According to the Table.1 and as shown in Fig. 1, when the permeability contrast
is small (permeability is 40 mD and 60 mD, respectively), a weak emulsifying
displacement agent (surfactant concentration is 1%) is injected into the parallel cores,
and the water content of the core are 40% and 50%, respectively. It can be inferred that
the medium emulsion (green background, blue mark) will be produced in the low
permeability and high permeability cores. Therefore, the injected displacement agent
does not play a profile control role in the formation.
When a strong emulsifying displacement agent (surfactant concentration is 1.5%)
is injected into the parallel cores, and the water content of the core are 40% and 50%,
respectively. It can be inferred that the medium emulsion (green background, blue mark)
will be produced in the low permeability core and the strong emulsion (pink background,
blue mark) will be produced in the high permeability core. The strong emulsion will
block the high permeability layer, promote the fluid flow diversion and expand the
sweep volume, so the injected displacement agent plays an active role in profile control
of the formation. Therefore, it is suggested to inject strong emulsifying displacement
agent into the formation with smaller permeability contrast.
Fig.1 Profile control enficacy when the permeability contrast is 1.5
As shown in Fig. 2, when the permeability contrast is bigger (permeability is 20
mD and 80 mD, respectively), a weak emulsifying displacement agent (surfactant
concentration is 1%) is injected into the parallel cores, and the water content of the core
are 30% and 60%, respectively. It can be inferred that the medium emulsion (green
background, blue mark) will be produced in the low permeability and high permeability
cores. Therefore, the injected displacement agent does not play a profile control role in
the formation.
When a strong emulsifying displacement agent (surfactant concentration is 2%) is
injected into the parallel cores, and the water content of the core are 30% and 60%,
respectively. It can be inferred that the strong emulsion (pink background, red mark)
will be produced in the low permeability core and the medium emulsion (green
background, red mark) will be produced in the high permeability core.
The strong emulsion will block the low permeability layer, make the low
permeability layer unusable and diminish the sweep volume, so the injected
displacement agent plays a negative role in profile control of the formation. Therefore,
it is suggested to inject weak emulsifying displacement agent into the formation with
bigger permeability contrast.
Fig.2 Profile control enficacy when the permeability contrast is 4
The prediction results can provide some guidance for the selection of emulsifying
strength of displacement agents in class III reservoir. We hope you will be satisfied with
our reply and reconsider our article.
Point 4: Emulsions are normally classified according to the Winsor phase diagrams. I
do not see authors have done such a job to classify the emulsions prepared by them.
They simply classify them as weak, strong or medium strong emulsion, which is not
quite useful in terms of engineering use. More careful experimental design and problem
statement is lacking in the current manuscript.
Response 4: Special thanks to the problems which you proposed. First of all, according
to your question, we consulted the relevant literature and found that the Winsor phase
diagrams are commonly used as the classification standard of microemulsion. But the
solution we used is a stable emulsion prepared by surfactant and kerosene, without
adding salt and alcohol, which is different from microemulsion. Secondly, as you said,
the classification of emulsions in the plate is simple, but we classify the emulsions
according to the commonly used classification standards of an oil production plant in
Daqing, and the original intention of the plate is to show the relationship between the
ratio and the resistance coefficient more clearly, and indicate the prediction function of
the plate. We hope you will be satisfied with our reply and reconsider our article.
Point 5: Overall, the writing of the manuscript is not acceptable. There are a lot of
grammar errors and confusing statements. A thorough revision should be in place to
make it more readable and suitable for journal publication.
Response 5: Special thanks to the problems which you proposed. We have asked our
American friend to revise the English writing. We have revised the introduction and
abstract of the paper. And here we did not list the changes but marked in revised paper.
We hope you will be satisfied with our reply and reconsider our article.
