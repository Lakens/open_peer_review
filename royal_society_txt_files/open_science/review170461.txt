In their reply to Norscia and Palagi, Duboscq and colleagues acknowledge Norscia and Palagi’s
point that examining the time scales within which environmental, parasitological and social
factors affect self-directed behaviours is important. However, the authors disagree on several
points. The authors first defend the importance of their original paper because it was the first to
examine simultaneously which factor (whether environmental, parasitological, or social)
influence SDBs. They then also argue that while in general they agree with Norscia and Palagi
that these factors are not necessarily mutually exclusive, only one of them very likely triggers
each SDB event, although they might in some cases operate simultaneously. Finally Duboscq et al
also suggest that, contrary to Norscia and Palagi’s claim, parasitological factors can indeed
determine a variation in SDBs from t0 to t1 within minutes or seconds, if parasite activity (and
not necessarily parasite load) varies, although the current knowledge on parasite activity and its
temporal variation is limited.
Overall, I do think that this is a nice reply but I have a couple of points to make:
1) I think that the point that the authors want to make in the second paragraph (between
‘we would argue…’ and ‘…address’) is unclear, as the sentence is too long with too many comas.
I had to read it multiple times to understand it, and I am not even sure I got it right. I would
recommend the authors to reword this phrase, maybe by making shorter sentences.
2) To me the authors should make clearer the point in the fourth paragraph. My
understanding is that they are arguing that, contrary to what Norscia and Palagi state, the link
between parasite load and SDBs has received little attention in the last decades in primates
compared to birds and ungulates. However, the author cite, for ungulates and birds, works that
were published in 1991 and 2004, while they seem to fail to provide evidence that research has
been conducted more recently in birds and ungulates than in primates. In fact, later on in the
paragraph, they list a high number of papers, showing the link between SDBs, grooming and
parasite infestation which seems to suggest that the work in this field and in primates appears to
be more established than what the authors claim. The authors should also cite Ventura et al (2004:
Differential effects of ambient temperature and humidity on allogrooming, self-grooming, and
scratching in wild Japanese macaques) as it is another important paper examining the effect of
environmental factors on self-directed behaviours.

This is a reply to a published commentary by Norscia & Palagi (2017) critiquing the original
feature article by Duboscq et al. (2017) entitled “Scratch that itch: revisiting links between self-
directed behaviour and parasitological, social and environmental factors in a free-ranging
primate”. Although I found the Norscia & Palagi commentary unclear, reading between the lines
I would infer that Norscia & Palagi were not pleased with the primary result of the original paper
that ectoparasite load is the main driver associated with scratching and self-grooming (self-
directed behaviours = SDB) in Japanese macaques, and are arguing that social factors (e.g., stress)
might emerge as more important had the authors been able to incorporate different time scales to
account for acute and chronic stressors. This inference is supported by the papers cited in the
commentary indicating that Norscia & Palagi’s research is focused on scratching as a response to
stress and anxiety in marmosets. So I think the point Norscia & Palagi are trying to make is that
social stress might be more important than indicated by the results of Duboscq et al. (2017). And
while they may be correct, and the results do suggest that self-grooming (but not scratching) is
influenced by social factors, I do not see anything to find fault with the Duboscq et al. analysis
and would concur that the predominant factor influencing rate and duration of SBD is parasite-
related, although social factors also come into play for self-grooming.
Duboscq and colleagues make the point, both in the original feature and in the reply (see quotes
below), that much of current behavioral research on primates has ignored the influence of
parasites on grooming and scratching, although much research on ungulates and birds has
established this link.
“…while the association between parasitological factors and self-directed behaviour is extremely
well-established in ungulates and birds [2,3], it has received surprisingly little attention in the last
few decades of non-human primate research. This is despite the fact that numerous earlier
studies investigating the functional significance of self- and social grooming did focus on the
removal of ectoparasites [e.g. 4-7]. There is no a priori or a posteriori reasons to assume that what
affects ungulates or birds does not affect primates when the system under study, in this case the
ectoparasite-host system, is more or less identical.” (page 1 line 57 to page 2 line 1 of Reply)
“Additionally, although scratching may not remove the egg from its position on the hair or
feather, it may damage it and halt its development [5], adding a prophylactic benefit similar to
that of self-grooming with the extra advantage that with scratching, an animal can reach areas
inaccessible to self-grooming [5]. This link is commonly established in many animals such as
ungulates and birds [3–5] but is neglected in primates because, among other reasons, they are
social animals and scratching was linked early on to social events and anxiety due to social
events.” (original feature)
My perspective comes from being a co-author on 24 articles investigating the relationship
between ectoparasites and grooming behavior in ungulates (e.g., impala, moose, elk, bison,
bighorn sheep, etc.). In this body of literature, we were primarily interested in testing predictions
of the programmed grooming hypothesis, a model based on grooming (oral self-grooming,
allogrooming = social grooming, and scratch grooming) as a preventive strategy to avoid costly
ectoparasite buildup in social ungulates. In all but one species we were able to support the
predictions of the programmed grooming model, and (without going into the details) conclude
that tick challenge was the key factor in predicting grooming rate and duration. In general,
Duboscq et al. incorporated these basic ideas into their ‘parasite hypothesis’ tested in the original
feature article. The finding that parasite factors (louse infestation estimates) were associated with
4
SBD measures (scratch, self-groom, and allogroom rates and duration) thus does not surprise me.
Naturally, given the hierarchical social organization of most primate societies, I would also
expect social factors (e.g., dominance, stressors) to also influence SDB, as indicated for the self-
grooming results. Finally, our own work has made it clear that environmental factors can
strongly influence grooming rates because they are drivers of ectoparasite life cycles and host
loads. Nonetheless, the only factors strong enough to emerge in this study were the parasite
factors for scratching, and the parasite and social factors for oral self-grooming.
Duboscq et al. found that (a) scratching was positively associated with monthly lice load, while
(b) self-grooming was negatively associated with monthly lice load. We very often saw similar
results in our ungulate grooming research, in which scratching rate was positively correlated
with tick load while oral self-grooming was negatively correlated with tick infestation. Our
interpretation was that scratch grooming is directly stimulated by the “itch” of a tick or other
ectoparasite and is thus “stimulus driven” and serves to directly remove the itch-causing
element, which is why scratching was often stimulated by fly activity. On the other hand, we
found that oral grooming (using teeth and/or tongue to groom) acts as an intrinsic preventive
measure, removing the ectoparasite before it actually elicits the itch, which in the case of ticks can
be many hours or days before blood feeding commences. Thus, for ungulates, it is likely that
scratching is stimulus-driven while oral grooming (more effective in removing ticks) is
programmed and preventive. (The details of the model can be found in our published work, but
I’d be glad to send a paper that gives a more comprehensive explanation if that is helpful.) My
reading of the Duboscq et al. (2017) feature is that the authors have interpreted these findings in
essentially the same way, although worded differently:
“Within models including lice load, the occurrence of scratching was positively associated with
monthly lice loads. Chemicals in saliva, stings, body secretions or urticating hairs of ectoparasites
all have the potential to induce an immune itch which triggers scratching, effectively relieving the
itch [1,17] … Inversely, the occurrence of self-grooming was negatively linked to monthly lice
loads. By grooming themselves, females thus may be able to prevent infestation by removing
future blood-sucking ectoparasites [4].”
Perhaps it would be helpful if this section were reinterpreted in the Reply within the perspective
of “what regulates rate of SDB”. In other words, the positive association of parasites with
scratching rate infers stimulus-driven regulation, whereas the negative association of parasites
with oral self-grooming infers a programmed regulation and a preventive function.
By and large the authors have done a splendid job of responding to the commentary. However, I
would also say that they are so diplomatic that I wonder whether the general reader will fully
grasp the points that they are making (I’m sure that Norscia & Palagi will get it). Thus, my only
substantial comment is to suggest that the authors strive to make their points a little less subtle
and more obvious for the general reader. In particular, I suggest that the 3 points that the authors
make could be clarified, perhaps at the risk of being more frank:
Point 1: “First, one of the main points of our study was to highlight biases in the investigation of
certain research hypotheses, such as those involving self-directed behaviours. We would argue
that before dissecting when a certain event occurs, that is to which other event or situation is this
event linked basically, we need to make sure it is indeed generally connected to it or them, which
to our point of view was never fully undertaken in primatology and which our original article
tried to address.”
I believe the point here is that many primatologists have made the (perhaps unconscious)
assumption that the primary factors driving grooming are social, with parasite factors being
secondary. What is needed is an objective attempt to test multiple hypotheses using the same
comprehensive database. A multiple hypothesis-testing approach has arguably the best chance
of teasing out the most important factors influencing behavior, and thus move the field forward.
This the authors have done, with the result that parasite factors are the strongest driver of
scratching, and parasite and social factors the most salient factors driving self-grooming. That is
what the evidence reveals, all speculation aside. If other investigators can tease out acute and
chronic stressors while also testing alternative explanations, they are free to do so.
Point 2: “Second, in our study, at the level of the aggregate data set, the hypotheses put forward
are indeed nonmutually exclusive in explaining general self-directed behaviour (SDB) patterns,
as noted by Norscia and Palagi. However, at the level of an individual SDB event, each of the
5
hypotheses is more likely to explain the behaviour independently than in concert, though we
acknowledge the possibility of additive or even synergistic effects here as well; note that our
statistical models for self-grooming suggested that such additive effects were likely. Regardless, if
a single SDB may be caused by x, y, or z, but seems less likely to occur because of all three
simultaneously, use of the term “alternative” is not necessarily incorrect.”
To myself, a non-primatologist, this section seems to be a lot of fuss over semantics. To the
general reader, reference to “alternative hypotheses” is completely appropriate because these are
alternative explanations for the phenomenon of SDB. That does not imply that only one
explanation must be true and the others false, and indeed I would argue that all three factors
(parasite, social, environmental) MUST be at work at some level and to some degree in
influencing grooming behaviours even if not all factors are strong enough to produce a
statistically significant result. Be that as it may, alternative explanations for grooming are general
not mutually exclusive; the question is, what factors are predominant? Again, the authors have
succeeded in identifying the predominant factors.
Point 3: “Third, some of the arguments put forth by Norsica and Palagi involve generalizations
that may not in fact be supported entirely. For example, they state that “(…) the association
between self-directed behaviours, and particularly scratching, with social, environmental and
parasitological factors can be considered as more than just a hypothesis. Once established that the
different factors are not alternative and that their relationship with scratching has been
demonstrated, it is worth focusing on the role that each factor can have in relation to the time
scale” (p.2). We would fully agree with the logic here if the premise were true: while the
association between parasitological factors and self-directed behaviour is extremely well-
established in ungulates and birds [2,3], it has received surprisingly little attention in the last few
decades of non-human primate research. This is despite the fact that numerous earlier studies
investigating the functional significance of self- and social grooming did focus on the removal of
ectoparasites [e.g. 4-7]. There is no a priori or a posteriori reasons to assume that what affects
ungulates or birds does not affect primates when the system under study, in this case the
ectoparasite-host system, is more or less identical...”
This is the meat of the reply and returns to the first point: primate investigations have often
assumed that parasite factors are secondary to “more important” social factors and therefore have
not bothered to apply robust approaches to test the parasite hypothesis. The authors then go
back to evidence supporting the parasite hypothesis and defending the integrative approach. I
appreciate the penultimate statement by the authors that “… contrary to the assertions of Norscia
and Palagi, this does not imply that some relationships are secondary to others. We think this
distinction is meaningless, and that is why we took an integrative approach in the first place.”
Bravo! All causal explanations are created equal and it is up to the scientist to carefully examine
the evidence for each explanation before drawing conclusions.

In their reply to Norscia and Palagi, Duboscq and colleagues acknowledge Norscia and Palagi’s
point that examining the time scales within which environmental, parasitological and social
factors affect self-directed behaviours is important. However, the authors disagree on several
points. The authors first defend the importance of their original paper because it was the first to
examine simultaneously which factor (whether environmental, parasitological, or social)
influence SDBs. They then also argue that while in general they agree with Norscia and Palagi
that these factors are not necessarily mutually exclusive, only one of them very likely triggers
each SDB event, although they might in some cases operate simultaneously. Finally Duboscq et al
also suggest that, contrary to Norscia and Palagi’s claim, parasitological factors can indeed
determine a variation in SDBs from t0 to t1 within minutes or seconds, if parasite activity (and
not necessarily parasite load) varies, although the current knowledge on parasite activity and its
temporal variation is limited.
Overall, I do think that this is a nice reply but I have a couple of points to make:
1) I think that the point that the authors want to make in the second paragraph (between
‘we would argue…’ and ‘…address’) is unclear, as the sentence is too long with too many comas.
I had to read it multiple times to understand it, and I am not even sure I got it right. I would

parasite infestation which seems to suggest that the work in this field and in primates appears to
be more established than what the authors claim. The authors should also cite Ventura et al (2004:
Differential effects of ambient temperature and humidity on allogrooming, self-grooming, and
scratching in wild Japanese macaques) as it is another important paper examining the effect of
environmental factors on self-directed behaviours.

This is a reply to a published commentary by Norscia & Palagi (2017) critiquing the original
feature article by Duboscq et al. (2017) entitled “Scratch that itch: revisiting links between self-
directed behaviour and parasitological, social and environmental factors in a free-ranging
primate”. Although I found the Norscia & Palagi commentary unclear, reading between the lines
I would infer that Norscia & Palagi were not pleased with the primary result of the original paper
that ectoparasite load is the main driver associated with scratching and self-grooming (self-
directed behaviours = SDB) in Japanese macaques, and are arguing that social factors (e.g., stress)
might emerge as more important had the authors been able to incorporate different time scales to
account for acute and chronic stressors. This inference is supported by the papers cited in the
commentary indicating that Norscia & Palagi’s research is focused on scratching as a response to
stress and anxiety in marmosets. So I think the point Norscia & Palagi are trying to make is that
social stress might be more important than indicated by the results of Duboscq et al. (2017). And
while they may be correct, and the results do suggest that self-grooming (but not scratching) is
influenced by social factors, I do not see anything to find fault with the Duboscq et al. analysis
9
and would concur that the predominant factor influencing rate and duration of SBD is parasite-
related, although social factors also come into play for self-grooming.
Duboscq and colleagues make the point, both in the original feature and in the reply (see quotes
below), that much of current behavioral research on primates has ignored the influence of
parasites on grooming and scratching, although much research on ungulates and birds has
established this link.
“…while the association between parasitological factors and self-directed behaviour is extremely
well-established in ungulates and birds [2,3], it has received surprisingly little attention in the last
few decades of non-human primate research. This is despite the fact that numerous earlier
studies investigating the functional significance of self- and social grooming did focus on the
removal of ectoparasites [e.g. 4-7]. There is no a priori or a posteriori reasons to assume that what
affects ungulates or birds does not affect primates when the system under study, in this case the
ectoparasite-host system, is more or less identical.” (page 1 line 57 to page 2 line 1 of Reply)
“Additionally, although scratching may not remove the egg from its position on the hair or
feather, it may damage it and halt its development [5], adding a prophylactic benefit similar to
that of self-grooming with the extra advantage that with scratching, an animal can reach areas
inaccessible to self-grooming [5]. This link is commonly established in many animals such as
ungulates and birds [3–5] but is neglected in primates because, among other reasons, they are
social animals and scratching was linked early on to social events and anxiety due to social
events.” (original feature)
My perspective comes from being a co-author on 24 articles investigating the relationship
between ectoparasites and grooming behavior in ungulates (e.g., impala, moose, elk, bison,
bighorn sheep, etc.). In this body of literature, we were primarily interested in testing predictions
of the programmed grooming hypothesis, a model based on grooming (oral self-grooming,
allogrooming = social grooming, and scratch grooming) as a preventive strategy to avoid costly
ectoparasite buildup in social ungulates. In all but one species we were able to support the
predictions of the programmed grooming model, and (without going into the details) conclude
that tick challenge was the key factor in predicting grooming rate and duration. In general,
Duboscq et al. incorporated these basic ideas into their ‘parasite hypothesis’ tested in the original
feature article. The finding that parasite factors (louse infestation estimates) were associated with
SBD measures (scratch, self-groom, and allogroom rates and duration) thus does not surprise me.
Naturally, given the hierarchical social organization of most primate societies, I would also
expect social factors (e.g., dominance, stressors) to also influence SDB, as indicated for the self-
grooming results. Finally, our own work has made it clear that environmental factors can
strongly influence grooming rates because they are drivers of ectoparasite life cycles and host
loads. Nonetheless, the only factors strong enough to emerge in this study were the parasite
factors for scratching, and the parasite and social factors for oral self-grooming.
Duboscq et al. found that (a) scratching was positively associated with monthly lice load, while
(b) self-grooming was negatively associated with monthly lice load. We very often saw similar
results in our ungulate grooming research, in which scratching rate was positively correlated
with tick load while oral self-grooming was negatively correlated with tick infestation. Our
interpretation was that scratch grooming is directly stimulated by the “itch” of a tick or other
ectoparasite and is thus “stimulus driven” and serves to directly remove the itch-causing
element, which is why scratching was often stimulated by fly activity. On the other hand, we
found that oral grooming (using teeth and/or tongue to groom) acts as an intrinsic preventive
measure, removing the ectoparasite before it actually elicits the itch, which in the case of ticks can
be many hours or days before blood feeding commences. Thus, for ungulates, it is likely that
scratching is stimulus-driven while oral grooming (more effective in removing ticks) is
programmed and preventive. (The details of the model can be found in our published work, but
I’d be glad to send a paper that gives a more comprehensive explanation if that is helpful.) My
reading of the Duboscq et al. (2017) feature is that the authors have interpreted these findings in
essentially the same way, although worded differently:
“Within models including lice load, the occurrence of scratching was positively associated with
monthly lice loads. Chemicals in saliva, stings, body secretions or urticating hairs of ectoparasites
all have the potential to induce an immune itch which triggers scratching, effectively relieving the
10
itch [1,17] … Inversely, the occurrence of self-grooming was negatively linked to monthly lice
loads. By grooming themselves, females thus may be able to prevent infestation by removing
future blood-sucking ectoparasites [4].”
Perhaps it would be helpful if this section were reinterpreted in the Reply within the perspective
of “what regulates rate of SDB”. In other words, the positive association of parasites with
scratching rate infers stimulus-driven regulation, whereas the negative association of parasites
with oral self-grooming infers a programmed regulation and a preventive function.
By and large the authors have done a splendid job of responding to the commentary. However, I
would also say that they are so diplomatic that I wonder whether the general reader will fully
grasp the points that they are making (I’m sure that Norscia & Palagi will get it). Thus, my only
substantial comment is to suggest that the authors strive to make their points a little less subtle

Point 1: “First, one of the main points of our study was to highlight biases in the investigation of

I believe the point here is that many primatologists have made the (perhaps unconscious)
assumption that the primary factors driving grooming are social, with parasite factors being
secondary. What is needed is an objective attempt to test multiple hypotheses using the same

as noted by Norscia and Palagi. However, at the level of an individual SDB event, each of the

acknowledge the possibility of additive or even synergistic effects here as well; note that our
statistical models for self-grooming suggested that such additive effects were likely. Regardless, if
a single SDB may be caused by x, y, or z, but seems less likely to occur because of all three
simultaneously, use of the term “alternative” is not necessarily incorrect.”
To myself, a non-primatologist, this section seems to be a lot of fuss over semantics. To the
general reader, reference to “alternative hypotheses” is completely appropriate because these are
alternative explanations for the phenomenon of SDB. That does not imply that only one
explanation must be true and the others false, and indeed I would argue that all three factors
(parasite, social, environmental) MUST be at work at some level and to some degree in
influencing grooming behaviours even if not all factors are strong enough to produce a
statistically significant result. Be that as it may, alternative explanations for grooming are general
not mutually exclusive; the question is, what factors are predominant? Again, the authors have
succeeded in identifying the predominant factors.
Point 3: “Third, some of the arguments put forth by Norsica and Palagi involve generalizations
that may not in fact be supported entirely. For example, they state that “(…) the association
between self-directed behaviours, and particularly scratching, with social, environmental and
parasitological factors can be considered as more than just a hypothesis. Once established that the
different factors are not alternative and that their relationship with scratching has been
demonstrated, it is worth focusing on the role that each factor can have in relation to the time
scale” (p.2). We would fully agree with the logic here if the premise were true: while the
association between parasitological factors and self-directed behaviour is extremely well-
established in ungulates and birds [2,3], it has received surprisingly little attention in the last few
decades of non-human primate research. This is despite the fact that numerous earlier studies
investigating the functional significance of self- and social grooming did focus on the removal of
11
ectoparasites [e.g. 4-7]. There is no a priori or a posteriori reasons to assume that what affects
ungulates or birds does not affect primates when the system under study, in this case the
ectoparasite-host system, is more or less identical...”
This is the meat of the reply and returns to the first point: primate investigations have often
assumed that parasite factors are secondary to “more important” social factors and therefore have
not bothered to apply robust approaches to test the parasite hypothesis. The authors then go
back to evidence supporting the parasite hypothesis and defending the integrative approach. I
appreciate the penultimate statement by the authors that “… contrary to the assertions of Norscia
and Palagi, this does not imply that some relationships are secondary to others. We think this
distinction is meaningless, and that is why we took an integrative approach in the first place.”
Bravo! All causal explanations are created equal and it is up to the scientist to carefully examine
the evidence for each explanation before drawing conclusions.

Appendix A
We are extremely grateful to the reviewers for their insightful comments. It has greatly improved our
commentary. Here are a few comments to their suggestions.
Reviewer: 1
In their reply to Norscia and Palagi, Duboscq and colleagues acknowledge Norscia and Palagi’s point that
examining the time scales within which environmental, parasitological and social factors affect self-
directed behaviours is important. However, the authors disagree on several points. The authors first
defend the importance of their original paper because it was the first to examine simultaneously which
factor (whether environmental, parasitological, or social) influence SDBs. They then also argue that
while in general they agree with Norscia and Palagi that these factors are not necessarily mutually
exclusive, only one of them very likely triggers each SDB event, although they might in some cases
operate simultaneously. Finally Duboscq et al also suggest that, contrary to Norscia and Palagi’s claim,
parasitological factors can indeed determine a variation in SDBs from t0 to t1 within minutes or seconds,
if parasite activity (and not necessarily parasite load) varies, although the current knowledge on parasite
activity and its temporal variation is limited.
Overall, I do think that this is a nice reply but I have a couple of points to make:
1) I think that the point that the authors want to make in the second paragraph (between ‘we would
argue…’ and ‘…address’) is unclear, as the sentence is too long with too many comas. I had to read it
multiple times to understand it, and I am not even sure I got it right. I would recommend the authors to
reword this phrase, maybe by making shorter sentences.
Response: we modify this sentence accordingly “So, we would argue that before dissecting when or
under what set of conditions a certain event is likely to occur, we need to first ensure that the event and
these other conditions are indeed generally related. From our perspective, such an investigation has
never been fully realized in taxa as socially complex as primates, and we therefore feel the approach
taken in our original article is justified.” and furthermore changed its place in the commentary (from 2nd
paragraph to 4th).
2) To me the authors should make clearer the point in the fourth paragraph. My understanding is that
they are arguing that, contrary to what Norscia and Palagi state, the link between parasite load and
SDBs has received little attention in the last decades in primates compared to birds and ungulates.
However, the author cite, for ungulates and birds, works that were published in 1991 and 2004, while
they seem to fail to provide evidence that research has been conducted more recently in birds and
ungulates than in primates. In fact, later on in the paragraph, they list a high number of papers,
showing the link between SDBs, grooming and parasite infestation which seems to suggest that the work
in this field and in primates appears to be more established than what the authors claim. The authors
should also cite Ventura et al (2004: Differential effects of ambient temperature and humidity on
allogrooming, self-grooming, and scratching in wild Japanese macaques) as it is another important
paper examining the effect of environmental factors on self-directed behaviours.
Response: we substantially changed the organisation of the 2nd and 4th paragraph based on this
suggestion and Reviewer 2’s comments. We now bring forward the argument that links between
ectoparasites and SDBs are extremely well established and investigated in birds and ungulates while
these links were considered in earlier studies on non-human primates but later dismissed or ignored in
further studies. We also updated the reference list to include more recent papers, both in primates and
non-primate species. We now write: “While the association between parasitological factors and self-
directed behaviour is extremely well-established in ungulates and birds [2-16], with also some evidence
in insects [17-19], it has received surprisingly little attention in non-human primate research. Despite
the fact that numerous earlier studies on the functional significance of self- and social grooming did
mention the removal of ectoparasites [e.g. 20-23], it has sometimes been dismissed groundlessly or
ignored altogether in more recent studies [e.g. 24-27].” 2nd paragraph.
Reviewer: 2
Response: we thank you very much for your detailed comments and suggestions. We allowed ourselves
to paraphrase some of the wordings as it was very nicely explained. We acknowledge your meaningful
contribution.
This is a reply to a published commentary by Norscia & Palagi (2017) critiquing the original feature
article by Duboscq et al. (2017) entitled “Scratch that itch: revisiting links between self-directed
behaviour and parasitological, social and environmental factors in a free-ranging primate”. Although I
found the Norscia & Palagi commentary unclear, reading between the lines I would infer that Norscia &
Palagi were not pleased with the primary result of the original paper that ectoparasite load is the main
driver associated with scratching and self-grooming (self-directed behaviours = SDB) in Japanese
macaques, and are arguing that social factors (e.g., stress) might emerge as more important had the
authors been able to incorporate different time scales to account for acute and chronic stressors. This
inference is supported by the papers cited in the commentary indicating that Norscia & Palagi’s research
is focused on scratching as a response to stress and anxiety in marmosets. So I think the point Norscia
& Palagi are trying to make is that social stress might be more important than indicated by the results of
Duboscq et al. (2017). And while they may be correct, and the results do suggest that self-grooming
(but not scratching) is influenced by social factors, I do not see anything to find fault with the Duboscq
et al. analysis and would concur that the predominant factor influencing rate and duration of SBD is
parasite-related, although social factors also come into play for self-grooming.
Duboscq and colleagues make the point, both in the original feature and in the reply (see quotes below),
that much of current behavioral research on primates has ignored the influence of parasites on grooming
and scratching, although much research on ungulates and birds has established this link.
“…while the association between parasitological factors and self-directed behaviour is extremely well-
established in ungulates and birds [2,3], it has received surprisingly little attention in the last few
decades of non-human primate research. This is despite the fact that numerous earlier studies
investigating the functional significance of self- and social grooming did focus on the removal of
ectoparasites [e.g. 4-7]. There is no a priori or a posteriori reasons to assume that what affects
ungulates or birds does not affect primates when the system under study, in this case the ectoparasite-
host system, is more or less identical.” (page 1 line 57 to page 2 line 1 of Reply)
“Additionally, although scratching may not remove the egg from its position on the hair or feather, it
may damage it and halt its development [5], adding a prophylactic benefit similar to that of self-
grooming with the extra advantage that with scratching, an animal can reach areas inaccessible to self-
grooming [5]. This link is commonly established in many animals such as ungulates and birds [3–5] but
is neglected in primates because, among other reasons, they are social animals and scratching was
linked early on to social events and anxiety due to social events.” (original feature)
My perspective comes from being a co-author on 24 articles investigating the relationship between
ectoparasites and grooming behavior in ungulates (e.g., impala, moose, elk, bison, bighorn sheep, etc.).
In this body of literature, we were primarily interested in testing predictions of the programmed
grooming hypothesis, a model based on grooming (oral self-grooming, allogrooming = social grooming,
and scratch grooming) as a preventive strategy to avoid costly ectoparasite buildup in social ungulates.
In all but one species we were able to support the predictions of the programmed grooming model, and
(without going into the details) conclude that tick challenge was the key factor in predicting grooming
rate and duration. In general, Duboscq et al. incorporated these basic ideas into their ‘parasite
hypothesis’ tested in the original feature article. The finding that parasite factors (louse infestation
estimates) were associated with SBD measures (scratch, self-groom, and allogroom rates and duration)
thus does not surprise me. Naturally, given the hierarchical social organization of most primate societies,
I would also expect social factors (e.g., dominance, stressors) to also influence SDB, as indicated for the
self-grooming results. Finally, our own work has made it clear that environmental factors can strongly
influence grooming rates because they are drivers of ectoparasite life cycles and host loads.
Nonetheless, the only factors strong enough to emerge in this study were the parasite factors for
scratching, and the parasite and social factors for oral self-grooming.
Duboscq et al. found that (a) scratching was positively associated with monthly lice load, while (b) self-
grooming was negatively associated with monthly lice load. We very often saw similar results in our
ungulate grooming research, in which scratching rate was positively correlated with tick load while oral
self-grooming was negatively correlated with tick infestation. Our interpretation was that scratch
grooming is directly stimulated by the “itch” of a tick or other ectoparasite and is thus “stimulus driven”
and serves to directly remove the itch-causing element, which is why scratching was often stimulated by
fly activity. On the other hand, we found that oral grooming (using teeth and/or tongue to groom) acts
as an intrinsic preventive measure, removing the ectoparasite before it actually elicits the itch, which in
the case of ticks can be many hours or days before blood feeding commences. Thus, for ungulates, it is
likely that scratching is stimulus-driven while oral grooming (more effective in removing ticks) is
programmed and preventive. (The details of the model can be found in our published work, but I’d be
glad to send a paper that gives a more comprehensive explanation if that is helpful.) My reading of the
Duboscq et al. (2017) feature is that the authors have interpreted these findings in essentially the same
way, although worded differently:
“Within models including lice load, the occurrence of scratching was positively associated with monthly
lice loads. Chemicals in saliva, stings, body secretions or urticating hairs of ectoparasites all have the
potential to induce an immune itch which triggers scratching, effectively relieving the itch [1,17] …
Inversely, the occurrence of self-grooming was negatively linked to monthly lice loads. By grooming
themselves, females thus may be able to prevent infestation by removing future blood-sucking
ectoparasites [4].”
Perhaps it would be helpful if this section were reinterpreted in the Reply within the perspective of “what
regulates rate of SDB”. In other words, the positive association of parasites with scratching rate infers
stimulus-driven regulation, whereas the negative association of parasites with oral self-grooming infers a
programmed regulation and a preventive function.
By and large the authors have done a splendid job of responding to the commentary. However, I would
also say that they are so diplomatic that I wonder whether the general reader will fully grasp the points
that they are making (I’m sure that Norscia & Palagi will get it). Thus, my only substantial comment is to
suggest that the authors strive to make their points a little less subtle and more obvious for the general
reader. In particular, I suggest that the 3 points that the authors make could be clarified, perhaps at the
risk of being more frank:
Point 1: “First, one of the main points of our study was to highlight biases in the investigation of certain
research hypotheses, such as those involving self-directed behaviours. We would argue that before
dissecting when a certain event occurs, that is to which other event or situation is this event linked
basically, we need to make sure it is indeed generally connected to it or them, which to our point of view
was never fully undertaken in primatology and which our original article tried to address.”
I believe the point here is that many primatologists have made the (perhaps unconscious) assumption
that the primary factors driving grooming are social, with parasite factors being secondary. What is
needed is an objective attempt to test multiple hypotheses using the same comprehensive database. A
multiple hypothesis-testing approach has arguably the best chance of teasing out the most important
factors influencing behavior, and thus move the field forward. This the authors have done, with the
result that parasite factors are the strongest driver of scratching, and parasite and social factors the
most salient factors driving self-grooming. That is what the evidence reveals, all speculation aside. If
other investigators can tease out acute and chronic stressors while also testing alternative explanations,
they are free to do so.
Response: We now merged parts of paragraph 2 with parts of paragraph 4 to make our points stronger
in paragraph 2, right after the introductory paragraph: “First, one of the main points of our study was to
highlight biases in the investigation of certain research hypotheses, such as those involving self-directed
behaviours. Studies in primatology have often, if perhaps inadvertently, assumed that the primary
drivers of self-directed behaviour (SDB) are social, with parasite or abiotic factors being secondary.
Norscia and Palagi nonetheless state that “(…) the association between self-directed behaviours, and
particularly scratching, with social, environmental and parasitological factors can be considered as more
than just a hypothesis. Once established that the different factors are not alternative and that their
relationship with scratching has been demonstrated, it is worth focusing on the role that each factor can
have in relation to the time scale” (p.2). We would fully agree with the logic here if the premise were
true. While the association between parasitological factors and self-directed behaviour is extremely well-
established in ungulates and birds [2-16], with also some evidence in insects [17-19], it has received
surprisingly little attention in non-human primate research. Despite the fact that numerous earlier
studies on the functional significance of self- and social grooming did mention the removal of
ectoparasites [e.g. 20-23], it has sometimes been dismissed groundlessly or ignored altogether in more
recent studies [e.g. 24-27]. There is no a priori or a posteriori reasons to assume that what affects
ungulates or birds does not affect primates when the system under study, in this case the ectoparasite-
host system, is more or less identical. Along these lines, our study was an attempt to test multiple
hypotheses simultaneously and objectively using the same comprehensive data set. A multivariate
approach perhaps provides the best opportunity to draw out the key factors influencing behaviour, and
thereby contribute to advancing the field. All speculation aside, our study reveals that, amongst the
candidate set of hypotheses tested (formulated as statistical models), parasite factors appear to best
explain the occurrence of scratching, while parasite and social factors appear to do so for self-grooming.
If future work can now tease out the impacts of these and other factors at distinct time scales while also
accounting for alternative explanations, such work would be most welcome indeed.”
Point 2: “Second, in our study, at the level of the aggregate data set, the hypotheses put forward are
indeed nonmutually exclusive in explaining general self-directed behaviour (SDB) patterns, as noted by
Norscia and Palagi. However, at the level of an individual SDB event, each of the hypotheses is more
likely to explain the behaviour independently than in concert, though we acknowledge the possibility of
additive or even synergistic effects here as well; note that our statistical models for self-grooming
suggested that such additive effects were likely. Regardless, if a single SDB may be caused by x, y, or z,
but seems less likely to occur because of all three simultaneously, use of the term “alternative” is not
necessarily incorrect.”
To myself, a non-primatologist, this section seems to be a lot of fuss over semantics. To the general
reader, reference to “alternative hypotheses” is completely appropriate because these are alternative
explanations for the phenomenon of SDB. That does not imply that only one explanation must be true
and the others false, and indeed I would argue that all three factors (parasite, social, environmental)
MUST be at work at some level and to some degree in influencing grooming behaviours even if not all
factors are strong enough to produce a statistically significant result. Be that as it may, alternative
explanations for grooming are general not mutually exclusive; the question is, what factors are
predominant? Again, the authors have succeeded in identifying the predominant factors.
Response: we acknowledge the reviewer’s feeling of frustration here, but we think this issue nonetheless
needs to be addressed, briefly. We moved a sentence from paragraph 4 to this paragraph to strengthen
our point: “Contrary to the assertions of Norscia and Palagi, this does not imply that some relationships
are secondary to others. We think this distinction is meaningless, and that is why we took an integrative
approach in the first place. If we did not make that point clear enough in the original manuscript, then
we reiterate it here.”
Point 3: “Third, some of the arguments put forth by Norsica and Palagi involve generalizations that may
not in fact be supported entirely. For example, they state that “(…) the association between self-directed
behaviours, and particularly scratching, with social, environmental and parasitological factors can be
considered as more than just a hypothesis. Once established that the different factors are not alternative
and that their relationship with scratching has been demonstrated, it is worth focusing on the role that
each factor can have in relation to the time scale” (p.2). We would fully agree with the logic here if the
premise were true: while the association between parasitological factors and self-directed behaviour is
extremely well-established in ungulates and birds [2,3], it has received surprisingly little attention in the
last few decades of non-human primate research. This is despite the fact that numerous earlier studies
investigating the functional significance of self- and social grooming did focus on the removal of
ectoparasites [e.g. 4-7]. There is no a priori or a posteriori reasons to assume that what affects
ungulates or birds does not affect primates when the system under study, in this case the ectoparasite-
host system, is more or less identical...”
This is the meat of the reply and returns to the first point: primate investigations have often assumed
that parasite factors are secondary to “more important” social factors and therefore have not bothered
to apply robust approaches to test the parasite hypothesis. The authors then go back to evidence
supporting the parasite hypothesis and defending the integrative approach. I appreciate the penultimate
statement by the authors that “… contrary to the assertions of Norscia and Palagi, this does not imply
that some relationships are secondary to others. We think this distinction is meaningless, and that is
why we took an integrative approach in the first place.” Bravo! All causal explanations are created equal
and it is up to the scientist to carefully examine the evidence for each explanation before drawing
conclusions.
Response: We thank the reviewer for his/her support. We substantially changed paragraph 2 and 4 to
strengthen our arguments (see above).
