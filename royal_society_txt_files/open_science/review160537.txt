Calcium and temp interactions… Betini et al.
This study addresses the potential interactions of (declining) levels of Ca and (increased)
temperature on Daphnia movement rates. While a suite of other impact of Ca (and temperature)
has been studied, the impact on movements is a rather novel take. The results are strong in
support of Ca-impact, but there are some major issues that should be addressed before this paper
can be accepted.
First I find the method quite old-fashioned in these days where automatized video recordings at
small scale are commonplace and rather inexpensive. Inspection by eye in small cylinders may
suffer from inaccuracy and subjectivity. I do not claim that this is the case here, but I´d like to see
the choice of methodbetter advocated and discussed. Second, I think the Ca-concentrations are
too high, although it seemingly still gave results. Sine the literature seem to suggest a threshold
between 1 and 2.5 mg Ca/l for different fitness related parameters, 3 of the 4 levels would here
presumably be above saturation for many physiological processes. Also most of the lakes where
declining ca is problem typically have Ca levels of 1 mg or below.
Specific comments:
P3, L24-32: The point is that the depletion of Ca is a post-acidification story, i.e. coupled to
reduced emissions and depositions of S.
P3, L47: To authors unfamiliar with Holopedium the slang “jelly-clad2 would seem strange. Be
more specific. Also I do not see that the lower content of Ca and P in Holopedium would reduce
energy transport in the food web. After all, these are minerals. The point that Holopedium may
clog water intakes is also quite irrelevant for your study.
P4,L5: Any support for retarded development at low Ca?
P4,L24: Climate change is no doubt causing increased temperatures in many (most?) lakes, but
still this is minor compared with inter-lake differences in temperature, diurnal differences of
vertical gradients in temp. While it of course is tempting to link this to climate change, it should
be put in perspective with other (and larger) temperature impacts in lakes. Also, costs of
migration are rather small compared to other metabolic expenditures.
P4,L32: Well, there are quite a number of recent studies addressing the role of Ca (you claim
few…).
P5;L17: Again, I think this gradient is way too high. At least it needs to be defended.
P5,L54: A ruler? How accurate could this be? Cf general comment above.
P6,L4: So how do you separate movements from direct stress response in this narrow trap?
L6, L31-33: What is the difference with tests without interactions and test with one-factor analysis
only? Both would be without interactions? Specify.
P8,L7: Or simply between-lake differences in temp. differences between cold and warm days,
diurnal differences, vertical differences…
P8,L24: ref. 6 and 12 deal with Canadian lakes, so where does the reference to the low Ca in
Norwegian lakes come from?
P9,L12: There are studies suggesting increased predation risk under low Ca (cf. Riessen et al.
2012).
P9;L48: There are also paper addressing the interactions between Ca and P which would be
relevant here.

This is a very interesting study that provides a new perspective on zooplankton responses to
lakewater calcium decline, by examining a behavioral response (movement) in Daphnia reared
under different temperatures and calcium concentrations. I have only minor comments, mainly
suggestions for improving the clarity of the manuscript in certain parts.
Comments:
- This is a minor point, but please add line numbers to your manuscript. Not having them makes
it challenging for me to refer to specific sentences in my comments.
- Abstract: “Here we tested whether the combined effects of calcium and temperature affect
movement parameters…” – please be specific here as to what you are measuring for
Background
-I think this section needs some work to better set the context for your study objectives. As it is, I
think a reader who is not well versed in the Ca decline literature could have a hard time
following. Specific examples follow:
- Page 3, 2nd paragraph (~lines 31/32) - I’d suggest adding a sentence to explain the mechanistic
link between acidification and Ca decline. I also think its important to point out where aquatic
ecosystems are likely to be experiencing (or are vulnerable to) Ca decline - softwater lakes with a
history of acidification like northeastern NA, Scandinavia, parts of China, etc.
On the following line, you reference cladocerans, but should clarify for the reader what they are
(component of the zooplankton)
(~lines 44/45): clarify Daphnia have been replaced by Holopedium in many low-Ca systems
(phenomenon not occurring in high-Ca lakes)
- Page 4 paragraph 1 (~lines 29/30) – I think it would be useful to provide some context here
about the degree of increasing temperatures currently occurring in regions experiencing Ca
4
decline (e.g. reference Keller, W., 2007. Implications of climate warming for Boreal Shield lakes: a
review and synthesis. Environmental Reviews, 15: 99-112)
- Page 4 paragraph 2 – give range of Ca concentrations when describing your study design
Methods
- Page 5 Paragraph 3 (~lines 45/47) – This description is a bit confusing. “They were first
removed from each of the 16 different stock cultures and placed in 50ml of adjusted COMBO
solution at room temperature for at least 5 minutes before the beginning of each trial" – where do
the temperature treatments come in? Did you rear them at different temperatures, and then have
them adjust to room temperature before running your trial? If so, why?
Discussion
- Page 8 Paragraph 2 (~lines 18/19) – "35% of 770 lakes in Canada" - change Canada to Ontario.
The % would be higher if you were looking at Nova Scotia lakes, lower if out west, etc.
- Page 8 Paragraph 3 (~lines 50-54) – Please explain this last sentence – how might temp-
dependent kinetic effects on Ca transport explain Ca effects on mobility?
Overall, I think this paper is an excellent contribution to the literature.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The authors conduct a crossed, two factor experiment to ask the question of whether climate
warming and calcium decline affect the swimming behavior of Daphnia magna. I have questions
about the methodology and also about the relevance of the results to real world situations. I
suggest the authors spend some time addressing the complexities of studying animal behavior,
and also pay attention to the question of how we may best interpret their work.
1. Were all of the Daphnia magna from one clonal line? Genetics plays a pretty strong role
in Daphnia swimming behavior with, for example, different clones of the same species showing
different vertical migration behaviors.
2. Why were the Daphnia reared under conditions of 24 hours of light. The normal
condition is 16:8 hours day:night split.
3. Were the Ca levels actually measured in either the algae or the Daphnia? If the algae
were reared under conditions of normal calcium, they could be an important supplementary
source of Ca for the Daphnia.
4. I’m curious why the decision was made to test Daphnia movement only at room
temperature (which was unspecified). The Daphnia that had only known low temperatures may
have simply been exhibiting heat shock when they were moved to room temperature. They were
given only 5 minutes to adjust.
5. From my experience with years of study, zooplankton behavior is affected by quite a few
unexpected things. Time of day, odd shadows and reflections in the observation arena, and light
polarization are all things that I’ve had to standardize in my own work. If you simply watch
Daphnia in a tank, there are times when they will stay near the bottom, hardly moving and other
times when they will congregate along one edge, etc. With all of this in mind I think the authors
need to better describe their experimental setup.
6. Behaviorists have learned to reduce the effects of uncontrolled factors with techniques
such as performing different trials in a factorial experiment such that each combination of factors
is replicated in each time block throughout the days of the experiment. In this case, trials with
each combination of temperature and Ca level would be conducted at different times, every day
until all 10 replicates were finished. Moreover, the trials would not be done in the same order
within each time block. Did the authors follow a procedure such as this, or anything like it?
7. What were the reasons for choosing AIC and the nlme package over an ordinary
ANOVA or regression model?
8. Were the Daphnia measured for body length? This is an important point because
swimming behavior is strongly affected by body size (see references in the authors’ citation list).
It’s likely the case that animals in the low calcium treatments were simply smaller and thus had
different movement patterns than the other animals.
9. It’s not at all reasonable to extrapolate the results from these experiments to zooplankton
movement in nature. The Daphnia in the small diameter pipettes would have been in a strange
light environment and would also have been completely aware of the walls of the tube. Normal
grazing and horizontal movements would have been restricted. Studying behavior in pipettes is
somewhat like watching hamsters on an exercise wheel. That said, hamster wheels do give an
indication of overall physiological condition of the test animals, and that’s likely the best
interpretation of the results from this study. With this experiment, the authors may simply be
asking, how healthy are Daphnia at low levels of Ca and low temperatures? I think an
explanation like this of the relevance of the authors’ results to the real world needs to be added to
the manuscript.
10. What would be the result in the AIC analyses if the lowest Ca level was left out? I’m
wondering because the lowest Ca level may simply represent the behavior of inviable or
moribund animals, and this may be driving the finding of significant interactions between Ca and
temperature.

I find that the authors have made serious efforts to address my concerns. By and large this is
satisfactory, but the two major concerns remains; the methodology and the range of Ca-
concentrations. There is no doubt that this method is stressful to the animals, but so will
admittedly most methods that require small volumes in 2D-space. I would still argue that the
levels are too high to really capture Ca-stress. If the point is to asssess the interaction between Ca
x temp, then both parameters should cover a gradient from high to low stress. You refer to the
levels in Great lakes, but Canadian Shield lakes would presumably be way below these levels. I´d
like to see this point justified even more properly.

Our response
We used a wide range of Ca levels (from 1mg/L to 31 mg/L). So we actually covered a gradient
from high to low stress in both Ca and temperature. Ca levels below 1mg/L increases Daphnia
mortality to a point where it is difficult to keep enough individuals alive to run experiments. We
have now better justified this point in the manuscript: “Ca levels around 1.5 mg/L is the limit of
reproduction and survival recorded for Daphnia” (l. 112)
