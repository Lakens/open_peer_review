On moment of velocity (MoV) for signal analysis
The investigators introduce the concept of moment of velocity (MoV) for signal analysis. As a
case study, they compare the performance of moment of velocity to a standard Hilbert transform
based approach for R wave identification in human ECG signals. They found that their approach
was more robust to noise.
Analysis of biosignals is an important topic. In particular, the electrocardiogram is of great
interest in medicine. Its morphology and the timing of the waves can provide important
information concerning cardiac health.
I am not sure how convincing the author case study is. There is just one example. Furthermore, I
am unsure as to what the authors are trying to detect. In Figure 2, there are obviously a lot of
spikes and randomness in the instantaneous frequency. The authors need to explain it. What do
the deflections mean? Why is there a burst in the middle? Why aren't the deflections symmetric
with respect to the time series? (middle panels).
The authors display the MoV in the lower panels. There are a pair of deflections that seem to
coincide with the R waves of the ECG in the top panels. But so what? This is not hard to do.
Adding random noise to the system and still detecting the R waves is also not so impressive.
There is very limited random noise. A threshold could also be used to detect the R wave peaks,
even with the random noise.
What exactly is being detected and measured? Identification means? The timing of the peak of the
R wave? Because it could also mean to classify R waves of differing morphology, among other
things. The authors should that state that the purpose of the MoV algorithm is for R peak timing
detection if that is true.
In Figure 3 there are very clean signals. So it is not surprising that the MoV finds the peaks. I
would like to see the MoV find the peaks in data with large motion artifact, very irregular
heartbeat, and large level of noise - noise on the order or much greater than the signal magnitude,
and nonrandom noise such as spikes and chirps.
There are grammatical errors in the manuscript. Also, some descriptions seem unnecessary, such
as the ECG waveform components and Figure 1.

The manuscript describes a mathematical tool that can be used to provide a more numerically
stable estimate for the instantaneous frequency of a time-dependent one-dimensional signal. The
work is certainly new to me, and the methods and the results when applied to an openly
accessible database are very well described and the conclusions are justified. I only have two
areas where the paper could be improved. The first is that the presentation of the data and the
results could use a standard method for specifying the performance. At the moment, the number
of false negatives (FNs) and false positives (FPs) are given in Figure 4, but the number alone only
shows that the method presented is superior to Benitez's method - no total number of examples is
given. A more conventional representation, either based on the the confusion matrix or,
preferably, the Receiver-Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve should be given. In addition, it
appears that the results may only relate to one of the MIT/BITH examples present in the
database. It would be better to be more explicit about which of the examples have been used and
give more than one example. For instance, are the results typical and in what circumstances/for
which examples does the method fail?
If these comments are addressed suitably, I would recommend publication.

Comments to authors.
This is an interesting manuscript which presents an alternative method for calculating
instantaneous frequency based on a quaternion type representation, which appears to have
improved performance against noise when applied to ECG records.
I found the development of the MoV framework a little terse – it could benefit from an expanded
treatment. Points to address are
1. Page 3 “MoV has a linear relationship with IF”. It would be useful to elucidate this in more
detail, what exactly is meant by “linear relationship”
2. The material in equation 3.2 – 3.6 needs a more systematic treatment and introduction. Thus
why is this model appropriate for neurophysiological time series?
3. The terms in equations 3.2 need defined and introduced, and a link provided to the analytic
signal representation, where, for example, the concept of mass does not make sense?
4. Equation 3.3 needs completed, include a LHS term for clarity and define your unit vectors i, j,
k.
5. It would be useful to comment on the broader context of the MoV measure. There is
considerable interest in instantaneous phase and phase coupling measures, but instantaneous
phase is only mentioned briefly in the Appendix. The relationship between MoV and
instantaneous phase should be explained in the methods section.
6. An alternative approach to calculating IF is the use of complex wavelets, again a comment on
how MoV compares to complex wavelets would help provide a clearer context for the work.
The other structural issue I wondered about was the presentation of the results. A single ECG
example is presented, taken from an online data base, which presumably has more entries. It
would make a more convincing case if the MoV could be applied across a number of data sets to
achieve a stronger validation.

This is reviewer #3 from before. I am happy with the changes made. I have one minor point - in
the conclusions the point is made that the performance of the MOV method is better than the
comparison below 18dB SNR. It would be useful to indicate if this is within the range typically
seen for ECG recordings.

Title: On moment of velocity (MoV) for signal analysis
Author: Dorraki et al
To: Prof. R. Kerry Rowe, Editor
Dear Kerry,
Re: Reply to reviewers on RSOS-180975
Many thanks for the valuable comments on our paper RSOS-180975. We have pleasure in attaching an
updated manuscript and our point-by-point response to the comments is given below.
Best regards,
Mohsen Dorraki et al.
Reviewer#1: I am not sure how convincing the author case study is. There is just one example.
Author reply: We agree.
Author action: We now increase the number of examples to 22 time series. Table 1 containing related
results such as false positive, false negative, detection error rate, sensitivity, and positive predictive values
is added to the manuscript. Moreover, in Table 2 the R-wave identification accuracy for each individual
subject is calculated using the MoV and the Benitez approaches.
Reviewer#1: Furthermore, I am unsure as to what the authors are trying to detect. In Figure 2, there are
obviously a lot of spikes and randomness in the instantaneous frequency. The authors need to explain it.
What do the deflections mean? Why is there a burst in the middle? Why aren't the deflections symmetric
with respect to the time series? (middle panels).
Author reply: We did in fact discuss this point in the second paragraph of introduction. We argue in this
paragraph that the application of IF is limited for multicomponent signals, because instantaneous
frequency (IF) normally is a fluctuating waveform, which is sensitive to the amplitudes of the frequency
components. Therefore, the interpretation of spectral information is often severely constrained by the
nonlinear nature of the instantaneous frequency. We highlighted that instantaneous frequency as a
function of time can possess large spikes and negative values. In Appendix in Fig. 5 (d) we showed how a DC
offset in the original signal leads to spikes and negative values in the IF.
In Fig. 2, we directly compare IF and MoV waveforms to show that IF contains frequency information of the
signal under analysis, the information can be seen more clearly when we remove the dominator of formula.
Author action: As requested by reviewer, we clarify this further by adding to the end of third paragraph in
section 4(a): “Considering Fig. 2, although, the IF waveforms possess the frequency information of the ECG
signal under analysis, the information is cluttered with large spikes and negative values. The influence of DC
offset, riding waves, and abrupt changes of signal are the main causes of these large spikes and negative IF
values. The use of MoV can overcome this problem by removing the numerator that can be very small in
the original formula. “
Reviewer#1: The authors display the MoV in the lower panels. There are a pair of deflections that seem to
coincide with the R waves of the ECG in the top panels. But so what? This is not hard to do. Adding random
noise to the system and still detecting the R waves is also not so impressive. There is very limited random
noise. A threshold could also be used to detect the R wave peaks, even with the random noise.
Author reply: In the figure, the objective is to demonstrate that how robust MoV is to noise in comparison
to IF.
Author action: In order to illustrate the performance of the MoV approach we now apply the method on a
group of 22 signals. The related results are provided in Tables 1 and 2.
Reviewer#1: What exactly is being detected and measured? Identification means? The timing of the peak
of the R wave? Because it could also mean to classify R waves of differing morphology, among other things.
The authors should that state that the purpose of the MoV algorithm is for R peak timing detection if that is
true.
Author reply: The particular scope of this paper is proposing MoV as a signal processing tool that can be
used in many practical applications. The timing of the peak of R wave can potentially be extended as a MoV
application in future studies; however, our scope is focused on investigating ECG signal as a case example
to detect the exact location of R peak.
Author action: No action.
Reviewer#1: In Figure 3 there are very clean signals. So it is not surprising that the MoV finds the peaks. I
would like to see the MoV find the peaks in data with large motion artifact, very irregular heartbeat, and
large level of noise - noise on the order or much greater than the signal magnitude, and nonrandom noise
such as spikes and chirps.
Author reply: We agree.
Author action: We now show the performance of MoV on irregular heartbeats containing artifacts and
noise in Fig. 3. Moreover, we show the result for a collection of 22 ECG signals with various shapes.
Reviewer#1: There are grammatical errors in the manuscript. Also, some descriptions seem unnecessary,
such as the ECG waveform components and Figure 1.
Author reply: We agree.
Author action: We now remove Figure 1 and related additional descriptions. The grammatical errors are
now corrected.
Reviewer#2: I only have two areas where the paper could be improved. The first is that the presentation of
the data and the results could use a standard method for specifying the performance. At the moment, the
number of false negatives (FNs) and false positives (FPs) are given in Figure 4, but the number alone only
shows that the method presented is superior to Benitez's method - no total number of examples is given. A
more conventional representation, either based on the the confusion matrix or, preferably, the Receiver-
Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve should be given.
Author reply: We agree.
Author action: We now add Table 1 so that the basic terms in the confusion matrix are indicated in it.
Reviewer#2: In addition, it appears that the results may only relate to one of the MIT/BITH examples
present in the database. It would be better to be more explicit about which of the examples have been
used and give more than one example. For instance, are the results typical and in what circumstances/for
which examples does the method fail?
Author reply: We agree.
Author action: We now increase the number of examples to 22 time series. Table 1 containing related
results such as false positive, false negative, detection error rate, sensitivity, and positive predictive values
are added to the manuscript. Moreover, in Table 2 the R-wave identification accuracy for each individual
subject is calculated using the MoV and the Benitez approaches.
Reviewer#3: Page 3 “MoV has a linear relationship with IF”. It would be useful to elucidate this in more
detail, what exactly is meant by “linear relationship”.
Author reply: We agree that this was not appropriate.
Author action: We now remove the term “linear relationship.”
Reviewer#3: The material in equation 3.2 – 3.6 needs a more systematic treatment and introduction. Thus
why is this model appropriate for neurophysiological time series?
Author reply: We defined the MoV as IF without the dominator included, and further the descriptions in
Eq. 3.2 to 3.6 justify the physical basis of MoV using an angular momentum concept. The main reason this is
appropriate for ECGs is that MoV is a convenient tool for analysis of non-stationary signals. We show that
MoV significantly outperforms IF that is used for non-stationary signals as well, especially under noisy
conditions.
In addition to describing MoV properties, we did in fact discuss the properties of ECG time series in the
Section 4, as follows: “ECG signals are transient, time varying, and non-stationary. The fact that ECG signals
are non-stationary imposes a number of limitations on using basic time and frequency analyses. Most time
and frequency analyses are established on the assumption that signals are stationary or locally stationary.
Therefore, these methods cannot represent all the characteristics of ECG signals.”
Author action: We have now extended the paragraph to further clarify the concept.
Reviewer#3: The terms in equations 3.2 need defined and introduced, and a link provided to the analytic
signal representation, where, for example, the concept of mass does not make sense? Equation 3.3 needs
completed, include a LHS term for clarity and define your unit vectors i, j, k.
Author reply: We agree
Author action: We clarify this further by rewriting Section 3:
“The initial concept of MoV is derived by analogy from angular momentum in the field of particle dynamics.
For an analytic signal, the imaginary part is the Hilbert transform of its real part that is the original signal.
Therefore, the original signal is always orthogonal to the Hilbert transform of the waveform. Similarly, the
angular momentum vector is perpendicular to the position vector. The angular momentum coordinate
system is shown in Fig. 1 (a). As an example, a signal and the Hilbert transform analytic plane is
demonstrated in Fig. 1 (b) for the case when x(t) = sin(t).
(a) (b)
Fig. 1 (a) Angular momentum coordinate system, and (b) signal and the Hilbert transform analytic plane for x(t) = sin(t)
The angular momentum for a moving particle of unit mass is defined as
L = r × v, (1)
where r is the position vector of particle and v is particle velocity. If the vectors r and v are resolved into
components and the cross-product formula is applied we obtain,
L= , (2)
where i, j, k, are the standard unit vectors, and indices show the x, y and z components of the vectors.
Assuming the particle moves in the x-y plane, the angular momentum is perpendicular to the x-y plane and
Equation 2 is reduced to only its z components defined by the scalar
In terms of signal and the Hilbert transform analytic plan, we replace , , and in Equation 3 by ,
H and MoV, respectively. Therefore, MoV is defined as:”
Reviewer#3: It would be useful to comment on the broader context of the MoV measure. There is
considerable interest in instantaneous phase and phase coupling measures, but instantaneous phase is only
mentioned briefly in the Appendix. The relationship between MoV and instantaneous phase should be
explained in the methods section.
Author reply: We agree
Author action: The instantaneous phase equation and its relationship with MoV is added now to the
manuscript.
Reviewer#3: An alternative approach to calculating IF is the use of complex wavelets, again a comment on
how MoV compares to complex wavelets would help provide a clearer context for the work.
Author reply: We thank the reviewer for this helpful comment. We have employed the IF obtain by
employing complex wavelets and the results outperform IF obtained from the Hilbert transform. However,
the MoV still yields superior outcomes, especially in noisy conditions.
Author action: We have added a new panel in Fig 2 showing IF obtained from the complex wavelet
approach. Therefore, the explanations are changed now to:
“Figure 2 illustrates ECG, corresponding instantaneous frequency, and MoV curves for a patient from
physionet database [8]. Here, IF is obtained from two different approaches, the Hilbert transform and
complex wavelet. The particular complex wavelet method we used is based on the Morse wavelet [23, 24].
Additionally, 20 dB SNR noise is intentionally added to the signal and the corresponding IF and MoV
waveforms are shown. In this stage, in order to directly compare IF and MoV, no filtering or pre-processing
steps are carried out on the ECG.
Considering Fig. 2, although, the IF waveforms possess the frequency information of the ECG signal under
analysis, the information is cluttered with large spikes and negative values, particularly in IF obtained from
the Hilbert transform. The influence of DC offset, riding waves, and abrupt changes of signal are the main
causes of these large spikes and negative IF values. The use of MoV can overcome this problem by
removing the numerator that can be very small in the original formula.”
Fig. 2, For qualitative comparison of IF and MoV, (a) the characteristic heartbeat, corresponding (b) instantaneous frequency obtained from the
Hilbert transform, (c) instantaneous frequency obtained from complex wavelet, and (d) MoV are shown for a normal patient. On the right, we have
added 20 dB SNR Gaussian white noise to the ECG in order to illustrate the affect of noise.
Reviewer#3: The other structural issue I wondered about was the presentation of the results. A single ECG
example is presented, taken from an online data base, which presumably has more entries. It would make a
more convincing case if the MoV could be applied across a number of data sets to achieve a stronger
validation.
Author reply: We agree.
Author action: We now increase the number of examples to 22 time series. Table 1 contains related results
such as false positive, false negative, detection error rate, sensitivity, and positive predictive values, which
are added to the manuscript. Moreover, in Table 2 the R-wave identification accuracy for each individual
subject is calculated using MoV and the Benitez method.
Reviewer#3: Minor
1. Page 2. “Therefore, they are useless for a signal” I would say “not appropriate” instead of “useless”
2. Page 3, section 3, Typo “dominator”
3. Page 5. “An investigation of ECG signals based on…” Poor grammar here.
4. Page 6, Figure 2. No units are included for MoV plots.
Author reply: We agree.
Author action: Done.

To: Prof. R. Kerry Rowe, Editor
Dear Kerry,
Re: Reply to reviewers on RSOS-182001
Many thanks for the valuable comments on our paper RSOS-182001. We have pleasure in attaching an
updated manuscript and our point-by-point response to the comments is given below.
Best regards,
Mohsen Dorraki et al.
Editor comments: Reviewer 1 continues to have some concerns with the paper, including the quality of the
written English.
Author reply: Thank you.
Author action: The manuscript has been proof read and corrected by native English speakers
Reviewer#1: The manuscript should be refined for English grammatical structure and phraseology.
Author reply: Thank you.
Author action: The manuscript has been proof read and corrected by native English speakers
Reviewer#1: Authors have created 5 figures and 2 tables. I think they are allowed another figure, in which
case they should create another like Figure 3, with different and more difficult data.
Author reply: We agree.
Author action: We have now added one more figure illustrating patient No. 104’s heartbeat characteristics,
corresponding MoV, and detected R waves.
Figure 3: (a) Characteristic heartbeat of subject 104 from the MIT/BIH arrhythmia database [8], (b) Corresponding MoV, and (c)
ECG tracing with the R-wave identified using the proposed approach.
Moreover, the last paragraph in the Section 4(a) now reads: “Fig. 3.a and Fig. 4.a demonstrate two
normalized heartbeat characteristics of 10 seconds from patient 104 and 122 with manually annotated R
waves. The corresponding moment of velocity curves are shown in Fig. 3.b and Fig. 4.b. The R waves
detected using the algorithm are demonstrated in the lower panels, and they correctly match the manual
annotations.”
Reviewer#1: Explanation of Figure 5 needs remedy. Explain why red signal has similar instantaneous phase
to blue signal, but yellow signal is flat (panel c). Explain why red versus yellow signals are inverted in panel
d.
Author reply: We agree.
Author action: We clarify this further by rewriting Appendix I:
“Negative values may appear in the IF waveforms, which is meaningless physically. DC offsets, riding waves,
and abrupt changes in the signal under analysis can be the main cause of negative IF. Fig. 6 shows that how
DC offset may potentially influence the sign of instantaneous frequency. Fig. 6(a) demonstrates three
signals with different DC term, s(t)=sin(2pt), sin(2pt)+0.5, and sin(2pt)+2. In Fig. 6(b) the trajectory of the
signals vs their Hilbert transforms are shown. The trajectory for all the signals is a circle with different
centres. Finally, the corresponding instantaneous phase and frequency diagrams are shown in Fig. 6(c) and
6(d) respectively.
Figure 6: Signals with different DC term and their instantaneous parameters.
(i) No DC offset
In case the DC offset is zero, s(t)= sin(2pt), the trajectory of signal and Hilbert transform is a circle that its
centre is exactly located on the origin (blue circle in Fig. 6(b)). Therefore, a point moving on the circle with a
constant angular speed (<U+03C9>) possesses a linear instantaneous phase with constant slope (blue line in Fig.
6(c)). The corresponding IF that is a straight line is show in Fig. 6(d).
(ii) Low DC offset
In presence of low amount of DC offset less than the signal amplitude, s(t)= sin(2pt)+0.5, the origin is still
located in the Hilbert transform circle but is not located exactly on the centre of the circle (red circle in Fig.
6(b)). Thus, for a point turning on the circle with constant <U+03C9>, the phase slope is time varying. It may be seen
that from the blue curve in Fig. 6(c) that the slope is always positive, therefore the corresponding
instantaneous frequency possesses some positive peaks in major phase variations.
(iii) High DC offset
In this case, s(t)= sin(2pt)+2, the origin is located out of the Hilbert circle (brown circle in Fig. 6(b)).
Therefore, for a moving point with constant <U+03C9> the instantaneous phase possesses negative slope in each
period. These negative slopes in instantaneous phase diagram cause negative values in the corresponding
IF (brown curve in Fig. 6(d)).”
Reviewer#3: I am happy with the changes made. I have one minor point - in the conclusions the point is
made that the performance of the MOV method is better than the comparison below 18dB SNR. It would
be useful to indicate if this is within the range typically seen for ECG recordings.
Author reply: It is difficult to measure SNR in ECG signals precisely as one is not perfectly capable of
distinguishing signal from noise after recording. In addition, the MoV approach outperforms the approach
of Benitez et al in all conditions; moreover, it shows superior performance when we intentionally add noise
to the signals.
Author action: We have now altered the last sentence in the Conclusion “For 18 dB SNR or less, the MoV
approach shows reduced error.” To now read “The MoV approach demonstrates reduced error especially
for 18 dB SNR or less. The result also suggests that MoV may be considered as an alternative method to IF
or other instantaneous parameters in other non-stationary applications, particularly in noisy conditions.”
