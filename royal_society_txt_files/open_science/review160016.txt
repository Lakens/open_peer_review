In their study, Sainudiin and Véber make multiple valuable contributions to the mathematics
relating to phylogenetic trees - specifically to the probability of trees produced by a beta-splitting
process. These contributions include:
(1) Extending (generalising) the beta-splitting model for evolutionary trees of Blum and François,
by allowing the probability distribution for tip node intervals to be asymmetric, which is in many
cases biologically relevant.
(2) Providing a clear and detailed reformulation of the model, which may result in the beta-
splitting model being more widely used in phylogenetics.
(3) Deriving the prior probabilities for all combinations of non-planar/planar and
unranked/ranked trees, in some cases provided that the beta distribution is symmetric (a = ß).
(4) Introducing a corresponding continuous-time process, equivalent in the sense that the
embedded discrete trees have equal probabilities under both discrete and continuous processes.
The manuscript is polished, cohesive and complete. I could not find any faults in the
mathematical proofs, however I am a computational biologist (not a mathematician). A
researcher who specialises in the mathematics of phylogenetic trees would be able to check the
proofs and lemmas with far greater certainty.
While I unreservedly recommend this manuscript for publication as-is, I have one suggestion the
authors can choose to follow if they agree it improves their study. While the range of tree
probability distributions from ß = -1 to ß = positive infinity is very large, at the lower limit the
only tree with non-zero probability is the comb tree. In contrast at the upper limit the balanced
tree is the most probable tree, but other trees have non-zero probability. Perhaps to give an idea
of the range of tree probability distributions the authors could construct a figure which plots the
probability of the comb tree and of the balanced tree as the number of tips "n" increases. This
figure would include (at least) the cases ß = 0 (the Yule model) and ß = positive infinity.

Dear Dr Veber
On behalf of the Editors, I am pleased to inform you that your Manuscript RSOS-160016 entitled
"A Beta-splitting Model for Evolutionary Trees" has been accepted for publication in Royal
Society Open Science subject to minor revision in accordance with the referee suggestions. Please
find the referees' comments at the end of this email.
The reviewers and handling editors have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, I invite you to respond to the comments and revise your
manuscript.
• Ethics statement
If your study uses humans or animals please include details of the ethical approval received,
including the name of the committee that granted approval. For human studies please also detail
whether informed consent was obtained. For field studies on animals please include details of all
permissions, licences and/or approvals granted to carry out the fieldwork.
• Data accessibility
It is a condition of publication that all supporting data are made available either as
supplementary information or preferably in a suitable permanent repository. The data
accessibility section should state where the article's supporting data can be accessed. This section
should also include details, where possible of where to access other relevant research materials
such as statistical tools, protocols, software etc can be accessed. If the data has been deposited in
an external repository this section should list the database, accession number and link to the DOI
for all data from the article that has been made publicly available. Data sets that have been
deposited in an external repository and have a DOI should also be appropriately cited in the
manuscript and included in the reference list.
If you wish to submit your supporting data or code to Dryad (http://datadryad.org/), or modify
your current submission to dryad, please use the following link:

• Competing interests
Please declare any financial or non-financial competing interests, or state that you have no
competing interests.
• Authors’ contributions
All submissions, other than those with a single author, must include an Authors’ Contributions
section which individually lists the specific contribution of each author. The list of Authors
should meet all of the following criteria; 1) substantial contributions to conception and design, or
acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article or revising it
critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the version to be published.
All contributors who do not meet all of these criteria should be included in the
acknowledgements.
We suggest the following format:
AB carried out the molecular lab work, participated in data analysis, carried out sequence
alignments, participated in the design of the study and drafted the manuscript; CD carried out
the statistical analyses; EF collected field data; GH conceived of the study, designed the study,
coordinated the study and helped draft the manuscript. All authors gave final approval for
publication.
• Acknowledgements
Please acknowledge anyone who contributed to the study but did not meet the authorship
criteria.
• Funding statement
Please list the source of funding for each author.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript within 7 days (i.e. by the 16-Apr-2016). If you do not think
you will be able to meet this date please let me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account

4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) Included your supplementary files in a format you are happy with (no line numbers,
vancouver referencing, track changes removed etc) as these files will NOT be edited in
production
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look
forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get
in touch.
Best wishes

Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-160016)
We would like to thank the referees for their careful reading of the paper, and Referee 1 for his
relevant suggestion. Because the orders of magnitude of the probabilities of a comb/fully
balanced tree are very variable (and even their logarithms in fact), we felt that a graph could be
difficult to read. Instead we added a table with these probabilities for different values of the
number of tips, and for beta=-1, 0, +infty. We also added a paragraph explaining shortly how
these numbers were obtained. See the end of Section 3.
