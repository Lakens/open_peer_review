Review of "Probing layered arc crust in the Lesser Antilles using Receiver Functions" by
Schlaphorst et al., for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
This is an interesting paper concerning the variable crustal structure along the Lesser Antilles
Arc. The authors supplement the receiver function, HK stacking approach of Zhu & Kanamori
(2000) with an inversion approach that utilises petrologically-derived constraints on crustal
structure. Adding constraint to HK analysis is critical in an arc setting such as this, since the basic
assumption that underpins the H-K method, namely that the largest amplitude P-to-S conversion
in the receiver functions is from the Moho, almost certainly breaks down.
I see no reason why this paper won't eventually be published in Royal Society Open Science, but I
think the authors need to work a little harder on the piece in the first instance. The main
shortcoming of the paper is the documentation of the analysis. Perhaps I am being unreasonably
dense, but I don't quite follow how the petrological and seismological data have been combined
3
in a single inversion. I put my lack of understanding down to the lack of technical detail in the
paper, which should be easy enough for the authors to address. More on all this below. A second
area where the paper can be improved is in its tectonic implications. Though lots of literature
from the region is discussed, it is never made explicitly clear what we still don't know, and how
the present study will fill our knowledge gap from a tectonic/subduction point of view. Overall,
my comments amount to moderate, but hopefully easy-to-address, corrections
Section 1.1 - Geological background
***********************************
This section mainly comprises seismological, not geological detail, so needs re-jigging if it is to
match the section title. Perhaps the section heading is meant to be "Overview"? Here, early on in
the paper, the reader needs to be presented with a clearer link between the geological/tectonic
problem at hand and the seismological tools available to address it. Consider dedicating a figure
to introducing the HK stacking method, since many petrological readers of this work will not
likely be familiar with it. I know the HK detail comes later, but I think some kind of brief
introduction is needed here to motivate the study.
* Line 50 - it is stated that the Moho marks a sharp change in seismic velocity. This is true in
many localities, but certainly not in arc settings where I would, to be honest, always expect the
HK method to fail. Perhaps emphasise in this section that the commonly-used HK stacking
method proceeds on the assumption that the largest amplitude P-to-S conversions come from the
Moho. Where it does not, the method is expected to break down. It can then be made clear to the
reader that additional information is needed to resolve structure.
Section 1.2 - The Lesser Antilles
**********************************
Line 101 - citation needed for the age of the magmatism.
Lines 114-116 - these statements need a citation or two.
Line 125 - "triple point" should be "triple junction" (the former is thermodynamics terminology).
Line 137 - "displays topographic expression..." sounds odd. Re-word.
Section 1.3 - Crustal structure of the Lesser Antilles
******************************************************
Consider adding a table here to document the seismological and gravity constraints you have for
the islands along the LAA. Petrological detail could be added to this too.
Line 151 - it would be helpful to the reader to know more about how Arnaiz-Rodrígues et al. 2016
and others calculate Moho depths. HK analysis, or more sophisticated inversions for Vs as a
function of depth?
Section 2 - Receiver functions and H–K stacking
***********************************************
Line 193 - incidence angles will not be normal to sub-surface layering for these epicentral
distances. Reword.
Line 195 - what magnitude range and for what time periods are data searched?
4
* It is nice to see the authors presenting their receiver function data in Figure 2, including pre-P-
wave signals. It is absolutely correct to show the pre-P-wave signals. However, some comment
should be made on the data quality: the pre-P-wave amplitudes at Martinique exceed those of the
Moho reverberations (PpPs and PpSs). St Vincent is better, but not by much.
* On the subject of data, one of the reasons I found it difficult to follow precisely what analysis is
being done in this paper has to do with the paucity of figures. I would like to see far more
examples of HK stacks and seismograms in the paper. Supplemental materials should then
house whatever is not shown in the main body of the text.
* Figure 2 - shading on the HK plots needs a scale bar so the reader can properly understand
what the s(H,K) function looks like. Also, there are insufficient contour labels for them to make
sense. What is the inner contour?
* I would like to see a comparison of the HK results with and without the petrological data. Only
then will the reader truly know how much is being gained from the addition of the latter.
* Line 240 - cite Zhu and Kanamori (2000) here too, since they quantified the impact of Vp
uncertainty on final HK solutions.
* On the subject of errors, more detail is needed here.
It is stated in lines 215-217 that "The H–K stacking method follows the work of Zhu & Kanamori
(2000), Dugda et al. (2005) and Dugda & Nyblade (2006), applying a bootstrapping algorithm
(Efron & Tibshirani, 1991)."
Zhu & Kanamori (2000) don't use bootstrapping to calculate their errors in the way that Dugda
does. I would like to see the authors present errors according to Zhu and Kanamori (2000), as
well as from the bootstrapping. I assume from line 244 that the errors presented are derived from
the standard deviation(?) of the results in the bootstrap analysis? Precisely what is varied in the
bootstrap analysis though (events, stacking weights)? With so few events used for some stations
(only 8 at St Vincent, 2 at station SKI), it is hardly surprising that the errors presented are so low
compared to those that would be gleaned from the s(H,k) surfaces.
* Lines 260-261 - it is stated that:
"In the case of multiple discontinuities the H–K stacking can only identify the strongest one."
Hmmm - not really. The problem with having multiple strong velocity contrasts is that the HK
stacking routine effectively muddles up receiver function peaks from both in s(H,K), the result of
which is just a mess, not one particular discontinuity.
Section 3 - Inversion for a layered crust
*****************************************
* Line 315-317 - "Our tests show that a slight modification in vP/vS in layers (2), (2a) and/or (3)
do not change the overall results".
Perhaps I have missed something, but I don't believe the reader yet knows how you are obtaining
your results? How are the petrologically-derived crustal properties used to help interpret the
receiver functions?
5
* Page 11 - ok, here we learn a bit more about the inversion method, but I am lacking enough
detail here to understand what's going on.
- Lines 330-331 - can you say a few things about the Ammon et al., (1990) method and
how it is used to invert the RF data for the upper 5km? This inversion will involve a trade-off
between model roughness and data fitting (see Ammon Figure 4), so some sense for how the
inversion is set up will be important. How much of the receiver function is used in the inversion
for this upper 5km of structure? I would normally expect a figure or two to accompany a discrete
piece of analysis like this, if only in supplementary materials.
- Why is a separate inversion strategy adopted for the deeper crust (MCD and Moho)?
* Lines 364-367:
"No satisfactory (low <U+03C7>2) solutions are obtained with such large vP/vS values, indicating that
large pockets of interconnected melt are unlikely beneath the LAA, consistent with the H–K
stacking results and Arnaiz-Rodrigues et al (2016) and the textural evidence from xenoliths."
See also comments on line 442 concerning melt.
* Figure 3 - the reader needs to see more examples of the inversion procedure, not just a
schematic showing its principles.
* Lines 428-432 - what confuses me is why a Moho and MCD at some stations (as shown in
Figure 4) would't result in two peaks on the s(H,K) surfaces. This will be easier to assess once
more are shown in the paper (and in supplemental materials).
Section 5. Discussion and conclusion
************************************
* Line 442 - "The most likely explanation for our observations".
Specifically what observations?
* Line 457 - note that melt can actually result in even higher Vp/Vs ratios than 2 (e.g., 2.2: Dugda
et al., 2005). However, this citation, and the Hammond et al., (2011) paper you cite here both
refer to extremely mafic crust in Africa, where Vp/Vs is compositionally elevated too. Hence, the
fact that you see bulk VpVs ratios <2 cannot necessarily be used as cast iron evidence that the
crust you are studying is melt free. I think you need to look more at composition first. In your
tectonic setting, the abundance of quartz may (or may not?) contribute to VpVs ratio observations
owing to its extremely low Poisson's ratio. Just explore melt versus composition issues a bit more
and lead the reader to the non-melt conclusion in a more robust way.
* By the time I got to the end of this paper, I felt slightly flat in terms of what we have learned that
is new. Is the goal of this work to constrain crustal structure, or to constrain and interpret it too?
In short, how does this work change the way we think about the Antilles?
* Line 492 - are all seismograms available via IRIS? If not, say which WI agency holds them.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
In this paper, the authors present new receiver function modelling results based on broadband
seismic station data from islands in the Lesser Antilles Arc. The new results demonstrate that
there are significant along-arc variations in crustal structure, with potentially significant changes
in the impedance contrast of major discontinuities such as the Moho, which can cause
conventional methods like H-K stacking to fail. Overall, this is a well written and presented paper
which I enjoyed reading. However, I do think that a number of largely minor modifications
(listed below) are required before publication can proceed.
(1) Line 28: I presume that should be “10 to 25 km depth”…?
(2) Line 62: One might argue that references from the 1970s are not ideal for backing up this
claim; technology has advanced a long way since then, so a more subtle Moho may be visible to
modern systems.
(3) Lines 70-71: First use of “velocity “ in this sentence is somewhat redundant.
(4) Line 99: Smith et al., 2013 should not be in parenthesis.
(5) Line 121: Wadge and Shepherd, 1984 should not be in parenthesis.
(6) Line 164: Boynton et al., 1979 should not be in parenthesis.
7
(7) Line 193: I think “normal to the subsurface layering” is somewhat of an exaggeration – the
incoming paths will be subvertical for mantle P-waves.
(8) Line 215: The sentence starting on this line doesn’t quite make sense – I presume that
bootstrapping only forms a part of the procedure …….
(9) Line 224: Equation 1 doesn’t make sense – perhaps something went wrong with the
conversion to PDF? I don’t see the function r_n(t) or use of the subscript n on the RHS.
(10) Line 248: Why two decimal places - are the depths resolvable to the 10 m level? I would have
thought that 28.3 +/- 1.1 km would be a more reasonable way to express it. This also occurs
elsewhere.
(11) Section 3: The need to move beyond H-K stacking is well described. The method that is
proposed instead seems to rely on some rather strong assumptions, including the number of
layers and the range of Vp/Vs values permitted. A layer stripping approach also appears to be
adopted (if I understand correctly) in which the top 5 km is discretized into 1 km thick layers and
RF inversion is applied to constrain this region of the model only. I realise that petrological
constraints are used to justify the choices made, but I do wonder how a less “groomed” inversion
might work out e.g. by applying a neighbourhood algorithm or transD approach. While I’m not
suggesting that the authors go down this path, perhaps a little more discussion as to why this
more general approach is not suitable may be warranted.
(12) Results: While these are fine as far as they go, I don’t feel that they go far enough. Unless I’m
missing something, we get one figure showing a couple of H-K stacking examples with what look
like very noisy RFs and strong parameter trade-offs, and then a summary diagram of the results,
which show how the current results for Moho and MCD compare with previous results from the
literature. I feel that more information is required – perhaps in supplementary information –
which shows examples of observed and fitted waveforms for some, if not all waveforms, and
estimates of uncertainty. It would also be useful to see a few plots of the different 1-D models.
Plotting error bars for the two discontinuities in Figure 4 would be quite useful, for example.
(13) Line 455: Should be “...carried out...”
(14) Lines 458-459: Are the names in parenthesis supposed to be references?
(15) Discussion and conclusions: This section is generally fine, although in claiming that the
method applied has advantages over a purely seismological approach, it would be very useful to
have information on how well the models actually fit the data – this is key information for
ensuring that the inversion result is actually plausible as far as the data is concerned. And as
mentioned above, the H-K approach is only one way to make structural inferences from an RF,
and much more sophisticated schemes are available if a purely seismological approach is
favoured.

Review of "Probing layered arc crust in the Lesser Antilles using Receiver Functions" by
Schlaphorst et al., for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
This is an interesting paper concerning the variable crustal structure along the Lesser Antilles

structure. Adding constraint to HK analysis is critical in an arc setting such as this, since the basic

Comments to the Author(s)
In this paper, the authors present new receiver function modelling results based on broadband
seismic station data from islands in the Lesser Antilles Arc. The new results demonstrate that
there are significant along-arc variations in crustal structure, with potentially significant changes
in the impedance contrast of major discontinuities such as the Moho, which can cause
conventional methods like H-K stacking to fail. Overall, this is a well written and presented paper
which I enjoyed reading. However, I do think that a number of largely minor modifications
(listed below) are required before publication can proceed.
(1) Line 28: I presume that should be “10 to 25 km depth”…?
(2) Line 62: One might argue that references from the 1970s are not ideal for backing up this
claim; technology has advanced a long way since then, so a more subtle Moho may be visible to
modern systems.
(3) Lines 70-71: First use of “velocity “ in this sentence is somewhat redundant.
(4) Line 99: Smith et al., 2013 should not be in parenthesis.
(5) Line 121: Wadge and Shepherd, 1984 should not be in parenthesis.
(6) Line 164: Boynton et al., 1979 should not be in parenthesis.
(7) Line 193: I think “normal to the subsurface layering” is somewhat of an exaggeration – the
incoming paths will be subvertical for mantle P-waves.
(8) Line 215: The sentence starting on this line doesn’t quite make sense – I presume that
bootstrapping only forms a part of the procedure …….
(9) Line 224: Equation 1 doesn’t make sense – perhaps something went wrong with the
conversion to PDF? I don’t see the function r_n(t) or use of the subscript n on the RHS.
(10) Line 248: Why two decimal places - are the depths resolvable to the 10 m level? I would have
thought that 28.3 +/- 1.1 km would be a more reasonable way to express it. This also occurs
elsewhere.
(11) Section 3: The need to move beyond H-K stacking is well described. The method that is
proposed instead seems to rely on some rather strong assumptions, including the number of
layers and the range of Vp/Vs values permitted. A layer stripping approach also appears to be
adopted (if I understand correctly) in which the top 5 km is discretized into 1 km thick layers and
RF inversion is applied to constrain this region of the model only. I realise that petrological
constraints are used to justify the choices made, but I do wonder how a less “groomed” inversion
might work out e.g. by applying a neighbourhood algorithm or transD approach. While I’m not
suggesting that the authors go down this path, perhaps a little more discussion as to why this
more general approach is not suitable may be warranted.
(12) Results: While these are fine as far as they go, I don’t feel that they go far enough. Unless I’m
missing something, we get one figure showing a couple of H-K stacking examples with what look
like very noisy RFs and strong parameter trade-offs, and then a summary diagram of the results,
which show how the current results for Moho and MCD compare with previous results from the
15
literature. I feel that more information is required – perhaps in supplementary information –
which shows examples of observed and fitted waveforms for some, if not all waveforms, and
estimates of uncertainty. It would also be useful to see a few plots of the different 1-D models.
Plotting error bars for the two discontinuities in Figure 4 would be quite useful, for example.
(13) Line 455: Should be “...carried out...”
(14) Lines 458-459: Are the names in parenthesis supposed to be references?
(15) Discussion and conclusions: This section is generally fine, although in claiming that the
method applied has advantages over a purely seismological approach, it would be very useful to
have information on how well the models actually fit the data – this is key information for
ensuring that the inversion result is actually plausible as far as the data is concerned. And as
mentioned above, the H-K approach is only one way to make structural inferences from an RF,
and much more sophisticated schemes are available if a purely seismological approach is
favoured.

l comments:
a well written manuscript on the crustal structure beneath the Lesser Antilles Island arc using
r functions. Receiver functions are sensitive to strong velocity contrasts and are frequently used
stigate the crustal structure beneath seismic stations. This study combines different approaches
iver function analysis, and uses petrological information as a priori constraints. In this sense the
ch is novel. The receiver function results presented here generally show a strong imprint of a
ustal discontinuity that varies strongly in depth along the Lesser Antilles arc, and the Moho
lso seems to vary. The authors tentatively interpret the results in terms of variations in water
. The research is sound and proper reference is given to previous studies as far as I can judge.

We realised an error concerning the number of stations used during the revision. It should have read
29 instead of 23 (which can be seen in Table 1). We have corrected this in the manuscript.
We exchanged Figure 4 with a new version since some of the labels had a different font.

gree with the reviewer and have changed the title accordingly. Also, we have included more
mation about the aims of H–k stacking as suggested. We have, however, decided against showing
er figure about H–k in this paper, since it is shown in Figure 2 already and is not the major focus of this
H–K stacking method makes use of the difference between P- and S-wave velocities to estimate the

e 50 - it is stated that the Moho marks a sharp change in seismic velocity. This is true
any localities, but certainly not in arc settings where I would, to be honest, always
ct the HK method to fail. Perhaps emphasise in this section that the commonly-used
tacking method proceeds on the assumption that the largest amplitude P-to-S
ersions come from the Moho. Where it does not, the method is expected to break
n. It can then be made clear to the reader that additional information is needed to
ve structure.

weighting factors are chosen so that phases that are more apparent will be enhanced (Dugda et al.,

ons, while changing the value of vP using random, normally-distributed values with 95% of the values
ange of <U+2206>vP=±0.3 around a mean of 6.5 km s-1. At the same time, the weighting factors are chosen so
5% fall in <U+2206>w=±0.05 around the means of 0.6 for w1 and 0.3 for w2 (with w1+w2=1; <U+2211>w =1). The best
tion occurs at the location in H–K space where the three phases are stacked coherently (Zhu &
mori, 2000) among all possible cases in terms of varying vP and the weighting factors.”
es 260-261 - it is stated that:
e case of multiple discontinuities the H–K stacking can only identify the strongest
m - not really. The problem with having multiple strong velocity contrasts is that the
tacking routine effectively muddles up receiver function peaks from both in s(H,K), the
t of which is just a mess, not one particular discontinuity.
ree that we have to clarify this. If the RF peaks were separated the H–K stacking would only identify
ongest discontinuity unless the search parameters are specifically constrained to certain depths and/or
ratios. However, it is – like the reviewer is pointing out – much more likely that these peaks will
y and distort the RF. We have changed this sentence to address this issue.

tinuities will overlay and distort the RF to a point where H–K stacking may find values that do not

Why is a separate inversion strategy adopted for the deeper crust (MCD and Moho)?

10 Abstract
11
12 Oceanic arcs can provide insight into the processes of crustal growth and crustal
13 structure. In this work, changes in crustal thickness and composition along the
14 Lesser Antilles Arc (LAA) are analysed at 10 islands using receiver functions (RF)
15 inversions that combine seismological data with vP/vS ratios estimated based on
16 crustal lithology. We collected seismic data from various regional networks to
17 ensure station coverage for every major island in the LAA from Saba in the north
18 to Grenada in the south. RFs show the subsurface response of an incoming signal
19 assuming horizontal layering, where phase conversions highlight discontinuities
20 beneath a station. In most regions of the Earth the Mohorovicic discontinuity
21 (Moho) is seismically stronger than other crustal discontinuities. However, in the
22 LAA we observe an unusually strong along-arc variation in depth of the strongest
23 discontinuity, which is difficult to explain by variations in crustal thicknesswhich
24 is difficult to explain by variations in crustal thickness. Instead, tThese results
25 suggest that in layered crust, especially where other discontinuities have a
26 stronger seismic contrast than the Moho, H–K stacking results can be easily
27 misinterpreted. To circumvent this problem, an inversion modelling approach is
28 introduced to investigate the crustal structure in more detail by building a 1D
29 velocity-depth profile for each island. Using this method it is possible to identify
30 identify any mid-crustal discontinuity in addition to the Moho. Our result shows
31 a mid-crustal discontinuity at about 10 to 25 km depth along the arc, with
32 slightly deeper values in the north (Montserrat to Saba). In general, the depth of
1
33 the Moho shows the same pattern with values of around 25 km (Grenada) to 35
34 km in the north. The results suggest differences in magmatic H2O content and
35 differentiation history of each island.

41 1. Introduction
42 1.1 Geological BackgroundOverview
43
44 Subduction zones are regions on Earth where new continental crust is thought to
45 have formed; however, even though the origin of continental crust has been
46 studied for a long time, major details, such as the discrepancy in composition
47 between average continental crust and that beneath many island arcs, remain
48 unclear (Taylor, 1967; Janiszewski et al., 2013).[1,2] A better understanding of
49 crustal structure provides insight into the link between subduction processes
50 and the formation of continental crust through arc volcanism.
51
52 The Mohorovicic discontinuity (Moho), the boundary between the crust and the
53 mantle, marks a sharp change in seismic velocities that are thought to be due to
54 chemical composition and/or rheology changes. In addition to the Moho, a mid-
55 crustal discontinuity, in some areas referred to as the Conrad discontinuity
56 (Conrad, 1925)[3], can be observed in many subduction environments (e.g.,
57 Boynton et al., 1979; Hasegawa et al., 2000[4,5], and references therein). Even
58 though it is normally found to be the dominant crustal discontinuity, the Moho is
59 sometimes weak and difficult to resolve, especially beneath volcanic arcs
60 (Boynton et al., 1979; Janiszewski et al. 2013)[2,4].
61
62 Ideally an active source along-arc seismic experiment would be carried out to
63 provide a comprehensive investigation of crustal structure, but long offsets and
64 large sources are needed. Furthermore, this option is expensive and long offsets,
65 which are required there is no to guarantee that the Moho will be visible, might
2
66 not be easy to acquire in many regions such as curved island arcs (e.g., Ewing et
67 al, 1971; Boynton et al., 1979[4,6]). Passive-seismic observations in a well-
68 monitored arc setting provide an alternative approach. Receiver functions (RF)
69 and related H–K stacking are now a common method for studying crustal
70 structures (e.g., Chevrot & van der Hilst, 2000; Zhu & [2, 7–15]Kanamori, 2000;
71 Dugda et al., 2005; Dugda & Nyblade, 2006; Niu et al, 2007; Sevilla et al., 2010;
72 Thompson et al., 2010; Hammond et al., 2011; Janiszewski et al., 2013; Arnaiz-
73 Rodrígues et al. 2016).
74
75 The H–K stacking method makes use of the velocity difference between P- and S-
76 wave velocities to estimate the depth of discontinuities at which strong changes
77 in seismic velocities occur (termed H) and the average vP/vS ratio between the Formatted: Subscript
Formatted: Subscript
78 receiver and the discontinuity (termed K; (Zhu & Kanamori, 2000[8]). The ratio
Formatted: Small caps
79 of the P- and S-wave velocities can be used to better constrain the average
80 material properties that are present in the crust between the surface and the
81 discontinuity (Christensen & Salisbury, 1975)[16]. In order to investigate crustal
82 thickness, H–K stacking is normally used with the assumption that the largest P- Formatted: Small caps
83 to-S conversions occur at the Moho.
84
85 In this work crustal structure variation along the Lesser Antilles Arc (LAA; Fig. 1)
86 is studied to investigate potential influences of subduction on the overlying
87 crust. Our approach integrates seismology and petrological observations with a
88 specific emphasis on the Lesser Antilles Arc. We use extensive seismic data from
89 26 stations on 10 islands and use receiver functions to explore crustal
90 discontinuities along the arc. This is complemented by published work on
91 reconstructed crustal structure and compositions of fossil and currently active
92 arcs (e.g., [2, 17–19]Behn & Kelemen, 2006; Kodaira et al., 2007; Jagoutz & Behn,
93 2013; Janiszewski et al., 2013). The results are compared to structural features
94 and Moho depth estimates from previous works, to propose hypotheses about
95 the link between subduction-related processes and the crustal structure beneath
96 the LAA.

98 1.2 The Lesser Antilles

99
100 The LAA (Fig. 1), extending some 800 km northwards from the South American
101 continent to the Greater Antilles, is an expression of slow (18 to 20 mm·yr-1),
102 westward subduction of Atlantic oceanic crust (North and South American
103 Plates) beneath the Caribbean Plate (e.g., Wadge and Shepherd, 1984[20]).
104 Subduction is sub-orthogonal in the vicinity of Martinique, with sinistral
105 obliquity to the north and dextral to the south (DeMets et al., 2000)[21]. A
106 comprehensive review of the geological and tectonic setting of the LAA is
107 provided by (Smith et al., 2013)[22] and summarised briefly here.
108
109 Magmatism along the LAA dates from the Eocene [23]. The present-day arc
110 consists of 11 major volcanic islands; a string of nineteen small islands (the
111 Grenadines) lies between St. Vincent and Grenada. Several volcanic centres in the
112 LAA are currently or recently active, including those on Montserrat, Martinique,
113 Dominica and Guadeloupe and the submarine Kick-'em Jenny (Allen et al.,
114 2018)[24]. The variation in size and spacing of the volcanic islands reflects
115 spatial and temporal variation in magmatic output. Magma production rates in
116 the LAA are at the low end of intra-oceanic arcs worldwide (162 km3km-1Myr-1;
117 Jicha & Jagoutz, 2015 [25]), possibly a consequence of slow convergence. The
118 LAA lies on the eastern margin of thickened oceanic crust of the Caribbean Plate
119 (Mauffret & Leroy, 1997)[26], although the extent to which vestigial Caribbean
120 Plate material, attenuated or otherwise, is present beneath the LAA is not known.
121
122 An unusual feature of the LAA is a marked bifurcation north of Martinique into
123 an inactive eastern limb and active western limb; t. There is evidence for an
124 abandoned, Mesozoic volcanic arc to the west of the Lesser Antilles (the Aves
125 Ridge), separated from the active arc by the Grenada Basin [27]. The westward
126 jump in the northern LAA accounts for a hiatus in volcanism there between mid-
127 and late Miocene times. The cause of the jump is not known. However, there is a
128 marked change in the dip and orientation of the Wadati-Benioff zone along the
129 arc, interpreted by (Wadge and Shepherd, 1984)[20] to indicate that either a
130 single American plate was torn and deformed during subduction or that the
131 North and South American plates were subducted with different velocities. In
4
132 either case, bifurcation of the LAA just north of Martinique would correspond to
133 the triple point junction where Caribbean, North American and South American
134 plates meet.
135
136 The division between the northern and southern parts of the LAA is also
137 reflected in the presence and character of the sedimentary cover. The incoming
138 plate in the south is rich in clastic detritus from the South American continent,
139 partially scraped off to form the Barbados accretionary prism (e.g., Faugères et
140 al., 1993[28]). To the north, sediment supply is limited by the presence of
141 submarine highs, such as the Tiburon Ridge, and the incoming plate is blanketed
142 by pelagic marine sediments. The spatial variation in sediments plays a role in
143 changing magma chemistry along the LAA (Carpentier et al., 2008)[29].
144
145 The LAA transects five major fracture zones on the down-going plate (Fig. 1).
146 The down-going plate displays the topographic expression of strong tectonic
147 extension including normal faults with large amounts of rotation and dome-
148 shaped faulted detachment surfaces, or core complexes, at the edge of the inner
149 valley floor. The presence of serpentine in the down-going plate, associated with
150 fracture zones and/or core complexes, could introduce significant H2O to the
151 mantle wedge, perhaps accounting for along-strike variation in magma
152 productivity (Boschi et al., 2013)[30] and subduction zone seismicity
153 (Schlaphorst et al. 2016)[31].
154
155 1.3 Crustal structure of the Lesser Antilles
156
157 The LAA has been the subject of three major geophysical experiments designed
158 to elucidate crustal structure [4,32,33](Boynton et al., 1979, Christeson et al.,
159 2008, Kopp et al., 2011), as well as an attempt to map an along-arc transect of
160 crustal thickness using receiver functions and H–K stacking (Arnaiz-Rodrígues et Formatted: Small caps
161 al. 2016)[15]. In [12], they have used the same method at the island of
162 Montserrat. Estimates of crustal thickness (depth to Moho) beneath the arc from
163 these studies range from 22 to 37 km. Boynton et al. (1979)In [4], from their
164 along-arc survey of the southern and central part of the arc (Grenada to
5
165 Guadeloupe), reveal the presence of two refractors that split the crust into
166 discrete layers. Their upper layer, with an average velocity of 6.2 km·s-1, varies
167 significantly in depth and velocity along strike. The average upper layer
168 thickness is 10 km, but varies from 2 to 20 km (Boynton et al., 1979)[4]. In
169 [34]Wadge (1986), they interpreted this layer as being built of dense, solidified
170 volcanic rock and plutons of intermediate composition. The uppermost portion
171 of the upper layer has significantly lower seismic velocities and densities, and is
172 likely composed of volcaniclastic and sedimentary rocks with abundant fractures
173 (Kopp et al., 2011)[33]. Gravity data from Guadeloupe (Gailler et al., 2013)[35]
174 show that this uppermost layer (vP <6 km·s-1) is approximately 4 km thick. The
175 lower crustal layer of (Boynton et al., 1979)[4], that immediately overlies the
176 mantle, has average vP = 6.9 km·s-1 and is thought to represent dense, more mafic
177 igneous rocks, including cumulates.
178
179 Two cross-arc seismic surveys, between Dominica and Guadeloupe (Kopp et al.,
180 2011)[33] and south of Grenada (Christeson et al., 2008)[32], provide a more
181 detailed picture of crustal structure. The layering persists, although the overall
182 vertical velocity gradient is smoother than suggested by (Boynton et al.,
183 1979)[4]. The crust between Dominica and Guadeloupe is 26 km thick and south
184 of Grenada it is 24 km thick. The Moho is not well resolved in either location;
185 mantle vP varies from 7.7 km·s-1 in the south to 8 km·s-1 in the centre. Neither
186 survey shows any significant deepening of the Moho beneath the active arc. West
187 of Grenada, the Moho shallows beneath the Grenada Basin (to less than 20 km in
188 places), thickening to 27 km beneath the Aves Ridge. Seismic surveys have been
189 unable to identify unequivocally any vestiges of Caribbean Plate in the sub-arc
190 crust.
191
192 Here, we refine the along-arc crustal image of Boynton et al. (1979)[4] using
193 seismic data collected from 23 29 remote seismic stations along the active LAA,
194 in combination with insights from experimental and igneous petrology, to
195 develop a method for constraining crustal structure using Receiver Functions.
196 Our approach, which refines a recent investigation of Moho depths along the LAA
197 using conventional receiver function analysis (Arnaiz-Rodrígues et al.,
6
198 2016)[15], has widespread applicability to volcanic arcs and layered crust more
199 generally.
200
201 2. Receiver functions and H–K stacking
202
203 We use seismic broadband stations from different networks, located on most of
204 the major islands of the LAA (Fig. 1, Tab. 1); for Montserrat, Guadeloupe and
205 Martinique more than one station is available. For this study we limit our
206 catalogue to events greater thangreater than magnitude 5.5. Teleseismic events
207 are required (30° to 90° distance) to ensure subvertical incidence angles normal
208 to the subsurface layering. Events are filtered using a 2nd order Butterworth
209 bandpass filter from 0.4 Hz to 3 Hz (after Thompson et al., 2010[13]). Only
210 events with a clear P-phase are then selected for this study.
211
212 The method uses the coda of an arriving signal, which contains mode-converted
213 energy due to the structure beneath the receiver (Phinney, 1964; Ammon et al.,
214 1990)[36,37]. A large velocity contrast at a seismic discontinuity leads to a
215 strong P-to-S-converted phase (Zhu & Kanamori, 2000)[8]. The signal at the
216 receiver is a convolution of the initial signal with the subsurface structure.
217 Therefore, assuming horizontal layering, a deconvolution can be carried out to
218 remove the source effects and produce a sequence of pulses representing this
219 structure by isolating the P-to-S conversions [8,13,37,38](Ammon et al., 1990;
220 Zhu & Kanamori, 2000; Helffrich, 2006; Thompson et al., 2010.). This resulting
221 sequence is called a “receiver function” (RF).
222
223 In this study the extended-time multitaper frequency-domain cross-correlation
224 receiver-function (ETMTRF; Helffrich, 2006[38]) is used to create the RFs.
225 ETMTRF, based on the work of Park & Levin (2000)[39], includes later arriving
226 multiple converted phases and has the advantage of being less sensitive to noise.
227 We use a high-frequency cutoff at 1.5Hz and for the purpose of this study three
228 overlapping tapers are sufficient. The radial RFs are then stacked by jackknifing
229 (Efron, 1982)[40] from -10s to +30s relative to the P-peak. This produces a
230 standard variation that can be used as a pointwise uncertainty for the RF. Here
7
231 the 2s level is used. The H–K stacking method follows the work of Zhu &
232 Kanamori (2000), Dugda et al. (2005) and Dugda & Nyblade (2006)[8–10], which
233 involves, applying a bootstrapping algorithm (Efron & Tibshirani, 1991)[41] to
234 determine the uncertainties of the model parameters.
235
236 Based on theoretical arrival times of converted phases the method derives
237 values for the depth of the discontinuity (H) and the average P-wave to S-wave
238 (vP/vS =K) ratio of the crust between that point and the surface. The amplitudes
239 at the theoretical arrival times are summed,
240
241 <U+0397>,  = <U+2211>  +    -    ,
242 (1)
243
244 where N is the number of RFs used in the stack, rn(t) is the RF amplitude at time
245 t, which is the predicted arrival time for the individual phases (the indices are 1
246 for Ps, 2 for PpPs and 3 for PsPs/PpSs), and w1, w2 and w3 are the weighting
247 factors with <U+2211>  = 1.
248
249 The weighting factors are chosen so that phases that are more apparent will be
250 enhanced [9,13,42](Dugda et al., 2005; di Leo et al., 2009; Thompson et al.,
251 2010). During the bootstrapping process we compute 300 iterations, while
252 changing tThe value of vP is changed using random, normally-distributed values
253 with 95% of the values in a range of <U+2206>vP=±0.3 around a mean of 6.5 km s-1.
254 SimilarlyAt the same time, the weighting factors are chosen so that 95% fall in
255 <U+2206>w=±0.05 around the means of 0.6 for w1 and 0.3 for w2 (with +  =
256 1; <U+2211> = 1). The best estimation occurs at the location in H–K space where the
257 three phases are stacked coherently (Zhu & Kanamori, 2000)[8] among all
258 possible cases in terms of varying vP and the weighting factors. Formatted: Subscript
259
260 Since the assumed value of vP can also be a source of error [8,14](Hammond et
261 al., 2011), the mean of vP is changed in subsequent calculations from 6.5 to 6.3
262 and 6.7 km s-1. These values are maximum deviations of the crustal mean vP as
263 determined by Boynton et al. (1979)[4]. Excluding the noisy part of data from
8
264 Dominica, our test show that the bootstrap error is either similar (Martinique,
265 Montserrat, St. Vincent) to the uncertainty due to the change in vP or smaller (in
266 all other cases). In case of the vP/vS ratio the bootstrap error is always larger.
267 The larger uncertainty between the bootstrap error estimate and the error
268 arising from a change in the mean vP is used in this study.
269
270 In the case of Martinique, we can see a strong, well-resolved discontinuity at
271 28.30 ± 1.05 1 km (Fig. 2a). At St. Lucia, the discontinuity is placed at 46.5 km,
272 much deeper than expected in this area and the solution is very poorly
273 constrained. Furthermore, at some islands H values are arguably too shallow
274 (e.g., St. Vincent with 19.90 ± 0.70 km, Fig. 2b) to be the Moho. We note that the
275 data are in general noisy, as they are from island stations (Figs. 2c, d). To help
276 mitigate this issue we ue the RFs with the highest signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio and
277 employ stacking to further improve the S/N ratio.
278
279 AOne explanation for the unexpectedly shallow or deep results is the existence
280 of a weak Moho beneath some of the islands and a stronger mid-crustal
281 discontinuity, in which case H–K stacking cannot resolve the Moho, returning
282 instead the depth (H) of the mid-crustal discontinuity as the preferred result.
283 Additionally, near-surface complexity affects H–K results, often leading to
284 estimates of discontinuities that do not reflect any real structure. We therefore
285 conclude that H–K stacking on its own may not be appropriate for mapping
286 layered crustal structure in arc settings without additional constraints. The
287 method is limited by the fact that it will only search for one pair of values. In the
288 case of multiple discontinuities, however, the H–K stacking can only identify the
289 strongest oneit is likely that peaks in the RF caused by different discontinuities
290 will overlay and distort the RF to a point where H–K stacking may find values Formatted: Small caps
291 that do not represent any real discontinuity depth and layer vP/vS ratio. Formatted: Subscript

292
293 3. Inversion for a layered crust
294
295 To overcome limitations of H–K stacking method when applied to layered crust
296 we adopted a grid-search inversion of a three-layer crust overlying the mantle
9
297 within the following petrological framework: (1) upper crustal layer composed
298 of loosely consolidated and fractured volcanoclastic sediments and lavas; (2)
299 middle crustal layer composed of plutonic rocks (solidified magma); (3) lower
300 crustal layer composed of mafic and ultramafic crustal cumulates; (4) mantle
301 layer (Fig. 3). In a subsequent development of the model we also consider the
302 presence of vestigial crust of the over-riding plate, proto-Caribbean plate (layer
303 2a).
304
305 Crustal cumulates are rocks formed by accumulation of near-liquidus phases
306 from magmas undergoing chemical differentiation. Cumulates consist of
307 assemblages that represent instantaneous solid compositions from one or more
308 magma batches. Conversely, plutonic rocks have mineralogy and textures
309 consistent with protracted, in situ sodilifcation solidifcation of magmatic mushes
310 (melt + mineral phases) without attendant differentiation. Our three-layer
311 crustal model is based on studies of currently active and exposed fossil island
312 arcs (e.g., [18,19,32,33,43,44]Kodaira et al., 2007; Hacker et al., 2008; Christeson
313 et al., 2008; Kopp et al., 2011; Jagoutz & Schmidt, 2012; Jagoutz & Behn, 2013).
314 The exposed arcs of Talkeetna and Kohistan show lower-crust that consists
315 predominantly of mafic/ultamafic cumulates such as pyroxenite, hornblendites
316 and gabbros, whereas the middle-crust is composed by evolved, often felsic,
317 plutonic rocks. The lithologies we see in fossil arcs are comparable to those we
318 find in currently active intra-oceanic arcs. Geochemistry and thermobarometry
319 of lavas and their igneous xenoliths along the LAA support that conclusion (e.g.,
320 [23,45–52] Arculus & Wills, 1980; Macdonald et al., 2002; Tollan et al., 2007;
321 Kiddle et al., 2010; Stamper et al., 2014, Cooper et al., 2016; Melekhova et al.,
322 2017; Ziberna et al., 2018; Camejo et al., in review). The seismic studies of active
323 Aleutian and Izu-Bonin island arcs also reveal layered crustal structures which
324 have been similarly interpreted as mafic lower crust and more felsic middle-
325 upper crust based on vP and vS properties of different rock types. We build our
326 model and estimate of vP/vS ratios on these observations. The physical
327 properties of the mantle (layer 4) are fixed at: vP = 8.00 km·s-1, vS=4.53 km·s-1,
328 density=3.33 g·cm-3. They are derived from Stamper et al. (2014)[48] and
329 represent putative mantle values beneath the Lesser Antilles.
10
330
331 Multiple studies of currently active and fossil arcs demonstrated that although vP
332 and vS vary considerably for the lower-crustal layer, vP/vS ratio is surprisingly
333 constant and on average lies between 1.75 and 1.80 (e.g., [2,17,19,53,54]Abers,
334 1994; Fliedner & Klemperer, 1999; Behn & Kelemen, 2006; Jagoutz & Behn,
335 2013; Janiszewski et al., 2013). A vP/vS ratio of 1.79 for lower-crustal layer (3) is
336 used in our model. The middle crust (2) in our model consists of plutonic rocks
337 of basaltic to andesite compositions. This assumption is based on average lava
338 composition of Lesser Antilles Arc and upper crustal xenoliths (e.g.,
339 [23,46,47,49,50]Macdonald et al., 2002; Tollan et al., 2007; Kiddle et al., 2010;
340 Cooper et al., 2016; Melekhova et al, 2017). According to Christensen (1996)[55],
341 plutonic rocks of this composition will have vP/vS ratio of 1.82 to 1.87 at mid-
342 crustal pressures. The vP/vS ratios of the upper layer (1) are controlled
343 primarily by the fracture density and degree of compaction, rather than
344 lithology. In a refinement of our model we also consider the presence of vestigial
345 Caribbean Plate (Layer 2a). The seismic properties of layer (2a) are estimated
346 from rock compositions of the Caribbean oceanic plateau (Hastie & Kerr,
347 2010)[56]. The vP/vS ratio found is 1.86. Our tests show that a slight modification
348 in vP/vS in layers (2), (2a) and/or (3) do not change the overall results.
349
350 The advantage of a fixed vP/vS ratio is a significant reduction in parameter space Formatted: Subscript
Formatted: Subscript
351 (see supplementary material for a comparison between modelling with and
352 without petrological constraints). More importantly, vP/vS ratios obtained for Formatted: Subscript
Formatted: Subscript
353 crustal and mantle lithology allow us to reconcile the seismological and
354 petrological interpretation of crustal structure. To test the reliability of the
355 chosen vP/vS ratios we tested upper and lower limits of this value for layers (2), Formatted: Subscript

356 (2a) and (3) and found that a modification in vP/vS ratio of ±0.05 does not change
Formatted: Subscript
357 the overall discontinuity depth results significantly. Formatted: Subscript
358
359 The advantage of fixed vP/vS ratio is a significant reduction in parameter space.
360 Furthermore, with this setup it is possible to obtain results that can be
361 reconciled both seismologically and petrologically. We assume that all melt has
362 either been extracted or is isolated at very low melt fraction along grain
11
363 boundaries. Xenoliths from the LAA contain variable, but small, amounts of melt
364 distributed along grain boundaries [45,46,50,52](Arculus & Wills, 1980; Tollan
365 et al., 2012; Melekhova et al., 2017; Camejo et al., in review). We will discuss the
366 seismological implication of presence of melt later in the discussion.
367
368 We set the thickness of layer (1) to be 5 km, consistent with the geophysical data
369 of [32,35,47]Christeson et al. (2008), Kiddle et al. (2010) and Gailler et al. (2013)
370 and derive its physical properties from the RF data alone. Using the method of
371 Ammon et al. (1990)[37], we first invert the seismic RF (using -5s to +15s after
372 the initial P-peak) for the uppermost 5 km with an initial model that consists of
373 five 1-km thick subsidiary layers (1a-e) and two main crustal layers. We use a
374 smoothness value of 0.1 based on visual observation to create the smoothest
375 models that still fit the observations well. The horizontal slowness was chosen to
376 be 0.06 s/km (but different values have been tested for stability of the result)
377 and the singular-value decomposition truncation fraction was chosen to be 0.001
378 to handle values close to zero. . The thickness of each layer stays fixed during this
379 inversion. Thicknesses of the middle (2) and lower (3) crustal layers are varied
380 within the range of plausible values throughout different inversion runs to
381 ensure the stability of the solution for layers (1a-e). This first step accounts for
382 strong effects of highly variable structure near the surface on the RF and can
383 overcome the non-linearity and non-uniqueness of this problem (e.g., Lodge &
384 Helffrich 2009[57]). Because of the nature of layer (1) this inversion does not
385 include any petrological constraints. In the second step, we introduce a grid-
386 search to investigate the depth to the MCD and the Moho and the velocity
387 contrast at these discontinuities, thus defining the thickness of the middle and
388 lower crustal layers. By this meansHaving already fixed the highly variable upper
389 layer (1) in a previous step it is possible to reduce the grid-search to a
390 reasonable number of models and computation time. In this step we introduce
391 vP/vS ratios based on the petrological considerations above. We keep the vP/vS
392 ratios for individual layers fixed but allow vP and vS to vary. This proves to be a
393 useful constraint, further restricting the explored parameter space. This
394 additional step is needed to vary the thicknesses of the layers, whereas the first
395 step only works with fixed layer thicknesses.

396
397 A <U+03C7>2-misfit is used to evaluate the match of different models with the
398 seismological data and, thus, make them comparable. It is described by

402 where N is the number of data points and d(n), s(n) and s(n) are data RF, its
403 pointwise uncertainties obtained by the jackknife stacking, and the model RF at
404 point n, and a weighting factor . The weighting factor w(n), which is chosen so
405 that it forms an envelope around the maximum at 0 s (P-arrival) and decreases
406 exponentially to both sides (see Lodge & Helffrich (2009)[57] for further
407 information). The smallest value of <U+03C7>2 depicts the best model; the uncertainties
408 on this model are given by all models that reach 95% of this value, taken from a
409 <U+03C7>2 distribution table.
410
411 We carry out the grid- search with vP/vS values as high as 2.2 to explore the
412 possible presence of melt, which is known to have a much greater effect on vS
413 than vP (Watanabe, 1993)[58]. No satisfactory (low <U+03C7>2) solutions are obtained
414 with such large vP/vS values, indicating that large pockets of interconnected melt
415 are unlikely beneath the LAA, consistent with the H–K stacking results, as well as
416 and Arnaiz-Rodrigues et al (2016)[15] and the textural evidence from xenoliths.

419
420 The depth to the MCD and vP for layers (2) and (3) is in excellent agreement with
421 previous work on various segments of the arc [4,12,32,33,59](Dorel et al., 1974;
422 Boynton et al., 1979, Christeson et al., 2008, Sevilla et al., 2010; Kopp et al.,
423 2011). The Moho was not observed seismically by Boynton et al. (1979)[4], but
424 was estimated to lie at about 35 km based on their gravity data. Arnaiz-
425 Rodrígues et al. (2016)In [15], using conventional H–K stacking, they propose
426 that the average Moho depth beneath the LAA is 29±7 km.
427
13
428 The best fitting models for stations FDF and SVB can be seen in Figure 4. The
429 obtained crustal structure (Fig. 54, Tab. 21) shows that the depths to the MCD
430 and to the Moho are highly variable over surprisingly short distances of tens of
431 kilometres. Arnaiz-Rodrígues et al. (2016)In [15], they arrived at a similar
432 conclusion, with up to 10 km change in Moho depth across Guadeloupe alone.
433 Furthermore, we find that the seismic velocitiesies of layers (2) and (3) also vary
434 vary laterally. Note that uncertainties in the results do not arise from these
435 lateral variations. Although both discontinuities are present along the entire
436 LAA, beneath some islands they compete to produce either a strong Moho and
437 weak MCD or strong MCD and weak Moho (Fig. 54). For St. Eustatius and Saba,
438 the Moho is very weak but the MCD is very strong. Beneath Grenada, Martinique,
439 Guadeloupe and St. Kitts the converse is true. The depth to the MCD varies
440 between 11 and 25 km, whilst the depth to the Moho varies between 24 and 37
441 km (e.g., Grenada and St. Kitts respectvely).
442
443 Our inversion approach considers only new, magmatic arc crust. We have not
444 considered thus far the possible presence of vestigial proto-Caribbean crust
445 (pCc) within the arc (layer 2a). The estimated seismic properties of this layer (vP
446 = 7.11 km s-1, vS = 3.97 km s-1, vP/vS = 1.79) are described above. Incorporating
447 layer (2a) into our models does not change the depths of the discontinuities in
448 the inversion results because the change in seismic velocity between the pCc and
449 the adjacent crust is too small to be identified by RFs and, hence, H–K stacking
450 and crustal inversions. This conclusion comes from models that included an 8 km
451 layer (2a), consistent with the seismic refraction study of Christeson et al.
452 (2008)[32] beneath the Grenada basin where the pCc is appreciably thinned. In
453 the unlikely scenario that layer (2a) is chosen with sufficient thickness that it
454 takes up most of the crustal column, the MCD is suppressed leading to a
455 significantly different inverted crustal structure In our models, a 20 km layer
456 (2a) is found to cause such a change. However, the resultant misfit between the
457 model and data RFs is considerably larger in those instances, leading to the
458 reasonable conclusion that a pCc, if present, cannot exceed thicknesses of around
459 10 to 15 km, depending on the island, and may not be present at all.
460
14
461 A comparison of the depth estimates of the crustal discontinuities with those
462 obtained from a range of other studies along the LAA reveals a good match. For
463 example, our estimate of the Moho depth beneath Martinique is around 29 km,
464 which agrees well with independent estimates from Dorel et al. (1974)[4,59] and
465 Boynton et al. (1979). The derived MCD depth agrees with estimates from
466 Boynton et al. (1979)[4] on every island (Fig. 54). The Moho depth beneath
467 Grenada, Martinique, Dominica and Montserrat agrees with estimates of
468 [4,12,15,32,33,59]Arnaiz-Rodrígues et al. (2016), Boynton et al. (1979),
469 Christeson et al. (2008), Dorel et al. (1974), Kopp et al. (2011) and Sevilla et al.
470 (2010). A particularly interesting comparison is with the results of Boynton et al.
471 (1979)[4], which also show a highly variable crustal structure with an
472 undulating MCD, albeit of greater amplitude (Fig. 54).
473
474 Our preferred final, four-layer velocity model (Fig. 54) for the LAA is as follows.
475 The 5 km-thick upper layer (1) has highly variable vP, that we attribute to
476 lithological heterogeneity due to the layering of sediments and volcanics. The
477 values have been used as a correction for the subsequent grid-search and the
478 highly heterogeneous nature would need a more detailed investigation in the
479 future to draw further conclusions. P-wave velocities are 5.8 to 7.2 km·s-1 in the
480 middle crust (layer 2) in the depth range of 5 to 25 km, and 6.6 to 7.6 km·s-1 in
481 the lower crust (layer 3) in the depth range of 24 to 37 km. Our RF inversion
482 model, incorporating constraints on vP/vS based on crustal lithology, enables us
483 to identify two crustal layers in a way that conventional H–K stacking does not.
484 Because of the changing relative strengths of MCD and Moho, conventional H–K
485 stacking would instead yield only the stronger of the MCD or Moho at each
486 location, giving the illusion of even larger lateral gradients in the depth of a
487 single discontinuity as it switches from MCD to Moho and back again.
488
489 5. Discussion and conclusion
490
491 There are different potential causes for highly varying discontinuity depths and
492 strengths over short distances. In the LAA we can rule out a changing amount of
493 subducted sediments. The subduction is sediment-rich in the south, gradually
15
494 becoming more sediment-poor towards the north, which does not match the
495 pattern observed.
496
497 The most likely explanation, however, for our observations is short-wavelength
498 variability in the delivery of water to the arc, which in turn affects the
499 temperature, composition and volumes of the magma added to the crust.
500 Variations in magmatic water contents of mantle-derived basalts influence their
501 phase relations and consequently the mineralogy and seismic velocities of
502 associated cumulate layers. Similarly, increased addition of water to the mantle
503 wedge beneath the arc will trigger enhanced melt production. Thus, in principle,
504 variations in the delivery of water to the arc can effect changes in both MCD and
505 Moho depths. We tentatively note a spatial correlation with subducting
506 transform faults (Fig. 1), which are likely water rich and serpentinised. The
507 spatial variability in seismicity along the arc has also been attributed to the
508 effects of the subducting fracture zones (Schlaphorst et al., 2016)[31]. The
509 dramatic variations in crustal properties might suggest complicated upper
510 mantle wedge dynamics, which would explain why the seismic properties of the
511 upper mantle wedge beneath the Lesser Antilles appear to be isotropic (Piñero-
512 Feliciangeli & Kendall, 2008; Schlaphorst et al., 2017)[60,61].
513
514 The vP/vS ratios used in the inversion are based on samples of melt-free material.
515 In contrast to many other areas where receiver function studies have been
516 carried out, a volcanic arc may be prone to higher melt content in the crust.
517 Partial melt in the crust can lead to higher vP/vS ratios to values of up to 2.00
518 (Hammond et al., 2011). However, H–K stacking results from stations where the
519 result agrees with results from the inversion and previous methods (Montserrat,
520 Martinique) show values lower than 1.9 on Montserrat and Martinique. The
521 presence of melt in any of the modelled layers will increase the vP/vS ratio. The Formatted: Subscript
Formatted: Subscript
522 magnitude of this effect will vary with the amount and physical distribution of
523 the melt. Melt-rich layers could be investigated explicitly using our methodology,
524 by assigning a specific, elevated vP/vS ratio to a layer. Where melt fractions are Formatted: Subscript
Formatted: Subscript
525 very low or melt lenses very thin, these layers will not be readily detectable
Formatted: Subscript
526 using RF methods alone. The fact that we see vP/vS ratios consistently below 2.0
Formatted: Subscript
16
527 in the Lesser Antilles suggests that melt fractions are consistently low.
528 Furthermore, petrological observations show that quartz is a very minor
529 component in all Antilles rocks due to the mafic nature of the arc. Therefore, its
530 contribution to the ratio is negligible.Therefore, the melt-free model applied in
531 this study seems appropriate for this inversion. This should not be taken to
532 mean that melt is absent beneath the active LAA, simply that where present it
533 occurs in relatively small, disconnected pockets that lie outside the resolution of
534 seismic methods.
535
536 We have elucidated crustal structure along strike in the LAA using an approach
537 that integrates seismology and petrology. The first important outcome of this
538 study is that uUsing a combination of local networks it is possible for the first
539 time to get a detailed study of crustal structure of all major islands in the LAA.
540 Combining several local networks, it has been possible, for the first time, to
541 propose a detailed picture of crustal structure beneath all major islands of the
542 LAA. Secondly, oOur approach affords several advantages over a purely
543 seismological approach, especially in arc settings at stations with high amounts
544 of noise, where the H–K stacking method is prone to ambiguity when used
545 without additional constraints. Consequently, Consequently, the results are
546 supported by data from seismology and petrology and show models that are
547 consistent with each. Combining several local networks, it has been possible, for
548 the first time, to propose a detailed picture of crustal structure beneath all major
549 islands of the LAA. Based on our results and previous work in other arcs we
550 conclude that arc crust is highly variable laterally. The strength of the Moho
551 varies along the LAA. It is the dominant discontinuity beneath four islands (St.
552 Kitts, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Grenada), whereas the MCD is dominant
553 beneath two (Saba, St. Eustatius). The MCD can be found at depths between 10
554 and 25 km (consistent with Boynton, ….), (consistent with [4]) whilst the Moho
555 depth varies between 25 and 45 km, with both discontinuities being located at
556 greater depths in the northern part of the arc. The highly variable nature of both
557 discontinuities can be explained by lateral variation in the mechanisms of melt
558 generation and differentiation along the arc arising from instabilities along the
559 mantle-slab interface. However, more work is needed (e.g., including petrological
17
560 constraints from further islands) before a more detailed interpretation is
561 possible.
562
563 In this study the advantages of a modelling technique combining seismological
564 with petrological results over a purely seismological approach have been
565 demonstrated. The approach is particularly useful when the crust is lithologically
566 layered. In arc settings at stations with high amount of noise, the H–K stacking
567 method used to investigate the crustal thickness is prone to misinterpretation
568 when used without additional constrains. Models that are derived from a
569 combined grid-search inversion can help interpret results from RFs and H–K
570 stacking.

1168 Figure 1: Map of the LAA showing the seismic broadband stations used in this
1169 study (red triangles). The western, active branch of the arc is shown in brown,
1170 the eastern, inactive branch is shown in yellow. There are 12 stations in
1171 Montserrat in close proximity. Plate motion, relative to the Caribbean plate, of
1172 the North American (NAm) and South American plates (SAm) is taken from
1173 DeMets et al. (2000)[21]. Sediment thicknesses greater than 10 km is indicated
1174 by the grey shaded area with 2 km contour intervals (Divins, 2003)[62]. Faults
1175 indicated by thin black lines (Feuillet et al., 2002); fracture zones by the dotted
1176 black lines: FT – Fifteen-Twenty; Ma – Marathon; Me – Mercurius; Ve – Vema; Do
1177 – Doldrums (Schlaphorst et al., 2016)[31].

1181 Figure 2: H–K stacking (a, b) and RFs (c, d) for Martinique (a, c) and St. Vincent
1182 (b, d). In the stacked H–K result, the best fit is indicated by the red lines. The top
1183 right values show the number of stacked events, as well as H and <U+03BA> (=vP/vS) with
39
1184 their uncertainties. The shading shows the normalised amplitude above 0.5. A
1185 value of 1.0 means that all iterations result in the same H and K values. In the Formatted: Small caps
1186 stacked RFs, the theoretical onset times of the phases, as predicted by the model,
1187 are indicated by coloured vertical bars. The grey lines show the pointwise 2s-
1188 jackknife uncertainties. Further H–K stacking results can be found in the Formatted: Small caps
1189 supplementary material.

1193 Figure 3: Schematic setup of the modelling approach. The velocities for the upper
1194 5 km (layer 1a-e, i.e. the shallow crust comprised of volcaniclastic and
1195 sediments) are modelled using the inversion code by Ammon et al. (1990)[37].
1196 The following layers (2, 3), i.e. the middle and lower crust, are constrained using
1197 the grid-search ignoring heuristic demands (see Lodge & Helffrich, 2009[57])
1198 but including fixed vP/vS ratios. The thick vertical lines represent the model with
1199 the best goodness-of-fit value, the thinner ones show all models with a goodness-
1200 of-fit above 95% to the best model. The thin dotted lines show the possible
1201 variability of the Moho in this model. The mantle (layer 4) is kept at fixed values
1202 (Stamper et al., 2014)[48]. The example in this figure displays the velocity-depth
1203 model for station FDF (Martinique). Note that the decrease in density and
42
1204 velocities below 5 km is a feature of this island and not a result of the inversion
1205 code in combination with the grid-search. Results from other islands can be
1206 found in the supplementary material.

1211 by the black lines, the grey lines show all models with a goodness-of-fit above
1212 95% to the best model. The RFs show the stacked data RFs (black) and the model
1213 RFs (red). The grey lines show the pointwise 2s-jackknife uncertainties. Further
1214 modelling results can be found in the supplementary material.

1218 Figure 54: Compilation of inversion results along the LAA from south (Grenada)
1219 to north (Saba) showing depths of MCD and Moho beneath each island based on
1220 inversion. The result from the seismic refraction carried out by Boynton et al.
1221 (1979)[4] is shown in the background beneath Grenada to Guadeloupe. The
1222 shallower lines represent the upper boundary of the upper main crustal layer
1223 and its uncertainties solutions for separate segments of the line (dashed lines),
1224 the lower lines in show the MCD and its uncertainties (dotted lines). Blue and red
1225 horizontal bars denote the best MCD (blue) discontinuity and Moho (red)
1226 estimates based on the grid-search inversion. Uncertainties for these values can
1227 be accessed in supplementary material. In cases of a dominating discontinuity
45
1228 (i.e. a higher S-wave velocity increase compared to the other) the stronger and
1229 weaker discontinuities are indicated by a thick solid bar and a thin dashed bar,
1230 respectively. Black horizontal bars indicate Moho depth results from previous
1231 studies: a – Arnaiz-Rodríguez et al. (2016)[15], using a station in the north (1)
1232 and one in the south (2) of the island of Guadeloupe; b – Boynton et al. (1979)[4];
1233 c – Christeson et al. (2008)[32]; d – Dorel et al. (1974)[59]; h – Hammond [pers.
1234 comm.]; k – Kopp et al. (2011)[33]; s – Sevilla et al. (2010)[12], showing a
1235 distinction using events from the northwest (1) and from the south (2) of
1236 Montserrat.
