In this manuscript, Murray et al describe the affiliative behaviour of chimpanzee males. They
found that males were more likely to associate with mothers who had offspring they had sired
than with mothers who had offspring a different male had sired. Additionally, male association
behaviour did not influence the likelihood of those males siring future offspring with those
females.
The study draws on an impressive amount of observation data and I thought that the statistical
methods used to analyse the data were appropriate. One concern I have is that a greater effort
should be made to broaden the appeal outside of a primatologist audience. Although paternal kin
discrimination has been tested in a wide variety of taxa, including birds and fish, there is no
mention of these studies, nor of the kin recognition literature in general (Holmes and Sherman
1982; Mateo 2004).
I have made a few comments to the authors with line numbers where appropriate. I thank the
authors for the opportunity to read their work.
Comments
L27-29 – to make a statement like this, I think you would have to know more about the behaviour
shown by other species in the clade and in the outgroup. Perhaps mother-father bonds were lost
in the chimpanzee lineage but retained in the Homo lineage, for example (also L422-425).
L37-39 – paternal kin discrimination has been shown in many other taxa (fishes and birds), as
well. To appeal to a general audience, I recommend including references to some of these taxa.
L172 – I found the wording of the denominator a little confusing. Consider rewording to “#
minutes ANY adult male followed’
L227 – reword to ‘information ON adult male behavior...’
L243 – Were there any instances of males entering groups solely to groom infants, where a small
amount of interaction time would lead to a high proportion in this calculation?
L257 – I like this
L261-262 – I found this part confusing. How is it that 9 out of 10 are NON-MATERNAL kin, but
the proportion of adult male MATERNAL kin is 0.9?
L397 – To increase the appeal to a general audience, I would have liked to see some attempt to
work out the kin recognition mechanism (either direct or indirect), the way that Buchan et al.
(2003) did.

This is a first class piece of work. I have no substantive criticisms. One suggestion might be to
state that the between period and within period analyses showed the same patterns, and then
present only one or the other. I had to work fairly hard to figure out the difference between these
and many readers will simply be confused.

This manuscript investigates male-female relationships in relation to the presence of an offspring
in the promiscuous Eastern chimpanzees to test two hypotheses (1) males bias their time and
behavior toward their own offspring in a form of paternal care, and (2) males bias their time and
behavior toward unrelated offspring to obtain mating privileges when the mother resumes
cycling. Authors use 25 years of data from the Gombe chimpanzees to show that males spend
more time with their own offspring than with unrelated juveniles in a given time period, that
they spend more time with their own offspring than with unrelated, same-age juveniles, that they
interact preferentially with their own offspring compared to unrelated juveniles, and that male-
female associations during offspring infancy do not predict their subsequent probability of
mating.

This manuscript tests an important hypothesis that had never been tested in this form in Eastern
chimpanzees. The analyses seem relevant and appropriate, results are clear, and the writing-up
is fluid, concise, and easy to follow. The introduction is concise but covers the relevant
background and literature, and same for the discussion. I like this paper, and have little to add. I
think it will be a valuable addition to the field, and is well-suited to the journal.
Here are some minor comments, in a chronological order:
1. L98-106: note that it all depends on who carries the responsibility for the maintenance of
proximity. If females are primarily responsible and follow males, then such associations may not
be very costly to males – that’s the scenario observed in baboons, where males do whatever they
want, including pursuing mating opportunities, and lactating females follow.
2. Following from this, would it actually be possible to establish responsibility in the
maintenance of proximity using your dataset? Presumably not, but just to double check...
3. L103: typo: “bonds are critical” – remove “a”
4. L196-200. Did you attempt to match time periods at best? It’s not too surprising that
results from this model are less compelling than results from the previous in terms of the impact
of paternity on male-offspring associations if a same male can be compared across periods
separated by 10 to 15 years, as the social dynamics & demography of the group can be very
different between such distant periods. If it’s difficult to match periods that are not too distant in
time, would it perhaps be useful to control for some aspects of these changes, such as the
demographic composition of the group (i.e., number of adult males, number of adult females)? I
appreciate that this is not crucial given that you already include a within-period approach that
controls for these demographic aspects… (but you do fit infant age bin in the within-period
model, so it may make sense to fit some aspect of group demography in the within age-class,
between-period approach…)
5. L218. I am not clear on why offspring ID is included in the between-period model, but
not in the within-period model. Could you please clarify?
6. L220. Is it reasonable to fit this variable (time proportion) using a Gaussian model?
Could you please comment on the distribution of the response variable/model residuals, or other
model validation tools to justify your approach?
7. L227: typo: “contains information on adult behavior”
8. L250: typo: “between the infant and the father”
9. L263. I think you need to give more info on the randomization test, and how you
calculate a p-value (One-sided? Two-sided?). It is also useful to see the simulated distributions, as
asymmetrical distributions may reduce the power of your test.
10. L348 more early -> “earlier”? (I'm not a native speaker, so for you to see what is
appropriate)
11. L393-395. Why? Are behavioural interactions always initiated by fathers? It does not
have to be the case… It would actually be useful to present the rate of interactions that are
initiated by the father in the results, especially if you cannot establish who is responsible for the
maintenance of proximity.
12. L423. I am a little uncomfortable with your final sentence “Our results suggest that a
capacity for paternal care, but not long-term mother-father bonds (…) existed early in hominin
evolution, because your results do not rule out the fact that a capacity for long-term associations
exist in early hominin evolution: first, you show that such associations may last 18 months, which
is not so short, second you show that longer associations exist for some male-female dyads (at
least 6/22), which is not nothing, and finally we know from gorillas that long-term male-female
associations exist in (some) apes. So I’d rather say something like “Our results suggest that a
capacity for paternal care existed early in hominin evolution, and can occur independently of
long-term male-female associations”.

L180-181 – perhaps explain why any potential paternal kin are included as non-kin
L333 – out of curiosity, what was the average time between births for mothers? Is conception
typically within the analyzed 18-month period, or do mothers need to remember what males
were around a lot after they first gave birth?
L341 – I do not think the word “Despite” applies here. I would expect this kin-biased behaviour
to evolve in promiscuous societies.
L368 – I agree with this idea for future studies. Perhaps other male ‘friends’ previously mated
with the mother? In that case, this kin-biased association behaviour would be explained by
indirect cues of kinship (mating history, as you describe on L404) rather than some direct kin
recognition mechanism like self-referencing.

L180-181 – perhaps explain why any potential paternal kin are included as non-kin
Some exclusively paternal kinship can be assigned from the DNA testing used to assign
paternity; however these data are limited. Also, it remains an open question the degree to which
paternal kinship influences male-female associations. Thus we considered relationships based on
long-term genealogical records. We have added this explanation to lines 184-186.
L333 – out of curiosity, what was the average time between births for mothers? Is conception
typically within the analyzed 18-month period, or do mothers need to remember what males
were around a lot after they first gave birth?
The average interbirth interval at Gombe is ~5.6 years, thus conception is not in the 18-month
period analyzed.
L341 – I do not think the word “Despite” applies here. I would expect this kin-biased behaviour
to evolve in promiscuous societies.
Changed to “However” in manuscript.
L368 – I agree with this idea for future studies. Perhaps other male ‘friends’ previously mated
with the mother? In that case, this kin-biased association behaviour would be explained by
indirect cues of kinship (mating history, as you describe on L404) rather than some direct kin
recognition mechanism like self-referencing.
Thank you, we are excited about the future directions of this research.
I thank the authors for allowing me to read their work.
We thank the reviewer for their comments.

his manuscript, Murray et al describe the affiliative behaviour of chimpanzee males.
ey found that males were more likely to associate with mothers who had offspring
y had sired than with mothers who had offspring a different male had sired.
ditionally, male association behaviour did not influence the likelihood of those males
ng future offspring with those females.
e study draws on an impressive amount of observation data and I thought that the
tistical methods used to analyse the data were appropriate. One concern I have is
t a greater effort should be made to broaden the appeal outside of a primatologist
ience. Although paternal kin discrimination has been tested in a wide variety of taxa,
uding birds and fish, there is no mention of these studies, nor of the kin recognition
rature in general (Holmes and Sherman 1982; Mateo 2004).
ank you for your comments. To appeal to a more general audience, we now
erence studies on a wider variety of taxa and a review of kin recognition
rature on Lines 40-42.
ve made a few comments to the authors with line numbers where appropriate. I
nk the authors for the opportunity to read their work.

-29 – to make a statement like this, I think you would have to know more about the
aviour shown by other species in the clade and in the outgroup. Perhaps mother-
er bonds were lost in the chimpanzee lineage but retained in the Homo lineage, for
mple (also L422-425).
imilar comment was made by Reviewer 3, who proposed some alternate text to
rify. We thank both reviewers for their astute comment, agree, and therefore
ve tempered this sentence as well as the sentence originally on Lines 429-431
ndicate that the results suggest the capacity for paternal care could have
sted early in hominin evolution, possibly in the absence of long-term male-
ale bonds.
-39 – paternal kin discrimination has been shown in many other taxa (fishes and
s), as well. To appeal to a general audience, I recommend including references to
me of these taxa.
ank you for the suggestion. We now include references to additional fish and
d taxa on Lines 37-42.
2 – I found the wording of the denominator a little confusing. Consider rewording to
minutes ANY adult male followed’
have changed the wording of the denominator to ‘# minutes the given adult
le was followed’ to clarify that the data in the numerator and denominator both
me from a given adult male.
7 – reword to ‘information ON adult male behavior...’
anged in manuscript.
3 – Were there any instances of males entering groups solely to groom infants,
ere a small amount of interaction time would lead to a high proportion in this
culation?
s is a great question! However, it is extremely unlikely given that the minutes
nteraction with infants compared to the minutes spent in the same party are
y low. For example, the highest dyadic rate of interaction is ~8.8% of the time
ale spends with an infant, meaning that association without interacting is
ch more common than association with interactions.
7 – I like this
ank you.
1-262 – I found this part confusing. How is it that 9 out of 10 are NON-MATERNAL
, but the proportion of adult male MATERNAL kin is 0.9?
ologies, this was a typo. It has been corrected to ‘4the proportion of male
N-maternal kin in the community would be 0.9.’
7 – To increase the appeal to a general audience, I would have liked to see some
mpt to work out the kin recognition mechanism (either direct or indirect), the way
t Buchan et al. (2003) did.
agree that this is an interesting direction and intend to address in a fuller,
ure treatment that includes such potential mechanisms as MHC compatibility
sed on genotyping. Given the breadth of possible mechanisms, we feel that
s is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.

s is a first class piece of work. I have no substantive criticisms. One suggestion
ht be to state that the between period and within period analyses showed the same
terns, and then present only one or the other. I had to work fairly hard to figure out
difference between these and many readers will simply be confused.
ank you very much! We have retained both within and between period
alyses in the revised manuscript as we believe they give slightly different, but
mplementary information. The within period analysis allowed us to compare
hers’ associations with infants controlling for time period, while the between
iod analysis allowed us to ensure that any bias in association with a male’s
n infant during an age bin did not simply reflect a preference for infants of that
e. To make this clearer in the manuscript, we added more detail on Lines 206-
.

s manuscript investigates male-female relationships in relation to the presence of an
pring in the promiscuous Eastern chimpanzees to test two hypotheses (1) males
s their time and behavior toward their own offspring in a form of paternal care, and
males bias their time and behavior toward unrelated offspring to obtain mating
ileges when the mother resumes cycling. Authors use 25 years of data from the
mbe chimpanzees to show that males spend more time with their own offspring than
h unrelated juveniles in a given time period, that they spend more time with their own
pring than with unrelated, same-age juveniles, that they interact preferentially with
ir own offspring compared to unrelated juveniles, and that male-female associations
ing offspring infancy do not predict their subsequent probability of mating.
s manuscript tests an important hypothesis that had never been tested in this form in
stern chimpanzees. The analyses seem relevant and appropriate, results are clear,
the writing-up is fluid, concise, and easy to follow. The introduction is concise but
ers the relevant background and literature, and same for the discussion. I like this
er, and have little to add. I think it will be a valuable addition to the field, and is well-
ted to the journal.
re are some minor comments, in a chronological order:
L98-106: note that it all depends on who carries the responsibility for the
intenance of proximity. If females are primarily responsible and follow males, then
h associations may not be very costly to males – that’s the scenario observed in
oons, where males do whatever they want, including pursuing mating opportunities,
lactating females follow.
s is a very good point; however, as we now note on Lines 103-108, lactating
ales travel more slowly than males or females without offspring, thus it would
difficult for mothers to be solely responsible for maintaining proximity.
Following from this, would it actually be possible to establish responsibility in the
intenance of proximity using your dataset? Presumably not, but just to double
ck...
s would indeed be very interesting to test; unfortunately, these data are not
ilable in the long-term dataset so beyond the scope of this paper.
L103: typo: “bonds are critical” – remove “a”
anged in manuscript
L196-200. Did you attempt to match time periods at best? It’s not too surprising
t results from this model are less compelling than results from the previous in terms
he impact of paternity on male-offspring associations if a same male can be
mpared across periods separated by 10 to 15 years, as the social dynamics &
mography of the group can be very different between such distant periods. If it’s
icult to match periods that are not too distant in time, would it perhaps be useful to
trol for some aspects of these changes, such as the demographic composition of the
up (i.e., number of adult males, number of adult females)? I appreciate that this is
crucial given that you already include a within-period approach that controls for
se demographic aspectsI (but you do fit infant age bin in the within-period model,
it may make sense to fit some aspect of group demography in the within age-class,
ween-period approachI)
you suggest, it is difficult to match periods and this is one reason we present
h the within and between period analyses as either on its own leaves the door
en for an alternative explanation: e.g. the possibility that fathers’ associations
due to age preferences or something about the time period. However, we also
e that we z-transformed father associations with all mother-infant pairs in part
control for known changes in gregariousness in this community over time,
ich may result from factors that include demographic variation and community
e.
L218. I am not clear on why offspring ID is included in the between-period model,
not in the within-period model. Could you please clarify?
were less concerned about repeated sampling on offspring for the within-
iod model as they did not appear repeatedly in the exact same time period as
y do in the between period analysis. However, it is true that each offspring
es appear more than once at various ages, in different time periods. We
refore added offspring ID to the within-period model as well (Lines 226-227),
d there was no difference in the results.
L220. Is it reasonable to fit this variable (time proportion) using a Gaussian
del? Could you please comment on the distribution of the response variable/model
iduals, or other model validation tools to justify your approach?
e z-transformed proportions (our response variable) were normally distributed
d we checked for violations from the assumptions of normality and
mogeneity of variance using residual plots. We found no evidence of violations
d have now added a sentence to the methods to indicate that we performed
se checks on Lines 294-296.
L227: typo: “contains information on adult behavior”
anged in manuscript
L250: typo: “between the infant and the father”
anged in manuscript
L263. I think you need to give more info on the randomization test, and how you
culate a p-value (One-sided? Two-sided?). It is also useful to see the simulated
tributions, as asymmetrical distributions may reduce the power of your test.
e permutation tests were two-sided and simulated distributions were normally
tributed. We now state this in the methods and cite the packages we used in
We have not added figures containing the sampling distributions, but can add
se as supplementary information if it is deemed necessary.
L348 more early -> “earlier”? (I'm not a native speaker, so for you to see what is
ropriate)
clarify, we have changed to 4’fathers associated more during early infancy4’
L393-395. Why? Are behavioural interactions always initiated by fathers? It does
have to be the caseI It would actually be useful to present the rate of interactions
t are initiated by the father in the results, especially if you cannot establish who is
ponsible for the maintenance of proximity.
s is a very good point. Unfortunately, the long-term data do not consistently
ntain information on who is responsible for initiating interactions or
intaining proximity. As such, we agree that in this example fathers could be
ssive participants and have removed this statement from the manuscript.
L423. I am a little uncomfortable with your final sentence “Our results suggest that
apacity for paternal care, but not long-term mother-father bonds (I) existed early in
minin evolution, because your results do not rule out the fact that a capacity for long-
m associations exist in early hominin evolution: first, you show that such associations
y last 18 months, which is not so short, second you show that longer associations
st for some male-female dyads (at least 6/22), which is not nothing, and finally we
w from gorillas that long-term male-female associations exist in (some) apes. So I’d
her say something like “Our results suggest that a capacity for paternal care existed
ly in hominin evolution, and can occur independently of long-term male-female
ociations”.
ank you for the excellent suggestion. We have incorporated this sentence into
end of the discussion, as well as edited a similar sentence in the abstract to
lect this.
