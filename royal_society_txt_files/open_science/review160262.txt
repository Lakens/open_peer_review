Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The authors provide a thought provoking study describing a spatially explicit model of herbivore
foraging behaviour. The outcomes of the modelling are discussed in the context of reef recovery.
I thoroughly enjoyed this manuscript. I believe it is a timely and much needed treatment of
herbivore behaviour on coral reefs and the implications of this behaviour.
General Comments
1. I am not sure I entirely agree with the choice to characterise an ephemeral post-
disturbance benthos as composed of 90% macroalgae (I realise this is a slight simplification of the
description of primary algal competitors). Having this much ‘primary algal competitor’ would
seem to me to be more in line with a regime shift (see my specific comment later on). Instead,
having a high percentage of turf algae would seem more appropriate as a representation of a
post-disturbance reef. I understand that space constraints may not permit exploration of a wide
range of starting conditions, however, having brief results on one or two other initial scenarios in
the supplementary material would be interesting.
2. The writing is a little bit long winded in places. It would help make the key messages
clearer if efforts were made to make the writing more concise, removing repetitive information.
For example the model domain section in the methods. I have highlighted one or two other
places in the specific comments, but there are further instances.
3. I found the methods and results sections a little difficult to follow. I have highlighted
specific problems in the following comments, but I think that tightening and clarifying these
sections would better complement the interesting Discussion you present.
4. While I found the discussion very interesting, I believe there is a need to link the study
outcomes to more of the broader literature – much of the discussion is focused solely on the
findings of this study, but there is a considerable relevant literature that could be brought in here.
Specific Comments
Line 28 From here on, where you are describing your results, I think you need to temper your
language slightly to reflect the nature of your analysis which is modelling with inbuilt
assumptions that may or may not hold true in the real world.
Line 31-33 Despite the lead in, in the previous sentence, it is not very clear how the first part of
this sentence links to the second half.
Line 49-52 This seems quite vague and to encompass all possible drivers - both abiotic and biotic,
so not sure exactly what you are trying to get at, other than there are lots of potential interacting
drivers.
Line 61 I would remove the word ‘fleshy’ here
Paragraph starting at Line 77 It would be beneficial to make this paragraph more concise and
combine it with the previous paragraph.
Line 77 ‘…there is a need…’
Line 84 ‘…lead to spatially heterogeneous…’
3
Line 92 It would be good to explain here what you mean by 'short-term'
Line 94-95 ‘…sufficient open space free of fleshy algae to facilitate settlement of corals….’
Line 133 ‘We further develop a cellular automata model...’
Line 135-136 ‘Not really clear what you are saying here - you used stereotypical coral growth
morphologies? Need to clarify.’
Line 144 ‘…these three benthic types…’
Paragraph starting at Line 162 I think you need to make it very clear at this point that secondary
algae may become primary algae in your model. This is implied here but isnt explicit. Linked to
this point, do I understand from Figure 1 that primary algae may also arise from coralline algae
without becoming secondary algae first? This isn’t very clear in the text.
Line 175 Although in playing around with the numbers I worked out what you meant here, I
think it would be beneficial if you made this clearer to your reader.
Section starting at line 183 (Herbivore Model). In reading this section and then viewing figure 3 at
the start of the results, I realised that I am confused about what the homing function describes.
Based on the description within the Herbivore Model section, I expected the homing radius to be
much larger than the grazing area when representing mobile, roving herbivores, such as in the
top line of snapshots in Figure 3. But this doesn’t seem to be the case. As such I think a much
clearer explanation of what the homing movements relate to is needed.
Paragraph starting at line 265. I am not sure about stating that having 90% coverage of mature
macroalgae (or thick turf) could be construed as an ephemeral state, considering the evidence that
extensive macroalgal fields reduce macroalgal consumption by herbivores reinforcing the
macroalgal dominated state (see Hoey & Bellwood 2011 Ecology Letters). While I understand
that you assessed a wide array of starting conditions (as discussed later on in the paragraph), you
don’t present any of these results. It would seem more sensible to me if you are interested in
recovery of a damaged reef that has not locked into a new algal dominated regime, to start with a
higher coverage of turf algae (secondary algal class) rather than macroalgae. If, as you state this
doesn’t affect the outcomes, then at the very least, these additional results need to be presented.
Line 188 This reference doesn't appear to be in your reference list.
Line 243 So each ‘bite’ is the removal of algae from a 100cm2 cell – is this correct? This needs to
be clarified.
Line 276 In the text you reference figure 4 before figure 3.
Line 296 ‘…led to qualitatively similar results as when using a uniform distribution…’
Line 305 – 308 This seems repetitive of the figure caption.
Paragraph starting at Line 310 I found this section of text very confusing. What do you mean by
diversity of space use patterns? This paragraph needs to be clarified.
Line 323 Do you mean more herbivores that happen to be spatially constrained or herbivores that
are more spatially constrained? Please clarify.
4
Section on halos starting at Lines 333. In line with my previous comment on the size of your
homing radii, I would think that your choice of minimising movement by fish among grazing
bouts, by having very small homing radii, drives this production of halos. I would be interested
whether larger movements between grazing bouts (what I am taking to be the homing
movements) would remove this halo effect, although this may be linked to my lack of
understanding regarding the homing movements.
Paragraph starting at Line 373. In this paragraph you refer to number of cells bitten per week
and low impact of herbivory. In both cases you present a number of cells per week in the
parentheses that follow. Are you referring to different settings of the model in both instances
here, or are you talking about two separate things– i) number of cells bitten per week, which you
are setting and ii) the grazing pressure that is an outcome of your model. Currently it is not clear,
as a result I find this paragraph difficult to follow.
Line 454 ‘…may not persist…’
Line 456 ‘…if shorter term…’
Table 1 Everything in this table, other that the meaning of the Cth term is fairly clear. Although
you direct your reader to Sandin & MacNamara for more info, I think it would be helpful to have
at least some explanation of this in the table caption.
Figure 2 Caption - What is RM – should this be RH? Also in the figure you have the Pm label
sitting within the Rg area, and the Pg label sitting within the Rh area – is this correct?
Figure 3 Caption Do you mean 90% primary algal competitor? In the caption it currently states:
90% secondary algal competitor and 10% secondary algal competitor

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
I find the question presented by the authors to be inherently interesting; how patterns of space
use by herbivores affects the dynamics and recovery of coral reef benthic communities. However,
after reading the manuscript i am left wondering how representative the outcomes are of actual
reef dynamics. The model itself is based on a number of assumptions that limit the tractability to
real world situations. The authors do acknowledge at least some of these and either argue they
are not significant or do not have an impact on the model outputs. I can sympethsize that some
simplification is necessary when building a model, but these cannot be justified when they are
erroneous. For example, the authors argue that it is unrealistic to consider the grazing behaviour
of individual species (lines 180-185) but i would have thought that a functional group approach
would be justified. These are relatively well established and accepted, and to my understanding
have differential impacts on the resilience of reefs. Further, assuming that the probability of an
algal cell being grazed is independent of its type (turf vs fleshy macroalgae, or in the context of
the model: secondary vs primary algal competitors) is not justified. This is a major flaw of the
model. Numerous studies have demonstrated that most herbivores do not feed on feed on fleshy
macroalgae, therefore assuming that they are equally likely to feed on these surfaces, and that
they can convert primary algal cells to secondary model cells is meaningless. This differential
susceptibility of algal types to herbivore functional groups is one of the primary reasons that
phase-shifts to macroalgae have proven difficult to reverse, and one of the feedbacks
hypothesised to lead to hysteresis (see review by Mumby and Steneck 2008 TREE). This issue is
confused further as all herbivores in the model are considered to 'scrape' the substratum. Very
few herbivores scrape the substratum, and of those that do none feed on fleshy macroalgae.
Similarly, no spatially-constrained herbivores (ie with small foraging range) that i am aware of
consume fleshy macroalgae.

label_comment_3
The authors have made few changes to address my previous concerns and their arguments for
not addressing these comments are generally weak.
while the same set of fishes may graze on long and short turfs, they will not feed on fleshy
macroalgae. A case could also be made that many grazing herbivores will not feed on long turfs
but i will refrain from that here. the authors cannot simply ignore this issue by stating that
macroalgae does not exclusively represent their primary algal competitor group. If a cell (or area
of reef) is dominated by macroalgae then grazing fishes will not be able to convert it to a long-
turf, short-turf or coralline algal state.
The grouping of long turfs and fleshy macroalgae as 'primary algal competitors' may be
supported in terms of competitive interactions with corals, however it is not supported in terms
of interactions with herbivores. As the authors are reluctant to include this distinction in their
model I suggest the easiest way to address is to remove fleshy macroalgae from the definition of
'primary algal competitor' so that primary algal competitors be represented by long turfs

label_comment_4
Since this manuscript already went through thorough review, I'm assuming that my perspective
is solicited to resolve the last remaining issue, i.e., whether macro-algae may reasonably be
included in the category of 'primary algal competitors' (PAC). Reviewer #2 states that although
fleshy macro-algae maybe grouped with PAC as competitors for space with corals, they cannot be
considered PAC in terms of food for herbivores (at least not equally likely to be grazed as
'secondary algal competitors' (SAC)). The authors maintain that the composition of the herbivore
community (CHC) is highly variable and may include consumers of fleshy macro-algae.
In Appendix 1, the authors convincingly show that this discrepancy in viewpoint does not affect
the major conclusions of the paper. Food preference of CHC does not change the qualitative
dynamics of the model, as is evident from comparing Fig 3 in the main text with Fig A in the
Appendix. Therefore, I concur with the authors.

Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
Since this manuscript already went through thorough review, I'm assuming that my perspective
is solicited to resolve the last remaining issue, i.e., whether macro-algae may reasonably be
included in the category of 'primary algal competitors' (PAC). Reviewer #2 states that although
fleshy macro-algae maybe grouped with PAC as competitors for space with corals, they cannot be
considered PAC in terms of food for herbivores (at least not equally likely to be grazed as
'secondary algal competitors' (SAC)). The authors maintain that the composition of the herbivore
community (CHC) is highly variable and may include consumers of fleshy macro-algae.
In Appendix 1, the authors convincingly show that this discrepancy in viewpoint does not affect
the major conclusions of the paper. Food preference of CHC does not change the qualitative
15
dynamics of the model, as is evident from comparing Fig 3 in the main text with Fig A in the
Appendix. Therefore, I concur with the authors.
Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-160262)
Dear Professor Kevin Padian, Andrew Dunn and editors of Journal of the Royal Society, Open
Science:
Thank you very much for having accepted the revised manuscript of our article entitled
“Herbivore space use influences coral reef recovery” for publication as a research article in
Journal of the Royal Society, Open Science.
In this last review, Reviewer #3 concur with us that food preference of the herbivore community
does not change the qualitative dynamics of the model and underlines the importance of having
included Appendix #3.
Additionally, Reviewer #3 did not suggest any change.
Again, many thanks to the reviewers, editors and editorial board members for their time; we
really appreciate their help in improving our work.

Dear Professor Kevin Padian, Emilie Aimé and editors of Journal of the Royal Society, Open Science:
We hope you will consider the revised manuscript of our article entitled “Herbivore space use influences coral reef recovery” for
publication as a research article in Journal of the Royal Society, Open Science. We also want to thank the two anonymous
reviewers for their very encouraging comments. They definitely helped shape the manuscript with their constructive remarks.
Broad changes made to the manuscript:
This original manuscript has been thoroughly modified and edited following the reviewers’ advice. Indeed, several parts of the
manuscript have been modified or added to improve its clarity. Additionally, this revised version now comprised a new appendix
(appendix 3) presenting original results concerning the choice of the initial conditions for the presented simulations. This appendix
reinforces the robustness of the results, in particularly highlighting that spatial patterns of herbivory are quantitatively important
for determining recovery trajectories of coral reefs across an inclusive spectrum of foraging preference.
We provide more specific responses to the individual reviewers below, with the original reviews in italics and our responses in
bold.
Responses to Reviewer #1:
The authors provide a thought provoking study describing a spatially explicit model of herbivore foraging behaviour. The
outcomes of the modelling are discussed in the context of reef recovery. I thoroughly enjoyed this manuscript. I believe it is a
timely and much needed treatment of herbivore behaviour on coral reefs and the implications of this behaviour.
General Comments
1. I am not sure I entirely agree with the choice to characterize an ephemeral post-disturbance benthos as composed of 90%
macroalgae (I realize this is a slight simplification of the description of primary algal competitors). Having this much
‘primary algal competitor’ would seem to me to be more in line with a regime shift (see my specific comment later
on). Instead, having a high percentage of turf algae would seem more appropriate as a representation of a post-
disturbance reef. I understand that space constraints may not permit exploration of a wide range of starting conditions,
however, having brief results on one or two other initial scenarios in the supplementary material would be interesting.
We understand the reviewer’s concerns about the initial conditions of the simulation presented in the manuscript. Hence,
we have followed the reviewer’s advice and added a more detailed description of the sensitivity to the initial conditions in a
new appendix (Appendix 3) showing that the model outputs presented in the Results section are similar for wide variations
in the starting conditions defining the ratio of primary to secondary algal competitor. (line 283 to 286 and Appendix 3)
2. The writing is a little bit long winded in places. It would help make the key messages clearer if efforts were made to
make the writing more concise, removing repetitive information. For example the model domain section in the
methods. I have highlighted one or two other places in the specific comments, but there are further instances.
The manuscript has been edited accordingly, with the goal to make it clearer and avoid unnecessary information
repetition.
3. I found the methods and results sections a little difficult to follow. I have highlighted specific problems in the following
comments, but I think that tightening and clarifying these sections would better complement the interesting Discussion
you present.
The results and methods function have been modified accordingly following the reviewers advice (see below).
4. While I found the discussion very interesting, I believe there is a need to link the study outcomes to more of the broader
literature – much of the discussion is focused solely on the findings of this study, but there is a considerable relevant
literature that could be brought in here.
We hear the reviewer’s advice and we also think that there is value in broadening a discussion. We have addressed this
concern somewhat by tightening the text within this (and other) section of the manuscript. Admittedly, however, our edits
are somewhat limited in the Discussion, especially given the somewhat contradictory review of Reviewer #2 (challenging
the specifics of the model moreso than the extensions to biological systems). As with most authors, we welcome the
encouragement to extend our thinking and interpretation of the results in the Discussion, but we grew concerned about
adding too much content to the manuscript. Hence we have decided to only include references to the literature directly
connected to the results of this work. However, if the editors and reviewer believe that more edits and extensions of the
Discussion would be valuable, we will be glad to consider how it could enrich the current manuscript.
Specific Comments:
Introduction:
Line 28 From here on, where you are describing your results, I think you need to temper your language slightly to reflect the
nature of your analysis which is modelling with inbuilt assumptions that may or may not hold true in the real world.
The language used in the abstract has been tempered to better reflect that our results are issued from a model
analysis.(line 28 to 30)
Line 31-33 Despite the lead in, in the previous sentence, it is not very clear how the first part of this sentence links to the second
half.
We acknowledge the misconstruction of this sentence; hence it has been removed from the abstract.
Line 49-52 This seems quite vague and to encompass all possible drivers - both abiotic and biotic, so not sure exactly what you
are trying to get at, other than there are lots of potential interacting drivers.
This sentence has been modified and now only focus on the central role of spatial competition in the observed spatial and
taxonomic diversity of coral reefs. Also, the end of this paragraph has been modified to improve its clarity. (Line 44 to 55)
Line 61 I would remove the word ‘fleshy’ here
We agree and thus have removed the term ‘fleshy’. (Line 58)
Paragraph starting at Line 77 It would be beneficial to make this paragraph more concise and combine it with the previous
paragraph.
This paragraph has been shortened and combined with the previous one. (Line 57 to 76)
Line 77 ‘…there is a need…’
Done. (Line 71 to 72)
Line 84 ‘…lead to spatially heterogeneous…’
This sentence has been modified. (Line 72 to 76)
Line 92 It would be good to explain here what you mean by 'short-term'
The sentence has been modified to make its meaning more clear. (Line 81)
Line 94-95 ‘…sufficient open space free of fleshy algae to facilitate settlement of corals….’
Done. (Line 83 to 84)
Material & Methods
Line 133 ‘We further develop a cellular automata model...’
This sentence has been modified. (Line 122)
Line 135-136 ‘Not really clear what you are saying here - you used stereotypical coral growth morphologies? Need to clarify.’
The sentence has been modified to make its meaning more clear. (Line 122 to 125)
Line 144 ‘…these three benthic types…’
We think the reviewer referred to line 146, advising to replace ‘these three types’ by ‘these four benthic types’. This latter
has been done. (Line 133)
Paragraph starting at Line 162 I think you need to make it very clear at this point that secondary algae may become primary
algae in your model. This is implied here but isn’t explicit. Linked to this point, do I understand from Figure 1 that primary algae
may also arise from coralline algae without becoming secondary algae first? This isn’t very clear in the text.
We agree with the reviewer that the rules and different types of succession between groups needed to be stated more
clearly in the text. Thus, a small paragraph presenting the possible transitions has been added, and now complement Fig. 1
and Table 1 in describing the model. (Line 149 to 165)
Line 175 Although in playing around with the numbers I worked out what you meant here, I think it would be beneficial if you
made this clearer to your reader.
The sentence has been modified to make its meaning more clear. (Line 180 to 181)
Section starting at line 183 (Herbivore Model). In reading this section and then viewing figure 3 at the start of the results, I
realised that I am confused about what the homing function describes. Based on the description within the Herbivore Model
section, I expected the homing radius to be much larger than the grazing area when representing mobile, roving herbivores, such
as in the top line of snapshots in Figure 3. But this doesn’t seem to be the case. As such I think a much clearer explanation of
what the homing movements relate to is needed.
Based on his/her understanding of the herbivore model, the reviewer anticipated that the homing radius should be larger
than the grazing radius when representing mobile, roving herbivores. Indeed, in the model, the homing radius can be
larger than the grazing radius. Hence, the reviewer is correct when thinking that some types of herbivores community will
exhibit such space use characteristic. In Fig. 3 (Fig. 4 in the revised manuscript), such types of herbivore space use will be
located in left side of the graph (i.e. on the left side of the blue dotted line in the figure below), where RH>RG. Finally, we
note that none of the types of herbivore community space use exhibiting such characteristics led to a recovery of the reef
after 50 years thus we have focused on an extended range of the homing node/grazing node parameter space.
RH>RG%
RH<RG%
G%
RH =R
We also acknowledge the lake of clarity in the description of the homing radius. Its definition has been modified and we
hope it will make its understanding much clearer. (Line 231 to 235)
Paragraph starting at line 265. I am not sure about stating that having 90% coverage of mature macroalgae (or thick turf) could
be construed as an ephemeral state, considering the evidence that extensive macroalgal fields reduce macroalgal consumption by
herbivores reinforcing the macroalgal dominated state (see Hoey & Bellwood 2011 Ecology Letters). While I understand that
you assessed a wide array of starting conditions (as discussed later on in the paragraph), you don’t present any of these results. It
would seem more sensible to me if you are interested in recovery of a damaged reef that has not locked into a new algal
dominated regime, to start with a higher coverage of turf algae (secondary algal class) rather than macroalgae. If, as you state
this doesn’t affect the outcomes, then at the very least, these additional results need to be presented.
We share the reviewer concern about the importance of initial conditions, which had motivated us to try several
configuration of post-disturbance benthic composition. Due to the relatively high transition rate from the secondary algal
competitor toward the primary algal competitor chose for the simulation, 0.33 year-1 as well as the growth rate of the
primary algal competitor, the differences between the simulations with an initial condition of 100% secondary algal
competitor, one of 100% primary algal competitor or even 100% CCA/empty space are hardly noticeable after 240 days of
simulations, as shown in the figure below.
Ini$al'condi$ons' 10%days% 80%days% 160%days% 240%days% 300%days% 365%days%
100%%
CCA/empty%space%
100%%
Secondary%algal%
compe=tor%
100%%
Primary%algal%
compe=tor%
We recognize that the statement pointed by the reviewer could be misleading. Here, we wanted to enlighten that the initial
conditions are ephemeral because the steady state of the system will depend on the type of simulated herbivore’s impact.
The sentence pointed by the reviewer has been modified. Additionally, the figure presented above is now part of an
additional appendix that discuss how initial conditions affect the result presented in this manuscript. (Line 280 to 286 and
Appendix 3)
Line 188 This reference doesn't appear to be in your reference list.
We have corrected this unfortunate mistake. (see bibliography)
Line 243 So each ‘bite’ is the removal of algae from a 100cm2 cell – is this correct? This needs to be clarified.
Indeed, each ‘bite’ is the removal of algae from 100cm2 cell. The first sentence introducing the term ‘bite’ in the
manuscript has been modified to clarify that point. (Line 252)
Line 276 In the text you reference figure 4 before figure 3.
We apologize for this mistake, it has been corrected.
Line 296 ‘…led to qualitatively similar results as when using a uniform distribution…’
Done. (Line 309)
Line 305 – 308 This seems repetitive of the figure caption.
Indeed, this part of the paragraph was slightly repetitive when compared to the mentioned figure’s caption. Thus, we have
removed this sentence from the manuscript.
Paragraph starting at Line 310 I found this section of text very confusing. What do you mean by diversity of space use
patterns? This paragraph needs to be clarified.
By using the word diversity, we meant to underline that the larger the maximum number of bites (BM) is, the larger the
number of different types of space use leading to reef recovery is.
Figure 3 (formerly Figure 4) presents the isoclines of the mean coral cover after 50 years of simulation as a function of he
homing node size (Y-axis) and the grazing node size (X-axis). Hence, every point on the homing node size * grazing node
size plan represents a given type of space use. Thus, a subset of the plane corresponds to a set of space use. The larger this
subset is, the higher the diversity of space use (i.e. the number of different type of space use) forming the plan subset is.
In Figure 3, the three isoclines represent the mean 30% coral cover threshold for 3 different values of the maximal grazing
impact (BM). Inside the curves the coral cover is higher than 30% after 50 years, outside, it is lower. Thus, for a given value
of BM, every type of space use under the curve has led to a coral cover of, at least, 30% after 50 years. The larger this area
is, the larger the number of type of space use, what we called the diversity of space use, leading to at least 30% of coral
cover after 50 years is.
Following the reviewer comments, we have edited that paragraph to avoid any further misunderstandings. (Line 324 to
330)
Line 323 Do you mean more herbivores that happen to be spatially constrained or herbivores that are more spatially constrained?
Please clarify.
We actually meant ‘herbivores that are more spatially constrained’. We thank the reviewer for having identified what could
have been a confusing sentence and we have edited it accordingly. (Line 338 to 339)
Section on halos starting at Lines 333. In line with my previous comment on the size of your homing radius, I would think that
your choice of minimizing movement by fish among grazing bouts, by having very small homing radii, drives this production of
halos. I would be interested whether larger movements between grazing bouts (what I am taking to be the homing movements)
would remove this halo effect, although this may be linked to my lack of understanding regarding the homing movements.
The reviewer is wondering if an increase in the homing radius, and thus the homing node size, could remove the halo
effect. In the model, for a given maximum number of bites (BM), both an increase in the homing radius and the grazing
radius could lead to the disappearance of what we call an ‘halo’. Hence, the reviewer is correct when thinking that an
increase in the homing radius could lead to the disappearance of the halo. Indeed, when looking at figure 4 (formerly
figure 3), one can see that if a halo is present after 50 years with a homing node size of 0.18 m2 and a grazing node size of
9m2 (point f), this halo disappears if the homing node size increases to 0.32m2(point c).
Paragraph starting at Line 373. In this paragraph you refer to number of cells bitten per week and low impact of herbivory. In
both cases you present a number of cells per week in the parentheses that follow. Are you referring to different settings of the
model in both instances here, or are you talking about two separate things– i) number of cells bitten per week, which you are
setting and ii) the grazing pressure that is an outcome of your model. Currently it is not clear, as a result I find this paragraph
difficult to follow.
We agree with the reviewer comment and have decided to modify this paragraph to make it clearer. (Line 387 to 397)
Line 454 ‘…may not persist…’
Done. (Line 470)
Line 456 ‘…if shorter term…’
Done. (Line 472)
Table 1 Everything in this table, other that the meaning of the Cth term is fairly clear. Although you direct your reader to Sandin
& MacNamara for more info, I think it would be helpful to have at least some explanation of this in the table caption.
Indeed, the meaning of the Cth term was unclear to the reader. Hence, following the reviewer’s advice, we have now
included more explanation in the caption of the table. (See Table 1 caption)
Figure 2 Caption - What is RM – should this be RH? Also in the figure you have the Pm label sitting within the Rg area, and the
Pg label sitting within the Rh area – is this correct?
We thank the reviewer for having catch this figure version issue, we have now included the correct version of the figure
and we apologize for this mistake. (see Figure 2)
Figure 3 Caption Do you mean 90% primary algal competitor? In the caption it currently states: 90% secondary algal competitor
and 10% secondary algal competitor
Indeed, we actually meant 90% primary algal competitor: this mistake has been corrected. (see Line 693)
Reviewer #2:
I find the question presented by the authors to be inherently interesting; how patterns of space use by herbivores affects the
dynamics and recovery of coral reef benthic communities. However, after reading the manuscript I am left wondering how
representative the outcomes are of actual reef dynamics. The model itself is based on a number of assumptions that limit the
tractability to real world situations. The authors do acknowledge at least some of these and either argue they are not significant or
do not have an impact on the model outputs. I can sympathize that some simplification is necessary when building a model, but
these cannot be justified when they are erroneous. For example, the authors argue that it is unrealistic to consider the grazing
behaviour of individual species (lines 180-185) but I would have thought that a functional group approach would be justified.
These are relatively well established and accepted, and to my understanding have differential impacts on the resilience of reefs.
We thank the reviewer for this comment, which allows us to better frame why we have chosen such a structure for our
model. Indeed, functional groups are well established and accepted, and such classification has participated in improving
our understanding of the coral reef system. To be clear, we do not think that representing the impact of each functional
group is inherently unrealistic, but rather an unnecessary refinement of the model in the light of the question we are trying
to answer here. Moreover, each functional group’s space use will be represented by a subset or a set of subsets of the
parameter space presented in Fig 4 (Fig 3 in the revised form of the manuscript), and is thus already represented by our
model. Our main goal was to avoid increasing the number of assumption at the base of the structure of the herbivore
model so that the results can be clearly related to as few parameters as possible.
Further, assuming that the probability of an algal cell being grazed is independent of its type (turf vs fleshy macroalgae, or in the
context of the model: secondary vs primary algal competitors) is not justified. This is a major flaw of the model. Numerous studies
have demonstrated that most herbivores do not feed on feed on fleshy macroalgae, therefore assuming that they are equally likely
to feed on these surfaces, and that they can convert primary algal cells to secondary model cells is meaningless. This differential
susceptibility of algal types to herbivore functional groups is one of the primary reasons that phase-shifts to macroalgae have
proven difficult to reverse, and one of the feedbacks hypothesised to lead to hysteresis (see review by Mumby and Steneck 2008
TREE).
We agree with the reviewer, numerous studies have demonstrated that only a few herbivores eat fleshy macroalgae. In the
model, fleshy macroalgae will belong to the primary algal competitor group, but not exclusively represent this group, as
thick turf also belongs to that group and is sometimes the dominant algal group on the benthos.
In the results presented in this manuscript, we make the assumption that herbivores indifferently graze onto the primary
and secondary algal competitor. Even if such hypothesis has already been followed in some contributions of mathematical
modeling to reef ecology (Mumby et al, 2007; Blackwood et al., 2011, 2012), we have questioned ourselves about the
implication of such an assumption to the results of our study. Consequently, we have chosen to explore the impact of food
preference on our result in the Appendix 2 (Appendix 1 in the revised version of the manuscript). The reviewer comment
underlines how important it is to correctly frame how we made such an assumption. Consequently, we have rephrased the
paragraph introducing this hypothesis to better introduce the main conclusion drawn from the work presented in
appendix 1. This work has shown that including new hypothesis about the food preference of the represented herbivores
community will lead to qualitatively similar results when embedded within explicitly spatial patterns of herbivory, as are
the ones presented in this manuscript. (Line 205 to 218)
This issue is confused further as all herbivores in the model are considered to 'scrape' the substratum. Very few herbivores scrape
the substratum, and of those that do none feed on fleshy macroalgae.
The reviewer is concerned that, since we only model herbivory by means of scraping, the model contains a flaw. In the
model, grazing activity is abstracted by the disappearance of 100 cm2 algal cells and a resulting transition toward a
crustose coralline algal/empty space state. We thus model herbivory by means of scraping (which graze primarily on turf
algae but often remove portions of the underlying carbonate substratum as they feed) and grazing (which intensely graze
turf algae but rarely alter the underlying substratum) as defined in Edwards et al. (2014) and references therein. Also,
please note that such types of grazing represent more than 50% of the herbivorous fish community (see Fig.4 in Edwards
et al. (2014)).
Also, we want to point out to the reviewer that, in the model, fleshy macroalgae belongs to the primary algal competitor
group, but not exclusively represent this group, since thick turf, which is often the dominant algal group on the benthos,
also belongs to that group. Thick turf, as said above, is often consumed by scrapers and grazers. (Line 206 to 209)
Similarly, no spatially-constrained herbivores (ie with small foraging range) that I am aware of consume fleshy macroalgae.
We agree with the reviewer, only a few small foraging range herbivores eat fleshy macroalgae. However, we again want to
point out to the reviewer that, in the model, fleshy macroalgae belongs to the primary algal competitor group, but does not
exclusively represent this group, since thick turf, which is often the dominant algal group on the benthos, also belongs to
that group. Thick turf, on the other hand, is more often consumed by spatially-constrained herbivores. Finally, we would
like to emphasize that our algal group naming convention explicitly refers to the relative capabilities of erect algae to
compete for space as our goal is to differentiate types of algae that can be grazed by herbivores and potentially outcompete
stony corals (i.e., primary competitors) from types that can be grazed by herbivores but are much less spatially competitive
(i.e., secondary competitors).
Again, many thanks to the reviewers for their time; we really appreciate their help in improving our work.

Dear Professor Kevin Padian, Andrew Dunn and editors of Journal of the Royal Society, Open Science:
We hope you will consider the revised manuscript of our article entitled “Herbivore space use influences coral reef recovery” for
publication as a research article in Journal of the Royal Society, Open Science.
Again, we want to thank the two anonymous reviewers for their very encouraging comments. In the first set of reviews, reviewer
#1 indicated having ‘thoroughly enjoyed the manuscript’ and provided us with writing advices and a few questions concerning the
simulations. Reviewer #2, while acknowledging its interest for the topic tackled by our study, asked several questions about the
assumptions made in the model as well as its structure. Hence, in our first revision, we thoroughly modified the manuscript
following the reviewers’ advices, notably by adding an appendix to better address reviewer #1’s concern (appendix 3). Also, we
provided each reviewer with documented answers to their questions.
After resubmission of the revised manuscript, we now appear to have comments from only one reviewer on this manuscript, and if
the numbers track between versions it was Reviewer #2 from the original submission. The review is brief and seemingly is focused
on a single point: macroalgae should not be grazed by our modeled herbivore community. We have tried to assuage the concerns
of this reviewer (and perhaps a broader readership) through a number of lines of reasoning, which are in the manuscript itself (in
the original submission and reinforced in this second revision in response to this reviewer's original and latter concerns) as well as
stated along with appropriate references in this response letter.
We provide specific responses to the reviewer below, with the review in italics and our responses in bold.
Response to Reviewer #2:
The authors have made few changes to address my previous concerns and their arguments for not addressing these comments are
generally weak.
We appreciate the thoughtful suggestions provided during the initial review. We made efforts to address these suggestions
by editing the manuscript (line 205-218). However, it appears that the changes made, both in the response letter and the
main body of the manuscript, were not accepted by the reviewer after resubmission. Additionally, the assertion that we
made “few efforts to address my previous concerns and their arguments for not addressing these comments are generally
weak” is a disappointment to us based on the work put in our extensive responses to the initial review, let alone the
preemptive efforts to assuage concerns (in challenging assumptions of the model, sensu Appendix 1). We hope that the
following answers will help clarify the model assumptions as well as the interpretation of its results.
While the same set of fishes may graze on long and short turfs, they will not feed on fleshy macroalgae. A case could also be made
that many grazing herbivores will not feed on long turfs but I will refrain from that here. the authors cannot simply ignore this
issue by stating that macroalgae does not exclusively represent their primary algal competitor group. If a cell (or area of reef) is
dominated by macroalgae then grazing fishes will not be able to convert it to a long-turf, short-turf or coralline algal state.
The grouping of long turfs and fleshy macroalgae as 'primary algal competitors' may be supported in terms of competitive
interactions with corals, however it is not supported in terms of interactions with herbivores.
We agree that the same set of fishes which would primarily graze on long and short turf will less likely graze on fleshy
macroalgae. However, the herbivore grazing represented in the model combines grazing behavior of a broad herbivore
community, whether the behavior be grazing of turf and macroalgae by browsing and grazing species, or the excavating
activities of some fish and urchins. Even if particular taxa avoid macroalgae (or long turfs), we are considering a diverse
assemblage of herbivory preferences in unique spatial distributions. This is stated in our manuscript as follows, "our
represented herbivore behavior should be seen as an abstracted version of detailed short-time-scale dynamics appropriate
to the coral-algal competition scale of interest (Allen and Hoekstra 1992), a so-called 'rain of bites' that lands on the
benthic community (Hamilton et al. 2014)”(line 199-203). As such, we are building on the capacity of reef herbivores to
consume diverse algal taxa in this representation.
Additionally, stating that macroalgae are not subject to herbivory would contradict a vast body of knowledge of herbivory
and reef ecology in general. The modeling of herbivores as macroalgae consumers has, as stated in the initial response to
reviewer #2, “ already been followed in some contributions of mathematical modeling to reef ecology (Mumby et al, 2007;
Blackwood et al., 2011, 2012)”. One of those contributions, Mumby et al., 2007, was published in Nature and to date has
been cited 407 times. Further, some groups of herbivorous fishes, notably the browsing herbivores, are virtually
universally accepted as macroalgae consumers and have been presented in numerous studies (e.g.: Steneck, 1988; Clements
et al., 1997; Choat et al., 1998; Fox et al., 2007; Mantyka et al., 2007; Green et al., 2009).
Finally, even though the qualification of some herbivores as macroalgae consumers has already been documented in many
contributions to reef ecology, we decided to further investigate implications of such an assumption by exploring the impact
of food preference on our result in Appendix 1. In this Appendix, we explore a wide range of foraging biases of the
herbivore assemblage, from strong preference for primary algal competitors to a strong preference for secondary algal
competitors. As the reviewer will note, the spatial patterns of herbivory lead to similar qualitative (and quantitative, for
that matter) patterns of reef recovery. In short, we have shown that the dynamical effects of spatial patterns of herbivory
are prominent in affecting patterns of reef recovery with only a weak effect of foraging bias between primary and
secondary algal competitors. (Line 218 to 223).
The reviewer’s initial comment underlined how important it was to correctly introduce the assumption that some members
of the herbivorous community would consume the primary algal competitor, and thus possibly macroalgae. Consequently,
the paragraph introducing this hypothesis was rephrased in the manuscript to better introduce the main conclusion drawn
from the work presented in appendix 1. Based on the reviewer’s remark, we fear that the reference to the results from the
Appendix 1 were not clear, thus we added another reference to the findings in the Methods section of the second revision of
the manuscript (line 214-221)
As the authors are reluctant to include this distinction in their model I suggest the easiest way to address is to remove fleshy
macroalgae from the definition of 'primary algal competitor' so that primary algal competitors be represented by long turfs.
We appreciate this suggestion and spent some time thinking about incorporating it into the analysis. However, after
consideration and given the specific comments on this issue above, we have chosen not to remove the possibility that the
primary algal competitor might also represent fleshy macroalgae. Indeed, such a change in the model assumption would
greatly weaken: (i) its conceptual structure, as it would no longer be a generalizable representation of the reef benthos; (ii)
its outputs interest, as it will not fully represent the post-recovery dynamic of a disturbed reef, but only the particular case
of a turf algal bloom. Hence, we believe that following the reviewer’s advice will decrease the scientific value of our work to
such a point that it would then outbalance the value of reaching a scientific consensus between our group and Reviewer #2.
Again, many thanks to the reviewers for their time; we really appreciate their help in improving our work.
