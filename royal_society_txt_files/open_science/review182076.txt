Reviewer Comments for Manuscript RSOS-182076, “INFLUENCES OF SODIUM AND
GLYCOSAMINOGLYCANS ON SKIN EDEMA AND THE POTENTIAL FOR ULCERATION: A
FINITE ELEMENT APPROACH.”
Overall:
1. The manuscript is poorly structured and reads like a BS or MS thesis, not a journal paper.
2. The manuscript is often in passive voice. Use active voice where possible.
Specifically (P = page, l = line):
P2-l41: Why is there a two-orders-of-magnitude range in the reported ultimate tensile stress of
skin?
P6-Fig1: Why does it say “More Swelling”? There is no swelling earlier in the flow chart.
P6-l27: “a computational model for the skin is required” This is not true. This is the approach that
3
the authors selected, but it’s not the only possibility.
P7-l18: Why use a three-layer model? There are 2-5 layer models available in the literature. How
does the choice of model affect the results and conclusions?
P7-l25: How is the geometry of the inclusion determined and justified? Could this be determined
by imaging approaches?
P7-l37-40: “Boundary conditions were applied to all surfaces except the top surface. Zero
displacement was used as the constraint for all surfaces (except the top).” Are these surfaces fixed
in all dofs? If so, this is likely far, far too stiff. These should only be fixed normal to the plane.
P8-Fig3: This is mislabeled as Figure 1. Was a mesh sensitivity analysis performed?
P12-l3-8: What is the justification for this approach? Why not use a design of experiments
approach based on the physiological ranges, or something similar?
P12-l16-21: How is this paper relevant to the current work?
P12-l32-39: Are these values reasonable?
P13-Eq6: This is a biphasic implementation in FEBio. What are the models and elements used?
P14-l6: Maximum tensile/compressive stress is usually referred to as the first/third principal
stress.
P14-l21: Why characterize the results using the Von Mises stress? What is the physiological
meaning of this stress measure when comparing the results to the ultimate tensile stress?
P15-l43: The results at the selected ROIs seems likely to derive from dependence of the mesh and
may not be real.
P17-Fig7: The selection of sigma_xx, sigma_yy, and sigma_zz is not meaningful, these measures
are arbitrary as the depend on the choice of coordinate system.
P23-l8: “which was at the lower end of the reported UTS range is likely to be more representative
of these patients in comparison to the higher values reported” What is the justification for this
statement?
P25-Fig12: Don’t repeat the original figure. Isn’t most of (b) inferable by intuition?

This manuscript addresses the role of GAGs and sodium content on skin edema and increased
tissue stresses as a potential mechanism for tissue damage and ulceration.
This is a well-designed basic science study and it is easy to read. The findings are interesting but
perhaps not unexpected, considering the observations from previous studies on other biological
tissues. I believe the paper still does add to the limited body of data regarding edema and
potential mechanisms of skin ulceration. Below are some specific comments.
Page 2, lines 41-46: This is not a full sentence.
Page 4, line 55: The cited papers are a review and another finite element study. Is there any
previous study with experimental evidence? A few suggestions are:
Nguyen et al. JOR 30(1):95-102, 2012
Bezci et al., J Biomech Eng 137(10):101007, 2015
Safa et al., Biomech 61(16):18-25
Page 5, line 18: Did these studies report how much sodium content increased in the inflamed
tissue? If so, please include the reported values in parentheses. For example, a previous study
reported a 3% increase in sodium content of the skin in women with lipedema (Crescenzi, 2018).
Page 5, line 30: “GAGS” should be “GAGs”.
Page 7: Please specify the width of the layers and report the number of elements in the models.
Did you use any constraints to connect the top layer to the underlying layer? Did you run a mesh
sensitivity analysis to ensure that the mesh density was adequate for the simulations?
Page 14, lines 40-43: Please include a quantitative comparison of the changes in the maximum
stress with an increase in FCD.
Pages 15-16: I suggest authors to move this paragraph to the methods section. This paragraph
does not present any results.
Page 17: Please comment on the trends in stresses (i.e., nonlinear or linear) with an increase in
GAGs FCD.
Page 21: Can you report the equation for the best-fit line to provide a functional relationship
between fluid pressure change and external bath osmolarity?
Page 25: The updated schematic for the physiological pathway for venous ulcer formation shows
an increase in permeability due to tissue swelling. Please elaborate on the schematic and support
the claims with some experimental evidence from your work and previous studies.
Page 26: The physiological osmolarity for normal skin was reported to be ~280 mOsm/L. Would
you expect to observe tissue shrinking or swelling if tissue sections were immersed in a
hypotonic solution (i.e., 50 and 100 mOsm/L solutions)? Please elaborate on the initial
configuration and its effect on the results presented in this study.

the (1) governing equations and (2) mathematical description of the boundary conditions. It’s very
cult to understand the foundation of the numerical simulation without it, particularly since some of
terminology is confusing (discussed below). All of the theory should be laid out before diving into
erial parameters and design of the parametric study. The discussion in section 2.4 provides a useful
rentiation between the physiological effects caused by Na and GAGs; however it would be better
ed within the theoretical formulation, either at the end of section 2.1 or as a stand-alone section
re the current section 2.2.
computational domain is well-described by Fig 3 (mistakenly labeled Fig 1 – also the color scheme in
(c) and (d) should match the other images of the domain (Fig 1(a) and (b) and Fig 4)). However,
ching them to the physiological analogs which are being modeled is not so obvious from Figs 3 and 4
the text. This is exacerbated by the fact that some of the terminology is confusing. The term “GAGs
usion” is not terribly helpful since GAGs are molecules and have a characteristic distribution
ughout the domain. Perhaps using “GAGs-induced inclusion” or simply “inclusion” would be an
on that better describes the spatial nature of what you are describing.
authors distinguish between the “external bath” and “interstitial fluid”, but it’s unclear where these
domains exist. Fig 4 attempts to define the external bath in relation to the computational domain,
at least for me, it muddies the waters further. The external bath looks like a 2-dimensional plane
ind the 3D skin block as though it exists at the back face of the block in contact with all 3 layers of
and extends beyond the domain of the epidermis. I don’t think that this is the intent. A better
al and written description that describes where these fluid domains reside in relation to the skin
k is needed, as well as how the fluid in the skin block, the external bath, and the interstitial space
interact. The text describes how water from the external bath can be drawn “across the membrane”
the interstitial space around p5, line 35, but it doesn’t describe what the membrane is. Also, the
ial link between the skin block and the veins is needed since the veins are the ultimate source of the
ss fluid in the skin block. A description of the theoretical formulation might have helped to infer the
tionships, but I think that you are going to lose your readers unless this is explicitly laid out.
g 5, do these images represent a steady-state solution or are they snapshots at a particular time?
discussion of results on p 23 is quite good and provides some quantitative estimates of threshold
es of their parameters that are associated with pathological changes.
scussion of grid resolution should be included to confirm that the numerical domain is sufficiently
lved and is essential for establishing credibility. This can be either a brief discussion in the
uscript or a more rigorous description in supplemental material. Grid resolution is particularly
ortant when a new model does not include any validation against experiment and/or other
erical simulations. This may be because there is currently nothing in the literature against which to
date. In the limitations section, the authors describe the need for experimental data to bound a
ple of their parameters. Are there other data that would help to validate your model?
authors chose to use a volume fraction within the range reported in the literature. Do the authors
k that the solution is sensitive to volume fraction?

ITE ELEMENT APPROACH.”
rall:
The manuscript is poorly structured and reads like a BS or MS thesis, not a journal paper.
The manuscript is often in passive voice. Use active voice where possible.
Thank you, we reviewed and edited the manuscript for structure and voice. Specifically, we
modified the abstract, introduction and discussion as well as implemented specific structural
revisions requested by the other reviewers. We recognize that the background section is not
typical for all types of publications, but because of the limited research conducted on venous
ulcers, we thought it was important for the readers to be familiar with the general physiology
associated with venous ulcer formation prior to discussing the model and simulation results.
cifically (P = page, l = line):
l41: Why is there a two-orders-of-magnitude range in the reported ultimate tensile stress of
?
The reviewer is correct. The literature of skin testing indicates a large range in UTS. The
authors did not conduct these studies that are referenced therefore we cannot comment on
their methods and accuracy. We can, however speak to skin as a biological tissue. It is a
well-documented fact that the elasticity of skin changes over time; thus aged skin will be
stiffer (lower strain with higher rupture stress) due to this reduction in elasticity than young
skin. Additionally, different body regions yield slightly different mechanical behavior (cheek
vs. heel) and the skin sample preparation methods also play a role in the outcomes of the
testing. Specifically, the 0.1-40 MPa value was reported from literature where it showed the
ultimate tensile stress of a sample from an 80 year old individual which was almost 100
times higher than that of a sample from 9 month old child. These ultimate tensile stress
values can be found in the references listed here:

Fig1: Why does it say “More Swelling”? There is no swelling earlier in the flow chart.
Thank you, we can see how this may be confusing. We have removed the word “more” and
just left swelling in the box. (Now Figure 2)
l27: “a computational model for the skin is required” This is not true. This is the approach
the authors selected, but it’s not the only possibility.
Thank you for this comment, this sentence has been rewritten and is also copied here:
“In order to validate this pathway and characterize the detailed mechanical changes in the
skin tissue, a computational model for the skin was developed.”
l18: Why use a three-layer model? There are 2-5 layer models available in the literature.
does the choice of model affect the results and conclusions?
The three layers in the model represent the three layers of the skin: epidermis, dermis, and
hypodermis. Models with other layers include more layers in the Epidermis (Stratum
Corneum) or referring the base layer beneath dermis as subcutaneous fat. The models that
use the stratum corneum as an individual layer usually combine the rest of the epidermis
with the dermis layer as the epidermis layer itself is extremely thin. The subcutaneous fat is
a synonym for hypodermis. Therefore, we believe the three-layer model best represents skin
anatomy and material properties. Additionally, all three layers of the skin were bonded
together without frictional force between the layers, thus the skin block behaved as a whole
and the differences between each layer consisted of the thickness and the material
properties (Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio).
l25: How is the geometry of the inclusion determined and justified? Could this be determined
maging approaches?
We do not have any experimental information that would lead us in one direction or another
for the geometry of the GAGs inclusion. However, we selected the sphere which would
generate the most conservative values in stress. A square would have corner stress
concentrations and an ellipse would have higher curvatures yielding higher stresses.
However, the volume of the inclusion was an estimation based on the reported GAGs
content in skin. GAGs consisted about 0.1%~0.3% of dry weight in skin and 0.37%~0.42%
wet weight in skin [1,2]. The skin model in the study had the volume of 125 mm3, and the
GAGs inclusion had a volume of 0.23mm3. This provided us a volume fraction of GAGs
inclusion at 0.18% at the baseline condition. Changes in geometry for the GAGs
concentration will be included in future work.

l37-40: “Boundary conditions were applied to all surfaces except the top surface. Zero
lacement was used as the constraint for all surfaces (except the top).” Are these surfaces
d in all dofs? If so, this is likely far, far too stiff. These should only be fixed normal to the
e.
We did not fix the surfaces in all dofs; we apologize for the confusion. All surfaces were
constrained somewhat, except for the top surface that represented the portion of the
epidermis in contact with air. We identified constraints that took into account the symmetry
of the model about the XZ plane, which was constrained only normally to the surface (see
Figure below). We also considered that we are analyzing a small portion of skin,
extrapolated from a large semi-infinite in vivo geometry (when compared to the dimensions
of our model). This led us to constrain the displacements in both the normal and shear
direction in the back, front, and right faces, which are ideally in contact with the rest of the
skin. Finally, since we were mostly concerned with investigating the effects of upward
swelling (namely toward the surface of the skin), as opposed to downward (which in this
case would mean internal swelling) we decided to constrain the bottom surface in every
direction.
We have clarified the manuscript as follows (page 9):
Boundary conditions were applied to represent the fact that the model is symmetric with
respect to the YZ-plane, see Figure 7, and is isolated from a larger skin plane. Namely, we
constrained the normal displacement on the plane of symmetry, and normal and shear
displacements on the planes in contact with surrounding skin. Because we are interested in
upward / outward swelling, the top surface, representing the side of the epidermis in contact
with air, was allowed free swelling, while the bottom surface, representing the side of the
hypodermis on contact with surrounding tissue, was constrained in every direction.

Fig3: This is mislabeled as Figure 1. Was a mesh sensitivity analysis performed?
We apologize for the mislabeling of Figure 3, that has been corrected. The authors did
perform a mesh sensitivity analysis. The element numbers was increased from 28896 to
37296 (a 29% increase) to generate a more refined mesh, and the results (displacement
and stress) did not show any difference within the 4 decimals output by FEBio. This
information has been added to the manuscript (page 9).
-l3-8: What is the justification for this approach? Why not use a design of experiments
roach based on the physiological ranges, or something similar?
Unfortunately, there are no reported lower or upper limit values for the FCD or osmolarity in
the inflamed skin for the patient population likely to develop venous ulcers (i.e., individuals
with vascular disease). This work is specifically focused on this population and was used to
obtain insights of what physiological events happen from the initial blood pooling to skin
edema and finally ulceration. This work was innovative in its aim to quantify how GAGs
increased presence and possible pooling could lead to skin tissue breakdown associated
with blood pooling and swelling as observed in the venous ulcer population.
-l16-21: How is this paper relevant to the current work?
Given that there is a lack of reported values on the range of osmolarity for skin inflammation
and skin ulceration, we broadened our literature review to consider all types of soft biological
tissues. Azeloglu et al., conducted the research with aorta ring (a soft biological tissue) and
the osmolarity value range from this paper provides a viable reference for understanding the
osmolarity limits associated with biological tissues. It would be ideal to have a reference
specific to skin and our patient population, but that does not yet exist.
-l32-39: Are these values reasonable?
The FCD values for normal skin are reported in the literature (Wiig et al., 2000; Wiig et al.,
2012 ) we used this as the starting point and then expanded the range. Additionally, one
author used an FCD of 150 in her previously published work (Roccabianca et al., 2014;
Roccabianca et al., 2014). This is the first work to study the relationship between the GAGs
inclusion and skin ulceration. Therefore, we used the normal range and expanded from
there since no information regarding the range of the FCD for inflamed skin is present in the
literature.

-Eq6: This is a biphasic implementation in FEBio. What are the models and elements used?
We developed the mesh using the Hypermesh software, and we used hexahedral elements
HEX8 (added to page 9). We employed the biphasic theory at equilibrium, which is already
implemented in FEBio, namely the Donna Equilibrium Swelling material. This material
represents a porous material, with a charged solid matrix, and an external solution
environment that contains monovalent ions. To describe the solid matrix, we used a neo-
Hookean material model for all layers of skin, but we specified different mechanical
parameters for each layer (as described on page 12 in section 2.3.1) This is a must for this
material description, since the Donnan equilibrium theory is based on the existence of a
solid matrix that “resists” the swelling. We are aware that an isotropic description of skin is
an approximation, however not having access to in house directional mechanical information
we felt that this approximation was reasonable for the time being. We will in the future
consider the possibility of using a more precise description for the solid matrix (for example
considering a fiber reinforced material description).
Finally, the material we consider is porous, however this does not represent a biphasic
analysis per se, these results are only valid once the fluid equilibrium is reached, namely we
are not analyzing what happens in the transient response. We believe this is a reasonable
approximation, since we are considering this to be a pathological condition that leads to PUs,
as opposed to a transient condition (for example as associated with inflammation due to
trauma).
-l6: Maximum tensile/compressive stress is usually referred to as the first/third principal
ss.
The authors agree with this statement. However, the authors chose the use of
tensile/compressive stress as they are more descriptive and these terms are used by
clinicians and surgeons while the first/third principal stress is not commonly used outside of
engineering. So, to support readability of researchers from an array of backgrounds, we
elected to use these terms.
We have added a clarification statement in the manuscript as follows (page 12):
Given that the shear stress component is zero in Eq. 11, the maximum tensile/compressive
stress could also be referred to as the 1st and 3rd principal stresses, respectively. The
authors chose to use the term tensile stress throughout the manuscript as it is a more
descriptive term.
-l21: Why characterize the results using the Von Mises stress? What is the physiological
aning of this stress measure when comparing the results to the ultimate tensile stress?
The Von Mises stress here was reported to visually understand the critical areas where high
stress localization was observed. To relate these data to the physiology, further detailed
stress analyses were conducted with the principal stresses in the regions that high Von
Mises was displayed. We later compared these principal stresses to the ultimate tensile
stress (Figures 8 and 11).
-l43: The results at the selected ROIs seems likely to derive from dependence of the mesh
may not be real.
The results at the selected ROIs were the averaged value of the elements in the selected
regions. The ROI represents the area where localized high stress occurred. As noted in an
earlier response, we did conduct a sensitivity analysis. The elements number was increased
from 28896 to 37296 (a 29% increase) to generate a more refined mesh, and the results
(displacement and stress) did not show any difference within the 4 decimals output by FEBio.
-Fig7: The selection of sigma_xx, sigma_yy, and sigma_zz is not meaningful, these
asures are arbitrary as the depend on the choice of coordinate system.
To keep the description of results consistent for all ROIs, we chose to use the global
reference system and refer to sigma_xx, sigma_yy, and sigma_zz during analysis. The
coordinate system was displayed in Figure 6. At different regions of interest, the stress
direction is different. Such as Sigma_yy is perpendicular at the right and left sides and
parallel to the top.
-l8: “which was at the lower end of the reported UTS range is likely to be more
esentative of these patients in comparison to the higher values reported” What is the
ification for this statement?
The lower UTS ranges were derived from samples that came from 5~9 month porcine skin
(Gallagher et al., 2012); porcine has been shown to be the closest to human skin material
properties and have long been used as an alternative for excised human skin tissue (Groves
at al., 2013; Ankersen et al., 1999). In consideration of the formation of venous ulcers,
patients who develop these ulcers have compromised vascular systems and are
experiencing inflammation and edema in their lower leg, causing decreased skin
extensibility (Pierard et al., 2014). With edema, the skin is weakened and unable to sustain
pressure and stress (Bansal et al., 2005)

is a well-designed basic science study and it is easy to read. The findings are interesting
perhaps not unexpected, considering the observations from previous studies on other
ogical tissues. I believe the paper still does add to the limited body of data regarding edema
potential mechanisms of skin ulceration. Below are some specific comments.
Thank you for the comment. Indeed, we agree and believe this work provides insights to the
physiological events that are not possible to observe.

The sentence has been rewritten and also copied here:
The results suggested that both the edema and increased fluid pressure could reach a point
of tissue damage and eventual ulcer formation.
e 4, line 55: The cited papers are a review and another finite element study. Is there any
vious study with experimental evidence? A few suggestions are:
yen et al. JOR 30(1):95-102, 2012
ci et al., J Biomech Eng 137(10):101007, 2015 Safa et al., Biomech 61(16):18-25
During our literature review, we were unable to locate studies specifically associated with
venous ulcers or skin tissue. Thank you for the suggested papers. We cited Bezci’s work in
the introduction (page 4 ref 31). We also reviewed all three manuscripts from Bezci et al.,
Nguyen et al., and Safa et al., and both papers provided a good justification for our model
results. We have included Bezci’s work together with the finite element study, and also
added the other two references in the discussion section as follows:
The results from the external bath osmolarity comparisons show that when the external bath
osmolarity was reduced from 100 to 50 mOsm/L, the change of interstitial fluid pressure in
the surrounding tissue during GAGs swelling also increased, in this case from 3.35 mmHg
(0.0004 MPa) to 33.94 mmHg (0.0045 MPa). This trend of increased stress and swelling
with decreased external bath osmolarity has also been observed in experimental studies
(Nguyen and Levenston 2012; Safa et al. 2017). Studies have reported that an increase of
10mmHg in the interstitial fluid pressure reduces capillary blood flow in half, causing tissue
ischemia, and potentially leading to tissue necrosis (Odland et al. 2004; Hargens et al. 1989;
Wiese 1993) and ulcer formation (Hargens et al. 1989; McGee et al. 2009).
e 5, line 18: Did these studies report how much sodium content increased in the inflamed
ue? If so, please include the reported values in parentheses. For example, a previous study
orted a 3% increase in sodium content of the skin in women with lipedema (Crescenzi, 2018).
The two reference cited here discussed the relationship between inflammation and
increased sodium, as well as the change in GAGs. Schwartz et al., reported increased
osmolarity values associated with inflammation and Titze et al., reported skin Na+ increased
from 140 mmol/L to 180~190 mmol/L with increased GAGs content. However, both of the
references were experimental studies with controlled laboratory settings, instead of in vivo
measurements.
We have added a sentence in the manuscript that specifically states the above (page 5)
In soft tissue inflammation, an increase in sodium, concurrent with GAG accumulation, has
been reported to occur (Schwartz et al. 2009; Titze et al. 2004; Crescenzi et al. 2018). Titze
et al., reported sodium increased from 140 mmol/L to 180~190 mmol/L with increased GAGs
content (Titze et al. 2004), and Cresscenzi et al., observed 3% increase in sodium content
associated with lipedema (Crescenzi et al. 2018).
Thank you for suggesting this new reference, we have also included in our manuscript.
e 5, line 30: “GAGS” should be “GAGs”.
Thank you, this has been corrected.
e 7: Please specify the width of the layers and report the number of elements in the models.
you use any constraints to connect the top layer to the underlying layer? Did you run a
h sensitivity analysis to ensure that the mesh density was adequate for the simulations?
Thank you for these questions. We have added this information to the manuscript (page 9).
The width and depth of each layer is 5mm x 5mm. The total number of the elements is
28896. In these simulations, the layers were considered to be perfectly bonded with one
another. We did perform a mesh sensitivity study where the elements number was
increased from 28896 to 37296 (a 29% increase) to generate a more refined mesh, and the
results (displacement and stress) did not show any difference within the 4 decimals output
by FEBio
e 14, lines 40-43: Please include a quantitative comparison of the changes in the maximum
ss with an increase in FCD.
A detailed stress analysis with quantitative comparisons between changes in FCD and
changes in maximum principal stress are available in Figure 8. The Von Mises stress was
used in Figure 6 to provide a visual perspective of where the localized high stresses
occurred, here we only showed the trend of increased stress with increased FCD.
The following was added to the text (page 19):
The highest stress was 400 times more when the FCD was 30 times higher than the normal
value. When the GAGs inclusion FCD was at 150 mEq/L, the same value reported being
used by Roccabianca et al., [37], the maximum elastic stress was 30 times higher than that
at normal FCD value.
es 15-16: I suggest authors to move this paragraph to the methods section. This paragraph
s not present any results.
Thank you for the suggestion. The reason why this paragraph was initially positioned here
was because without the preliminary observation of the high stress localization, it was not
possible to predetermine the Regions of Interest (ROIs). We have edited the manuscript and
these statements have been moved to the methods section.
e 17: Please comment on the trends in stresses (i.e., nonlinear or linear) with an increase in
Gs FCD.
We appreciate this question. Using the left ROI as an example, we plotted the stresses
against GAGs FCD, it can be seen that the stresses had a nonlinear increase with GAGs
FCD. We have included a statement of this trend in our discussion (page 26). This
statement is also below:
“The maximum stress exhibited a nonlinear increase with the increase of the GAGs inclusion
FCD.”
e 21: Can you report the equation for the best-fit line to provide a functional relationship
ween fluid pressure change and external bath osmolarity?
Thank you for the comment. In order to find the best-fit trend line, the logarithm transform
was performed and the fluid pressure change can be expressed with a polynomial fit of the
log osmolarity values. The equations and R2 values are reported in the figures below:
e 25: The updated schematic for the physiological pathway for venous ulcer formation
ws an increase in permeability due to tissue swelling. Please elaborate on the schematic
support the claims with some experimental evidence from your work and previous studies.
Thank you for this comment. Permeability by definition is the ability of the membrane wall to
allow fluids to pass. When tissue is swollen, the pressure difference between the two sides
of the membrane is increased, pushing the fluid transport through the membrane. Therefore,
we have indicated permeability occurs in association with increased edema. We have
included text in the manuscript noting this relationship (page 27). Additionally, several
researchers have also discussed the relationship between edema and increased
permeability [1-3]:

We have added the following to the manuscript (page 27):
We observed that when GAGs and sodium were increased, as reflected by the inflammatory
process within the tissue, they caused an increase in deformation and higher fluid pressure,
thus promoting more fluid transport across the membrane (i.e. increased permeability),
resulting in skin edema.
e 26: The physiological osmolarity for normal skin was reported to be ~280 mOsm/L. Would
expect to observe tissue shrinking or swelling if tissue sections were immersed in a
otonic solution (i.e., 50 and 100 mOsm/L solutions)? Please elaborate on the initial
figuration and its effect on the results presented in this study.
When the tissue is immersed in a hypotonic solution, which means the external bath has a
lower sodium (Na+) concentration compared to inside the tissue, more water will be drawn
from the external bath into the tissue due to the pressure/concentration difference.
Therefore, when the tissue is in the hypotonic solution, it will swell. Here is a schematic
presentation of this swelling process. Since two reviewers asked questions about this point,
we have added this figure to the manuscript (Figure 1).

e hypothesis and associated physiological mechanisms are well-described. Separating out
physiological impact of GAGs and osmolarity is interesting.
wever, the problem statement is unclear and requires clarification and reorganization in
ction 2.The major flaw is that the theoretical formulation is not included. The
nuscript should explicitly lay out the (1) governing equations and (2) mathematical
scription of the boundary conditions. It’s very difficult to understand the foundation of
numerical simulation without it, particularly since some of the terminology is confusing
scussed below). All of the theory should be laid out before diving into material parameters
d design of the parametric study.
e discussion in section 2.4 provides a useful differentiation between the physiological
ects caused by Na and GAGs; however it would be better placed within the theoretical
mulation, either at the end of section 2.1 or as a stand-alone section before the
rrent section 2.2.
Thank you for the suggestions. Based on Reviewer 4’s comments, we have reorganized
Section 2 significantly. As requested, the theoretical formulation has been moved
earlier in the manuscript.
The material model used here was a mixture of Donnan swelling and Neo-Hookean solids.
Therefore, the governing equations for such biphasic material based on conservation of
momentum and conservation of mass are
Where is the porous solid matrix displacement and Q is the fluid flux relative to the solid
matrix.
The boundary conditions are:
;
for quarter symmetric boundaries
;
The fluid flux at the final stage of the equilibrium will be zero as the fluid transfer reach
the balance. The symmetric boundaries have the displacement constraints as follows:
Front: X=0; Y=0
Back: X=0; Y=0
Left: X=0
Right: X=0; Z=0
Bottom: X=Y=Z=0
e computational domain is well-described by Fig 3 (mistakenly labeled Fig 1 – also the
lor scheme in Fig 1(c) and (d) should match the other images of the domain (Fig 1(a)
d (b) and Fig 4)). However, matching them to the physiological analogs which are being
deled is not so obvious from Figs 3 and 4 and the text.
Thank you, this has been corrected. Figure 3 (a)~(d) and Figure 4 (now Figures 4 & 5) were
obtained from the same model. Figure 4 (a) was displayed as a transparent image for the left
half and the wireframe image displayed for the right half. We presented in this format
because we thought it was easier to see the symmetry and the three layers could be easily
seen and identified.
We see how the blue colors can be confusing, so we have modified the color scheme to be
gray (epidermis), teal (dermis), and blue (hypodermis) so that this confusion is avoided.
The physiological analog can be seen in Figure 1, and we have labeled Figures 3, 4 and 5
with matching labels identifying the three layers of the skin, and the GAGs inclusion.
is is exacerbated by the fact that some of the terminology is confusing. The term “GAGs
lusion” is not terribly helpful since GAGs are molecules and have a characteristic
tribution throughout the domain. Perhaps using “GAGs-induced inclusion” or simply
clusion” would be an option that better describes the spatial nature of what you are
scribing.
The GAGs inclusion represents the volume of the tissue cells with accumulated GAG
molecules. Although the GAGs were distributed throughout the entire skin tissue blocks,
the tissue that contains the GAGs inclusion had a much higher GAGs concentration. This is
the rationale as to why the specific region was called a “GAGs inclusion”. Such terminology
was used in Roccabianca et al., (2014) and continued here. We have added a line in the
text that clarifies and defines what is meant by the GAGs inclusion. We believe this will
reduce the potential confusion; thank you for pointing this out (page 8).
e authors distinguish between the “external bath” and “interstitial fluid”, but it’s unclear
ere these fluid domains exist. Fig 4 attempts to define the external bath in relation to the
mputational domain, but, at least for me, it muddies the waters further. The external bath
ks like a 2-dimensional plane behind the 3D skin block as though it exists at the back face
the block in contact with all 3 layers of skin and extends beyond the domain of the
idermis. I don’t think that this is the intent. A better visual and written description that
scribes where these fluid domains reside in relation to the skin block is needed, as
ll as how the fluid in the skin block, the external bath, and the interstitial space can
eract. The text describes how water from the external bath can be drawn “across the
mbrane” into the interstitial space around p5, line 35, but it doesn’t describe what
e membrane is.
Thank you for these comments. We have added a figure and modified a figure to address
these concerns. We acknowledge that representing the 3D situation in 2D is not ideal and
have modified the image so that the bath is clearly identified as being along all sides of the
block. This figure was also modified to match the new color scheme of Figure 4.
A modified visual presentation of the external bath is:
In addition, another reviewer asked for the analog presentation of the water and GAGs
movement during inflammation and swelling, so we have added the figure below as well.
o, the spatial link between the skin block and the veins is needed since the veins are
ultimate source of the excess fluid in the skin block. A description of the theoretical
mulation might have helped to infer the relationships, but I think that you are going to lose
ur readers unless this is explicitly laid out.
e have updated the Figure 3 and added the location of the vein. We also included a
tement in the manuscript. (Page 7)
chematic of the broader perspective of modeling blood pooling and skin edema through
anges in GAGs and sodium content is located in Figure 2. As veins are located in the
podermis layer of the skin, we expected the GAGs and sodium accumulation would first
cur in this region.
Fig 5, do these images represent a steady-state solution or are they snapshots at a
rticular time?
These images represent a steady state solution as provided in the boundary conditions
of this model. The model reached an equilibrium at the end of each simulation. This is
also explained in the “pressure drop” at the end of the simulation as the model is at a
steady state, the pressure gradient required across the membrane is lowered.
e discussion of results on p 23 is quite good and provides some quantitative estimates of
eshold values of their parameters that are associated with pathological changes.
discussion of grid resolution should be included to confirm that the numerical
main is sufficiently resolved and is essential for establishing credibility. This
n be either a brief discussion in the manuscript or a more rigorous description in
pplemental material. Grid resolution is particularly important when a new model does
t include any validation against experiment and/or other numerical simulations. This
y be because there is currently nothing in the literature against which to
lidate. In the limitations section, the authors describe the need for experimental data
bound a couple of their parameters. Are there other data that would help to validate
ur model?
We have performed a mesh sensitivity study where the element numbers was increased
from 28896 to 37296 (a 29% increase) to generate a more refined mesh, and the results
(displacement and stress) did not show any difference within the 4 decimals output by FEBio.
This proved the sufficiency of grid resolution in this study. This information has been added
to the manuscript (page 9).
The study presented here was one of the first to apply the Donnan swelling model to
the study of venous ulcers. The adopted methodology and model set up is comparable
to previous studies reported in the literature for other soft tissue studies (Roccabianca,
Bellini, and Humphrey 2014; Ateshian et al. 2011; Yu, Malakpoor, and Huyghe 2018).
Although these studies were on other tissues, the swelling observed in our work
followed similar trends as those reported in these publications.
e authors chose to use a volume fraction within the range reported in the literature. Do
authors think that the solution is sensitive to volume fraction?
The volume fraction we used was for the model fluid volume fraction. This was a
physiological value that has been reported between 0.70-0.85 for a hydrated tissue. The
fluid volume fraction, together with the solid volume fraction describes the porosity of the
skin. For this parameter we do have physiological values included within a small range.
Based on the equations:
difference between Max. and Min. volume fraction is only 0.15, where R*T=2.577E-03,
ch is a very small scale. Therefore, the values selected in our volume fraction range will not
ificantly impact the calculated pressure change.
