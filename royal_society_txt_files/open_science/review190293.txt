Comments to the Author
This paper describes that the optical force driven movement of vesicles was accelerated in the
presence of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The author concluded that the acceleration was caused
by AuNPs adsorbed on the vesicles. However, I do not wholly agree with the authors' model. I
recommended that the paper should not be published until all questions listed below are
answered satisfactorily.
1) The size of the vesicles used in this experiment should be described.
2) To demonstrate the acceleration of the movement of vesicles by light pressure, I strongly
encourage the author to show the photographs or video that is the basis for calculating the
velocity of vesicles.
3) The velocity (v) of an individual vesicle might be expected to be proportional to the number (n)
of AuNPs adsorbed on its surface. However, the authors assumed that the velocity of the vesicle
was proportional to n[Ve(NP)<sub>n</sub>]. The physical meaning of equation (5) is
incomprehensible for me.
4) On page 10, line 45; The meaning of “a is a constant to relate W with v.” is unclear, because
“W” is not defined.
5) The n values listed in Table 1 are less than 2. Therefore, the authors predicted that one or two
AuNPs were bound to one vesicle. If the movement of vesicles by light pressure is governed by
the AuNPs, the velocity of the vesicles is expected to be a maximum when two AuNPs adhere to
the surface. However, in Fig. 2, the velocity of vesicles increases exponentially with the increase
of the concentration of AuNPs. Therefore, the value of n obtained by curve fitting using eq. 7
seems to be physically meaningless. It is necessary to explain why the velocity of vesicles does
not have the maximum value.
6) The n values indicated that one or two AuNPs were bound to one vesicle. Under the such
conditions, the velocity of vesicles should show discrete values. Consequently, even at the same
concentration of AuNPs, the velocity of individual vesicles is expected to be categorized into
three different types (i.e., without AuNPs, one AuNP, two AuNPs). Since only four vesicle speeds
were measured in this experiment, it is doubtful that statistically significant velocities have been
estimated.
7) The data of Fig.3(a) should also be curve fitted by eq. 7, and the fitting parameters should be
discussed in comparison with the values in Table 1.
8) Figure 3(b) represents a linear relationship between the extinction and the velocity. The authors
claim that the velocity of the vesicle is directly proportional to the light intensity scattered by the
adsorbed AuNPs. However, if an excess amount of free AuNPs exists in the solution, the
extinction of the solution would be mainly ascribed to the free AuNPs. The explanation for Figure
3(b) seems to be inconsistent with the conclusions.

This manuscript is reporting the enhancement of optical force acting on vesicles via the binding
of AuNPs. The authors discussed in detail by controlling the surface charges in the vesicles and
the AuNPs, and by changing the sizes of the AuNPs. Also, the authors proposed a model that
could be used to estimate the binding constant and the apparent number of AuNPs adsorbed on a
vesicle. The study is systematic and interesting. In my opinion, this manuscript is acceptable for

Appendix A
To the Reviewer: 1
Thank you very much for your helpful comments and suggestions. We carefully
considered the comments raised by the reviewer. Our replies to the comments are as
follows.
This paper describes that the optical force driven movement of vesicles was
accelerated in the presence of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The author concluded that the
acceleration was caused by AuNPs adsorbed on the vesicles. However, I do not wholly
agree with the authors' model. I recommended that the paper should not be published
until all questions listed below are answered satisfactorily.
1) The size of the vesicles used in this experiment should be described.
We also added a description in the text according to the suggestion by the reviewer.
(P.6, L.7-8)
2) To demonstrate the acceleration of the movement of vesicles by light pressure, I
strongly encourage the author to show the photographs or video that is the basis for
calculating the velocity of vesicles.
We added a movie in the Supporting information as suggested by the reviewer. (P.7,
L.18-19, at the Dryad Digital Repository, Movie S1)
3) The velocity (<i>v</i>) of an individual vesicle might be expected to be proportional
to the number (n) of AuNPs adsorbed on its surface. However, the authors assumed that
the velocity of the vesicle was proportional to n[Ve(NP)<sub>n</sub>]. The physical
meaning of equation (5) is incomprehensible for me.
According to the mass balance of AuNPs as shown in equation (3), n[Ve(NP)n]
represents the concentration of AuNPs adsorbed on the vesicles. The number of
AuNPs adsorbed on the vesicles also depends on the concentration of vesicles when
considering binding equilibrium employed in our model. So, we assumed that the
velocity of the vesicle is proportional to n[Ve(NP)n] = CNP-[NP], which is the
concentration of AuNPs bound to the vesicles. However, the expression made
understanding difficult as found in the reviewer's comment, so we decided to delete
the part of n[Ve(NP)n] from the equation (5). (P.10, L.21-P.11, L.2)
4) On page 10, line 45; The meaning of “<i>a</i> is a constant to relate <i>W</i> with
<i>v</i>.” is unclear, because “<i>W</i>” is not defined.
We apologize for our mistake. The “W” must be replaced by CNP-[NP]. We
corrected the mistake in the text. (P.11, L.3)
5) The n values listed in Table 1 are less than 2. Therefore, the authors predicted that one
or two AuNPs were bound to one vesicle. If the movement of vesicles by light pressure is
governed by the AuNPs, the velocity of the vesicles is expected to be a maximum when
two AuNPs adhere to the surface. However, in Fig. 2, the velocity of vesicles increases
exponentially with the increase of the concentration of AuNPs. Therefore, the value of n
obtained by curve fitting using eq. 7 seems to be physically meaningless. It is necessary
to explain why the velocity of vesicles does not have the maximum value.
We apologize for the insufficient explanation of our model. It should be noted that
the n values shown in Table 1 are the “apparent” number of AuNPs bound to the
vesicles. In the model, we do not assume that the velocity of an individual vesicle is
proportional to the number (n) of AuNPs adsorbed on its surface because the light
scattering induced by AuNPs depends on the adsorbing site of the AuNPs on the
vesicle. Namely, the degree of the increase in the velocity of the vesicle depends on
both the number and the adsorbing site of the AuNPs on the vesicle. We added a
schematic illustration of our model in figure 3 along with a discussion to help
readers understand the model. (P.9, L.21- P.10, L.6)
Conversely, the reason the velocity of vesicles does not have the maximum value is
attributed to a low concentration of AuNPs that is insufficient to reach the
maximum velocity. We added this explanation to the text. (P.11, L.6)
6) The n values indicated that one or two AuNPs were bound to one vesicle. Under the
such conditions, the velocity of vesicles should show discrete values. Consequently, even
at the same concentration of AuNPs, the velocity of individual vesicles is expected to be
categorized into three different types (i.e., without AuNPs, one AuNP, two AuNPs).
Since only four vesicle speeds were measured in this experiment, it is doubtful that
statistically significant velocities have been estimated.
We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion in part. As suggested by the reviewer, it is
incorrect that the maximum number of the AuNPs bound to the vesicle is 2. So, we
deleted the description of “one or two AuNPs were bound to one vesicle.” to avoid
misunderstanding by the readers. (P.2, L.18-20 and P.12, L.16-17)
Conversely, according to our model based on the binding equilibrium, the
number of AuNPs bound to the vesicles depends on the concentration of the AuNPs
added to the solution. As the reviewer pointed out, a few different vesicles with
different numbers of AuNPs may exist in a solution. However, a major species
would be stochastically observed at a certain concentration of the AuNPs.
Also, the reviewer was worried about whether the statistically significant
velocities were estimated or not. We presented the standard deviations that suggest
the errors of the data, so the experimental errors were considered in the results.
7) The data of Fig.3(a) should also be curve fitted by eq. 7, and the fitting parameters
should be discussed in comparison with the values in Table 1.
We fitted the results in Fig.3 (a) to eq. 7 and discussed the values as suggested by the
reviewer. (P.14, L.19-P.15, L.5)
8) Figure 3(b) represents a linear relationship between the extinction and the velocity.
The authors claim that the velocity of the vesicle is directly proportional to the light
intensity scattered by the adsorbed AuNPs. However, if an excess amount of free AuNPs
exists in the solution, the extinction of the solution would be mainly ascribed to the free
AuNPs. The explanation for Figure 3(b) seems to be inconsistent with the conclusions.
We apologize that our insufficient explanation causesd a misunderstanding by the
reviewer. Against the results in figure 3, free AuNPs existing in the solution should
reduce the velocity of the vesicle because they will decrease the laser intensity that
hits the vesicle. So, we cannot explain the acceleration of the vesicle if free AuNPs
are not present in the laser light. The increased velocity of the vesicle is related to
the enhanced light scattering, that is, the extinction, by the AuNPs that bind with
the vesicle. To avoid the misunderstanding, we added a further explanation in the
text. (P.15, L8-12)
