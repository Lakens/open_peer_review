Review ms Mollica & Piantadosi
Marc Brysbaert
This is an interesting ms estimating how much information is needed to acquire a language. It
follows similar attempts to estimate the size of human memory.
To some extent, reviewing this ms could require weeks of work, properly checking each and
every assumption / choice the authors make, to make sure no errors are present in the
calculations. Unfortunately, I do not have the time (nor the motivation) to do so.
Instead, I've read the ms as an informed reader, judging whether the authors' assumptions /
calculations agreed with mine for the areas I know best. I am happy to say that I am satisfied in
this respect. This does not preclude that other researchers may take up the challenge and come up
with different numbers based on different arguments. However, the beauty of the present
submission is that the choices are made explicit and are open to challenge. As such, it presents a
sound basis for scientific discussion.
The ms is exceptionally wel written. As it happens, I have only one issue. It is the estimate of
word frequency at the bottom of p. 7. Using a factor of two to get the upper limit would give a
limit of 4 bits rather than 3, no? Wouldn't change much in terms of conclusions, but in my
understanding would be more correct.
I also like the estimate of information required for syntax relative to lexial information. Indeed
shines new light on the nativist/empirist discussion. Arguably will also be like by researchers of
embodied cognition, as it shows the challenge of learning new words and word meanings.

Comments to the Author(s)

I congratulate the authors on this provocative and bold study. Researchers have adduced large
amounts of knowledge about language acquisition and representation, and the authors do an
admirable job of synthesizing existing facts and estimates and show impressive creativity in
generating further plausible-sounding estimates from existing sources when required. The result
is a range of estimates of the amount of information that must be acquired to become a competent
adult speaker of a language. I do not expect this to be anywhere near a definitive statement on
this issue, but it is certain to spark interest and discussion, as well as alternative attempts to
quantify the information encoded in the linguistic representations of a competent adult language
user.
The claim of 1.5 MB is built on a fairly large pile of assumptions and back-of-the-envelope
calculations, and so it is anyone's guess how close the authors are to the real target number. But
at least the assumptions have been very transparently laid out in detail, and the authors are
honest about the limitations of the study. Some of the math was beyond my expertise, but those
equations that I could grasp seemed sound. The manuscript is also clearly written and practially
flawless. I much appreciated the vividly written discussion section ("our knowledge of language
fits compactly on a floppy disk"), which ends a provocative note ("any innate capacity for human
language learning is most likely to be for lexical semantics"; probably too provocative, since
learners probably spend most of the assumed 18 years learning about lexical semantics anyway).
Others will be better placed than I to evaluate the linguistic assumptions made at each of the
representational levels. I have no doubt that linguistic experts will find much to debate regarding
many assumptions behind these calculations, but you have to start somewhere. I would also
guess that there would be some controversy about what types of representations should be
considered part and parcel of Language. For instance, conventions of language use such as
described by conversation analysts or Herbert Clark are not included, while word frequency is,
and some might see word frequency as a "performance" aspect of language and not part of
language knowledge proper. But I don't think these possible points of disagreement are really
that important---what I think is important is the existence proof that the field has matured
enough that such theoretical calculations are within our grasp, and that the authors have worked
transparently so that others can evaluate and build on their work. Anyone who disagreed on the
details could follow the authors' logic and generate their own estimates.
In sum, I think this paper makes a valuable contribution to the literature. I hope that publication
is not held up by disagreements about the authors' assumptions (which are necessarily arbitrary
in some cases, but I do think they more or less represent reasonable, best guess attempts for each
of the relevant levels of representation). In my view, the main contribution here is the novel
theoretical approach taken by the authors.

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi

can be accessed;
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.

s is exceptionally well written. As it happens, I have only one issue. It is the estimate of
requency at the bottom of p. 7. Using a factor of two to get the upper limit would give a
f 4 bits rather than 3, no? Wouldn't change much in terms of conclusions, but in my
tanding would be more correct.
oduce the factor of error on the estimate of the mental representations of the bins not the bit
es themselves. So our best guess 4 bins = log2(4) = 2 bits per word. Lower bounded as 2 bins =
= 1 bit per word. Upper bounded as 8 bins = log2(8) = 3 bits per word.
