In this manuscript, the author developed a colorimetric assay for human serum insulin detection
using a nanoarray from G-rich aptamers carried by MNPs-coupled DNA nanotubes. Some minor
revisions would add to the value of this manuscript for supporting its acceptance in the Royal
Society Open Science.
1) G-quadruplex structures are usually stabilized in the presence of stabilizing ions. As stated in
the experimental procedure, no stabilizing ion e.g. potassium ion was used. Please explain.
Meanwhile, a binding buffer is usually necessary for efficient binding between the aptamer and
the target. Please state the binding buffer and the detailed conditions for the colorimetric sensing
experiment.
2) The authors are advised to conduct a selectivity experiment for their platform. For example,
the selectivity of the assay for insulin could be tested by studying the response of the system to
other interfering substances including metal ions, amino acids, and proteins. This additional
experiment could provide strong evidence on the promising selectivity of this sensing system.
The authors are also suggested to provide evidence on the formation of G-quadruplex structure
e.g. by employing circular dichroism (CD).
3) To make the manuscript more informative for the readership of the Royal Society Open
Science, some references for the application of G-quadruplex-based platform may also be
included in the introduction. For example,
(a) Analyst 136, 2692.
(b) Anal Chem 81, 2144.
(c) Chem Sci 7, 2516.
(d) Chem Comm 47, 5461.

Overall, I recommend the publication of this manuscript after minor revision.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The manuscript by Rafati et al., describes a colorimetric assay for human serum insulin that is
comparable to ELISA or better. This assay has future potential. However, the manuscript as
written needs significant rework prior to publication.
Major and minor issues:
1) Several errors and omissions within the manuscript suggesting that not all authors have read
the manuscript carefully.
2) Words like “more sensitivity” are used in the abstract and conclusion. The authors do not
describe what they mean by “sensitivity”.
3) Statistical tests are performed and data are shown in tabulated format. It is unclear why a
particulate statistical test was used? What was being compared or what hypothesis was being
tested. They are randomly thrown and left up to the reader to figure it out.
4) Page 2 line 13, MNP is abbreviated. Don’t abbreviate since it is the first time being used in the
introduction.
5) Page 2 line 26 G-quadroplex should be G-quadruplex.

12) Page 4 line 17 and 18: The AFM figure is confusing. The authors should show at least an
image of 5 um x 5 um, and 1 um x 1 um as supporting images in a supporting section. If not,
Figure 2 is not a representative image obtained from AFM. Moreover, it is unclear as to what is
being looked at in the image. For example, how does the array conform to what was
immobilized on the surface?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_6
The authors have provided satisfactory responses to this reviewer’s questions. However, the
manuscript still has some minor issues that needs to be fixed prior to publication.
On Page 10, under insulin measurement of nanoarrays, the authors state the relationship found in
8
Figure 4 is “nearly linear”. However, only the (0,0) data point is on the line. The authors should
show the linear regression line equation on the plot, as well as the R2 value. The authors should
also show a residual plot based on Figure 4 in the supporting information section. Clearly an
increasing trend is shown in this plot, but unclear if it is linear. A residual plot or a statistical test
for linearity should clear this up. However, the authors must convince the readers why this trend
should be acceptable analytically. Many analytical calibrations required a better than 0.99 R2
value, but the authors can justify why a less than 0.99 on their R2 value is still valid.
On Page 11, under limit of detection, Figure 5 provides the data for the limit of detection. It
seems the method used by the authors is not a standard method for determining limit of
detection for an analytical technique. The authors should at least state why the method they
chose is a valid methodology for limit of detection.
Figure legend and tic legend font sizes are inconsistent across figures. The authors should show
some consistency across figure presentations.
Minor issues:
SI section, under Results and Discussion, change G-quadroplex structure to G-quadruplex
structure.
Figure 2, legend font sizes are too small and blurry to the eye. Difficult to read.
Figure 3, tic label font sizes are too small, these figures when shrunk would make it difficult to
read the labels. The axes legends are a good font size, but need to be consistent in figure
presentations (see Figure 2 axes legend font sizes, which are much smaller).
Figure 4, Hard to read the legends and numbers listed under each data point. Consistency is
required for all figure presentations. On the figure, list the linear equation for the calibration and
the correlation coefficient (R2).

The authors have provided satisfactory responses to this reviewer’s questions. However, the
manuscript still has some minor issues that needs to be fixed prior to publication.
On Page 10, under insulin measurement of nanoarrays, the authors state the relationship found in
Figure 4 is “nearly linear”. However, only the (0,0) data point is on the line. The authors should
show the linear regression line equation on the plot, as well as the R2 value. The authors should
also show a residual plot based on Figure 4 in the supporting information section. Clearly an
increasing trend is shown in this plot, but unclear if it is linear. A residual plot or a statistical test

should be acceptable analytically. Many analytical calibrations required a better than 0.99 R2
value, but the authors can justify why a less than 0.99 on their R2 value is still valid.
On Page 11, under limit of detection, Figure 5 provides the data for the limit of detection. It
seems the method used by the authors is not a standard method for determining limit of
detection for an analytical technique. The authors should at least state why the method they
chose is a valid methodology for limit of detection.
Figure legend and tic legend font sizes are inconsistent across figures. The authors should show
some consistency across figure presentations.
Minor issues:
SI section, under Results and Discussion, change G-quadroplex structure to G-quadruplex
structure.
Figure 2, legend font sizes are too small and blurry to the eye. Difficult to read.
Figure 3, tic label font sizes are too small, these figures when shrunk would make it difficult to
read the labels. The axes legends are a good font size, but need to be consistent in figure
presentations (see Figure 2 axes legend font sizes, which are much smaller).
Figure 4, Hard to read the legends and numbers listed under each data point. Consistency is
required for all figure presentations. On the figure, list the linear equation for the calibration and
the correlation coefficient (R2).

40mM KCl, 200 mM NaCl, 0.06 % (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.4). In addition, desired concentration of insulin was
olved in binding buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, and 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4).
refore, potassium was provided from the above formulations at the experiments.
he authors are advised to conduct a selectivity experiment for their platform. For example, the
ctivity of the assay for insulin could be tested by studying the response of the system to other
rfering substances including metal ions, amino acids, and proteins. This additional experiment could
vide strong evidence on the promising selectivity of this sensing system. The authors are also
gested to provide evidence on the formation of G-quadruplex structure e.g. by employing circular
roism (CD).
he reviewer suggested, the selectivity of the developed assay should be tested by studying the
ponse of the system to the other interfering substances. For this purpose, it was tested with a
dom sequence to confirm the selectivity and specificity of the assay related to the specificity of the
amer selected for targeting insulin. In addition, the reviewer recommended providing a strong
ence for formation of G-quadruplex structure in G-rich insulin aptamer after insulin binding;
ever, the aptamer was selected from Verdian-doghaei et al study (Ref# 22) and the evidence of CD
ctroscopy on the formation of G-quadruplex structure was provided by them. For more evidence, CD
ctra of the aptamer used in this study was added as a supporting image in a supporting section of the
nuscript.
o make the manuscript more informative for the readership of the Royal Society Open Science, some
rences for the application of G-quadruplex-based platform may also be included in the introduction.

r Professor,
se find the revised version of our manuscript (Manuscript ID RSOS-171835) that is herewith
losed. We are pleased with the positive comments from you and the referees, and have addressed
heir requests in the revised manuscript. Considering the reviewers comments, all corrections have
n incorporated in the text in red fonts. In addition, the answer to the list of responses to the
ments is as follow:

On Page 10, under insulin measurement of nanoarrays, the authors state the relationship found in
re 4 is “nearly linear”. However, only the (0,0) data point is on the line. The authors should show
linear regression line equation on the plot, as well as the R2 value. The authors should also show a
dual plot based on Figure 4 in the supporting information section. Clearly an increasing trend is
wn in this plot, but unclear if it is linear. A residual plot or a statistical test for linearity should clear
up. However, the authors must convince the readers why this trend should be acceptable
lytically. Many analytical calibrations required a better than 0.99 R2 value, but the authors can
ify why a less than 0.99 on their R2 value is still valid.
As the reviewer recommended on page 10, the linear regression line equation of the plot, as well as
R2 value were showed. Also, a residual plot based on Figure 4 were showed in the supporting
rmation section as "Supplementary Figure 3".
n Page 11, under limit of detection, Figure 5 provides the data for the limit of detection. It seems
method used by the authors is not a standard method for determining limit of detection for an
lytical technique. The authors should at least state why the method they chose is a valid
hodology for limit of detection.
As the reviewer recommended, a method for determining limit of detection (LoD) were referred to
standard method described by Ref. No# 29.
igure legend and tic legend font sizes are inconsistent across figures. The authors should show some
sistency across figure presentations.
As the reviewer recommended, figure presentations were checked and corrected according to the
ructions for the authors.
or issues:
SI section, under Results and Discussion, change G-quadroplex structure to G-quadruplex structure.

As the reviewer recommended, "G-quadroplex" was changed to "G-quadruplex".
Figure 2, legend font sizes are too small and blurry to the eye. Difficult to read.
As the reviewer recommended, legend font sizes of Figure 2 were checked and corrected.
Figure 3, tic label font sizes are too small, these figures when shrunk would make it difficult to read
labels. The axes legends are a good font size, but need to be consistent in figure presentations (see
re 2 axes legend font sizes, which are much smaller).
As the reviewer recommended, tic label font sizes of Figure 3 were checked and corrected.
Figure 4, Hard to read the legends and numbers listed under each data point. Consistency is
uired for all figure presentations. On the figure, list the linear equation for the calibration and the
elation coefficient (R2).
As the reviewer recommended, the legends and numbers listed under each data point were checked
corrected. Also, the linear equation for the calibration and the correlation coefficient (R2) were
ed.
feel that these revisions improve our paper and we hope that you find our manuscript suitable for
lication in Royal Society Open Science.
