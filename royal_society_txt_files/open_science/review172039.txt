In the manuscript titled “Elucidation of Immunological response and its Regulatory Network by
P-TUFT-ALT-2: A Promising Fusion Protein Vaccine for Human Lymphatic Filariasis” authors
have checked the immunological characteristics of the possible filarial vaccine candidate. Overall,
this manuscript is appropriately written, and authors have discussed most of their results. I have
following comments on this manuscript.
Major comments:
1. Given to the fact that ALT-2 is a potentially good filarial vaccine candidate, how the addition of
P-TUFT to ALT-2 enhance its immunogenic response need to be included. I understand that the
authors have mentioned this in the introduction of the manuscript and that those are
unpublished observations. Including the protection data into this manuscript will improve the
overall quality of this manuscript and will strengthen the scientific reporting, with no protection
data currently available for P-TUFT-ALT-2, it is inappropriate to conclude it as a potentially
better vaccine candidate in comparison to ALT-2 alone.
2. In the result section “Indirect ELISA for total IgG” it looks like P-TUFT-ALT-2 showed more
reactivity to EN sera samples compared to E-ALT-2 or P-ALT-2 (Figure 4). As these individuals
were not at all exposed to TUFT, its difficult to understand that how P-TUFT-ALT-2 can show
higher reactivity to EN sera samples. Authors should provide an appropriate explanation for
these results and discuss the same in the manuscript.
Minor comments:
1. Include in brief the details about the expression of all the recombinant proteins (E-ALT-2, P-
ALT-2, P-TUFT-ALT-2) in the Material and methods of the manuscript.
2. What were the endotoxin levels in the recombinant proteins and soluble crude extract of L3
larvae? Include this details in the Material and methods of the manuscript.
3. Page # 4, Line # 94 “Transforming growth factor……………lymphocyte”. Provide appropriate
reference to this sentence.
4. Include which statistical test was applied in the Legend to Figure 1.

In the manuscript titled “Elucidation of Immunological response and its Regulatory Network
by P-TUFT-ALT-2: A Promising Fusion Protein Vaccine for Human Lymphatic Filariasis”
authors have checked the immunological characteristics of the possible filarial vaccine
candidate. Overall, this manuscript is appropriately written, and authors have discussed most
of their results. I have following comments on this manuscript.
Major comments:
1. Given to the fact that ALT-2 is a potentially good filarial vaccine candidate, how the
addition of P-TUFT to ALT-2 enhance its immunogenic response need to be included. I
understand that the authors have mentioned this in the introduction of the manuscript and that
those are unpublished observations. Including the protection data into this manuscript will
improve the overall quality of this manuscript and will strengthen the scientific reporting,
with no protection data currently available for P-TUFT-ALT-2, it is inappropriate to conclude
it as a potentially better vaccine candidate in comparison to ALT-2 alone.
Ans. The possible immunomodulatory function of TUFT (Tuftsin) on ALT-2 has been
discussed in introduction (page no. 3 line 77) and discussion section (page no. 9, line
253). The protection study was not performed due to non-availability animal facility at
our university. Of course, we performed In vitro ADCC assay of anti- P-TUFT-ALT-2
and anti- P-ALT-2 antibody produced in Balb/c mice with L3 larvae of filarial parasite.
All data on immunological study in mice along with splenocyte culture and ADCC assay
have been included in another article which is communicated to another journal for
publication. The study in Balb/c mice indicated enhanced immunological response along
with better cytotoxicity on L3 larvae by P-TUFT-ALT-2 over P-ALT-2. Even, P-TUFT-
ALT-2 stimulated PBMCs expressed higher amount cytokines than P-ALT-2 stimulated
PBMCs. Therefore, we used the term ‘potentially better vaccine candidate’ for P-
TUFT-ALT-2.
2. In the result section “Indirect ELISA for total IgG” it looks like P-TUFT-ALT-2 showed
more reactivity to EN sera samples compared to E-ALT-2 or P-ALT-2 (Figure 4). As these
individuals were not at all exposed to TUFT, its difficult to understand that how P-TUFT-
ALT-2 can show higher reactivity to EN sera samples. Authors should provide an appropriate
explanation for these results and discuss the same in the manuscript.
Ans. P-TUFT-ALT-2 showed more reactivity to EN sera samples compared to E-ALT-2
or P-ALT-2 (Figure 4). This might be due to native folding configuration of eukaryotic
ALT-2 protein in eukaryotic expression system i.e. Pichia pastoris. There is no
significant difference in reactivity between P-TUFT-ALT-2 and P-ALT-2. The reactivity
of E-ALT-2 was slightly lower might be due to the folding configuration change in
eukaryotic ALT-2 expression in prokaryotic expression system i.e. E. coli. We have
included this explanation in the discussion section (page no. 12, line 335).
Minor comments:
1. Include in brief the details about the expression of all the recombinant proteins (E-ALT-
2, P-ALT-2, P-TUFT-ALT-2) in the Material and methods of the manuscript.
Ans. We have included the brief information on the expression of all the recombinant
proteins (E-ALT-2, P-ALT-2, P-TUFT-ALT-2) in the material and methods section
(page no. 4 ).
2. What were the endotoxin levels in the recombinant proteins and soluble crude extract of
L3 larvae? Include this details in the Material and methods of the manuscript.
Ans. We didn’t perform the endotoxin levels in the recombinant proteins and soluble
crude extract of L3 larvae as we didn’t have plan in our main project proposal, and
instrumental facility for LAL assay in our institution. So, we couldn’t include the
endotoxin level.
3. Page # 4, Line # 94 “Transforming growth factor……………lymphocyte”. Provide
appropriate reference to this sentence.
Ans. We have included reference [24] now.
4. Include which statistical test was applied in the Legend to Figure 1.
Ans. Unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction was performed.

Ans. We also indicated the methods of diagnosis of Lymphatic filariasis in the material

Ans. We have included Th2 cytokines IL-9 and IL-13 in introduction (page no. ), but
we cannot include any research data on these cytokines as I am retired now and we
don’t have laboratory access now.
