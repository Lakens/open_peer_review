Overall, I think this is a very interesting paper. This paper makes a unique contribution in
offering a new method in measuring temporal accessibility and its relevance with social equity.
The platform created provides excellent examples of visualizations of temporal accessibility in
several world cities and has potential implications for transport policies, particularly in transport
equity. Other cities may easily create similar accessibility maps using the codes provided by the
authors.

One of the interesting things about the “open review” process at the Royal Society Open Science
journal is the idea of an ‘unmasked’ peer review: where I can explicate my own academic
personality as a background to my reviewer judgment. So to start with that, I am Dr. Michiel van
Meeteren, lecturer in human geography at Loughborough University. The reason why I believe I
was chosen as a reviewer to this paper is because I was a co-author on the following paper:
“Boussauw, K., Van Meeteren, M., Sansen, J., Meijers, E., Storme, T., Louw, E., Derudder, B. &
Witlox, F. (2018). Planning for agglomeration economies in a polycentric region: Envisioning an
efficient metropolitan core area in Flanders, European Journal of Spatial Development,

In this paper we combine accessibility analysis with isochrone maps for a practical application in
public transport planning. In doing so we explicitly draw on the long established history of using
these techniques in transport geography and related disciplines. I have to admit up front that the
method proposed in this paper is more sophisticated as what we used, and I am actually quite
enthusiastic about the indicators that this paper proposes. However, my disciplinary background
is also a source of criticism in this review, in the sense that “the claims to newness” in this paper
does disenfranchise the contributions from geography and geographers to the study of
accessibility somewhat. Claims that this paper is “a first contribution in this direction” (abstract),
that “studying cities in terms of travel time is a minoritan view” (page 2, for geographers it is the
default view). “very few people have studied the temporal features of these systems” (page 2). tie
into this feeling. It might be new to complexity science, computer science or physics, but it is not
new to geographers at all. This is something the authors acknowledge when they cite some of
geography’s foundational works, references 21-29 contain some of the classic papers I would
normally recommend. This resonates with a broader annoyance as data science, physics and
complexity theorists have been ‘discovering the city’ as a topic of research. We as geographers
welcome new perspectives and input to some of our established research topics, but we do like to
have some acknowledgement of our historical contribution to a topic, a recurring complaint
nicely elaborated in O’ Sullivan and Manson (2015).
The authors mention that “that the science of cities is a relatively new research area (P.2)”. I
would make the case that it needs qualification. I’d say that the author of that claim, Michael
Batty has been doing the science of cities for the whole of his long and distinguished career and
that he himself was able to establish that career on a network of scholars in the 1960s (Barnes and
Wilson 2014 provide historical perspective; and I did my little bit in Van Meeteren and Poorthuis
2018). In fact, accessibility analysis goes back to the collaboration of a geographer and a physicist
on population potential in the 1950s (Stewart and Warntz, 1958). In other words, this reviewer
would be very happy to see this contribution not as the “invention” of a debate/concept but as a
“contribution/refinement” to a longstanding, but perhaps at certain times in history dormant
research agenda. Most of this revision is just a question of language and due citation. Even
nowadays there is quite a bustling community of geographers working on these topics, for
instance just look at journals such as “Environment and planning B: urban analytics and city
science” (edited by Mike Batty), The Journal of Transport Geography or Transportation Research.
So although I agree with the authors that big data and massive computation offers great potential
to revisit these topics (page 4), it is not that there is not a large community of scholars doing
exactly that.
Which brings me to another comment: I don’t think this community of geographers has no
standard measures of accessibility: we have (see Boussauw et al 2018 for references) and they are
quite similar in type to what this paper proposes.
That said, I am very enthusiastic about the new measures “velocity score”, :Sociality score” and
“city sociality” and I like the crisp and unambiguous way in which the authors define it. Those
measures will be a very welcome and useful tool for comparative research across cities both for
academic and for practical applications. Geographers do not like describing indicators with
adjectives like “universal” or “law” for all sorts of epistemological and historical reasons (Barnes
2013). Nevertheless I understand there is a problem of translation between disciplinary languages
here.
To conclude there is one final weaker point in the paper I would like to point out. The section
Space-time distribution of inequality in accessibility patterns” (page 9-10) assumes a monocentric
model of a city. This monocentric model has been increasingly found to be unrealistic of city
structures regardless of where you are(Van Meeteren et al. 2016 is a good introduction to these
4
debates see also Clark and Kuijpers-Line 1994, Clark 2000). Of course there are car based and
public transport based cities and North American cities tend to be the former for historical
reasons. So the rankings provided do not surprise a geographer at all. They are exactly what one
would expect based on geographical knowledge. However, if the paper is serious in its ambition
to provide a cartographic tool that helps policy makers, it should take into account that cities
have several employment centres and that the traditional ‘urban core’ has long since lost its
meaning as the principal centre of employment public transport is directed toward. Most new
jobs come in the city’s edge (Phelps, 2017; Keil, 2017), therefore championing cities that have the
best accessibility to the city center is not always the best policy advice, although advocating for
higher densities that allow for public transportation surely is. On that note, there is a literature on
‘threshold values’ when public transport becomes viable. This is not so much a “general
mechanism” (page 10) as the simple result of transport economics that require a minimal number
of customers for an investment to be politically and economically sustainable. Again here we
encounter some disciplinary lost in translation. For social scientists these “general mechanism”
are the product of social and political decisions which makes us cautious in using terms like
“general” and “universal” as society could easily change that reality if enough people want to.
Lastly, the ‘most of the world now lives in cities’ argument is now so much of a cliché (that hides
a lot, see Brenner and Schmid 2014) that I would avoid using it.
I hope these points allow the author to improve on what is already a really interesting paper. I
look forward to see it develop further.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
If my assumptions are correct, then the methodology is sound. However, the use of imprecise
scientific terminology and the lack or rigour when explaining the mathematical equations often
forces the reader to guess what the authors meant instead of what they wrote. This becomes
particularly problematic when it results in masking some important limitations of the
methodology. Although I believe that the following points should prove relatively easy to fix, I
would strongly advise against publishing the manuscript until these are addressed, hence the
major revision recommendation.
(1) L. 206: The speed of expansion of the isochrone is dr/dt, not r/t. Please indicate the correct
interpretation (l. 208-209) directly. In addition, the term “velocity” is generally used instead of
“speed” when the direction is considered, while it has precisely been removed here.
(2) L. 209-210: v is certainly not proportional to the explorable area from the hexagon <U+03BB>. If an
isochrone moves at a constant speed of 1 m.s-1 and is a perfect circle, then v(1)=1 and A(1)=pi,
while v(2)=1 and A(2)=4.pi, and more generally, v(n)=1 and A(n)=n^2.pi for any n. The authors
probably meant that for different <U+03BB>s in one or more cities and for a common t, then v is
proportional to the explorable area. The text needs to be changed accordingly.
(3) L. 235-236: A(t) for a typical daily t is already a better measure than v from eq. 3 of “the
6
extension of the area that it is possible to explore in a typical working day”. Meanwhile, v is the
average speed at which an individual should expect to travel on their typical daily trips. Why is
the first interpretation chosen rather than the second?
(4) Eq. 3: I am guessing from the supplementary information and from the legend of fig. 2 that “N
is a normalisation constant” means that its role is to ensure that \int f(t) dt = 1 and this would
explain why the division by \int f(t) dt has been omitted in eq. 3. This omission should be
properly indicated, otherwise the dimension of v is not [m].[s]^-1, but only [m] and the integral
becomes a sum rather than an average. More details about f(t) and at the very least a reference to
the supplementary material should appear in the main text. Also, presenting f(t) as the direct
result of a survey is misleading, since it is instead the result of some modelling work using an
external methodology (which comes with its limits, see (6)).
(5) The description of f(t) in the supplementary material is still hard to understand. What is the
value and role of N? What is the quality of the fitting (e.g. R^2)? Why does T_bus mention only a
bus when the survey is now about “transport habits” compared to “Oyster card journeys on bus,
Tube, DLR and London Overground”?
(6) The study on which the f(t) distribution is based only uses (significantly outdated) data from
the UK. As a matter of fact, the authors of the original study lengthily discuss the limitations of
their data. The only improvement made is a comparison to some more recent data that already
shows discrepancies despite being from the same geographical region (which is not even featured
in the case studies). This is an important flaw that should be mentioned in the discussion in the
main text of the manuscript.
(7) L. 236-237: It would be useful to indicate that people are counted multiple times. For example,
a typical trip from inside inner Paris is likely to stay inside inner Paris which only has a
population of 2M, while fig. 2 suggests a typical traveller would reach up to 3M people in a day.
On a side note, I would replace “meet” by “reach” on l. 237.
(8) L. 300: “without lack of generality” is a strong claim considering that this subset of cities
contains only two clusters of very similar cities.
(9) L. 315-320: Please discuss the varying cultural expectations regarding car usage. Inequality in
accessibility through public transport does not necessarily mean inequality in practical
accessibility if the use of cars has been assumed a priori by urban planners.
(10) L. 341-354: This result is an artefact due to the combination of some hexagons being directly
on the fastest lines together with a daily trip distribution that only represents the “average habit”
over the entire city. People who are more “travel averse” will tend to pay a higher rent to be
closer to the fastest lines, specifically to limit their “travel energy budget”, without necessarily
belonging to the 1% richest. An interesting analysis could have consisted in linking the hexagons
with the social characteristics of their inhabitants and checking if the most socially privileged are
also the most privileged in accessibility. Failing to do that, at least discuss the limits of this “1% of
the hexagons” approach.
(11) L. 78-81 & l. 404-406: These statements are very subjective. It is a normal part of science to
study a notion in all its aspects. As a matter of fact, a broader perspective on the subject would
have been beneficial to the quality of the “Inequalities in urban accessibility patterns” section of
the manuscript, as illustrated in the two previous points. Please rephrase (l. 78-81 in particular) in
a more neutral and more moderate way.

Comments to the Author(s)
If my assumptions are correct, then the methodology is sound. However, the use of imprecise
scientific terminology and the lack or rigour when explaining the mathematical equations often
forces the reader to guess what the authors meant instead of what they wrote. This becomes
particularly problematic when it results in masking some important limitations of the
methodology. Although I believe that the following points should prove relatively easy to fix, I
would strongly advise against publishing the manuscript until these are addressed, hence the
major revision recommendation.
(1) L. 206: The speed of expansion of the isochrone is dr/dt, not r/t. Please indicate the correct
interpretation (l. 208-209) directly. In addition, the term “velocity” is generally used instead of
“speed” when the direction is considered, while it has precisely been removed here.
(2) L. 209-210: v is certainly not proportional to the explorable area from the hexagon <U+03BB>. If an
isochrone moves at a constant speed of 1 m.s-1 and is a perfect circle, then v(1)=1 and A(1)=pi,
while v(2)=1 and A(2)=4.pi, and more generally, v(n)=1 and A(n)=n^2.pi for any n. The authors
probably meant that for different <U+03BB>s in one or more cities and for a common t, then v is
proportional to the explorable area. The text needs to be changed accordingly.
12
(3) L. 235-236: A(t) for a typical daily t is already a better measure than v from eq. 3 of “the
extension of the area that it is possible to explore in a typical working day”. Meanwhile, v is the
average speed at which an individual should expect to travel on their typical daily trips. Why is
the first interpretation chosen rather than the second?
(4) Eq. 3: I am guessing from the supplementary information and from the legend of fig. 2 that “N
is a normalisation constant” means that its role is to ensure that \int f(t) dt = 1 and this would
explain why the division by \int f(t) dt has been omitted in eq. 3. This omission should be
properly indicated, otherwise the dimension of v is not [m].[s]^-1, but only [m] and the integral
becomes a sum rather than an average. More details about f(t) and at the very least a reference to
the supplementary material should appear in the main text. Also, presenting f(t) as the direct
result of a survey is misleading, since it is instead the result of some modelling work using an
external methodology (which comes with its limits, see (6)).
(5) The description of f(t) in the supplementary material is still hard to understand. What is the
value and role of N? What is the quality of the fitting (e.g. R^2)? Why does T_bus mention only a
bus when the survey is now about “transport habits” compared to “Oyster card journeys on bus,
Tube, DLR and London Overground”?
(6) The study on which the f(t) distribution is based only uses (significantly outdated) data from
the UK. As a matter of fact, the authors of the original study lengthily discuss the limitations of
their data. The only improvement made is a comparison to some more recent data that already
shows discrepancies despite being from the same geographical region (which is not even featured
in the case studies). This is an important flaw that should be mentioned in the discussion in the
main text of the manuscript.
(7) L. 236-237: It would be useful to indicate that people are counted multiple times. For example,
a typical trip from inside inner Paris is likely to stay inside inner Paris which only has a
population of 2M, while fig. 2 suggests a typical traveller would reach up to 3M people in a day.
On a side note, I would replace “meet” by “reach” on l. 237.
(8) L. 300: “without lack of generality” is a strong claim considering that this subset of cities
contains only two clusters of very similar cities.
(9) L. 315-320: Please discuss the varying cultural expectations regarding car usage. Inequality in
accessibility through public transport does not necessarily mean inequality in practical
accessibility if the use of cars has been assumed a priori by urban planners.
(10) L. 341-354: This result is an artefact due to the combination of some hexagons being directly
on the fastest lines together with a daily trip distribution that only represents the “average habit”
over the entire city. People who are more “travel averse” will tend to pay a higher rent to be
closer to the fastest lines, specifically to limit their “travel energy budget”, without necessarily
belonging to the 1% richest. An interesting analysis could have consisted in linking the hexagons
with the social characteristics of their inhabitants and checking if the most socially privileged are
also the most privileged in accessibility. Failing to do that, at least discuss the limits of this “1% of
the hexagons” approach.
(11) L. 78-81 & l. 404-406: These statements are very subjective. It is a normal part of science to
study a notion in all its aspects. As a matter of fact, a broader perspective on the subject would
have been beneficial to the quality of the “Inequalities in urban accessibility patterns” section of
the manuscript, as illustrated in the two previous points. Please rephrase (l. 78-81 in particular) in
a more neutral and more moderate way.

I now had the chance to review the revision of Universal scores for accessibility in urban areas.
The major concerns I had with the previous version have sufficiently been resolved. What
remains are some minor issues, mostly of a semantic nature, that can be easily resolved.
1: One overarching comment is that the paper would benefit from a thorough language edit.
Although everything is understandable, there are repeated minor grammatical and spelling
errors and many dangling modifiers (where the reference object in the previous sentence is
unclear), and repeated language that could be avoided by use of synonyms. A language specialist
might choose different adjectives / phrases in order to get a more nuanced perspective across,
and sentences could be split to improve readability. For instance the first sentence of the
introduction is more than four lines, which is not very common in the English language (contrary
to many Latin languages). "Lost in translation" issues could also be in play in some of the other
minor things I raise below.
2: What do you mean with "the fruition" of metrics? (page 12, line 32). I agree that your metrics
are intuitive, but do you mean "making their practical application easier" or something like that?
14
3: Both in the abstract and on pages 18-19 there is the claim that there is a "general mechanism" or
"common mechanism" at work that can possibly explain the regular patterns of inequality found.
I would advise some caution here. The notion of "mechanism" suggests ideas about causation of
spatial inequality which is somewhat outside the scope of the current paper. I wholeheartedly
agree that there is a recurring pattern across cities, and that this seemingly "universal pattern"
merits further investigation. However, what causes these patterns is a question that is yet to be
answered. Even if one was able to describe the mechanism in a morphological sense (for instance
through a process of preferential attachment) it still could have different causes. Some may be
described in the realm of transport economics (minimum densities to profitably exploit public
transport or alternatively through network externalities), labour market geographies (places of
work and places of living), theories of rent and so on. I would suggest being slightly more modest
and claim that there is a recurring morphological pattern of inequality in accessibility across cities
that is very interesting to disentangle in future urban-scientific research. But like my similar
remark in the previous review round: I am aware that this is viewed differently across
disciplines, and that where I come from we tend to be very cautious when it concerns causality.
4: Related, I have still some issue with the generous use of the term "universal" (with all its "law-
like" connotations in epistemology). Although the term is qualified as meaning "in the sense that
they can be applied in every city and in different context allowing comparison between different
areas and means of transportation." (page 12, line 67), in my world we would not use the term
universal for that condition. Perhaps "universally applicable", "Generic indicators" or "context-
independent measures/indicators" would be my preferred terms. I have a similar feeling with the
paper's title "universal scores for accessibility and inequalities in urban areas". "Universally
applicable accessibility indicators and inequalities in urban areas" would be closer to my
preferred title for what the paper is about. A "universal score" seems too timeless, too much cast
in stone for a social object such as the city. But again, these things are the "lost in translations"
common to interdisciplinary dialogue.
With all those semantic remarks I might almost overlook to remark how much I consider the
proposed indicators a valuable addition to the toolbox of researchers working in this field, and
that I enjoyed getting acquainted with them and would surely consider applying them in future
research. Thus I still warmly recommend this paper for eventual publication, perhaps after giving
some thoughts to my final semantic concerns.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_5
I am only partly satisfied with the corrections made by the authors. Point (2) below, for example,
remains a major issue for me. I do understand that the authors made the most of what was
available to them, however I fail to understand why it is not possible for them to acknowledge
properly in the manuscript serious limitations to the validity of their results. Claiming that the
Supplementary Material ascertains the robustness of the methodology is misleading, if not
dishonest.
In addition, the authors make bold claims of providing “operational” information that policy
makers were in dire need of, but seem opposed to including in the discussion any argument that
would explain why their results are so disconnected from the reality of the field (points (3)-(5)).
(1) We have the feeling that, when speaking about transportations, is easier for all to quantify
and imagine a speed rather than an area as a function of time, so it is easier to make a comparison
with our everyday life and communicate the scientific results to a large audience with very
different backgrounds.
I agree. Hence, I don’t understand why the first clear and neatly written interpretation of v(<U+03BB>)
(given l. 238), the one people are likely to remember, is “the Velocity Score provides with a
measure of the extension of the area” rather than the speed interpretation.
(2) We used empirical travel-time distributions that we were able to find in literature. We could
find only two analytic forms derived from empirical data in the literature. Then we add a third
one, the “flat” distribution, just to check if our results are sensitive to the choice of the travel time
distributions. What the Fig.1 of the Supporting Material file S1 shows is indeed that our results
are robust against a different choice of travel-time distributions.
Comparing two travel time distributions obtained for one city, then applying these distributions
to completely different cities is the exact opposite of a “robust” approach. Where is it justified in
the manuscript that the empirical daily budget for London residents is relevant to Boston or
Sydney? Why should we expect people living in Florence or Toulouse to devote as much time to
transport as people living in a city 15 times bigger? In addition, what is the quality of these
fittings compared to real data, not compared to other modelled data?
(3) In our approach, people are not counted multiple times. We use the definition of an urban
area as economic functional units given by OECD/EU, as written in the main text, in the Methods
section. In the case of Paris, the urban area contains more than 12 millions of people. Due to the
high level of development of the public transports, from the center of Paris, one can reach more
than 3 millions of people, some of them, of course, living outside the municipality of Paris,
though still within its urban area.
The methodology assumes that the daily budget is entirely spent in one round trip. If, for
example, an individual undertakes a first trip from inside Paris to their workplace 4 km away and
a second trip to a shop 2 km away, their movements remain in fact bounded within a disk of
radius 4 km, representing 64% of Paris, or roughly 1.3M inhabitants. However, the method would
count them as traveling up to 6km away, reaching roughly a total of 3M inhabitants. In this case,
16
the 320k inhabitants of the area of the second trip, already counted once in the first trip, add an
extra 1.7M to the total count of people reachable. This needs to be properly indicated.
There are already one unrealistic isotropy assumption (contradicted, for example, by the lack of
willingness to cross the “périphérique” - or purpose to do so - for inhabitants of the municipality)
and one incorrect assumption that the daily budget is uniformly distributed inside the city
(people living inside the “périphérique” do so at a very high cost to avoid spending time in
transports). As a result, the sociality score obtained for inner Paris residents is completely
unrealistic. In fact, the maps in panel B of figure 2 appear to be a less precise and less accurate
version of this map, which provides simple objective information without making any claim of
representing anything “typical”:
http://www.urbanmorphologyinstitute.org/france/
(4) In the section “Inequalities in urban accessibility patterns” we study the inequalities in the
access to the public transports among populations, not the absolute values. The point is that we
observe common patterns among cities regardless if the urban planners design the city to be more
cars or public transports oriented.
The purpose of the manuscript is to propose a “unifying definition of accessibility” that would be
directly useful to policy makers. Ignoring how urban planners design their cities does not sound
like a good starting point to achieve that. I fail to see why it is not possible to add one or two lines
pointing out the role of cars as an explanation to the difference in the observed results between
cities.
(5) Our analysis is trying to measure the performance of public transports to cover the space and
connect people regardless of the “habit” of the people. As previously explained, our results are
quite stable against a reasonable choice of the “average habit” choose. We do not consider the 1%
richest and the rest 99%. We only consider people or area with accessibility 1% higher in
comparison to the rest 99%. The analysis of the connections with the economic, cultural or habits
diversity will be the subject of future studies.
The “1% highest accessibility hexagons” is not necessarily meaningful. An individual living in the
south of Horley (42 km from London) will fare very well since they will be in the same hexagon
as the Gatwick express (only £18/trip) and the fast suburban Southern and Thameslink trains.
Meanwhile an individual living on Westbourne Grove in zone 1 may (depending on the hexagon
placement) have to rely on buses or walk to another hexagon to take the tube.
By construction, building a transport network requires to fill a 2-dimensional space with 1-
dimensional lines. As cities become larger, this is less and less possible, so planners only try to
connect people to places that matter to them. They try to cater to people’s habits, no matter the
number of random strangers they can wave hello to from the window of their trains as they pass
by towards their intended destination. This is similar to the difference between degree centrality
and Katz centrality in network theory. What matters most: the number of nodes one is connected
to or the importance of the nodes one is connected to?
Some may think that taking these considerations into account participates in the “proliferation of
definitions that disperse the scientific effort”. However, the “top 1%” analysis presented in the
manuscript is misleading and does not add any valuable “operational” information. It does not
reveal anything about inequality in “access to opportunities”, only that central inhabitants could
easily go check if the birds are different in the suburban residential areas if they wanted to and
that airports and amusement parks are the best spots for high accessibility unauthorized
camping.

I believe the paper does make a contribution to urban accessibility studies by proposing indices
that can be used to compare pedestrian and public transit accessibility levels from city to city. I
The three indices proposed in the paper – velocity, sociality, cohesion – are complementary. I
think the paper deserves publication, but there are still a few issues the paper should address
before publication, however.
First, as has already been indicated in previews reviews, a thorough language edit is still needed
by a native English speaker.
Second, the most important issue I find with the paper is the assumption that trips are modeled
from all hexagons to all hexagons. I understand the simple appeal of this assumption – which is
also common in computer science and graph theory algorithms, where indices are computed
form all nodes to all nodes. It offers a simple way to make cities comparable to each other, but it
doesn’t really describe real commuting flows nor aims of transit systems.
Urban populations do not commute with equal likelihood to all parts of the city. Trips are much
more common from homes to jobs, homes to commercial destinations as well as homes to
recreational destinations and vica versa These destinations types are never uniformly distributed
in space – they tend to concentrate in the CBD and other subcenters. Accordingly, public
transportation systems and street networks evolve over time to prioritize access to such
destinations instead of maximizing uniform access to all parts of the city. If we measured how
easily people from all parts of the city can gain access to jobs as well as commercial destinations,
we would likely find different results. The 1% VS 99% access differences highlighted in the paper
would likely change. And the meaning of velocity, sociality and cohesion would likely change.
People meet others not at their homes, but in public or commercial and recreational spaces of the
city. We should thus not judge the quality of public transit systems based on how well they allow
residents to get to all other residents’ homes.
To address this issue, I suggest that:
a) the discussion section should either eliminate or substantially change the discussion about the
inequality of access in cities.
b) Some material should be added towards the beginning of the paper about the all hexagons to
all hexagons O-D choice.
c) The discussion section should also mention the need in future work to test a similar approach
with different assumptions about origins and destinations.
22
d) The paper should reduce its claims that an end-all approach is delivered to compare cities on
accessibility levels. Rather, the paper makes an interesting step towards comparable urban
accessibility indices but there is a quite a bit more to do before a universal or standardized
approach can be agreed upon.

Comments to the Author(s)
I believe the paper does make a contribution to urban accessibility studies by proposing indices
that can be used to compare pedestrian and public transit accessibility levels from city to city. I
The three indices proposed in the paper – velocity, sociality, cohesion – are complementary. I
think the paper deserves publication, but there are still a few issues the paper should address
before publication, however.
25
First, as has already been indicated in previews reviews, a thorough language edit is still needed
by a native English speaker.
Second, the most important issue I find with the paper is the assumption that trips are modeled
from all hexagons to all hexagons. I understand the simple appeal of this assumption – which is
also common in computer science and graph theory algorithms, where indices are computed
form all nodes to all nodes. It offers a simple way to make cities comparable to each other, but it
doesn’t really describe real commuting flows nor aims of transit systems.
Urban populations do not commute with equal likelihood to all parts of the city. Trips are much
more common from homes to jobs, homes to commercial destinations as well as homes to
recreational destinations and vica versa These destinations types are never uniformly distributed
in space – they tend to concentrate in the CBD and other subcenters. Accordingly, public
transportation systems and street networks evolve over time to prioritize access to such
destinations instead of maximizing uniform access to all parts of the city. If we measured how
easily people from all parts of the city can gain access to jobs as well as commercial destinations,
we would likely find different results. The 1% VS 99% access differences highlighted in the paper
would likely change. And the meaning of velocity, sociality and cohesion would likely change.
People meet others not at their homes, but in public or commercial and recreational spaces of the
city. We should thus not judge the quality of public transit systems based on how well they allow
residents to get to all other residents’ homes.
To address this issue, I suggest that:
a) the discussion section should either eliminate or substantially change the discussion about the
inequality of access in cities.
b) Some material should be added towards the beginning of the paper about the all hexagons to
all hexagons O-D choice.
c) The discussion section should also mention the need in future work to test a similar approach
with different assumptions about origins and destinations.
d) The paper should reduce its claims that an end-all approach is delivered to compare cities on
accessibility levels. Rather, the paper makes an interesting step towards comparable urban
accessibility indices but there is a quite a bit more to do before a universal or standardized
approach can be agreed upon.

ll, I think this is a very interesting paper. This paper makes a unique contribution in offering a new
d in measuring temporal accessibility and its relevance with social equity. The platform created
es excellent examples of visualizations of temporal accessibility in several world cities and has
ial implications for transport policies, particularly in transport equity. Other cities may easily create
accessibility maps using the codes provided by the authors.

f the interesting things about the “open review” process at the Royal Society Open Science journal
dea of an ‘unmasked’ peer review: where I can explicate my own academic personality as a
round to my reviewer judgment. So to start with that, I am Dr. Michiel van Meeteren, lecturer in
n geography at Loughborough University. The reason why I believe I was chosen as a reviewer to
per is because I was a co-author on the following paper:
sauw, K., Van Meeteren, M., Sansen, J., Meijers, E., Storme, T., Louw, E., Derudder, B. & Witlox,
18). Planning for agglomeration economies in a polycentric region: Envisioning an efficient
politan core area in Flanders, European Journal of Spatial Development,
p://doi.org/10.30689/EJSD2018:69.1650-9544<U+200B>”
paper we combine accessibility analysis with isochrone maps for a practical application in public
ort planning. In doing so we explicitly draw on the long established history of using these
ques in transport geography and related disciplines. I have to admit up front that the method
sed in this paper is more sophisticated as what we used, and I am actually quite enthusiastic about
icators that this paper proposes. However, my disciplinary background is also a source of criticism
review, in the sense that “the claims to newness” in this paper does disenfranchise the
utions from geography and geographers to the study of accessibility somewhat. Claims that this
is “a first contribution in this direction” (abstract), that “studying cities in terms of travel time is a
tan view” (page 2, for geographers it is the default view). “very few people have studied the
ral features of these systems” (page 2). tie into this feeling. It might be new to complexity science,
ter science or physics, but it is not new to geographers at all. This is something the authors
wledge when they cite some of geography’s foundational works, references 21-29 contain some of
ssic papers I would normally recommend. This resonates with a broader annoyance as data
e, physics and complexity theorists have been ‘discovering the city’ as a topic of research. We as
aphers welcome new perspectives and input to some of our established research topics, but we do
have some acknowledgement of our historical contribution to a topic, a recurring complaint nicely
ated in O’ Sullivan and Manson (2015).
anged the phrase in the abstract:
paper gives a first contribution in this direction by providing a new perspective on how to
ate accessibility in cities based on data of public transportation.”
paper gives a contribution in this direction by providing general methods to evaluate
sibility in cities based on data of public transportation.”
anged the phrase at line 29:
is end, we start from a relatively minoritarian point of view, namely that of measuring cities
ms of travelling times rather than geographical distances.”
is end, we measure cities in terms of travelling times rather than geographical distances.”
d a sentence, add a citation [...1] at line 70:

uthors mention that “that the science of cities is a relatively new research area (P.2)”. I would make
se that it needs qualification. I’d say that the author of that claim, Michael Batty has been doing the
e of cities for the whole of his long and distinguished career and that he himself was able to
sh that career on a network of scholars in the 1960s (Barnes and Wilson 2014 provide historical
ctive; and I did my little bit in Van Meeteren and Poorthuis 2018). In fact, accessibility analysis
ack to the collaboration of a geographer and a physicist on population potential in the 1950s
art and Warntz, 1958). In other words, this reviewer would be very happy to see this contribution
the “invention” of a debate/concept but as a “contribution/refinement” to a longstanding, but
ps at certain times in history dormant research agenda. Most of this revision is just a question of
ge and due citation. Even nowadays there is quite a bustling community of geographers working
se topics, for instance just look at journals such as “Environment and planning B: urban analytics
ty science” (edited by Mike Batty), The Journal of Transport Geography or Transportation
rch. So although I agree with the authors that big data and massive computation offers great
ial to revisit these topics (page 4), it is not that there is not a large community of scholars doing
y that.
anged the following sentence at line 12:
science of cities is a relatively new research area that greatly benefited, in the last decades,
digital revolution”
science of cities is a research area that greatly benefited, in the last decades, of the digital
tion”
brings me to another comment: I don’t think this community of geographers has no standard
res of accessibility: we have (see Boussauw et al 2018 for references) and they are quite similar
to what this paper proposes.
aid, I am very enthusiastic about the new measures “velocity score”, :Sociality score” and “city
ty” and I like the crisp and unambiguous way in which the authors define it. Those measures will
ery welcome and useful tool for comparative research across cities both for academic and for
al applications. Geographers do not like describing indicators with adjectives like “universal” or
or all sorts of epistemological and historical reasons (Barnes 2013). Nevertheless I understand
s a problem of translation between disciplinary languages here.
ded the following sentence at line 68:
metrics adopted are defined "universal" in the sense that they can be applied in every city
different contexts allowing comparison between different areas and means of
ortation.”
clude there is one final weaker point in the paper I would like to point out. The section Space-time
ution of inequality in accessibility patterns” (page 9-10) assumes a monocentric model of a city.
onocentric model has been increasingly found to be unrealistic of city structures regardless of
you are(Van Meeteren et al. 2016 is a good introduction to these debates see also Clark and
rs-Line 1994, Clark 2000). Of course there are car based and public transport based cities and
American cities tend to be the former for historical reasons. So the rankings provided do not
e a geographer at all. They are exactly what one would expect based on geographical knowledge.
ver, if the paper is serious in its ambition to provide a cartographic tool that helps policy makers, it
take into account that cities have several employment centres and that the traditional ‘urban core’
ng since lost its meaning as the principal centre of employment public transport is directed toward.
ew jobs come in the city’s edge (Phelps, 2017; Keil, 2017), therefore championing cities that have
st accessibility to the city center is not always the best policy advice, although advocating for
densities that allow for public transportation surely is. On that note, there is a literature on
old values’ when public transport becomes viable. This is not so much a “general mechanism”
10) as the simple result of transport economics that require a minimal number of customers for an
ment to be politically and economically sustainable. Again here we encounter some disciplinary
translation. For social scientists these “general mechanism” are the product of social and political
ons which makes us cautious in using terms like “general” and “universal” as society could easily
e that reality if enough people want to.
analysis, we do not assume a monocentric model of a city. We start only from the point
he highest value (called “center”) of the accessibility quantity under exams and we see how
antity varies with the time distance from that “center”. What we observe is a fast decay of
erage quantities from the “center” with the time distance. It is also important to highlight
ur findings are not in contrast with a “polycentric” model of cities. As a matter of fact, our
vations could be in agreement with a polycentric city, where the centers are close to each
in public transport travel time.
anged the following sentences, in the subsection “Space-time distribution of inequality in
sibility patterns” at line 370, in order to reduce possible misunderstandings:
maps shown in Fig.2 highlight the fact that the best performing public transport areas are
lly clustered in the center of the cities, while many other areas experience poorly
ming public transport. To better quantify this effect we display the behaviour of the velocity
f the sociality scores (Fig.8) as a function of the travel-time from the center of each city.
he center is defined for each city as the hexagon with the highest score (velocity and
ity, respectively).”
e maps shown in Fig.2} (and at www.citychrone.org) we observe a central area with the
st values of the accessibility observables and some “islands” with high accessibility values
cted to the central zone by some well-served directions, consistent with the idea of
entric cities [41]. To better quantify this effect we display the behaviour of the velocity and
sociality scores (Fig.8) as a function of the travel-time, instead of using the spatial
ce, from the “center” of each city. Here the “center” is defined, for each city, as the
on with the highest score (velocity and sociality, respectively)<U+200B>.”
h we understand that some of our results could be expected at a qualitative level, we think
per could make a good contribution towards quantification of what can be intuitively
ed; for instance, to quantify the level of inhomogeneity of specific observables on different
and different areas. These observables could be very useful, for instance, to check the
y of specific assumptions and modelling schemes about cities.
the ‘most of the world now lives in cities’ argument is now so much of a cliché (that hides a lot,
enner and Schmid 2014) that I would avoid using it.
ange the sentence:
e end of this century, most of the world population will be living in cities. The
cedented level of urban interactions and interconnectedness represents a big challenge to
ge the unavoidable growth while aiming at sustainability and inclusiveness.”
t decades the acceleration of the urban growth led to an unprecedented level of urban
ctions and interconnectedness. This represents a big challenge to manage the unavoidable
h while aiming at sustainability and inclusiveness.”
these points allow the author to improve on what is already a really interesting paper. I look
d to seeing it develop further.

ssumptions are correct, then the methodology is sound. However, the use of imprecise scientific
ology and the lack or rigour when explaining the mathematical equations often forces the reader to
what the authors meant instead of what they wrote. This becomes particularly problematic when it
in masking some important limitations of the methodology. Although I believe that the following
should prove relatively easy to fix, I would strongly advise against publishing the manuscript until
are addressed, hence the major revision recommendation.
206: The speed of expansion of the isochrone is dr/dt, not r/t. Please indicate the correct
etation (l. 208-209) directly. In addition, the term “velocity” is generally used instead of “speed”
the direction is considered, while it has precisely been removed here.
anged the following sentences at lines 204, 210,211, 213:

209-210: v is certainly not proportional to the explorable area from the hexagon <U+03BB>. If an isochrone

nt <U+03BB>s in one or more cities and for a common t, then v is proportional to the explorable area. The
eds to be changed accordingly.
anged the following sentence at line 215:
he other hand, this quantity is proportional <U+200B>to the square root of the<U+200B> amount of area it is
ble to explore from the hexagon <U+200B>$\lambda$<U+200B> given a time interval <U+200B>$\tau$”
235-236: A(t) for a typical daily t is already a better measure than v from eq. 3 of “the extension of
ea that it is possible to explore in a typical working day”. Meanwhile, v is the average speed at
an individual should expect to travel on their typical daily trips. Why is the first interpretation
n rather than the second?
ose to consider the square root of the area, divided by the time, because this quantity, in
proximate way, can be seen as the average velocity from the point considered taking a
m direction of displacement. We have the feeling that, when speaking about
ortations, is easier for all to quantify and imagine a speed rather than an area as a function
e, so it is easier to make a comparison with our everyday life and communicate the
ific results to a large audience with very different backgrounds.
anged the sentence at line 218:
hose to consider the square root of the area instead of the area itself to have a more direct
retation of it in terms of transportation velocity,<U+200B> that is easier to communicate and to
stand for a general audience.<U+200B>”
. 3: I am guessing from the supplementary information and from the legend of fig. 2 that “N is a
lisation constant” means that its role is to ensure that \int f(t) dt = 1 and this would explain why the
n by \int f(t) dt has been omitted in eq. 3. This omission should be properly indicated, otherwise the
sion of v is not [m].[s]^-1, but only [m] and the integral becomes a sum rather than an average.
details about f(t) and at the very least a reference to the supplementary material should appear in
in text. Also, presenting f(t) as the direct result of a survey is misleading, since it is instead the
of some modelling work using an external methodology (which comes with its limits, see (6)).
anged the equation Eq. 3 and Eq. 4 in order to ensure that the dimension of the average is
^-1. We added explicitly the normalization.
anged the following sentences at line 224:
distribution adopted is taken from a<U+200B>n analytic curve obtained from fits of<U+200B> surveys of the
budget times spent on a bus by UK citizens [1].<U+200B> In the Supplementary Material File S1, it is
n how the accessibility measures proposed are robust against reasonable choices of travel
istributions and the results presented do not sensibly change by choosing different

rations of the maps and other cities we refer the reader to the platform \url{citychrone.org}.
Supplementary Material File S1 it is shown how the accessibility measures proposed are
t against reasonable choices of travel time distributions and the results presented do not
bly change by choosing different distributions.<U+200B> <U+200B>”
e description of f(t) in the supplementary material is still hard to understand. What is the value and
N? What is the quality of the fitting (e.g. R^2)? Why does T_bus mention only a bus when the
is now about “transport habits” compared to “Oyster card journeys on bus, Tube, DLR and
n Overground”?
ed empirical travel-time distributions that we were able to find in literature. We could find
wo analytic forms derived from empirical data in the literature. Then we add a third one, the
distribution, just to check if our results are sensitive to the choice of the travel time
utions. What the Fig.1 of the Supporting Material file S1 shows is indeed that our results
bust against a different choice of travel-time distributions. The “N” is a normalization
ant. It ensures that the distribution sums to 1.
ded the following sentence in the supplementary:
e <U+200B>$N$<U+200B> is a normalization constant <U+200B>that ensures that $\int_{0}^{\infty}f_{DBT}(t)dt = 1$.<U+200B>”
e study on which the f(t) distribution is based only uses (significantly outdated) data from the UK.
atter of fact, the authors of the original study lengthily discuss the limitations of their data. The
provement made is a comparison to some more recent data that already shows discrepancies
e being from the same geographical region (which is not even featured in the case studies). This is
ortant flaw that should be mentioned in the discussion in the main text of the manuscript.
ted earlier, our results are quite stable against a reasonable choice of the travel-time
utions, meaning that different choices of those distributions, did not affect our results.

Response to Reviewer 2:
We thank the reviewer for his/her comments and support to our work. His/her contribution
was extremely valuable in helping us to better shape our text to make it accessible also to a
general audience outside our field of research. The reviewer’s comments are addressed in
the following text.
1: One overarching comment is that the paper would benefit from a thorough language edit.
Although everything is understandable, there are repeated minor grammatical and spelling
errors and many dangling modifiers (where the reference object in the previous sentence is
unclear), and repeated language that could be avoided by use of synonyms. A language
specialist might choose different adjectives / phrases in order to get a more nuanced
perspective across, and sentences could be split to improve readability. For instance, the
first sentence of the introduction is more than four lines, which is not very common in the
English language (contrary to many Latin languages). "Lost in translation" issues could also
be in play in some of the other minor things I raise below.
We revised the manuscript accordingly, trying to remove the grammatical and spelling errors
and simplifying and shortening sentences.
2: What do you mean with "the fruition" of metrics? (page 12, line 32). I agree that your
metrics are intuitive, but do you mean "making their practical application easier" or
something like that?
Indeed. We meant that our metrics and results should be easily reproducible by other
researchers. We modified the sentence in the following way: <U+200B>“Also, our metrics are well
suited for being shared and easily visualized on maps, making them easy to be applied by
other researchers to reproduce and extend our results.”
Both in the abstract and on pages 18-19 there is the claim that there is a "general
mechanism" or "common mechanism" at work that can possibly explain the regular patterns
of inequality found. I would advise some caution here. The notion of "mechanism" suggests
ideas about causation of spatial inequality which is somewhat outside the scope of the
current paper. I wholeheartedly agree that there is a recurring pattern across cities, and that
this seemingly "universal pattern" merits further investigation. However, what causes these
patterns is a question that is yet to be answered. Even if one was able to describe the
mechanism in a morphological sense (for instance through a process of preferential
attachment) it still could have different causes. Some may be described in the realm of
transport economics (minimum densities to profitably exploit public transport or alternatively
through network externalities), labour market geographies (places of work and places of
living), theories of rent and so on. I would suggest being slightly more modest and claim that
there is a recurring morphological pattern of inequality in accessibility across cities that is
very interesting to disentangle in future urban-scientific research. But like my similar remark
in the previous review round: I am aware that this is viewed differently across disciplines,
and that where I come from we tend to be very cautious when it concerns causality.
We agree with the Reviewer that we are not investigating the causes of the observed
patterns. Accordingly, in the abstract we removed the reference to a “common mechanism”,
simply pointing out the similarities across cities:
“We highlight great inequalities in the access to good public transport services across the
population, which are found to be strikingly similar across different towns.”
As the reviewer pointed out, the adoption of the term “mechanism”, when referring to the
observed patterns, may be misleading. Still, what we meant was that, even though the
causes of those patterns have yet to be elucidated, we conjecture that similar causes could
lead to similar outcomes. In order to be well balanced, we changed the text along the
following lines:
“These results exhibit strongly similar patterns among all the observed cities, suggesting the
existence of similar causes underlying the observed phenomenology, that could range from
morphological to Socio-Economic ones.”
We also turned “a general mechanism” into “shared causes independent from the particular
location”.
In the discussion section, we speculate a bit about such causes, also following the
comments of Reviewer 3 about the adoption of private cars and the need to connect
important points with limited resources:
“The observed similarities of the mobility patterns across different cities suggest the
existence of common causes, independently of the specific location. The observed inequality
patterns are the results of the planning and organization of public transport systems. Though
disentangling such causes remains a challenge, one can speculate that these patterns might
emerge as a consequence of the limited resource urban planners have to deal with when
designing public services. Under these circumstances, planners may be forced to secure
first efficient services to highly important locations, leaving behind less crowded areas or
less economically crucial areas. In doing this, planners might foresee the use of other
transportation means (e.g., private cars), thus leaving certain areas with poor public
transport connections.”
Response to Reviewer 3:
We thank the review for the constructive comments on our work. In the following, we hope to
address the issues the Reviewer pointed out in a satisfactory manner. Despite some
misunderstandings and limitations, we still think our work is relevant for the field of spatial
accessibility studies and we hope the Reviewer will be convinced as well at the end of this
round of review. The first issue raised by Reviewer 3 states:
“Claiming that the Supplementary Material ascertains the robustness of the methodology is
misleading, if not dishonest.”
The accusation of being misleading, or worst dishonest, though certainly a bit over the line,
can be due to a misunderstanding that we hope to clarify here. “Robustness” in our case
means that the results are qualitatively independent from the travel time distribution used to
compute our accessibility metrics. Either if we use the empirical travel budget distribution or
another synthetic one, we do not observe large variation in the results. An area with a
relatively large velocity score will have a large velocity score changing travel time
distribution.
The main criticism about the methodology is described by Reviewer 3 in point 2 of his/her
second review:
Point 2.
Comparing two travel time distributions obtained for one city, then applying these
distributions to completely different cities is the exact opposite of a “robust” approach. Where
is it justified in the manuscript that the empirical daily budget for London residents is relevant
to Boston or Sydney? Why should we expect people living in Florence or Toulouse to devote
as much time to transport as people living in a city 15 times bigger? In addition, what is the
quality of these fittings compared to real data, not compared to other modelled data?
We understand the concerns raised by the Reviewer, about the choice of the travel time
distribution. We thank him/her for raising this important remark that allows us to better clarify
our approach and methodology. We agree with Reviewer 3 that the travel time distribution
could vary between cities, and also among groups of different cities, and at a microscopic
level from an individual to another. Our aim is that of measuring the performance of public
transports to connect places and people<U+200B> from the point of view of a single or a group of
individuals<U+200B>. This is why we use the same travel time distribution for every point in every city.
In general, we agree with the Reviewer that our accessibility metrics quantitatively depends
on the specific travel time distribution used. Still, how our accessibility metrics are defined as
guarantees that the results presented do not change qualitatively upon changing the travel
time distribution. In particular, the ranking of cities as well as the inequalities pattern
observed do not change, as reported in the main text as well as in the Supplementary
Material. From this perspective we consider our results robust and independent from the
specific travel time distribution used and in general from the habit of people. More in general,
the adoption of accessibility metrics computed by keeping fixed the travel time distribution,
could be suitable to single out areas better served by public transportation in any city from
an individual point of view. In order to clarify this point we added in the Results section the
following paragraph:
“In equation (\ref{eq:vel_score_avg}) the average over $\tau$ is performed by weighting with
a travel-time distribution $f(\tau)$. The travel time distribution represents the probability for
an individual or a group of individuals to perform a journey of duration of $\tau$. The travel
time distribution could vary between the considered cities, time
frames~\cite{geurs2004accessibility}, and also between areas and groups of individuals of
the same city~\cite{Accessibility_Houston}. In the Supplementary Material File S1 we show
how the \emph{Velocity Score} (and the other accessibility metrics defined in the following)
computed with different choices for $f(\tau)$ are highly correlated with one another. Thus,
the choice of $f(\tau)$ does not alter qualitatively the results obtained. On the other hand,
using the same $f(\tau)$ for each city is equivalent to focusing on the perspective of a single
individual, or a cohesive group of individuals, who would compare different cities and
different transportation systems from their perspective. For all these reasons we focused on
one specific travel time distribution, namely that obtained from fits of surveys of the daily
budget times spent on a bus by UK citizens~\cite{kolbl2003energy}. We remark that, though
out of the scope of the present paper, the investigation of the impact of different city-specific
travel time distributions would deserve a research effort.”
Point 1.
I agree. Hence, I don’t understand why the first clear and neatly written interpretation of v(<U+03BB>)
(given l. 238), the one people are likely to remember, is “the Velocity Score provides with a
measure of the extension of the area” rather than the speed interpretation.
We apologize for having missed this remark. We agree with the Reviewer.
We accordingly modified the text as follows:
“Considering a typical working day, the Velocity Score approximately provides with a
measure of the average speed at which an individual can move away from a hexagon
$\lambda$, in a randomly chosen direction. The Sociality Score provides instead a measure
of the number of people it is possible to reach within the same trip.”
Point 3.
The methodology assumes that the daily budget is entirely spent in one round trip. If, for
example, an individual undertakes a first trip from inside Paris to their workplace 4 km away
and a second trip to a shop 2 km away, their movements remain in fact bounded within a
disk of radius 4 km, representing 64% of Paris, or roughly 1.3M inhabitants. However, the
method would count them as traveling up to 6km away, reaching roughly a total of 3M
inhabitants. In this case, the 320k inhabitants of the area of the second trip, already counted
once in the first trip, add an extra 1.7M to the total count of people reachable. This needs to
be properly indicated.
We think there is a misunderstanding here. We are interested in the travel time distribution,
not in the budget time distribution. We do not assume that “the daily budget is entirely spent
in one round trip”, but we consider that the daily budget distribution in spent in two trips as
explained in the Supplementary Material. This is of course a rough approximation. This point
was explained in the first page of the Supplementary Material. In order to better highlight this
point, we rewrote the section “Robustness of the accessibility metrics definitions with respect
to travel time distributions” in the Supplementary Material, where we tested three different
travel time distributions.
There are already one unrealistic isotropy assumption (contradicted, for example, by the lack
of willingness to cross the “périphérique” - or purpose to do so - for inhabitants of the
municipality) and one incorrect assumption that the daily budget is uniformly distributed
inside the city (people living inside the “périphérique” do so at a very high cost to avoid
spending time in transports). As a result, the sociality score obtained for inner Paris
residents is completely unrealistic. In fact, the maps in panel B of figure 2 appear to be a
less precise and less accurate version of this map, which provides simple objective
information without making any claim of representing anything “typical”:
http://www.urbanmorphologyinstitute.org/france/
We would like to thank the Reviewer for signalling this interesting map, which is indeed very
related to our work. We honestly do not have a detailed knowledge of the behaviour of the
inhabitants of Paris. The inclusion of this element as well as the corresponding one for other
cities will certainly be an added value for future works. Concerning the isotropic
assumptions, this is typically made for sake of simplicity in many accessibility studies, at
least concerning the direction of the movements of the citizens. Such assumption is indeed
made also in “<U+200B>http://www.urbanmorphologyinstitute.org/france/<U+200B>”, where our same notion of
isochrones is considered. The main difference we can see is that such map does not
consider any area of the city as equal, but uses as relevant only those in which workplaces
are available. This issue has been pointed out by the Reviewer as well in one of the
comments that follows.
The purpose of the manuscript is to propose a “unifying definition of accessibility” that would
be directly useful to policy makers. Ignoring how urban planners design their cities does not
sound like a good starting point to achieve that. I fail to see why it is not possible to add one
or two lines pointing out the role of cars as an explanation to the difference in the observed
results between cities.
We understand the concerns of the Reviewer about the use of private cars and the role of
private transportations in urban planning. The scope of our work is mainly related to public
transportation systems, yet some of the observed patterns might be the result of plans in
which both public and private transportation systems are considered. At present, we cannot
prove or disprove the conjecture made by the Reviewer that the differences observed in the
accessibility patterns of different cities are due to the presence of private cars. Anyway, to
open to further studies along these lines, we added the following text in the Discussion
section:
“The observed similarities of the mobility patterns across different cities suggest the
existence of common causes, independently of the specific location. The observed inequality
patterns are the results of the planning and organization of public transport systems. Though
disentangling such causes remains a challenge, one can speculate that these patterns might
emerge as a consequence of the limited resource urban planners have to deal with when
designing public services. Under these circumstances, planners may be forced to secure
first efficient services to highly important locations, leaving behind less crowded areas or
less economically crucial areas. In doing this, planners might foresee the use of other
transportation means (e.g. private cars), thus leaving certain areas with poor public transport
connections.”
The “1% highest accessibility hexagons” is not necessarily meaningful. An individual living in
the south of Horley (42 km from London) will fare very well since they will be in the same
hexagon as the Gatwick express (only £18/trip) and the fast suburban Southern and
Thameslink trains. Meanwhile an individual living on Westbourne Grove in zone 1 may
(depending on the hexagon placement) have to rely on buses or walk to another hexagon to
take the tube.
Despite limited to a max of 15 minutes on foot travelled at 5 km/h, we consider the possibility
to walk to a nearby hexagon to access public transport, either at the beginning of the trip or
whenever there is the need to change means of transport. The time spent walking is
included in the time of the trips. The limit of 15 minutes is again arbitrary, but it can be easily
varied in our analysis.
We clarify this in the text:
“Each one of these shortest-time-paths will consider all the possible means of transport
between two hexagons, including the possibility to move on foot to nearby hexagons to
access the public transport services places within a given area.”
By construction, building a transport network requires to fill a 2-dimensional space with
1-dimensional lines. As cities become larger, this is less and less possible, so planners only
try to connect people to places that matter to them. They try to cater to people’s habits, no
matter the number of random strangers they can wave hello to from the window of their
trains as they pass by towards their intended destination. This is similar to the difference
between degree centrality and Katz centrality in network theory. What matters most: the
number of nodes one is connected to or the importance of the nodes one is connected to?
We agree with the Reviewer on the fact that the patterns we are observing could result from
the constraints urban planners have to face. Being the explanation of these mechanisms
beyond the scope of the present work, we just mention this issue in the Discussion section
(see comment above)
Some may think that taking these considerations into account participates in the
“proliferation of definitions that disperse the scientific effort”. However, the “top 1%” analysis
presented in the manuscript is misleading and does not add any valuable “operational”
information. It does not reveal anything about inequality in “access to opportunities”, only
that central inhabitants could easily go check if the birds are different in the suburban
residential areas if they wanted to and that airports and amusement parks are the best spots
for high accessibility unauthorized camping.
Here the Reviewer highlights one of the drawbacks of our approach: not considering the
distribution of opportunities within the cities. The reason we did not take them into account is
purely practical. As for the travel-time distribution, finding these data for many different towns
requires a strong effort that we would like to devote to future researches. Nevertheless, we
can already argue that the possibility to reach even remote and uncommon locations is
correlated with the possibility to reach more important ones easily. Still, it will be essential to
include points of interest and opportunities in future works, which, by the way, is quite
straightforward in our approach. For example, we could consider the number of recreational
areas, of shops of a specified kind or of workplaces instead of individuals reached in our
Sociality Score metrics and obtain accessibility maps conveying different information.
We modified the text along the following lines:
“The population can be considered as a proxy for the number of opportunities within an area.
Given the availability of data, the Sociality Score can be easily modified to consider only
opportunities of a specified kind. It is sufficient to substitute in equation
(\ref{eq:sociality_score}) the amount of population within the isochrone with the amount of
that kind of opportunities.”
And in the discussion:
“Our framework is easily extendable to clarify these issues since the inclusion of other data
sources concerning private transport and the inclusion of points of interest in the accessibility
metrics (e.g. workplaces, shops, schools, etc.) is quite straightforward.”

Response to Reviewers
We want to thank the editor for having accepted to assess our paper, based just on one
reviewer's comments. We addressed the concerns about the English language polishing by
having it revised by an English native speakers, working at Sony CSL Paris. Michael Ainslow
(<U+200B>michael.ainslow@sony.com<U+200B>) is familiar with scientific english and has revised our
manuscript, correcting and rephrasing some of its parts.
The editor is free to contact him and he will provide proof of their involvement in the revision
of the paper, as well as a report of his corrections.
We would also like to thank the reviewer for his valuable comments. We agree with his
concerns about the statements made in the paper, which are due to our different backgrounds,
and we are more than willing to solve. The reviewer gave us a precise set of points to be
addressed. Hence, we will first discuss his comments and then provide the changes we made
in the text for each provided point.
All the sentences added and corrected are highlighted in red in the manuscript. We indicate
them in the following with the part of the text in which they can be found.
Reviewer 4
I believe the paper does make a contribution to urban accessibility studies by proposing indices that
can be used to compare pedestrian and public transit accessibility levels from city to city. I The three
indices proposed in the paper – velocity, sociality, cohesion – are complementary. I think the paper
deserves publication, but there are still a few issues the paper should address before publication,
however.
First, as has already been indicated in previews reviews, a thorough language edit is still needed by a
native English speaker.
We agree with the reviewer and we have addressed this issue in the response to the editor at
the beginning of this document.
Second, the most important issue I find with the paper is the assumption that trips are modeled from
all hexagons to all hexagons. I understand the simple appeal of this assumption – which is also
common in computer science and graph theory algorithms, where indices are computed form all
nodes to all nodes. It offers a simple way to make cities comparable to each other, but it doesn't really
describe real commuting flows nor aims of transit systems.
As the reviewer mentioned, this choice is a strong assumption. What we would like to
communicate is that our aims are not to describe the real commuting flow or the way public
transport are design. Our principal aim is to measure the performance of public transport at
connecting places or people in cities. As we better describe below, we add and change several
sentences in the text to better highlight this aspect.
-
Urban populations do not commute with equal likelihood to all parts of the city. Trips are much more
common from homes to jobs, homes to commercial destinations as well as homes to recreational
destinations and vica versa These destinations types are never uniformly distributed in space – they
tend to concentrate in the CBD and other subcenters. Accordingly, public transportation systems and
street networks evolve over time to prioritize access to such destinations instead of maximizing
uniform access to all parts of the city. If we measured how easily people from all parts of the city can
gain access to jobs as well as commercial destinations, we would likely find different results. The 1%
VS 99% access differences highlighted in the paper would likely change. And the meaning of velocity,
sociality and cohesion would likely change.
Again, we agree with the reviewer. If we use instead of population, like in the case of sociality
score, the distribution of jobs we obtain a different accessibility measure, that may be called
for instance jobs score. Up to now we just analyze the performance of the public transport to
connect areas and people.
People meet others not at their homes, but in public or commercial and recreational spaces of the city.
We should thus not judge the quality of public transit systems based on how well they allow residents
to get to all other residents' homes.
We remove all the sentences in the text that could lead to the interpretation that our aims were
to assess the quality of public transport in general. We always try to make clear in the text that
we want to measure only the performance of public transport to connect people or places.
Here there is a list of sentences that were changed in order to reduce the misunderstanding:
Abstract:
<U+25CF> In the last decades, the acceleration of urban growth has led to an unprecedented level of
urban interactions and interdependence. This situation calls for a significant effort among the
scientific community to come up with engaging and meaningful visualizations and accessible
scenario simulation engines. The present paper gives a contribution in this direction by
providing general methods to evaluate accessibility in cities based on public transportation
data. Through the notion of isochrones, <U+200B>the accessibility quantities proposed measure the
performance of transport systems at connecting places and people in urban systems. Then
we introduce scores rank cities according to their overall accessibility. We highlight significant
inequalities in the distribution <U+200B>of these measures<U+200B> across the population, which are found to be
strikingly similar across various urban environments. Our results are released through the
interactive platform: www.citychrone.org, aimed at providing the community at large with a
useful tool for awareness and decision-making.
Introduction:
<U+25CF> [line 82] It is worth mentioning that the local nature of our metrics allows us to evaluate and
visualize the geographical fluctuations of the velocity and sociality scores, and thus to quantify
the inequalities <U+200B>distribution of these measures among areas and population<U+200B> within each city.
In particular, we show that while the distributions of the accessibility metrics seem to have
higher values for high-density areas, only a small fraction of the population <U+200B>lives in areas with
accessibility scores much larger than the rest of the city.
Inequalities in urban accessibility patterns:
<U+25CF> [line 315] In this section, we focus on a particular aspect of accessibility, <U+200B>the
spatial-temporal distribution inside the city.
<U+25CF> [line 368] Similar considerations hold for the sociality scores, which implies that $1\%$ of
the population potentially has access at twice the number of <U+200B>people<U+200B> as the rest of the
population.
<U+25CF> [line 377] The quantitative assessment of the strong <U+200B>uneven distribution<U+200B> observed in the
accessibility patterns reported above can be further clarified by looking at the spatial
distribution of the accessibility metrics.
<U+25CF> [line 353] The spread of the distributions is still very high and very few people (or areas)
have access to high <U+200B>accessibility values<U+200B> compared to the rest of the populations (or
areas).
<U+25CF> [line 406] Moving in space and time away from these areas will lead to experiencing
generally <U+200B>much less performing<U+200B> public transport services.
Discussion:
<U+25CF> [line 438] A very interesting opportunity open by the new scores concerns the possibility
to quantify the level of <U+200B>uneven distribution of these quantities<U+200B> within a city, i.e., the
fluctuations of the accessibility scores among <U+200B>areas and population<U+200B>.
We agree with the reviewer that people do not meet others only at home. The sociality score
gives also a measure of how many people can reach a place. If we assume that, on average,
the travel time of a trip is very similar to the time of the reverse trip, the sociality score can be
interpreted as the amount of population can reach a specific location.
The following plot [added in the supplementary material] shows the high correlation between
the sociality score of Rome computed with travel time of incoming and outcoming trips.
In order to better clarify the nature of sociality score we add the following sentence in the text:
[line 249] The sociality score can also be interpreted as a measures of the amount of the population
that can easily reach the point considered if we assume that, on average, the travel time of trips in
cities is similar reversing origin and destination. In order validate this assumption we compute the
sociality score with travel time of the incoming trip and out coming trips for each point in Rome. In fig.5
in the Supplementary Material File S1 there is the scatter plot of this two quantities showing the high
correlation between these two measures.
Finally, we agree with the reviewer that a more detailed understanding of the quality of public
transport would require taking into account the distribution of opportunities and points of
interest within the city and the travel choices of individuals. As we briefly discussed in the
Discussion section, the inclusion of this kind of data would be straightforward in our method
and would certainly lead to interesting results. We tried to stress this more in the text. We also
tried to clarify that our results are far from being conclusive and more investigation is needed
in this direction.
In the following, we follow the suggestion of reviewer 4 and we changed the text accordingly
to the issue raised.
To address this issue, I suggest that:
a) the discussion section should either eliminate or substantially change the discussion about
the inequality of access in cities.
We change the discussion about inequality access in cities. We highlight principally the
uneven distribution of our accessibility quantities among population and areas. We
change/add the following sentences:
[line 438] A very interesting opportunity open by the new scores concerns the possibility to quantify
the level of <U+200B>uneven distribution of these quantities within a city, i.e., the fluctuations of the accessibility
scores among areas and population. We remark here that our first aim was to measure the
performance of public transport to connect places and people. Despite that more realist origin
destination matrix, for instance considering the distribution of opportunities within the city, can be
considered and easily integrated into our framework. But, up to now, there is still a lack of open
data-sets covering enough cities for this kind of analysis<U+200B>. <U+200B>Taking into account the aim of the
accessibility measure proposed, our analyses reveal a general pattern observed in all the considered
cities. Namely that the $1\%$ of the area of a city features accessibility scores with average values at
least double those of the remaining $99\%$ of areas.
The same patterns are observed by looking at the number of people enjoying specific values of the
accessibility scores: also in this case, the top $1\%$ of the population can move at least twice as fast
as the remaining $99\%$ of the population. This very uneven distribution of performances of the
public transport within an urban environment is explained in terms of the rapid decay of the
accessibility scores as a function of the temporal distance from the city center. The observed
similarities of the mobility patterns across different cities suggest the existence of common causes,
independently of the specific location. The observed inequality patterns are the results of the planning
and organization of public transport systems. Considering our initial remarks, we can speculate that
these patterns might be explained by the limited resource urban planners have to deal with when
designing public services. In this sense, including important locations and fluxes might allow us to
understand if these resources are efficiently allocated to satisfy the mobility needs of the citizens.
b) Some material should be added towards the beginning of the paper about the all hexagons to
all hexagons O-D choice.
We add at the beginning of the accessibility measures section the following sentences:
[line 189] The accessibility quantities proposed aim to measure the performance of public transports
at connecting places (velocity score) and people (sociality score). Roughly speaking, the velocity
score measures how fast it is possible to reach any point from any other point in the city. The sociality
score measures the amount of population that it is possible to reach from any point in the city.
Usually, the flow of people in urban systems is described by an origin-destination matrix (ODM). The
velocity score can be thought as an accessibility measure that assumes a uniform ODM. Conversely,
in the case of the sociality score, we assume an ODM proportional to the population.
c) The discussion section should also mention the need in future work to test a similar approach
with different assumptions about origins and destinations.
We add the mention about using different assumptions about origins and destinations flow in
the discussion section. The answer to the point “a” shows these sentences.
d) The paper should reduce its claims that an end-all approach is delivered to compare cities on
accessibility levels. Rather, the paper makes an interesting step towards comparable urban
accessibility indices but there is a quite a bit more to do before a universal or standardized approach
can be agreed upon.
As explained before we try to better clarify the aim of the accessibility measure we define. In
this regard, most of the changed/added sentences listed reduce the claims about the
generality of our accessibility measure. Then we add the following sentences in the discussion
section:
[line 424] The main aim of this paper is to give a contribution towards a unifying, simple and general
framework for accessibility studies. We proposed some general metrics that allow for a quantitative
comparison of different cities and different areas of the same city. Despite the limitations of some of
our assumptions, our framework and measures are easily reproducible and applicable to the study of
accessibility via public transport in every urban environment in which transit feed open data is
available.
[line 464] As a final remark, the inclusion of other data sources, such as points of interest in the
accessibility metrics (e.g. workplaces, shops, schools, etc.) or considering fluxes of people is quite
straightforward in our framework and could lead to interesting results either in the global ranking of
accessibility between cities and in the comparisons between city areas, by giving more importance to
the purpose and popularity of certain trips.
