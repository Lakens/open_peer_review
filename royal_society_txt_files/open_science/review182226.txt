Author’s reply: During the preparation of the aminated microspheres, due to the
addition of the polyamine-based substances TETA and PEI, the degree of
cross-linking between the molecular chains was increased, causing aggregation. But
the amino group content on the same surface area was significantly increased, which
in turn leaded to a higher adsorption amount.
Thus, please provide evidence data about "the amino group content on the same surface area was
significantly increased". This claimed conclusion should be proved by Solid data, not description.

Reviewer #1: Comments to the Author(s)
Author’s reply: We highly appreciate the reviewer’s time and constructive
suggestions on our manuscript. All the corrections have been made following the
reviewer’s suggestions and highlighted in RED in the revised manuscript.
1. There are several, but very important issues, have not been present in the
manuscript. Like "the disperse property of the MSs", "the surface area (BET)
information", "the recycle properties of the dye adsorbent".
Author’s reply: The SEM images (Fig. 4) showed that the dispersion of the
microspheres TETA-CTSms and PEI-CTSms was worse than that of the microspheres
CTSms. Meanwhile, the particle size distribution curve of aminated microspheres was
presented in Fig. 6. This may be because during the crosslinking of the polyamine
substance, the degree of crosslinking increased due to a large amount of amino groups,
and the dispersibility of the microspheres deteriorated.
The surface area of the MSs was characterized by N2 adsorption/desorption
isotherms at 77 K on Accelerated Surface Area and Porosimetry System (ASAP
2020M, Micromeritics Company), and the surface areaobtained by the test was almost
absent. This may be due to the tight entanglement between the molecular chains of
chitosan during the process of crosslinking and precipitation when adding NaOH
solution. The BET test data of CTSms, TETA-CTSms and PEI-CTSms microspheres
were given.
A laser particle size distribution analyzer (BT-2002, Dandong Bettersize Co., Ltd.
China) is used to measure the particle size distribution of the microspheres according
to the diffraction and scattering phenomenon of the laser, while obtaining the surface
area of the MSs by particle size fitting.
In this work, we mainly prepare polyamine-based microspheres by one-pot
method. Next, we prepare to further optimize the preparation process of the aminated
microspheres, including reactant feed ratio, reaction temperature, reaction time and
the additive amount of glutaraldehyde. In the next adsorption experiment, we will
further study the binary and ternary adsorption processes, and the recycling
performance of the materials will be studied in detail in the next work.
2. SEM in Fig 4 show those MSs were seriously agglomerated as they been
produced. The agglomerated adsorbents present perfect dye remove
performance. The conclusion is seemed contradictory.
Author’s reply: During the preparation of the aminated microspheres, due to the
addition of the polyamine-based substances TETA and PEI, the degree of
cross-linking between the molecular chains was increased, causing aggregation. But
the amino group content on the same surface area was significantly increased, which
in turn leaded to a higher adsorption amount.
3. Abstract, should contain some important quantitative findings
Author’s reply: The comments pointed out above have been revised.
4. Introduction, first paragraph, need to put these references:
Carbohydrate polymers 113, 115-130 (2014).
Journal of hazardous materials 177 (1), 70-80 (2010).

Author’s reply: The comments pointed out above have been revised. We have cited

4. For characterization of adsorbents, because the process was adsorption, so the
analysis BET must be made to determine the surface area of the particles.

adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K on Accelerated Surface Area and Porosimetry
