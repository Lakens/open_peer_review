Appendix A
Dear Dr Siobhán Hackett,
Thank you for your letter and the reviewers’ comments concerning our manuscript
(RSOS-171134). These comments are all valuable and very helpful for revising and
improving our paper. We have studied comments carefully and have revised our
manuscript (the revisions are marked red). The main corrections in the paper and the
responses to the reviewer’s comments are as follows:
Reviewer #1:
Comment 1: There are grammatical mistakes in this manuscript.
Response: Thank you for your valuable advice. We have studied this paper carefully
and have revised that in this manuscript.
Comment 2: what is the relationship between the cotton fabric, protein fabric and
wool fabric?
Response: The cotton fabric is one of cellulosic fabric, which is made of cotton fibre.
And wool fabric is included in protein fabric. The dyeing property of protein fabric is
better compared to cotton fabric according to experimental results in this manuscript.
Comment 3: In the reaction mechanism analysis, the authors proposed that dimer
could be obtained through polymeriaztion. It is not reasonable. And there is no
experimental results(such as Ms) to support the mechnism (Figure 8).
Response: Thank you for your professional advice. China is one of tea producing
countries, and possible reaction mechanism has been mentioned in many published
Chinese papers. And much deeper research concerning the mechnism will be carried
out in our upcoming work. Furthermore, the proposal that dimer could be obtained
through polymerization has been reported in our published English paper as flowing:

334-341.( doi:10.1016/j.dyepig. 2016.07.032)
Reviewer #2:
Comment 1: Page 5 lin 44 perfecting the sentence (cancer, hyperglycemic as well as
anti-microbial et al.)
Response: Thank you for your valuable advice. We have studied this sentence
carefully and have revised that in this manuscript.
Comment 2: In the entire manuscript the analyze statistics is missing, like Page 9 lin
34-39. to interpret the results and draw conclusions, the statistical analysis is
mandatory.
Response: The statistics of the entire manuscript are shown in the tables and figures,
which is listed in Page 19-25.
Comment 3: Page 9 lin 14 -16, it is necessary to indicate the protocol used and does
not satisfy the reference.
Response: Thank you for your valuable advice. We have supplemented relevant
testing theory and method in this manuscript.
Comment 4: In the Results and discussion part, the discussion are practically absent.
It is necessary to discuss your results in relation to the bibliography.
Response: Thank you for your advice. We have discussed experimental results
according to measured data. In addition, the conclusion has been reported in our
published English paper with respect to admirable dyeing property of wool fabrics
with tea pigments. On another level, the conclusion that glycine is contributed to the
formation of tea pigments also have been reported in many published Chinese papers.
However, there is no report in published English paper currently.

334-341.( doi:10.1016/j.dyepig. 2016.07.032)
Comment 5: For the measurements made and shown in the tables, how many
repetitions you have performed for these measurements.
Response: We have performed these measurements for three times, and data is the
average value in the tables.
Appendix B
Dear Dr Siobhán Hackett,
Thank you for your letter and the reviewers’ comments concerning our manuscript
(RSOS-171134.R1). These comments are all valuable and very helpful for revising
and improving our paper. We have studied comments carefully and have revised our
manuscript (the revisions are marked red). The main corrections in the paper and the
responses to the reviewer’s comments are as follows:
Reviewer #2:
Comment 1: 2- In the entire manuscript the analyze statistics is missing, like Page 9
lin 34-39. To interpret the results and draw conclusions, the statistical analysis is
mandatory. Indeed, I not find information about the name of statistical test used in
part Materials and methods, or the value of P in the legend of the all figures and
tables.
Response: Thank you for your valuable advice. We have analyzed relevant statistics
to interpret the results and draw conclusions in this manuscript. In addition, we make
use of the Integ value to explain the colour strength of dyed fabrics since the
maximum absorption wavelength of tea pigments could not been determined. On
another level, the K/S value of dyed fabrics could not been calculated according to the
R value, we have deleted the data in table 7 accordingly.
