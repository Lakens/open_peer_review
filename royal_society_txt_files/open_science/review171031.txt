Professor F. Cunill. University of Barceloina. Spain
It is an interesting paper that deserves to be published after minor but important revision.
The most important issue to be corrected deals with an important conceptual error in the field of
Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design. On page 20, it is said "The positive deltaH values indicate
that the esterification was endothermic (TRUE), such that increasing the temperature increased
the esterification rate (COMPLETELY FALSE)". For endothermic reversible reactions, an increase
on temperature leads to an increase in the equilibrium conversion but not the reaction rate with
what it is reached. It could it but not necessarily. One thing is the thermodynamics and other is
the kinetics, which has nothing to do with the thermodynamics.
The other comment to be considered is related with the introduction. In the open literature, it can
be found that esterificaion of rosin acids can be also performed with lipase (Lin. R. et al., BioMed
Research International, DOI 10.1155/2014/647068) and with ion exchange resins (Patent,
US20090056201 A1). These kind of catalyst should be also quoted in the introduction.

Appendix A
Revision of Manuscript RSOS-171031
This paper deals with the esterification reaction of rosin with glycerol under super/sub critical
pressure of CO2. Moreover, authors claim that CO2 solved in the water released in the reaction
of esterification is able to catalyze the reaction enhancing significantly the reaction rate. The
reaction is interesting under several viewpoints: the production of rosin esters would be a
commercial exit for the glycerol surplus, and the possibility of using CO2 as the catalyst makes
this process a green one. However, in my opinion the paper is not publishable in its present
form. Despite it contains enough experimental work, the manuscript has to be substantially
upgraded to be easily readable by readers. The following points should be addressed by the
authors:
1) Page 2. Abstracts Section. In lines 28-30, it is said “It was found that the esterification
kinetics was a pseudo first-order reaction, and the reaction enthalpy and entropy were
calculated using the Arrhenius-Polanyi equation”. In this point (and regrettably after in
pages 13-14, and 19-20) the authors explain that they use the Arrhenius-Polanyi
equation to find the thermodynamic parameters of the reaction. In my opinion the
authors refer to the Eyring-Polanyi equation (see Chapter 2-6 Prediction of Reaction
Rates – Theories of Kinetics, in “Chemical Engineering Kinetics” by J.M. Smith, 1981,
McGraw-Hill). This equation allows to estimate the enthalpy and entropy changes of
formation of the activated complex of the reaction, not the enthalpy and entropy
changes of the reaction. The last parameters can be estimated only from the values of
the equilibrium constant of the reaction at several temperatures
2) In the section 2.1 Materials, the authors should explain the properties of the ZnO used
as catalyst in some experiments (manufacturer, purity, surface properties, etc)
3) IN page 6, 2.2 Experimental setup and procedure section, the authors explain that they
use a 2-m3 stainless steel autoclave. However in the captions of figures 4 and 5 it is
said that the charge of rosin was 800 g. On the basis of the rosin mass it seems that
the reactor volume is probably 2-L. Is it so?
4) The description of the products obtained are necessary. With glycerol different esters
can be formed: monoester (two different), di-ester (two different), and the tri-ester. In
addition, later the authors admit the possible formation of decarboxylation products.
It would be good that authors explain with detail of products obtained and add to the
paper a reaction scheme to follow the reaction chemistry.
5) In page 9, line 166, it is said that triplicate experiments were carried out. However the
authors do not mention the experimental error of data of Table 1 (for example). The
authors should report the experimental error of all data
6) In page 10, line 187, it is said “Here, F<U+0BDE><U+0BDC> is the fractional fugacity coefficient of
component I in the k-phase (MPa)”. However, such symbol does not appear in
equations 2 and 3
7) In equation 12, page 12, there is a left bracket that has to be erased
8) In page 13, lines 250-252, it is said “The present work used a stoichiometric excess of
glycerol in the reaction mixtures, and thus the concentration of glycerol can be
considered to be constant in the kinetic model for the esterification”. But in page 8 it is
explained that the used rosin-to-glycerol molar ratio was between 1.25 and 1.75. Why
then the authors say that there is an excess of glycerol?
9) As shown in table 3, homogeneous reaction in the absence of ZnO and CO2 is very
noticeable. The authors should explain why they does not have used a model taking
into account the two contributions: with and without catalyst
10) In my first query I have explained that in my opinion the use of equation 17 to
determine the thermodynamic parameters of the reaction is wrong. However, I have
to point out that following the Eyring-Polanyi theory, equation 17 is wrong. In the term
ln(kb/h) the temperature is missing. The correct expression for the term is
ln(kbT<U+03B3>A<U+03B3>B/h). <U+03B3>A and <U+03B3>B are the activity coefficients of reactants A and B
11) The authors use esterification rate instead of rosin conversion. It is dangerous because
it can be confused with reaction rate. In my opinion, the authors should change
esterification rate by rosin conversion.
12) In line 338, page 17, the authors say that “The esterification reaction is typically
restricted by the chemical reaction equilibrium”. Why then the authors do not use a
kinetic model including the term of the reverse reaction?
13) In the same paragraph, the authors says “The presence of the super/sub critical CO2-
enrichied HTLW catalyst overcomes this limitation, thus improving the conversion and
the reaction rate (Fig. 6)”. A catalyst allows reaching faster the equilibrium position but
it does not change the equilibrium position.
14) In line 343, the authors says that rosin is not miscible with glycerol. As a consequence,
the reactor has two phases. In such reactor, is equation 15 actually describing the
reaction rate data? Concentrations used in reaction 15 are those in glycerol-phase or
those in rosin phase? How was estimated the volume of reaction?
15) In lines 355 and 361, the authors refer to rate constant K. The rate constant are usually
represented by k (lower case). This mistake appears in other places of the paper.
Please, correct
16) In page 20, lines 388-390, it is said “The positive <U+2206>H values indicate that the
esterification was endothermic, such that increasing the temperature increased the
esterification rate”. Actually, the formation of the activation complex is endothermic.
The estimated value is the enthalpy of formation of the activation complex, not the
enthalpy of reaction. Esterification reactions, endothermic or exothermic, have an
enthalpy of reaction close to zero.
17) In tables 5 and 6, the error of Ea, <U+2206>H, <U+2206>S and <U+2206>G should be quoted.

Revision of Manuscript RSOS-171031
Dear editors and reviewers,
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning our
manuscript entitled “A novel acid catalyst based on super/sub critical CO2-water
for the efficient esterification of resin acids”. Those comments are all valuable and
helpful for revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding
significance to our researches. We have taken them into a careful consideration and
have made correction which we hope meet with approval. Revised portions are
marked in red in the manuscript. The main changes in the paper and responds to the
reviewer’s comments are as following.

Responds to the reviewers’ comments:
Reviewer #1:
1. Response to Reviewer comment No.1: The most important issue to be corrected
deals with an important conceptual error in the field of Chemical Kinetics and Reactor
Design. On page 20, it is said "The positive deltaH values indicate that the
esterification was endothermic (TRUE), such that increasing the temperature
increased the esterification rate (COMPLETELY FALSE)". For endothermic
reversible reactions, an increase on temperature leads to an increase in the equilibrium
conversion but not the reaction rate with what it is reached. It could it but not
necessarily. One thing is the thermodynamics and other is the kinetics, which has
nothing to do with the thermodynamics.
[Responses] Thank you for your valuable and thoughtful comments.
As suggested by the reviewer, the reaction rate was different from the
esterification rate, which mentioned in this paper was equivalent to rosin conversion.
The esterification of rosin was endothermic reversible, an increase on temperature
leads to an increase in the equilibrium conversion, and an increase in the rosin
conversion was reached. Nevertheless, esterification rate can be easily confused with
reaction rate, as a result of it, we have used rosin conversion instead of esterification
rate in pages 8, 16-17 and 21 in the revised manuscript.
Special thanks to you for your good comments.
2. Response to Reviewer comment No.2: The other comment to be considered is
related with the introduction. In the open literature, it can be found that esterificaion
of rosin acids can be also performed with lipase (Lin. R. et al., BioMed Research
International, DOI 10.1155/2014/647068) and with ion exchange resins (Patent,
US20090056201 A1). These kind of catalyst should be also quoted in the
introduction.
[Responses] Thanks for your comment.
We have added the details in lines 75-76 of page 4, in the introduction of the
revised manuscript.
Reviewer #2:
1. Response to Reviewer comment No.1: Page 2. Abstracts Section. In lines 28-30, it
is said “It was found that the esterification kinetics was a pseudo first-order reaction,
and the reaction enthalpy and entropy were calculated using the Arrhenius-Polanyi
equation”. In this point (and regrettably after in pages 13-14, and 19-20) the authors
explain that they use the Arrhenius-Polanyi equation to find the thermodynamic
parameters of the reaction. In my opinion the authors refer to the Eyring-Polanyi
equation (see Chapter 2-6 Prediction of Reaction Rates-Theories of Kinetics, in
“Chemical Engineering Kinetics” by J.M. Smith, 1981, McGraw-Hill). This equation
allows to estimate the enthalpy and entropy changes of formation of the activated
complex of the reaction, not the enthalpy and entropy changes of the reaction. The last
parameters can be estimated only from the values of the equilibrium constant of the
reaction at several temperatures.
[Responses] Thanks for your comment.
We apologize for our negligence. We confused the enthalpy of activation with
the enthalpy of reaction. The enthalpy of activation was the energy required for the
reactants to form an activate state complex, which was different from the enthalpy of
reaction. The entropy of activation and the entropy of reaction were also similar. And
we have already modified it in pages 2, 14 and 20-21 in the revised manuscript.
Special thanks to you for your good comments.
2. Response to Reviewer comment No.2: In the section 2.1 Materials, the authors
should explain the properties of the ZnO used as catalyst in some experiments
(manufacturer, purity, surface properties, etc)
[Responses] Thanks for your comment.
We have added the properties of catalyst ZnO in section 2.1, lines 107-109 of
page 6, and in the revised manuscript.
3. Response to Reviewer comment No.3: In page 6, 2.2 Experimental setup and
procedure section, the authors explain that they use a 2-m3 stainless steel autoclave.
However in the captions of figures 4 and 5 it is said that the charge of rosin was 800 g.
On the basis of the rosin mass it seems that the reactor volume is probably 2-L. Is it
so?
[Responses] Thank you for your careful work.
We apologize for our negligence. We used a 2-L stainless steel autoclave, not a
2-m3. We had revised it in section 2.2, page 6, and in the revised manuscript.
Special thanks to you for your good comments.
4. Response to Reviewer comment No.4: The description of the products obtained
are necessary. With glycerol different esters can be formed: monoester (two different),
di-ester (two different), and the tri-ester. In addition, later the authors admit the
possible formation of decarboxylation products. It would be good that authors explain
with detail of products obtained and add to the paper a reaction scheme to follow the
reaction chemistry.
[Responses] Thank you for your comment.
As suggested by the reviewer, the description of products and a reaction scheme
were added in section 3.3, lines 356-358 of page 18, and in the revised manuscript as
follows:
The carboxylic group of resin acids can be combined with hydroxyl groups of
glycerol to produce rosin ester, including monoesters, diesters and triesters
(GPC-HPLC) (Fig. 4). In addition, a high reaction temperature can lead to some
decarboxylation, as shown in Fig. 4.
Fig. 4 The reaction scheme of esterification and decarboxylation of resin acids
5. Response to Reviewer comment No.5: In page 9, line 166, it is said that triplicate
experiments were carried out. However the authors do not mention the experimental
error of data of Table 1 (for example). The authors should report the experimental
error of all data.
[Responses] Thanks for your comment.
We have added the data error of triplicate experiments in Table 1 in the revised
manuscript.

6. Response to Reviewer comment No.6: In page 10, line 187, it is said “Here, Fik is
the fractional fugacity coefficient of component i in the k-phase (MPa)”. However,
such symbol does not appear in equations 2 and 3.
[Responses] Thanks for your comment.
“Fik” has been instead of “ <U+F06A> Vi ” and such symbol did appear in Eqs. (2) and (4),
page 10, in the revised manuscript.
7. Response to Reviewer comment No.7: In equation 12, page 12, there is a left
bracket that has to be erased.
[Responses] Thank you for your careful work.
We have erased the left bracket in Eq. (12), page 12, in the revised manuscript.
8. Response to Reviewer comment No.8: In page 13, lines 250-252, it is said “The
present work used a stoichiometric excess of glycerol in the reaction mixtures, and
thus the concentration of glycerol can be considered to be constant in the kinetic
model for the esterification”. But in page 8 it is explained that the used
rosin-to-glycerol molar ratio was between 1.25 and 1.75. Why then the authors say
that there is an excess of glycerol?
[Responses] Thanks for your comment.
There is 1 mol carboxyl group with 1 mol rosin, however, there are 3 mol
hydroxyl group with1 mol glycerol. When rosin-to-glycerol molar ratio was between
1.25 and 1.75, that was, carboxyl and hydroxyl group molar ratio was 1: 3.75 to 5.25.
Therefore, there was an excess of glycerol.
9. Response to Reviewer comment No.9: As shown in table 3, homogeneous
reaction in the absence of ZnO and CO2 is very noticeable. The authors should explain
why they does not have used a model taking into account the two contributions: with
and without catalyst.
[Responses] Thank you for your careful work.
<U+2460>At present, a homogeneous catalyst ZnO dissolved in esterification reaction
system was widely used for preparing rosin ester, which was difficult to separate from
the product. This work used super/sub critical CO2-enrichied HTLW catalyst to
replace a traditional ZnO catalyst as green acidic catalyst to enhance the esterification
of rosin, and an enhanced esterification yield of 94.74% was achieved. Therefore, we
have not used a model taking into account the contributions of traditional catalyst
ZnO.
<U+2461>Obviously, it is more meaningful to discusse the kinetics of green catalytic
conversion of rosin to glycerol esters using super/sub critical CO2-enrichied HTLW
catalyst. This manuscript has discussed in detail the kinetics of esterification reactions
with and without CO2 addition. Similarly, in order to examine the effect of super/sub
critical CO2 on acid-catalyzed reaction, Christian et al. (From plant materials to
ethanol by means of supercritical fluid technology, The Journal of Supercritical
Fluids, 2008), and Hunter and Savage (Quantifying rate enhancements for acid
catalysis in CO2-enriched high-temperature water, AIChE journal, 2008), only
discussed kinetic models with and without CO2 addition, without discussing the
kinetics of conventional catalysts.
<U+2462>As suggested by the reviewer, in order to make this manuscript more scientific
and rigorous, we have added the corresponding explain in section 2.6, lines 242-244
of page 13 in the revised manuscript.
10. Response to Reviewer comment No.10: In my first query I have explained that
in my opinion the use of equation 17 to determine the thermodynamic parameters of
the reaction is wrong. However, I have to point out that following the Eyring-Polanyi
theory, equation 17 is wrong. In the term ln(kb/h) the temperature is missing. The
correct expression for the term is ln(kbT<U+03B3>A <U+03B3>B/h). <U+03B3>A and <U+03B3>B are the activity coefficients
of reactants A and B.
[Responses] Thank you for your careful work.
<U+2460>The answer to the use of equation 17 to determine the thermodynamic
parameters of the reaction has been replied in the first query of reviewer #2 and
revised in pages 2, 14 and 20-21 in the revised manuscript.
<U+2461>Equation 17 is equal to Eyring-Polanyi equation. In order to calculate <U+2206>S and
<U+2206>H, we made an equivalent mathematic deformation of Eyring-Polanyi equation that
moved the temperature term to the other side, obtaining equation 17. In recent years,
using Eyring-Polanyi equation to estimate the enthalpy and entropy changes of
formation of the activated complex of the reaction has been reported in the literatures
(Encinar JM, Pardal A, Sánchez N. 2016 An improvement to the transesterification
process by the use of co-solvents to produce biodiesel. Fuel 166, 51-58; Sarve AN,
Varma MN, Sonawane SS. 2016 Ultrasound assisted two-stage biodiesel synthesis
from non-edible Schleichera triguga oil using heterogeneous catalyst: Kinetics and
thermodynamic analysis. Ultrason. Sonochem. 29, 288-298; Petrou AL, Terzidaki A.
2014 Calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate precipitation, crystallization and
dissolution: Evidence for the activated steps and the mechanisms from the enthalpy
and entropy of activation values. Chem. Geol. 381, 144-153; etc). Therefore, in the
term ln(kb/h) the temperature is not missing. The detailed deformation process is as
follows:
Eyring-Polanyi Eq. (1) is obtained from the Eyring-Polanyi theory (see Chapter
2-6 Prediction of Reaction Rates-Theories of Kinetics, in “Chemical Engineering
Kinetics” by J.M. Smith, 1981, McGraw-Hill).
k BT <U+F044>S <U+F02A> / Rg <U+F02D><U+F044>H <U+F02A> / Rg T
k<U+F03D> <U+F067> A<U+F067> B e
h (1)
Moving T from the right to the left, thus the logarithmic form of Eq. (1) is
k kB <U+F044>S <U+F02A> <U+F044>H <U+F02A>
ln( ) <U+F03D> ln( <U+F067> A <U+F067> B ) <U+F02B> <U+F02D>
T h Rg RgT
When the activity coefficient of reactants is approximately equal to 1, the
expression of ln(kb/h) is correct, because the function ln(k/T) ~ 1/T eliminates the
effect of temperature in the term ln (kb/h ).
11. Response to Reviewer comment No.11: The authors use esterification rate
instead of rosin conversion. It is dangerous because it can be confused with reaction
rate. In my opinion, the authors should change esterification rate by rosin conversion.
[Responses] Thank you for your careful review and correction.
We have used rosin conversion instead of esterification rate in pages 8, 16-17
and 21 in the revised manuscript.
12. Response to Reviewer comment No.12: In line 338, page 17, the authors say that
“The esterification reaction is typically restricted by the chemical reaction
equilibrium”. Why then the authors do not use a kinetic model including the term of
the reverse reaction?
[Responses] Thanks for your comment.
Considering that esterification was a reversible reaction, to break the limit of
chemical equilibrium, firstly, water was continually released for a fixed period of time;
besides, CO2 consumed the water to form carbonic acid; finally, an excess of glycerol
was added. As a result, an enhanced esterification yield of 94.74% was achieved. It
can be seen that the effect of reversible reaction was small, so we did not use a kinetic
model including the term of the reverse reaction. Similarly, Ma et al. (Biodiesel
production via transesterification of soybean oil using acid catalyst in CO2 expanded
methanol liquids. Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research, 2012.) used an
excess of alcohol to drive the equilibrium toward products, and Dong et al. (Adiabatic
Correction for the Esterification of Acetic Anhydride by Methanol via Accurate
Kinetics, Chinese Journal of Chemical Engineering. 2007) is not considered of
reversible reactions in the esterification of acetic anhydride. As suggested by the
reviewer, in order to make this manuscript more scientific and rigorous, we have
added the corresponding explain in lines 345-347 of page 18 in the revised
manuscript.
13. Response to Reviewer comment No.13: In the same paragraph, the authors says
“The presence of the super/sub critical CO2-enrichied HTLW catalyst overcomes this
limitation, thus improving the conversion and the reaction rate (Fig. 6)”. A catalyst
allows reaching faster the equilibrium position but it does not change the equilibrium
position.
[Responses] Thank you for your careful work.
As suggested by reviewer, a general catalyst allows reaching faster the
equilibrium position but it does not change the equilibrium position. However, in this
work, owing to the presence of super/sub critical CO2-enrichied HTLW catalyst, CO2
will consumes the water to form carbonic acid to promote the reaction to move
forward. Inappropriate description has been corrected in lines 347-350 of page 18 in
the revised manuscript.
14. Response to Reviewer comment No.14: In line 343, the authors says that rosin is
not miscible with glycerol. As a consequence, the reactor has two phases. In such
reactor, is equation 15 actually describing the reaction rate data? Concentrations used
in reaction 15 are those in glycerol-phase or those in rosin phase? How was estimated
the volume of reaction?
[Responses] Thanks for your comment.
Equation 15 was actually described the reaction rate data. Under the conditions
of mechanical stirring (stirring speed 600 rpm) and super/sub critical CO2, the
reaction system was pseudo-homogeneous with no boundary between glycerol and
rosin phase. The concentration used in establishing the kinetic model was the one in
pseudo-homogeneous phase, not a single glycerol or rosin phase. We determined the
amount of rosin by GPC (gel permeation chromatography) analysis. The literatures
(Ladero M, de Gracia M, Tamayo JJ, de Ahumada IL, Trujillo F, Garcia-Ochoa F.
2011 Kinetic modelling of the esterification of rosin and glycerol: Application to
industrial operation. Chem. Eng. J. 169, 319-328; Ladero M, de Gracia M, Trujillo F,
Garcia-Ochoa F. 2012 Phenomenological kinetic modelling of the esterification of
rosin and polyols. Chem. Eng. J. 197, 387-397.) have been reported to estimated the
volume of reaction.
15. Response to Reviewer comment No.15: In lines 355 and 361, the authors refer to
rate constant K. The rate constant are usually represented by k (lower case). This
mistake appears in other places of the paper. Please, correct.
[Responses] Thank you for your careful review and correction.
We are so sorry for this negligence. It has been corrected in line 261 of page 14,
line 365 of page 18, line 370 of page 19 in the revised manuscript.
16. Response to Reviewer comment No.16: In page 20, lines 388-390, it is said “The
positive <U+2206>H values indicate that the esterification was endothermic, such that
increasing the temperature increased the esterification rate”. Actually, the formation of
the activation complex is endothermic. The estimated value is the enthalpy of
formation of the activation complex, not the enthalpy of reaction. Esterification
reactions, endothermic or exothermic, have an enthalpy of reaction close to zero.
[Responses] Thank you for your careful review and correction.
The answer to the enthalpy of formation of the activation complex and the
enthalpy of reaction has been replied in the first query of reviewer #2 and revised in
lines 398-400 of pages 20 in the revised manuscript.
17. Response to Reviewer comment No.17: In tables 5 and 6, the error of Ea, <U+2206>H,
<U+2206>S and <U+2206>G should be quoted.
[Responses] Thanks for your comment.
We have added the errors of Ea, <U+0394>H, <U+0394>S, and <U+0394>G in Table 5 in the revised
manuscript.

Appendix C
Revision of Manuscript RSOS-171031
Most of reviewers’ suggestions have been accepted and the quality of the paper is
substantially enhanced. However, there are some points that the authors have to consider.
These points are the following.
Major points:
1. The authors say in a number of places that the thermodynamics of the reaction is
examined (e.g. last line of page 5; Caption of section 3.4: Analysis of thermodynamics;
discussion contained in lines 396-409), and then they explain the conclusions drawn
from the Eyring-Polanyi equation. Most explanations are confusing, and the authors
should do their best to avoid the following confusing idea for readers: the
thermodynamics of the formation of the activated complex is not the thermodynamics
of the reaction. Therefore, the fact that the formation of the activated complex be
endothermic does not imply that the esterification reaction be endothermic. The
authors explain that the formation of the activation complex is endothermic (right, in
agreement with their data), but they does not prove that the reaction be endothermic
(this requires the study of the equilibrium constant of the reaction with temperature,
which is not carried out by the authors). To sum up, the authors have to be extremely
careful in the explanation of section 3.4 (rewrite it paying attention to the underlying
concepts to avoid confusion to readers), and make clear that the thermodynamics of
the reaction has not been studied
2. Throughout the paper, the authors talk about resin esters and rosin esters. It gives the
impression that both things are the same. If it is so, please make an effort to refer it
with the same expression (resin or rosin esters). If not, explain clearly the difference.
3. In Table 5 and 6 the different magnitudes are expressed with their experimental error
(GOOD), but in a number of places they do not have the correct number of significant
places. For example, Ea (kJ/mol) for k1 is Table 5 is quoted as 62.45 ± 0.779, but the
correct way of quoting it is 62.5 ± 0.8 (or 62.45 ± 0.78); in Table 6 <U+2206>S (kJ/K·mol) is
quoted as -0.17 ± 0.0015 for experiments without CO2, but the correct way is – 0.170 ±
0.002 (or – 0.1700 ± 0.0015). Tables 5 and 6 had be rewritten using the right number
of significant places. Finally, units of <U+2206>S are kJ/K·mol
Minor points
1. Line 261, page 14, k0 is the rate constant, k is an apparent rate constant
2. Lines 262 and 263, spell correctly concentrations
3. Line 281, equation 19 is a polynomial equation (not a binomial equation)

Responds to the reviewers’ comments:
Reviewer #1:
1. Response to Reviewer comment No.1: I do not see thermodynamis properties of
the activater transition state has been calculated. What is their application and
purpose?
[Responses] Thank you for your valuable and thoughtful comments.
(1) We have calculated the thermodynamics properties of the formation of the
activated complex using the Eyring-Polanyi equation, the results as shown in Table 6
in the manuscript.
(2) We can know the thermodynamics properties from the reactants to the
transition state. Moreover, the <U+2206>H without CO2 addition is greater than that with CO2
addition, and it is compensated by the more activation energy for the formation of the
activated complex, indicating the CO2-enriched HTLW can be an effective acid
catalyst.
2. Response to Reviewer comment No.2: Authros said the system is non ideal. The,
why they use concentration instead of activities?.
[Responses] Thank you for your comments.
(1) In section 2.5 of the manuscript concerns the issue of gas-liquid equilibrium,
which is a question of thermodynamics related to an ideal or non-ideal solution
(Kirkwood JG. Oppenheim I. 1961 Chemical thermodynamics. McGraw-Hill.).
However, the solubility of CO2 in water is small (Crovetto R. 1991 Evaluation of
solubility data of the system CO2-H2O from 273 K to the critical point of water. J.
Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 20, 575-589.) under reaction conditions, and the liquid phase
can be considered to represent an infinitely dilute solution, such that the CO2 activity
coefficient can be approximated as 1.
(2) In sections 2.6 and 3.3 of the manuscript, the rosin concentration is used to
calculate the rate of the esterification reaction. The conversion rate per unit volume,
J/V, is called the rate of reaction r (Levine I.N. 2003 Physical chemistry. Fifth ed.,
McGraw-Hill.):
J 1 <U+F0E6> 1 dn A <U+F0F6>
r<U+F0BA> <U+F03D> <U+F0E7><U+F02D> <U+F0F7>
V V <U+F0E8> a dt <U+F0F8>
When V is essentially constant,we have (1/V)(dnA/dt) = d(nA/V)/dt = dCA/dt =
d[A]/dt, where CA=[A] is the molar concentration. Thus, The rate equation of the
esterification reaction is:
dC R
r<U+F03D><U+F02D> <U+F03D> k 0C R<U+F061> CG <U+F062>
dt
In fact, the calculation of the rate equation has nothing to do with the ideal or
non-ideal system. Therefore, we used rosin concentration instead of activities.
3. Response to Reviewer comment No.3: Glycerol is, effectively in excess, but it is
not enough to be considered constant for kinetic analysis.
[Responses] Thank you for your comments.
(1) Ladero et al. [Ladero M, de Gracia M, Trujillo F, Garcia-Ochoa F. 2012
Phenomenological kinetic modelling of the esterification of rosin and polyols. Chem.
Eng. J. 197, 387-397.] found that the rosin-glycerol system evolved from a biphasic
system to a monophasic one, and glycerol solubility in rosin sharply increased from
0.05 to 0.45 mol L-1 when temperature increased from 240 <U+2103> to 260 <U+2103>. At higher
temperatures, glycerol solubility is constant with increasing temperature and equal to
0.45 mol L-1, probably due to the fact that the boiling point of glycerol at atmospheric
pressure is 292 <U+2103>. Moreover, the solubility of glycerol in the mixture of rosin and
rosin triglyceride can be similar.
(2) For a example, the concentration of remaining glycerol was calculated
according to the RSM optimization results of 3.9 MPa CO2 pressure, a
rosin-to-glycerol molar ratio of 1.32 and 269 <U+2103> as follow.
Initial material Reaction Remaining
material
C0/(mol L-1) Ct /(mol L-1) CR /(mol L-1)
rosin 3.20 3.05 0.15
glycerol 2.42 1.02 1.40
*Reaction volume V= the total mass of rosin glyceride/ the density of rosin glyceride
=675.0/1.09=619.27 cm3
Therefore, when the reaction is over, the concentration of glycerol is greater than
0.45 mol L-1, and it is enough to be considered constant for kinetic analysis. The same
applies to other rosin-to-glycerol molar ratio.
Reviewer #2:
Major points
1.Response to Reviewer comment No.1: The authors say in a number of places that
the thermodynamics of the reaction is examined (e.g. last line of page 5; Caption of
section 3.4: Analysis of thermodynamics;discussion contained in lines 396-409), and
then they explain the conclusions drawn from the Eyring-Polanyi equation. Most
explanations are confusing, and the authors should do their best to avoid the following
confusing idea for readers: the thermodynamics of the formation of the activated
complex is not the thermodynamics of the reaction. Therefore, the fact that the
formation of the activated complex be endothermic does not imply that the
esterification reaction be endothermic. The authors explain that the formation of the
activation complex is endothermic (right, in agreement with their data), but they does
not prove that the reaction be endothermic(this requires the study of the equilibrium
constant of the reaction with temperature,which is not carried out by the authors). To
sum up, the authors have to be extremely careful in the explanation of section 3.4
(rewrite it paying attention to the underlying concepts to avoid confusion to readers),
and make clear that the thermodynamics of the reaction has not been studied.
[Responses] Thank you for your valuable and thoughtful comments.
We had rewrote it in section 3.4 in the revised manuscript.
Special thanks to you for your good comments.
2. Response to Reviewer comment No.2: Throughout the paper, the authors talk
about resin esters and rosin esters. It gives the impression that both things are the
same. If it is so, please make an effort to refer it with the same expression (resin or
rosin esters). If not, explain clearly the difference.
[Responses] Thanks for your comment.
(1) Resin acids are the main chemical constituents of rosin, accounting for
approximately 85.63% to 88.72%. The esterification reaction between rosin and
glycerol is the esterification reaction of resin acids and glycerol, and the rosin esters
are the same as the resin esters.
(2) As suggested by the reviewer, in order to make this manuscript more
scientific and rigorous, we should make an effort to refer it with the same expression
(resin or rosin esters), so we used rosin esters as a substitute in the revised manuscript.
Therefore, We used the heading of “A novel acid catalyst based on super/sub
critical CO2-water for the efficient esterification of rosin” instead of “A novel acid
catalyst based on super/sub critical CO2-water for the efficient esterification of
resin acids”.
3. Response to Reviewer comment No.3: In Table 5 and 6 the different magnitudes
are expressed with their experimental error(GOOD), but in a number of places they do
not have the correct number of significant places. For example, Ea (kJ/mol) for k1 is
Table 5 is quoted as 62.45 ± 0.779, but the correct way of quoting it is 62.5 ± 0.8 (or
62.45 ± 0.78); in Table 6 S (kJ/Kmol) is quoted as -0.17 ± 0.0015 for experiments
without CO2, but the correct way is – 0.170 ±0.002 (or – 0.1700 ± 0.0015). Tables 5
and 6 had be rewritten using the right number of significant places. Finally, units of S
are kJ/Kmol.
[Responses] Thank you for your careful review and correction.
We had revised it in Tables 5 and 6.
