Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
I am very happy with the careful revision that was done in order to incorporate all my previous
comments; so I have only a few rather minor comments remaining.
I very much appreciate the cautious interpretation that is made throughout the Discussion
section. Would it be possible to add another 1-2 sentences addressing the problem of uncertainty
whether the current findings will generalize to other populations (possibly referring to the Byers
2011 Anim Behav paper that I mentioned previously for a more detailed discussion of the
problem)?
Throughout the Results section: Please ensure that for all non-significant results we not only get
to see a p-value but also some measure of the direction of the trend which would facilitate use in
a meta-analysis (unless p=1). For instance one could report mean values for each of the two
subspecies, which would clarify the direction of the trend without having to call this a ‘trend’
(because some readers are opposed to using the term ‘trend’ for effects that come with clearly
non-significant p-values).
Minor comments line by line:
1. Line 87: “wild”: do you mean “wild and recently wild-derived”?
2. Line 176: “preened”: I have never noticed preening as part of the courtship dance. I guess that
you are not referring to the typical preening behavior where male and female sit in body contact
often for several minutes and allopreen.
3. Line 209: “unique”: The wording is unclear to me. Do you mean that thresholds were manually
chosen once for every individual (thereby different thresholds for each individual)?
4. Line 247: “generalized”: This term is widely used for non-Gaussian models (e.g. Poisson), but I
guess you fitted a Gaussian model.
5. Lines 283-285 and elsewhere: If I remember PCA correctly, then the ‘loadings’ are the
correlations (-1<r<+1) between the original variables and the PC. So for instance if all variables
would have the same strong positive loading of r=+0.90, then the mean r-squared would be 0.81,
meaning that PC1 explains 81% of the total variance. The numbers that are given here (loadings
of 0.23 to 0.3) do not seem to fit with the notion that PC1 explains 86.5% of the variance. Can you
clarify where this discrepancy with my expectations comes from? Is it that the loadings are
calculated differently, or is it that PC1 explains 86.5%, PC2 explains 13.5%, and PC3 to PC13 all
get rejected due to their eigenvalues being <1 and therefore are not entered in the calculation? If
the latter is true, then I find this highly misleading because then it would not be the proportion of
total variance “in the song data”.
6. Line 299: Change to “In a group of 6 TGC and 6 TGG finches…”
7. Line 301: Report two medians or means rather than just one.

The paper compares subspecies of zebra finch in how variable songs are within population. Both
domesticated and a wild-derived population of the subspecies Taeniopygia guttata castanotis
(TGC) were analyzed and the much more recently captivated taeniopygia guttata guttata (TGG,
Timor) finches. In domesticated TGC, song diversity was highest, whereas in TGG diversity was
lowest and the wild-derived TGC population was intermediate.
Birds of the two subspecies were also cross-fostered with Bengalese finches, resulting in a similar
pattern: TGC more variable than TGG. This indicates that the origin in variation likely has a
genetic component.
These findings are highly relevant as it gives insight in the evolution of vocalizations, the relation
between genetic and cultural evolution and their effect on learning mechanisms.
I have seen this manuscript before and my earlier concerns have been adequately dealt with: 1)
the potential unequal amount of directed and undirected song in the populations have been
measured and turns out to be equal. 2) The statistics have been adjusted and p-values now match
more what I would expect based on the graphs.
All other questions have been answered satisfactory as well.
I only have some minor questions and comments.
-Statistics: I appreciate the work done to improve the statistics. I don't know enough about
bayesian statistics to see if the current statistics are appropriate and I don't understand the
singularity issue. I 'm also not sure if the lmer nesting is implemented correctly. I would expect
something like 1|bird/pair (where pair is each (average) comparison between 2 individuals).
Then you would need one extra column with individual label in added to the file now on github
if I'm correct. I'm not sure if the current way of nesting you use could also be correct so please
verify with a statistician.
That being said, I think the p-values make sense given the graphs so I don't expect very different
results.

-Is it possible a data point is missing from the data file? I thought there should be 1 or more
comparison in Chicago?
-Reviewer 1 asked a question about syllable duration, which reminded me that actually previous
cross-fostering experiments with Bengalese showed gap duration is one of the features that seem
to be experience independent as well as phrase length (see Araki et al., 2016, clayton et al., 89).
How do your results relate to those studies?
