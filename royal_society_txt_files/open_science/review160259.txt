In this work the authors investigate the role of language as a tool to achieve coordination among
a social group and the implications this has for language evolution and the establishment of large
social groups. The authors build on a model previously established in Ref 4 (the citation for
which, incidentally, is missing the article number), the main innovation being an investigation of
optimal strategies in the group coordination problem, and the evolutionary dynamics that results
from it. The authors use this model to provide support for a number of claims about the evolution
of language. The most important of these, in my view, is that the coordination of behaviour
within a social group has distinctive features that set it apart from other types of "cooperative"
behaviour (such as the production of public goods), and is consequently less susceptible to an
instability whereby individual agents can maximise their payoff by benefiting from the presence
of the public good without paying the cost incurred in generating it. This is because the degree of
coordination achieved has an effect on the benefit that is gained, and that an individual with a
cheap strategy can - under certain conditions - incur a substantial cost by reducing the overall
degree of coordination. The authors furthermore claim that this view of language as a
coordination device facilitates an increase in social group size, and leads to a slow rate of
language evolution.
I found this manuscript to be clearly written in the main, and overall I felt it to be a thought-
provoking piece of work. Furthermore, the details of the model were set out cleanly, and it was
straightforward for me to understand the results that were obtained. Nevertheless, although I
share many of the same intuitions as the authors about the nature and evolution of linguistic
behaviour in humans, I felt some disconnects between the model set-up and the motivational
background presented; and I was further unsure as to whether the results obtained fully justified
the four main claims made in the concluding section of this paper. I elucidate on these points
below. These misgivings lead me to feel that the manuscript is not yet ready for publication as it
is currently presented, but with some additional discussion and/or reworking of the existing text,
a resubmission to RSOS might well be appropriate.
My detailed comments are as follows:
1. In the second paragraph, the authors state that language evolving as a side-effect of some
unrelated trait implies a rapid emergence of language, whilst unique preconditions would lead to
a slow emergence. I do not understand how the authors infer a rate of emergence from way in
which it initially appeared. For example, language could be some kind of "mutation" that is hard
to arrive at (explanation 2) but has a high selective advantage. What am I missing that rules out
this possibility?
2. In the introduction and elsewhere in the paper, the authors make an important distinction
between models where there is a direct benefit (or avoidance of a punishment cost) for engaging
in an otherwise costly behaviour, and those where the benefit comes from the fact that the rest of
the social group is engaging in this behaviour. In the former case, a cooperative state is not
susceptible to free-riders, whilst in the latter case it is. The authors appear to give the impression
that their model falls into the latter class, for example through the phrase "Thus, this model poses
a classic public goods problem: ..." in the introduction, repeated as "[language] poses a classic
free-rider problem". The model presented in this work manifestly removes the public-
goods/free-rider instability by including a direct benefit for coordinating: the second term in (13)
directly punishes a poor coordination strategy. The presence of this feature is also highlighted on
page 3, where it states that "each agent's payoff is modified by two costs: her [...] distance from
3
everyone [else] at the end of the synchronisation process, and ...". It seems to me that the crucial
feature of coordination is that the payoff to each individual depends on how well coordination is
achieved overall, and that an expensive strategy can have a direct benefit by virtue of facilitating
better coordination. Since the authors seem keen to argue that coordination is different to trading
information, it would make sense to be clear about how this leads to a different kind of
evolutionary game (i.e., one that can have a direct benefit for participating, and is not necessarily
susceptible to freeriding) rather than being another solution to the public goods problem (of
which there are already so many that I find myself wondering why people still regard this as a
problem).
3. In fact, I am not sure why the authors include the second term in (13) at all, i.e., the one that
directly punishes individual poor performance on the task. There are two reasons. First, its
presence does not seem necessary to for costlier coordination strategies to spontaneously evolve:
even without this term, there can be a disbenefit to adopting a cheaper strategy than the rest of
the population since that will lead to a lower degree of coordination and a fitness cost as a
consequence. The second reason is that it is not clear to me what the mechanism for such
individual punishment would be: the authors seem to be silent on this. For example, if the
purpose of coordination were to ward off predators, one would need to argue that those agents
who coordinate less well are more likely to be attacked. It is not clear to me that this would be a
feature of every coordination problem, whereas the fact that better coordination leads to a better
outcome for the group sounds like a reasonable generic assumption to make. Also the results
suggest that many of the phenomena reported still occur if alpha=0 (one still has a transition of
the optimal epsilon going from below to above the group value in Fig 1 for example). This leads
me to wonder how necessary positive alpha is (as assumed in most of the text) to reach the same
conclusions, and if it is not necessary, whether perhaps having it there in fact obscures the most
fundamental reason for the emergence of costly communicative behaviour. The authors state on
p7 that "alpha=0 implies that there would be a conflict of interests between the group and the
noise level. In this case, the model simplifies to the classic tragedy of commons case." but it is not
clear (eg from Fig 1) that this is actually true. It might be that the cost B would need to be much
smaller than the benefit H for language to emerge, but this would be compatible with the fact that
language is rarely observed in nature.
4. I think there is a typo in Eq (4), and that the B on the lhs should be phi_j.
5. On p5, the parameter epsilon_i is referred to as noise. I don't think this is noise in the strictest
sense, as it appears to be a deterministic perturbation on agent i's reading of another agent's
compass direction. In other words, if my epsilon is 10 degrees, then I will always read your
compass direction as 10 degrees larger than it actually is. The term "noise" suggests that this
perturbation should be random, when it is not. Personally, I think a model where epsilon is
drawn from a distribution whose width is inverse to the cost of the strategy would feel more
natural: after all in this model, if one knows what the systematic error is, one can easily correct for
it and recover the original signal. With real noise, this would not be possible.
6. In Eq (7) one should surely apply the same minimum image convention as expressed in Eq (4),
in other words, the distance between two phi variables should correspond to the shorter arc that
separates the two points on the circumference of the unit circle. I trust that was done in the
simulation, as otherwise there would be artifacts arising from values of phi near 0 or 360 degrees
which the authors seemed keen (rightly) to avoid.
7. On p10, the authors show that a population with better strategies can achieve coordination in
larger groups. They then seem to argue that the existence of good communication strategies will
then lead to bigger social groups. I don't see anything in the model (or the discussion) that
4
provides a mechanism by which the group size would naturally increase to the maximum size at
which a positive payoff from coordination would still be achieved. They should comment on this.
8. Also on p10, the authors make the interesting observation that "even if it is optimal for the
individual to improve precision, it is suboptimal to be much better than the rest of the group". I
could not point to the specific component of the model that was responsible for this effect. Can
the authors elucidate here?
9. The above points bear on each of the "novel conclusions" set out on p12, so some finessing of
these may be necessary. The first is the idea that the primary function of language is coordination,
whilst exchange of information is secondary. One might argue that information exchange is
necessary to achieve coordination in the first place. Perhaps there is some subtlety in the word
"exchange" that I am missing. Second, as already mentioned, the model includes two sources of
punishment arising from coordination, one of which seems more artificial to me than the other.
Third, as noted in point 7 above, I do not see any direct reason why a larger n_max should cause
social groups to grow. Finally, the speed of language evolution seems to rely on the observation
noted in point 8, which is not at present fully explained.

Appendix A
Using a simple modification of a model they have previously developed, the authors study the evo-
lution of language as a public good: accurate communication is individually costly, but has a group
benefit (shared equally) and an individual benefit. Sensibly, they find that accuracy evolves most
easily when the individual benefit is sufficiently large relative to the cost, but that the evolution
of accuracy is slow because it is not individually beneficial to have much more accurate language
than everyone else in your group – that is, selection does not act immediately on accurately-
communicating “mutants”.
These points are straightforward, but worth making, and the model employed is a good one with
which to make them. My only concerns about the paper concern the exposition. As I detail below,
the simplicity of the model is obscured by the authors’ unnecessary use of technical mathematical
expressions. This is not to say that precision should be compromised, but, for example, the sim-
ple description “an agent updates her direction to midway between her current direction and the
perceived direction of her interactant” is identical to the mathematically verbose and difficult-to-
parse expressions in equations (3) and (4). Rewritten in a clearer fashion, I would be happy to
recommend the paper for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Minor points
• A connected k-regular graph with n nodes can be described precisely and simply in words;
equation (1) is an unnecessary distraction that will confuse a non-mathematical audience
and irk a mathematical one.
• Equation (2) should include that the f0,i are independently and identically distributed. Also,
the subscripts in f0,i in the equation would be more immediately understandable if, in the
paragraph leading to it, “Thus all agents start with a random initial vector” were replaced
with “Thus, at time t = 0, each agent i starts with a random vector”
• Equations (3) and (4) can be replaced with the simple, equally-precise statement suggested
above. A figure showing the update step would also help. If the authors insist on keeping
the unnecessary expressions, they should note that there is an error in equation (4), in the
second and third lines: should be (fi + fj + 360o ) and (fi + fj - 360o ), I think. Also, the
second argument of f1 in equation (4) should be “fj ”, not “B”.
• A ‘meeting’ is an interaction between connected agents, with each pair of connected agents
equally likely to meet. Equation (5) is both an unnecessarily technical attempt to convey this,
and an imprecise one. The claimed distribution is U (1, . . . , n) ‘s.t. i 6= j, i <U+2208> ej , b <U+2208> ei ’ (note
typo in last part – should be j <U+2208> ei ), but this is not a sensible distribution. Pedantically, it
should be noted that {i, j} is not distributed (“~”) anyway, but is a realization of a random
variable with a distribution.
• What is ei ? It is called a “noise characteristic” on page 5, seems to have to be a positive
number in equation (10), but enters equation (6) in such a way that if agents i and j have
equal large values ei = ej , that’s as good for their subsequent coordination as if they had
equal small, or zero, values. For example, if fi = 10o , fj = 60o , and ei = ej = 30o , then
agent i perceives j’s direction as fj + ei = 90o and so updates to (10 + 90)/2 = 50o , while
agent j perceives i’s direction as fi + ej = 40o and so updates to (40 + 60)/2 = 50o . So
they’re perfectly coordinated after a single update, despite ei , ej > 0, just as they would have
been (though at a different position) if ei = ej = 0.
Why not just follow much of the signalling literature and say that the noise added to agent i’s
perception of j’s position is drawn from a normal distribution with mean zero and variance
e2i ?
• Page 6, line 53, typo: “to examine to individual’s” should be “to examine the individual’s”.
• Equations 15 and 16 are, again, unnecessary ways to describe a simple model. Each step,
the agent i with the lowest payoff is eliminated, and replaced with a new agent, still labelled
i. The new agent i’s value of ei is chosen using that of the highest-payoff agent from the
previous round (say j), by sampling from a uniform distribution on [(1 - <U+03B8>)ej , (1 + <U+03B8>)ej ].

Comments to the Author(s)
In this work the authors investigate the role of language as a tool to achieve
coordination among a social group and the implications this has for language
evolution and the establishment of large social groups. The authors build on a
model previously established in Ref 4 (the citation for which, incidentally, is
missing the article number), the main innovation being an investigation of
optimal strategies in the group coordination problem, and the evolutionary
dynamics that results from it. The authors use this model to provide support
for a number of claims about the evolution of language. The most important of
these, in my view, is that the coordination of behaviour within a social group
has distinctive features that set it apart from other types of "cooperative"
behaviour (such as the production of public goods), and is consequently less
susceptible to an instability whereby individual agents can maximise their
payoff by benefiting from the presence of the public good without paying the
cost incurred in generating it. This is because the degree of coordination
achieved has an effect on the benefit that is gained, and that an individual
with a cheap strategy can - under certain conditions - incur a substantial cost
by reducing the overall degree of coordination. The authors furthermore claim
that this view of language as a coordination device facilitates an increase in
social group size, and leads to a slow rate of language evolution.
I found this manuscript to be clearly written in the main, and overall I felt it to
be a thought-provoking piece of work. Furthermore, the details of the model
were set out cleanly, and it was straightforward for me to understand the
results that were obtained. Nevertheless, although I share many of the same
intuitions as the authors about the nature and evolution of linguistic behaviour
in humans, I felt some disconnects between the model set-up and the
motivational background presented; and I was further unsure as to whether
the results obtained fully justified the four main claims made in the concluding
section of this paper. I elucidate on these points below. These misgivings lead
me to feel that the manuscript is not yet ready for publication as it is currently
presented, but with some additional discussion and/or reworking of the
existing text, a resubmission to RSOS might well be appropriate.
[OUR COMMENT]
Thank you. We have made the text clearer, as suggested.
My detailed comments are as follows:
1. In the second paragraph, the authors state that language evolving as a
side-effect of some unrelated trait implies a rapid emergence of language,
whilst unique preconditions would lead to a slow emergence. I do not
understand how the authors infer a rate of emergence from way in which it
that is hard to arrive at (explanation 2) but has a high selective advantage.
What am I missing that rules out this possibility?
[OUR COMMENT]
We agree that the previous formulation did not provide enough explanations.
We have now added some additional explanatory points. Thank you for point
this out.
2. In the introduction and elsewhere in the paper, the authors make an
important distinction between models where there is a direct benefit (or
avoidance of a punishment cost) for engaging in an otherwise costly
behaviour, and those where the benefit comes from the fact that the rest of
the social group is engaging in this behaviour. In the former case, a
cooperative state is not susceptible to free-riders, whilst in the latter case it is.
The authors appear to give the impression that their model falls into the latter
class, for example through the phrase "Thus, this model poses a classic
public goods problem: ..." in the introduction, repeated as "[language] poses a
classic free-rider problem". The model presented in this work manifestly
removes the public-goods/free-rider instability by including a direct benefit for
coordinating: the second term in (13) directly punishes a poor coordination
strategy. The presence of this feature is also highlighted on page 3, where it
states that "each agent's payoff is modified by two costs: her [...] distance
from everyone [else] at the end of the synchronisation process, and ...". It
seems to me that the crucial feature of coordination is that the payoff to each
individual depends on how well coordination is achieved overall, and that an
expensive strategy can have a direct benefit by virtue of facilitating better
coordination. Since the authors seem keen to argue that coordination is
different to trading information, it would make sense to be clear about how this
leads to a different kind of evolutionary game (i.e., one that can have a direct
benefit for participating, and is not necessarily susceptible to freeriding) rather
than being another solution to the public goods problem (of which there are
already so many that I find myself wondering why people still regard this as a
problem).
[OUR COMMENT]
Thank you for this insightful comment. We fully agree, of course. We have
added a few explanatory sentences to the text that points out that language is
indeed a classic free rider problem when not in a coordination setting, but
naturally bypasses the problem within a coordination setting.
3. In fact, I am not sure why the authors include the second term in (13) at all,
i.e., the one that directly punishes individual poor performance on the task.
There are two reasons. First, its presence does not seem necessary to for
costlier coordination strategies to spontaneously evolve: even without this
term, there can be a disbenefit to adopting a cheaper strategy than the rest of
fitness cost as a consequence. The second reason is that it is not clear to me
what the mechanism for such individual punishment would be: the authors
seem to be silent on this. For example, if the purpose of coordination were to
ward off predators, one would need to argue that those agents who
coordinate less well are more likely to be attacked. It is not clear to me that
this would be a feature of every coordination problem, whereas the fact that
better coordination leads to a better outcome for the group sounds like a
reasonable generic assumption to make. Also the results suggest that many
of the phenomena reported still occur if alpha=0 (one still has a transition of
the optimal epsilon going from below to above the group value in Fig 1 for
example). This leads me to wonder how necessary positive alpha is (as
assumed in most of the text) to reach the same conclusions, and if it is not
necessary, whether perhaps having it there in fact obscures the most
fundamental reason for the emergence of costly communicative behaviour.
The authors state on p7 that "alpha=0 implies that there would be a conflict
of interests between the group and the noise level. In this case, the model
simplifies to the classic tragedy of commons case." but it is not clear (eg from
Fig 1) that this is actually true. It might be that the cost B would need to be
much smaller than the benefit H for language to emerge, but this would be
compatible with the fact that language is rarely observed in nature.
[OUR COMMENT]
The inclusion of the second term in (13) is the key to the model. Without it, the
model is merely a collective action setup in which there is either a motivation
to coordinate with others, or there is not. And thus, that way it would become
the standard collective action model with/or without free riding. The important
role of the second term in (13) is that it show that even if there is a seeming
space for free riding (i.e., beta is high enough), it is possible to have a solution
without a third party policing the actions of the individuals, simply due to the
fact that a deviation from the rest can carry a natural cost term for the
individuals. We have added a few sentences for clarification. Thank you for
pointing out the need for it.
Thank you for pointing out that the alpha=0 should be more a condition that
alpha is small relatively to beta. We have included a correction. Thank you
noticing this.
4. I think there is a typo in Eq (4), and that the B on the lhs should be phi_j.
[OUR COMMENT]
Thank you very much for spotting this. We have corrected it.
5. On p5, the parameter epsilon_i is referred to as noise. I don't think this is
noise in the strictest sense, as it appears to be a deterministic perturbation on
agent i's reading of another agent's compass direction. In other words, if my
degrees larger than it actually is. The term "noise" suggests that this
perturbation should be random, when it is not. Personally, I think a model
where epsilon is drawn from a distribution whose width is inverse to the cost
of the strategy would feel more natural: after all in this model, if one knows
what the systematic error is, one can easily correct for it and recover the
original signal. With real noise, this would not be possible.
[OUR COMMENT]
This was a write up mistake: in the simulations epsilon enters the decision
making problem as a random variable (exactly as you described it should be),
but in the write up of the model we, rather sloppily, for which we apologise, did
not make this explicit. Now it is mended. Thank you for noticing this and
raising this.
6. In Eq (7) one should surely apply the same minimum image convention as
expressed in Eq (4), in other words, the distance between two phi variables
should correspond to the shorter arc that separates the two points on the
circumference of the unit circle. I trust that was done in the simulation, as
otherwise there would be artifacts arising from values of phi near 0 or 360
degrees which the authors seemed keen (rightly) to avoid.
[OUR COMMENT]
Exactly. We have made it explicit in the text now. Thank you for pointing out
the need for this.
7. On p10, the authors show that a population with better strategies can
achieve coordination in larger groups. They then seem to argue that the
existence of good communication strategies will then lead to bigger social
groups. I don't see anything in the model (or the discussion) that provides a
mechanism by which the group size would naturally increase to the maximum
size at which a positive payoff from coordination would still be achieved. They
should comment on this.
[OUR COMMENT]
Thank you for the question. We have now included a more detailed discussion
about the kind of pressures that can lead to increased pressure towards
higher group sizes.
8. Also on p10, the authors make the interesting observation that "even if it
is optimal for the individual to improve precision, it is suboptimal to be
much better than the rest of the group". I could not point to the specific
component of the model that was responsible for this effect. Can the authors
elucidate here?
This is one of the important consequences of the model, and we are happy to
go into more detail. We have added a few further sentences to the text, as
you suggested. Thank you for the suggestion.
9. The above points bear on each of the "novel conclusions" set out on p12,
so some finessing of these may be necessary. The first is the idea that the
primary function of language is coordination, whilst exchange of information is
secondary. One might argue that information exchange is necessary to
achieve coordination in the first place. Perhaps there is some subtlety in the
word "exchange" that I am missing. Second, as already mentioned, the model
includes two sources of punishment arising from coordination, one of which
seems more artificial to me than the other. Third, as noted in point 7 above, I
do not see any direct reason why a larger n_max should cause social groups
to grow. Finally, the speed of language evolution seems to rely on the
observation noted in point 8, which is not at present fully explained.
[OUR COMMENT]
Thank you. We have added clarifications in line with these points further up in
the text. Thank you again for your close read and very useful comments and
suggestions.

Keywords: social coordination, communication efficiency, social group size,
agent-based models, costs of communication, language evolution
Abstract: Social living ultimately depends on coordination between group
members, and communication is necessary to make this possible. We
suggest that this might have been the key selection pressure acting on the
evolution of language in humans and use a behavioural coordination model to
explore the impact of communication efficiency on social group coordination.
We show that when language production is expensive but there is an
individual benefit to the efficiency with which individuals coordinate their
behaviour, the evolution of efficient communication is selected for. Contrary to
some views of language evolution, the speed of evolution is necessarily slow
because there is no advantage in some individuals evolving communication
abilities that much exceed those of the community at large. However, once a
threshold competence has been achieved, evolution of higher order language
skills may indeed be precipitate.
EndDryadContent
Using a simple modification of a model they have previously developed, the authors
study the evo- lution of language as a public good: accurate communication is
individually costly, but has a group benefit (shared equally) and an individual benefit.
Sensibly, they find that accuracy evolves most easily when the individual benefit is
sufficiently large relative to the cost, but that the evolution of accuracy is slow
because it is not individually beneficial to have much more accurate language than
everyone else in your group – that is, selection does not act immediately on
accurately- communicating “mutants”.
These points are straightforward, but worth making, and the model employed is a
good one with which to make them. My only concerns about the paper concern the
exposition. As I detail below, the simplicity of the model is obscured by the authors’
unnecessary use of technical mathematical expressions. This is not to say that
precision should be compromised, but, for example, the sim- ple description “an agent
updates her direction to midway between her current direction and the perceived
direction of her interactant” is identical to the mathematically verbose and difficult-to-
parse expressions in equations (3) and (4). Rewritten in a clearer fashion, I would be
happy to recommend the paper for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
[OUR COMMENT]
The difficulty of such interdisciplinary paper is that some of the audience
expects mathematically precise exposition, while others are sometimes turned
away by it. We tried to walk a tight line, trying to serve both kinds of readers.
regard. We suggest that the mathematical exposition stays, but we expand on
the verbal explanation.
With regard to the wording of the meaning of (3) and (4), we have done
exactly that now: we have added the reviewer’s wording exactly as
suggested. Thank you very much.
Minor points
• A connected k-regular graph with n nodes can be described precisely and simply in
words; equation (1) is an unnecessary distraction that will confuse a non-
mathematical audience and irk a mathematical one.
[OUR COMMENT]
We have added an additional verbal explanation to the mathematical formula.
• Equation (2) should include that the f0,i are independently and identically
distributed. Also, the subscripts in f0,i in the equation would be more
immediately understandable if, in the paragraph leading to it, “Thus all agents
start with a random initial vector” were replaced with “Thus, at time t = 0,
each agent i starts with a random vector”
[OUR COMMENT]
We have modified the text as suggested. Thank you.
• Equations (3) and (4) can be replaced with the simple, equally-precise statement
suggested above. A figure showing the update step would also help. If the
authors insist on keeping the unnecessary expressions, they should note that
there is an error in equation (4), in the second and third lines: should be (fi +
fj + 360o) and (fi + fj - 360o), I think. Also, the second argument of f1 in
equation (4) should be “fj”, not “B”.
[OUR COMMENT]
We have made the changes, and added to the text as suggested. Thank you.
• A ‘meeting’ is an interaction between connected agents, with each pair of
connected agents equally likely to meet. Equation (5) is both an unnecessarily
technical attempt to convey this, and an imprecise one. The claimed
distribution is U(1,...,n) ‘s.t. i <U+0338>= j,i <U+2208> ej,b <U+2208> ei’ (note typo in last part – should
be j <U+2208> ei), but this is not a sensible distribution. Pedantically, it should be noted
that {i, j} is not distributed (“~”) anyway, but is a realization of a random
variable with a distribution.
[OUR COMMENT]
Thank you for spotting the typo. We have corrected it, and also adopted the
wording that you suggested. Thank you for that, too.
• What is ei? It is called a “noise characteristic” on page 5, seems to have to be a
positive number in equation (10), but enters equation (6) in such a way that if
agents i and j have equal large values ei = ej, that’s as good for their
subsequent coordination as if they had equal small, or zero, values. For
example, if fi = 10o, fj = 60o, and ei = ej = 30o, then agent i perceives j’s
direction as fj + ei = 90o and so updates to (10 + 90)/2 = 50o, while agent j
perceives i’s direction as fi + ej = 40o and so updates to (40 + 60)/2 = 50o. So
they’re perfectly coordinated after a single update, despite ei, ej > 0, just as
they would have 1
been (though at a different position) if ei = ej = 0.
Why not just follow much of the signalling literature and say that the noise added to
agent i’s perception of j’s position is drawn from a normal distribution with mean
2
zero and variance e i ?
[OUR COMMENT]
Thank you for spotting this sloppiness of the write up. (The simulation was as
you suggested, albeit + or – epsilon at 50% chance rather than the normal
distribution. Same results, but faster computation.) We have now corrected
the text.
• Page 6, line 53, typo: “to examine to individual’s” should be “to examine the
individual’s”.
[OUR COMMENT]
Corrected. Thank you for spotting it.
• Equations 15 and 16 are, again, unnecessary ways to describe a simple model. Each
step, the agent i with the lowest payoff is eliminated, and replaced with a new
agent, still labelled i. The new agent i’s value of ei is chosen using that of the
highest-payoff agent from the previous round (say j), by sampling from a
uniform distribution on [(1 - <U+03B8>)ej , (1 + <U+03B8>)ej ].
[OUR COMMENT]
We have adopted your wording suggestion. Thank you.
