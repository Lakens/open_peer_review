The authors describe new finds of a early Miocene bird in Australia, as well as revising
previously described birds from the late Oligocene at the same continent. One of their
conclusions is that these birds belong to the family Presbyornithidae, a taxon that is well-
represented in Paleogene deposits in the Northern Hemisphere. These findings in turn lead to
inference about the systematics and biogeography of Presbyornithidae, as well as of some
ecological adaptations of members of this family. Needless to say the paper rests on the
assumption that these new finds are correctly allocated as to family.
I have myself spent considerable time studying bits and pieces of Paleogene fossils attributed to
either presbyornithids or graculavids. My conclusion from that is that a lot of the morphology
that has been used to allocate fossils to these two groups seems to be symplesiomorphic. I found
that representatives of modern lineages in fact share morphologies that are rarely in any living
group of birds. Taxa like Lithornithidae (a paleognath), Gallinuloides (a galliform) have a
postcranial skeleton bearing resemblance to presbyornithids or graculavids. Some of the same
characters are also found in Juncitarsus (a flamingo-type bird), Anatalavis (an anseranatid) the
undescribed screamer you refer to, and many other undescribed Paleogene taxa housed in
different museums. Indeed even parts of the postcranial Ichthyornis exhibit these characters. One
example is a sternum with the articular facets for the coracoids crossed at mid-line, but there are
many other, more subtle characters that made me realize that a lot of these bits and pieces of
Paleogene birds may never be possible to allocate even to family-level. When it came to allocating
single finds to the taxon I mostly worked on, Presbyornithidae, I was lucky to have many
specimens to study to fully understand the within-taxon variation. Still, I wasn't fully assured
that Telmabates indeed was a presbyornithid until I found several small, previously
undiscovered pieces from the mandible and skull. By telling this I just want to explain why I may
be a bit cautious when interpreting postcranial elements.
After having studied the descriptions and the illustrations of the Australian fossils in the
manuscript I believe that W. tedfordi is indeed similar to many aspects of the Presbyornis
morphology. When it comes to W. prideauxi I must confess I am less convinced. Actually the few
elements of this taxon that can be readily compared to W. telfordi show differences that make me
a bit uncomfortable. I am also a bit wondering if it can be convincingly placed in the
Presbyornithidae according to the characters you use for the diagnosis. I don't think this can be
easily determined by the reader from only looking at the illustrations, so you may want to
elaborate this in the text.
For both species of Wilaru I wish there was some skull elements available. In the 2000 paper I
diagnosed Presbyornithidae as long-legged, wading birds with the skull of a duck. If your
taxonomic assignments and ecological interpretations are correct the presbyornithids may well
also be rather short-legged birds living in terrestrial environments with an unknown feeding
style. It is not clear to me why Wilaru can’t belong to the screamer or anseranatid lineages of
anseriforms. That would be much more consistent with their tarsometatarsal morphology.
All in all I believe this ms should be published, maybe after some further consideration
concerning W. prideauxi. It is a solid piece of research that contributes significantly to the
knowledge of Australia’s fossil bird fauna.

My expressed concerns about some identifications could be said of many paleontological studies
but the authors have done their part by providing good illustrations and verbal descriptions. My
suspicion of an excess of symplesiomorphic characters in these taxa can only be evaluated
through a world-wide revision of postulated graculavids, presbyornithids and other taxa of the
same “form-family”.
Minor things:
- Some references should be removed on page 26 lines 1 and 21.
- Cracraft (XXX) postulated a Gondwanan origin for the Anseriformes, add reference.
- My initials are P.G.P., please correct in reference list.

This is an interesting, well researched and well written contribution that advances knowledge of
avian evolution and biogeography. I have marked 'minor revision', but the ms is basically very
sound and requires little change. Here, I considered that it is too strong to claim that
presbyornithids survived in Australia for ~25 million years after they disappeared elsewhere.
One or two other very minor comments appear on the attached ms.
Following Royal Society policy, I am happy to not be anonymous: the authors should know that
within my research in Cenozoic environment evolution through plant fossil study, I have only
broad general interest in vertebrate fossils, and cannot be qualified to assess critical details of
avian bone morphology. Nevertheless, I have read the ms closely, and am satisfied that the
comparative work is well planned and exhaustive, and the logic, written expression and figures
are of high standard.

General comments:
I have certainly not negative comments to this work. Paper includes the assignation to
Presbyornithids of two species (Wilaru tedfordi and Teviornis gobiensis), description of a new
species (W. prideauxi) and discussion about phylogenetic, paleobiogeographic and
paleobiological implications of the records, mainly those of Australia.
Judging from the current standard of the papers published in Royal Society Open Science, the
quality and the amount of the data are appropriate. Methods and their usage are adequate and
up to date. It is a classic and well done paleontological work; not a phylogenetic analysis is done
but conclusions are compelling. I confess that could greatly improve the impact of the work if the
authors do that (cladistic analysis) to better support their conclusions (for example, page 25, lines
19-21: ...Wilaru, Telmabates, and Presbyornis had a common ancestry on the southern
landmasses), but I respect the decision of the authors of do not.
I am not fully satisfied of the quality of the figures. This is my main concern. It seems important
that figures show more views of the elements assigned to the new species W. prideauxi, mainly of
the tarsometatarsus. It could be solved by adding a new figure that illustrates only the elements
of the new species. In some cases, photos are not bad but details are not visible, for example, z, w
of figure 2. This same figure appears to have a non-white background. I'm not sure if these are
artifacts of the pdf. Please, check it.
Please, delete cites in lines 3 and 21 on page 27.
For reasons of time, I have not cross-check the literature.
I feel that the manuscript has merit, but is not suitable for publication as it currently stands but
needs "Minor Revision."

Abstract: Presbyornithids were the dominant birds in Palaeogene lacustrine assemblages,
especially in the Northern Hemisphere, but are thought to have disappeared worldwide by the
mid-Eocene. Now classified within Anseriformes (screamers, ducks, swans, and geese), their
relationships have long been obscured by their strange wader-like skeletal morphology.
Reassessment of the late Oligocene South Australian material attributed to Wilaru tedfordi, long
considered to be of a stone-curlew (Burhinidae, Charadriiformes), reveals that this taxon
represents the first record of a presbyornithid in Australia. We also describe the larger Wilaru
prideauxi sp. nov. from the early Miocene of South Australia, showing that presbyornithids
survived in Australia at least until ca. 22 Ma. Unlike on other continents, where presbyornithids
were replaced by aquatic crown-group anatids (ducks, swans, and geese), species of Wilaru lived
alongside these waterfowl in Australia. The morphology of the tarsometatarsus of these species
indicates that, contrary to other presbyornithids, they were predominantly terrestrial birds,
which probably contributed to their long-term survival in Australia. The morphological similarity
between species of Wilaru and the Eocene South American presbyornithid Telmabates antiquus
supports our hypothesis of a Gondwanan radiation during the evolutionary history of the
Presbyornithidae. Teviornis gobiensis from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia, is here also
reassessed and confirmed as a presbyornithid. These findings underscore the temporal
continuance of Australia’s vertebrates, and provide a new context in which the phylogeny and
evolutionary history of presbyornithids can be examined.

descriptions. My suspicion of an excess of symplesiomorphic characters in these taxa can
only be evaluated through a world-wide revision of postulated graculavids, presbyornithids
and other taxa of the same “form-family”.
Response to R1: All of the points raised by this reviewer are valid, and we now have
addressed and expanded on these, as follows:
Regarding presbyornithid affinities of species of Wilaru:
We note that changes in ecology through time within avian lineages is not unusual, it has
happened several times within Charadriiformes (shorebirds) for instance, and possibly in
screamers. As we note in our manuscript, terrestriality evolved several times within
anseriform lineages as well. It is accepted that the progressive aridification of Australia
during the latter part of the Cenozoic promoted the evolution of distinctive taxa that departed
in ecology from their ancestors.
These changes are reflected in the skeleton of birds, and in our case, these are most notable in
the tarsometatarsus of species of Wilaru. The rest of the postcranial elements closely match
Telmabates antiquus (more than Presbyornis pervetus) in morphology, and they all display
the combination of features present in prebyornithids. Wilaru differs from species of
Presbyornis in notable ways but only as one would expect within a family – it differs from
other anseriforms to a far greater extent. As it is generally accepted that Telmabates is a
presbyornithid, then it is most parsimonious to consider Wilaru a presbyornithid as well,
regardless of the absence of cranial material.
In any case, we do not have just fragmentary or isolated elements (as is the case for many
problematic Palaeogene taxa), but a complete sample of the major elements that make up the
postcranial skeleton of birds. With the exception of the tarsometatarsus, all display features
that are present in Presbyornithidae, and differ markedly from other anseriforms. It is
therefore unlikely for the entire postcranial skeleton to be confused with some of the taxa
mentioned by the reviewer, despite the fact that several features are indeed likely to be
plesiomorphic for Neornithes.
We have added a sentence in the Methods section clarifying that lithornithids (which are
unknown for Australia) and phoenicopteriforms (flamingos and allies) were considered for
comparisons.
We have added the following sentences to our discussion: “We note that although members
of Anseranatidae are known from similar-aged deposits in Australia, they differ from
presbyornithids in the morphology of most skeletal elements, but especially the humerus and
coracoid.”
Potential affinities of Wilaru and other presbyiornithids to screamers (Anhimidae), are
already explored in the manuscript. A close relationship between Wilaru and anhimids to the
exclusion of other presbyornithids seems very unlikely (based on the diagnosis for the family
and noted differences). Also, as we mention above, features linked to terrestriality are
probably not phylogenetically informative. We further note that anhimids are unknown for
Australia, but presbyornithids may have been present in Australia since the early Eocene. The
position of presbyornithids (including Wilaru) within anseriforms however, certainly needs
revision, but this is out of the scope of this work.
The following paragraph has been added in the discussion: “There are marked differences
between screamers and presbyornithids in major skeletal elements that extend beyond the
highly pneumatic nature of anhimid limb bones, e.g. the humerus of anhimids has an inflated
shaft and a pneumatic fossa pneumotricipitalis, the coracoid has a very reduced acrocoracoid
with an unusually shallow sulcus supracoracoideus, and the carpometacarpus has a unique
spur-like development of the processus extensorius.”
Regarding Wilaru prideauxi: Despite the limited amount of material we were able to attribute
to W. prideauxi, its similarities with W. tedfordi warrant attribution to the same genus, as it is
mostly size and “robustness” that differentiate the coracoid, tarsometatarsus and
carpometacarpus of these taxa. These differences tie in with our ecological interpretations of
species of Wilaru, and we also note that W. tedfordi and W. prideauxi do not co-occur in
same age deposits. Also, no other anseriform has a coracoid like that of presbyornithid birds.
All the anatids represented in the deposits have typical anatid-like coracoids assigned to
them. For these reasons it is more parsimonious to say W. prideauxi is indeed a species of
Wilaru (and by extension a presbyornithid), rather than allocating it to another family of birds
so far unknown in the local faunas.
R2:
This is an interesting, well researched and well written contribution that advances knowledge
of avian evolution and biogeography. I have marked 'minor revision', but the ms is basically
very sound and requires little change. Here, I considered that it is too strong to claim that
presbyornithids survived in Australia for ~25 million years after they disappeared elsewhere.
One or two other very minor comments appear on the attached ms.
Following Royal Society policy, I am happy to not be anonymous: the authors should know
that within my research in Cenozoic environment evolution through plant fossil study, I have
only broad general interest in vertebrate fossils, and cannot be qualified to assess critical
details of avian bone morphology. Nevertheless, I have read the ms closely, and am satisfied
that the comparative work is well planned and exhaustive, and the logic, written expression
and figures are of high standard.
Response R2: We changed the statement regarding 25 MA to “…survived in Australia for
~25 million years after the youngest fossil record for them elsewhere” to better clarify this
statement.
All other changes suggested by this reviewer have been incorporated into the manuscript.

I have certainly not negative comments to this work. Paper includes the assignation to
Presbyornithids of two species (Wilaru tedfordi and Teviornis gobiensis), description of a
new species (W. prideauxi) and discussion about phylogenetic, paleobiogeographic and
paleobiological implications of the records, mainly those of Australia.
Judging from the current standard of the papers published in Royal Society Open Science, the
quality and the amount of the data are appropriate. Methods and their usage are adequate and
up to date. It is a classic and well done paleontological work; not a phylogenetic analysis is
done but conclusions are compelling. I confess that could greatly improve the impact of the
work if the authors do that (cladistic analysis) to better support their conclusions (for
example, page 25, lines 19-21: ...Wilaru, Telmabates, and Presbyornis had a common
ancestry on the southern landmasses), but I respect the decision of the authors of do not.
I am not fully satisfied of the quality of the figures. This is my main concern. It seems
important that figures show more views of the elements assigned to the new species W.
prideauxi, mainly of the tarsometatarsus. It could be solved by adding a new figure that
illustrates only the elements of the new species. In some cases, photos are not bad but details
are not visible, for example, z, w of figure 2. This same figure appears to have a non-white
background. I'm not sure if these are artifacts of the pdf. Please, check it.
Please, delete cites in lines 3 and 21 on page 27.
For reasons of time, I have not cross-check the literature.
I feel that the manuscript has merit, but is not suitable for publication as it currently stands
but needs "Minor Revision."

Response to R3: Unfortunately images Z and W of Figure 2 were taken while visiting the
collection at USNM, and better quality images are not possible at this stage. We did,
however, change the brightness of these images to improve visibility. We have now checked
the background, to make sure it is white.
The tarsometatarsus of W. prideauxi is shown in plantar, dorsal and proximal views, and
placed as such in the figure to facilitate comparisons with other taxa. Once we upload the
high quality images, it will be possible to zoom in to a much greater detail. For these reasons,
we will not be adding a figure showing W. prideauxi alone.
All other changes suggested by this reviewer have been made.
