The paper is so important and significant that it is worth minor integrations and of future
relevant improvements.
Minor integrations: (i) add a simple scheme of the simulation, showing the sequence of the action
within each "year" and the agents involved; (ii) specify that the code is related to Python2; (iii)
create a list of required libraries to run the code (a requirements.txt file within the GitHub would
be sufficient).
Future development (to be declared as integration to the current version): (a) have the capability
of experimenting with different birth rates, which is very important for the future; (b) the same,
for migration rates; (c) the same, with working hours, considering the probability of facing aging
with different production structures (e.g., more automation); (d) introduce imitation among
agents as a way to modify their behavior, with spreading effects.
Without (d) the whole model is closer to a microsimulation than to an agent-based simulation.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The paper extends an earlier work of Silverman et al. [14] by providing an augmented agent-
based model of social care benchmarked to the UK population dynamics, and by analysing some
of the resulting policy implications in two alternative scenarios. The key innovations of the paper
are threefold: (1) including the socio-economic status of agents, (2) embedding the kinship
networks and "social distance" between agents, and (3) introducing elements of the formal care
market and labour market. All of these innovations are non-trivial, make the model more realistic
and better suited to addressing actual policy questions, and in my view warrant a separate
publication. Replicability of the results is ensured via two online repositories, one with the model
code, the other one with the data.
Where the paper falls short, even taking a step back towards the predecessor [14], is the analytical
layer. The conclusions mention in passing the need for sensitivity analysis, but in order to make
the findings robust, this should have been a part of the current analysis, alongside with the basic
uncertainty analysis. Of particular interest would be the relative impacts of a set of free
parameters (such as F, I, K, R, and other) on the key outputs of interest (ICER, unmet care need,
informal care). In short, a formal analysis of systematic variation of outcomes across the free
parameter space is badly needed, also from a policy point of view.
The description of the model also needs a more detailed discussion of the two policy scenarios
(tax deduction and direct funding), including any policy-specific parameters (tax rates?), which
may also be subject to sensitivity testing. If space is constrained, then some space could be freed
up by condensing the description of the pre-existing model [14] in Section 2. From the current
description, it is not clear how the money transfers work in the system - and of course the tax rate
will affect the demand for formal care by changing disposable income.
The model, and the discussion of policy implications of the model also misses an elephant in the
room, which is the international migration component. While I do not think that adding it is
absolutely necessary, what the results seem to be pointing at is a care gap, some of which can be
met through migration (which in turn is a policy, as well as a political choice). One additional
4
analysis that could help shed light on that might be along the lines of "replacement migration" -
how many migrants from outside the system would be needed in the care sector to fill the gaps,
under some realistic assumptions regarding migrant wages relative to the local labour force.
Finally, a minor, stylistic point: the introduction starts with a sombre tone, but it is actually worth
mentioning that the care challenges are actually a byproduct of one of the greatest successes of
humanity so far, which is the increase in longevity (and also in years spent in good health).

Appendix A
Comments on Gostoli and Silverman paper on Modelling Social Care Provision in an Agent-Based
Framework with Kinship Networks
This paper presents an interesting simulation of care provision in the U.K. in which family members
decide to provide unpaid care or purchase private care for their relative who has care needs. It is an
interesting and valuable paper on a policy-relevant and important topic.
General points:
It is surprising that formal care is not discussed or defined and that local authority funded care is not
mentioned until page 8. It appears that formal care is treated in this paper solely as private care
bought by relatives. Since much home care in the UK is funded by local authorities the role of
publicly funded care should be discussed.
The importance of attitudes and preferences in the choice of types of care sought and provided
should be mentioned even though they cannot be modelled.
Introduction:
The projections in Wittenberg and Hu (ref 6) are on a set of base case assumptions: this should be
stated.
The Health Survey for England (HSE) provides data on receipt of unpaid care by older people and on
provision of unpaid care by adults of any age.
It is important to distinguish between care which is fully privately funded and care where the family
are providing ‘top up’ payments to local authority support.
The model: health status and care need
Those with critical needs are likely to need to be in care homes, which are not mentioned.
The model: model enhancements: kinship networks
The number of hours of care which agents can provide (table 2) seems rather high in some of the
categories. Studies have shown that unpaid care of more than 10 hours per week, and certainly
more than 20 hours per week, is very difficult to combine with full-time work. The hours for
teenagers and students also seem high. Account should also be taken of potential carers’ other
caring responsibilities, especially caring for their children.
It is not clear what role estimated informal care attraction plays in the model given the statement
(footnote 9) that relocation is prompted only by a job offer or marriage.
The model: model enhancements: formal care:
My comments above about formal care and its definition are relevant here. The local authority may
fund the formal care or the person with care needs could do so.
Social care experiments:
It is not clear whether social care expenses of £X means that £X is deducted from taxable income or
£x is deducted from the tax bill – presumably the former but the drafting suggests the latter. There is
of course direct public funding of care in the UK subject to eligibility criteria and (except in Scotland)
a means test.
Results
It is not initially clear that figures 1-8 relate to the base case without any policy experiment.
It is surprising that total population peaks in 2025 which does not seem consistent with ONS
population projections. This requires an explanation.
The final part of the results section, on the impact of the two policy experiments, is somewhat brief.
It is not clear, for example, how the cost to public funds of the two policy experiments is estimated
how the ICERs are estimated, or whether the ISERs are estimated using a public sector or societal
perspective.
Discussion
Some data on inequalities by SEG in receipt of home care by older people is available from the HSE,
and there have been some studies on this topic.
The finding that ‘kinship distance impacts care provision behaviour’ is more an underlying
assumption of the modelling than a finding.
The limitations of the modelling, and its strengths, would normally be discussed in this section.
Future work
The outline of plans for future work is a valuable part of the paper. Scotland is however rather
different from England, Wales and N Ireland in terms of the generosity of its funding system (free
personal care for older people). But the greater availability of data for Scotland means that the plan
to start with Scotland seems sensible.
Appendix B
Reviewer Response: Modelling Social Care
Provision in An Agent-Based Framework with
Kinship Networks
Umberto Gostoli and Eric Silverman
1 Summary
We have attempted to address every comment from the three reviewers, and
below we describe how we have done so. The most significant changes are the
addition of publicly-funded care to the model, which required re-doing all the
default and policy comparison simulation runs, and the addition of a sensitivity
analysis using Gaussian process emulators, which required weeks of computa-
tion. This revised version of the paper now includes a more nuanced model of
care provision, more detailed analyses of the outcomes, and greater clarity in
our exposition and interpretation. We would like to thank all three reviewers
for their detailed comments, which have substantially improved the paper.
2 Reviewer One Comments
It is surprising that formal care is not discussed or defined and that
local authority funded care is not mentioned until page 8. It appears
that formal care is treated in this paper solely as private care bought
by relatives. Since much home care in the UK is funded by local
authorities the role of publicly funded care should be discussed.
We have moved the definition of social care further up in the paper. We have
also enhanced the current version of the model by including local-authority-
funded care, and have redone all the results accordingly. We have described the
implementation of this in the Methods section. We had not initially planned to
add this at this stage, but doing so turned out to be less difficult than we had
feared, so we decided to add this to the current paper in order to address this
criticism.
The importance of attitudes and preferences in the choice of types
of care sought and provided should be mentioned even though they
cannot be modelled.
1
We have mentioned both in the Motivations subsection and in the Future
Work section that attitudes and preferences are another aspect of behavioural
modelling that may be introduced in later versions of this model. We disagree
that they cannot be modelled, though certainly it would be challenging.
The projections in Wittenberg and Hu (ref 6) are on a set of base case
assumptions: this should be stated. The Health Survey for England
(HSE) provides data on receipt of unpaid care by older people and
on provision of unpaid care by adults of any age.
We have added in a footnote the requested statement about the assumptions
on which the projections in Wittenberg and Hu (2015) are based.
We have also added the Health Survey for England 2017 reference, some
findings of which we added in the Introduction section, and thank the reviewer
for the suggestion.
It is important to distinguish between care which is fully privately
funded and care where the family are providing top up payments to
local authority support.
The new version of the model includes both varieties of formal care.
Those with critical needs are likely to need to be in care homes, which
are not mentioned.
We have now mentioned this aspect in a footnote in Health Status and Care
Need : “Note that in the UK, people with critical care needs are likely to be
placed into care homes. In this model we do not explicitly represent this aspect,
but, for the sake of simplicity, the social care received in a care home is implicitly
considered as part of the formal social care received by people in need. Future
iterations of the model will simulate care homes more explicitly.”
The number of hours of care which agents can provide (table 2) seems
rather high in some of the categories. Studies have shown that unpaid
care of more than 10 hours per week, and certainly more than 20
hours per week, is very difficult to combine with full-time work. The
hours for teenagers and students also seem high. Account should also
be taken of potential carers other caring responsibilities, especially
caring for their children. It is not clear what role estimated informal
care attraction plays in the model given the statement (footnote 9)
that relocation is prompted only by a job offer or marriage.
Our perusal of relevant studies in Scotland suggest these figures are not out
of the realm of possibility. However, following the reviewer’s suggestion, we
have significantly reduced the hours of care of students and employed agents
in this updated version of the model. We would stress again that this model,
as explicitly described in the Motivations section, is not intended to be highly
accurate or predictive, but illustrative of what this framework can simulate and
the behaviours it generates. We are in contact with social care experts here in
Scotland who will be helping us to refine these aspects of the simulation.
2
It is not clear whether social care expenses of X means that X is
deducted from taxable income or x is deducted from the tax bill
presumably the former but the drafting suggests the latter. There is
of course direct public funding of care in the UK subject to eligibility
criteria and (except in Scotland) a means test.
This point has now been clarified.
It is not initially clear that figures 1-8 relate to the base case without
any policy experiment.
We have made this more explicit in the text by altering the last sentence
of the first paragraph of Results: “The single-run charts are displayed here in
Figures 1 through 8, and were chosen to highlight the key features of this new
simulation framework....”
We have also divided the Results into subsections, to make it more clear
where we are examining the base case and the policy comparisons.
It is surprising that total population peaks in 2025 which does not
seem consistent with ONS population projections. This requires an
explanation.
As noted in the text, the model does not include international migration,
and as such we do not intend, nor do we claim to precisely replicate UK pop-
ulation change. As noted throughout we aimed for this stage of the model
development to provide qualitative similarity to real-world behaviour, and have
no pretensions toward predictive accuracy at this time. Developing a model of
this complexity to a high level of predictive accuracy is a very long-term project.
We have underlined this point further with the following sentence in Future
Work : “The addition of international migration to the model will allow us to
understand UK demographic dynamics in future decades, and to more closely
replicate UK population change.”
The final part of the results section, on the impact of the two policy
experiments, is somewhat brief. It is not clear, for example, how the
cost to public funds of the two policy experiments is estimated how
the ICERs are estimated, or whether the ISERs are estimated using
a public sector or societal perspective.
Details on the ICER calculations are now included in the Results section.
Some data on inequalities by SEG in receipt of home care by older
people is available from the HSE, and there have been some studies on
this topic. The finding that kinship distance impacts care provision
behaviour is more an underlying assumption of the modelling than
a finding. The limitations of the modelling, and its strengths, would
normally be discussed in this section.
Regarding the kinship distance impact, we present this in the Discussion as
underlining the importance of modelling this aspect, in that the model’s results
3
show the effects are non-trivial. Our initial assumptions do drive some of this,
namely the restriction on informal care provision linked to kinship distance, but
the simulation outcomes are also driven by emergent effects from the interactions
between kinship distance, spatial distance, and related agent behaviours.
We have worked to be very clear throughout the paper about the motiva-
tions of the project and the limitations of the current model, as well as what
additional factors are going to be examined in future iterations. We have not
added additional discussion on this issue, as we felt that further repetition of the
model’s caveats would bog the paper down rather than provide any additional
clarity.
3 Reviewer Two Comments
**The paper is so important and significant that it is worth minor
integrations and of future relevant improvements.
We thank the reviewer for this encouraging comment.
Minor integrations: (i) add a simple scheme of the simulation, show-
ing the sequence of the action within each ”year” and the agents
involved; (ii) specify that the code is related to Python2; (iii) create
a list of required libraries to run the code (a requirements.txt file
within the GitHub would be sufficient).
We agree that these additions would be helpful, and have added a summary
of the sequence of each yearly update in the simulation (Section 2, subsection
e, sub-subsection vii).
Future development (to be declared as integration to the current ver-
sion): (a) have the capability of experimenting with different birth
rates, which is very important for the future; (b) the same, for migra-
tion rates; (c) the same, with working hours, considering the proba-
bility of facing aging with different production structures (e.g., more
automation); (d) introduce imitation among agents as a way to mod-
ify their behavior, with spreading effects.
All of the mentioned aspects are user-alterable, as they are driven by input
data and parameters. However in most cases we expect most of these to be left
unchanged by users, as they will want to use empirical values for birth rates,
migration, etc. as starting points.
In the Future Work section, we have added mentions of additional ‘what-
if’ scenarios, including automation, and the possibility of further behavioural
influences between agents. The automation idea is beyond the scope of our
current projects, but we hope mentioning it here may inspire others to take this
forward.

4 Reviewer Three Comments
Where the paper falls short, even taking a step back towards the
predecessor [14], is the analytical layer. The conclusions mention in
passing the need for sensitivity analysis, but in order to make the
findings robust, this should have been a part of the current analysis,
alongside with the basic uncertainty analysis. Of particular interest
would be the relative impacts of a set of free parameters (such as
F, I, K, R, and other) on the key outputs of interest (ICER, unmet
care need, informal care). In short, a formal analysis of systematic
variation of outcomes across the free parameter space is badly needed,
also from a policy point of view.
As in the preceding paper cited by the reviewer, we have now utilised Gaus-
sian process emulation to perform a sensitivity analysis using the five parameters
identified in this comment. Embarking on a sensitivity analysis for a simula-
tion of this complexity is a major undertaking, as an individual run takes 24-48
hours to complete. Producing enough simulation output data to run the em-
ulator required 243 simulation runs, which took six weeks to complete on our
high-performance workstation.
Note that we have only used unmet care need as an output of interest, as
running a emulator capable of coping with a vector of outputs would vastly
increase the amount of runs needed and the complexity of the procedure, and
would have been impossible to perform in the time allotted for revisions, and
indeed probably impossible in general until our computing resources are sig-
nificantly increased. Very few modellers have attempted Gaussian process em-
ulators of this type, so we also would have needed to write new software for
this purpose. We will take a look at implementing analyses of this complexity
when we are developing future work intended to provide more concrete policy
recommendations, rather than illustrative comparisons of simplified exemplar
policies as in this paper.
We have added a new subsection to the Results section, subsection c, which
introduces Gaussian process emulation, describes our sensitivity analysis in de-
tail, presents a table and two graphs of results, and provides our interpretation
of the outcomes.
The description of the model also needs a more detailed discussion of
the two policy scenarios (tax deduction and direct funding), including
any policy-specific parameters (tax rates?), which may also be subject
to sensitivity testing.
We have added some additional details on the two policy scenarios presented.
We have refrained from a detailed sensitivity analysis in this case, as these
scenarios are intended as illustrative of model behaviour and outputs and not
as a serious attempt at policy evaluation (and we have highlighted this fact in
this revised manuscript). More complex policy scenarios will be examined in
detail with sensitivity analyses in future work.

The model, and the discussion of policy implications of the model also
misses an elephant in the room, which is the international migration
component.
We agree that this is a very useful direction for future work, and have referred
to the care gap and international migration in the Future Work section in this
sentence: “Moreover, this will enable us to explore whether migration policies
can help to reduce the ‘care gap’ produced by dropping birthrates in the UK-
born population.”
Finally, a minor, stylistic point: the introduction starts with a sombre
tone, but it is actually worth mentioning that the care challenges are
actually a byproduct of one of the greatest successes of humanity so
far, which is the increase in longevity (and also in years spent in good
health).
We agree with this stylistic suggestion and have added a new first sentence
to the Introduction which reads as follows: “In recent history, researchers and
practitioners in public health have succeeded in significantly lengthening the
human lifespan and increasing quality of life for the elderly.”

Dear Dr Haddadi,
Please find attached our final revised manuscript for the paper entitled Modelling Social
Care Provision in an Agent-Based Framework with Kinship Networks. As requested, we have
modified Figure 17 for enhanced readability and clarity, we have revisited our textual
explanations of all 17 figures in the text, and we have modified all axes labels in all of the
figures to ensure legibility.
We hope you find these modifications to your satisfaction and look forward to appearing in
your pages.
Yours sincerely,
