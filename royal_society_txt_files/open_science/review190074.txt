In the process of deep hole blasting, the thickness of blasting roof will directly affect the blasting
effect and operation safety. By establishing the analytical model of plastic bearing capacity of
blasting roof, the authors put forward the plastic ultimate bearing capacity expression of blasting
roof, which is suitable for different boundary conditions. It provides a new idea for determining
the thickness of blasting roof in deep hole mining.
However, there are still some problems about their work. The problems are listed below:
(1) In Section 3.1, the boundary conditions are simplified. After simplification, the calculation
results will be affected. How to eliminate these effects?
(2) As shown in figures 6, the author points out that “When the thickness exceeds 4.6m, limit
bearing capacity is higher than upper uniform load, so the blasting-roof is in a favorable state”.
When the thickness is 4.6m, the overlying load may have local stress concentration, which
exceeds the ultimate load. How to deal it?
(3) As shown in figures 8 and 9, when the thickness of blasting roof is 6 meters or7 meters, the
plastic failure and the stress weakening range are small. Does the thickness of blasting roof satisfy
the safety requirement as long as it is more than 6 meters?
(4) There are some grammar errors in the article.
In summary, minor repairs are recommended.

The Authors proposed the plastic limit bearing calculation method of blasting-roof. The results
are nicely presented and the conclusions can be supported by the study results. It has important
guiding significance for deep hole mining. The reviewer recommends a minor revision prior to
the publication of the paper in the journal Royal Society Open Science. Below shows the minor
comments on the manuscript:
(1) Some assumptions are made for the sake of simplifying theoretical analysis. How to deal with
the affect of assumptions on the calculation results? Whether the calculation result is verified in
engineering application?
The variables in formula 1-8 should be given units to facilitate readers to verify the calculation.
(3) Please check the spell and grammatical errors.
(4) Please figure out the position of Fig. 2 in the description. In Fig 10, it is recommended that the
thickness of blasting roof varies from small to large rather than from large to small.
(5) The authors should explain the specific method of getting the safety coefficient value. And, the
safety coefficient value should be confirmed in the paper.
(6) Please figure out the difference between the external work of blasting-roof and the internal
work blasting-roof. In the paper (Page 4, Line 47), the external work is equal to internal work.
Therefore, the expression in the Abstract and Conclusion (i.e., The external work and internal
work of blasting-roof under plastic limit state were calculated) should be more specific.

Reviewer 1:
In the process of deep hole blasting, the thickness of blasting roof will directly affect
the blasting effect and operation safety. By establishing the analytical model of plastic
bearing capacity of blasting roof, the authors put forward the plastic ultimate bearing
capacity expression of blasting roof, which is suitable for different boundary conditions.
It provides a new idea for determining the thickness of blasting roof in deep hole mining.
However, there are still some problems about their work. The problems are listed below:
(1) In Section 3.1, the boundary conditions are simplified. After simplification, the
calculation results will be affected. How to eliminate these effects?
Reply: Considering that the boundary conditions are simplified, in Section 4.3 the
calculation result is revised with safety coefficient (safety coefficient value: 1.2~1.5).
These effects can be effectively eliminated by multiplying the safety coefficient.
(2) As shown in figures 6, the author points out that “When the thickness exceeds 4.6m,
limit bearing capacity is higher than upper uniform load, so the blasting-roof is in a
favorable state”. When the thickness is 4.6m, the overlying load may have local stress
concentration, which exceeds the ultimate load. How to deal it?
Reply: We thank the reviewer’s comment. The theoretical calculation shows that the
thickness of the broken roof is 4.6m. The overlying load may have local stress
concentration that exceeds the ultimate load. Therefore, the theoretical value is revised
with safety coefficient to ensure the reliability of thickness of blasting roof.
(3) As shown in figures 8 and 9, when the thickness of blasting roof is 6 meters or7
meters, the plastic failure and the stress weakening range are small. Does the thickness
of blasting roof satisfy the safety requirement as long as it is more than 6 meters?
Reply: When the thickness of blasting roof is more than 6 meters it can satisfy the
safety requirement. However, if the blasting-roof is too thick, kerf blasting efficiency
will decrease and generated free surface incline to be uneven. So the reasonable
thickness of blasting roof is 6m
(4) There are some grammar errors in the article.
Reply: We are sorry for the mistake. We have carefully checked the grammar errors in
the article and revised them.
Reviewer 2:
The Authors proposed the plastic limit bearing calculation method of blasting-roof. The
results are nicely presented and the conclusions can be supported by the study results.
It has important guiding significance for deep hole mining. The reviewer recommends
a minor revision prior to the publication of the paper in the journal Royal Society Open
Science. Below shows the minor comments on the manuscript:
(1) Some assumptions are made for the sake of simplifying theoretical analysis. How
to deal with the affect of assumptions on the calculation results? Whether the
calculation result is verified in engineering application?
Reply: Considering that the assumptions are made for the sake of simplifying
theoretical analysis, in Section 4.3 the calculation result is revised with safety
coefficient (safety coefficient value: 1.2~1.5). These effects can be effectively
eliminated by multiplying the safety coefficient. The calculation result had been
verified in engineering application
(2)The variables in formula 1-8 should be given units to facilitate readers to verify the
calculation.
Reply: We are thankful for the reviewer’s kind suggestion. We have given the units of
variables in formula 1-8.
(3) Please check the spell and grammatical errors.
Reply: We are sorry for the mistake. We have carefully checked the spell and grammar
errors in the article and revised them.
(4) Please figure out the position of Fig. 2 in the description. In Fig 10, it is
recommended that the thickness of blasting roof varies from small to large rather than
from large to small.
Reply: Thank you for the suggestion. We have figured out the position of Fig.2 in the
manuscript and revised the Fig.10.
(5) The authors should explain the specific method of getting the safety coefficient
value. And, the safety coefficient value should be confirmed in the paper.
Reply: Thank you for reminding us. When the surrounding rock around the stope is
very stable, groundwater and engineering disturbance have little influence on the stope,
and the safety factor is set to 1.2. Considering that one side of the object stope is backfill,
the influence of groundwater and Engineering Disturbance on the stope is very small,
so the safety coefficient value is set to 1.3.
(6) Please figure out the difference between the external work of blasting-roof and the
internal work blasting-roof. In the paper (Page 4, Line 47), the external work is equal
to internal work. Therefore, the expression in the Abstract and Conclusion (i.e., The
external work and internal work of blasting-roof under plastic limit state were
calculated) should be more specific.
Reply: We are thankful for the reviewer’s kind suggestion. The external work mainly
includes blasting vibration and mechanical work. Internal work is mainly the work done
by gravity. The expression in the Abstract and Conclusion about external work and
internal work are revised.
