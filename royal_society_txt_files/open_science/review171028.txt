This paper reports the preparation of nitrogen doped carbon particles from a metal organic
framework for electrical double layer capacitors. This is new work and the results are sound. I
recommend accept for publication after major revisions.
1. The mass loading the electrode material for each electrode should be described.
2. The atomic content of nitrogen should be measured.
3. The flexibility should be studied by repeatedly bending to large angles for over 1000 cycles.
4. The performance of the supercapacitor needs to be compared with counterparts reported in
literature.

The manuscript “A novel adenine-based-MOF derived nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbon for
flexible solid-state supercapacitor” by Zhang et al. is an interesting piece of work and should be
suitable for the publication in RSOS. Few minor comments:
1. MS is full of typo mistakes. Authors should check each and every word. For eg. in Abstract
“areal capacitance in place of area capacitance”, “Electrochemical data in place of dates” etc….

2. Some important references are missing. It is better to cite them. For eg. ChemistrySelect 1

Chemistry Chemical Physics 18 (42), 29308, RSC Advances 7 (1), 309-317. In addition, in the
explanation section of supercapacitor, relevant references should be cited to justify their
statements.
3. Can authors explain why did they specifically choose 3 electrode configuration to test the
reliability of the fabricated supercapacitor device, why not 2 electrode configuration?

Appendix A
Response to comments
Reviewer #1: This paper reports the preparation of nitrogen doped
carbon particles from a metal organic framework for electrical double
layer capacitors. This is new work and the results are sound. I recommend
accept for publication after major revisions.
TECHNICAL CONCERNS
Question: 1. The mass loading the electrode material for each electrode
should be described.
Answer 1: The mass of the active material coated on the film is about
1mg for each electrode.
Question: 2. The atomic content of nitrogen should be measured.
Answer 2: The atomic content of nitrogen was measured by varion EL
CUBE elemental analyzer. The nitrogen atomic content of NPC-1-900 is
2.61 %. This indicated that we successfully obtained nitrogen doped
porous carbon by carbonized adenine-based-MOF.
Question: 3. The flexibility should be studied by repeatedly bending to
large angles for over 1000 cycles.
Answer 3: To explore the flexibility of the device, the bending test was
conducted under large angles (145°) through CV method at the scan rate
of 50 mV s-1. The data is shown in SFig.7. We can see that the
capacitance of the device retain 89.5% of the initial capacitance after
2000 cycles, which indicate that the device possesses an excellent cycling
stability and flexibility.
Question: 4. The performance of supercapacitor needs to be compared
with counterparts reported in literature.
Answer 4: The power output of supercapacitors is lower than that of
electrolytic capacitors, but can reach about 10 kW kg-1. These devices can
store large amounts of energy, but do not offer very high power densities
(500-10000 W kg-1) due to their storage mechanism [11]. Porous carbon
and nitrogen porous carbon are used electrode materials for SCs,
especially EDLCs, have caught many researcher attentions.
Electrochemical data show that the device of NPC-1-900/CNTF exhibited
superior areal capacitance (43.2 mF cm-2) at the scan rate of 5 mV s-1, the
volumetric energy density is 57.3 µWh cm-3 and the volumetric power
density is 2.4 mW cm-3 at the current density of 0.5 mA cm-2 based on
PVA/H3PO4 gel electrolyte. Compared with counterparts [25], the
performance of supercapacitor are more excellent.

Reviewer #2: The mamuscript “A novel adenine-based-MOF derived
nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbon for flexible solid-state supercapacitor”
by Zhang et al. is an interesting piece of work and should be suitable for
the publication in RSOS. Few minor comments:
TECHNICAL CONCERNS
Question: 1. MS is full of typo mistakes. Authors should check each and
every word. For eg. In Abstract “areal capacitance in place of area
capacitance”, “Electrochemical data in place of dates” etc….
Answer 1: The mistakes in the manuscript have been checked and
modified.
Question: 2. Some important references are missing. It is better to cite
them. For eg. ChemistrySelect 1(11), 2826-2833, Nat Commun. 2017, 8:
15717, Journal of Materials Chemistry A 2016, 4, 16432-16445, J. Mater.

Advances 7(1), 309-317. In addition, in the explanation section of
supercapacitor, relevant references should be cited to justify their
statements.

Question: 3. Can authors explain why did they specifically choose 3
electrode configuration to test the reliability of the fabricated
supercapacitor device, why not 2 electrode configuration.
Answer 3: In the manuscript, the single electrode of CNTF, PC/CNTF
and NPC-X/CNTF were evaluated using a three-electrode cell in 1 M
H2SO4 electrolyte. The performance of the assembled device was tested
in a two-electrode configuration. The capacitance of the device is
essentially measured by the double electrode, and the specific capacitance
to the single electrode material has more interference factors, so it is not
recommended.
