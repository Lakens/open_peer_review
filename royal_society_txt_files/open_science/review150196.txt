The paper “Phylogenomics based on RNA-Seq resolves relationships within Cladobranchia
(Gastropoda: Nudibranchia): An initial investigation” by Goodheart et al. presents a phylogeny
of a group of sea slugs based on several hundreds of genes.
This is an interesting paper that makes good use of newly generated transcriptomic data from 16
species of nudibranchs. Overall, the study is well designed, uses appropriate molecular lab
methods and provides a fully resolved cladobranch, which I anticipate would be useful to many
peers and the general readership of RS Open Science.
I have several comments that the authors may want to consider when revising the manuscript:
- I think the study is among the seminal ones applying NGS data to phylogenomics of
gastropods. However, I disagree with the authors in that it is a mere “Initial investigation” (Title)
or a “preliminary exploration” (page 4, line 34) but instead a nice full contribution that advances
what we know about the systematics of Cladobranchia. Hence, I encourage the authors to be less
modest and delete those statements.
- Page 6, line 5. The real name of the kit is “TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit”. Was the
sequencing pair-ended and if so 50, 75, 100PE?
- Page 6, line 15. What was the minimum size of the transcript (contig) selected in Trinity?
Have the authors used any measure on how “good” was the assembly process? For instance, can
they report on the completeness of the assembled transcriptomes by comparison with the
CEGMA core protein set?
- Page 6, line 18. In my view, homology is similarity by descent and thus can only be
assessed through phylogenetic analyses (as performed later in the study). This “orthology
detection” is performed using similarity searches; hence, here I would suggest using “tentative”,
“preliminary”, etc. and “assignment” instead of ”detection”.
- Page 8, line 21. Could you generate for the supplementary material a pairwise matrix
showing how many of the 839 genes were present in the different species? Could you comment in
the corresponding section of the discussion whether the phylogenetic analyses could be
influenced/ biased by the 54-77% of gaps in the sequence matrices?
- Phylogenetic trees. Could you discuss on those nodes that are incompatible in the two
reconstructed trees but highly supported and to what extent the high support of the nodes maybe
misleading in phylogenomics (see Salichos and Rokas, 2013 Nature 497: 327-331)?
- Discussion. I miss a more thorough comparison of present results with those obtained in
reference #12, particularly taking into account that this reference is mentioned but not published
yet, and the reader does not know anything about it. Are the results of both studies congruent
despite the different in number of taxa and source of sequence data? Also, other relevant papers
that may be considered/ mentioned in the introduction and/ or discussion are: Bertsch et al.

Phylogenomics based on RNA-Seq resolves relationships within Cladobranchia (Gastropoda:
Nudibranchia): An initial investigation
This is an interesting manuscript since it deals with large transcriptomic data analysing
phylogenetic relationship within a rather small taxon. Therefore it is certainly of interest, even on
a broader aspect, since it shows that transcriptomes might not only be used in analysing deeper
metazoan nodes. However there are several aspects that the authors have to consider and take
into consideration.
Some concerns are with regard to methodology, but major problems are with the remarks on
evolution based on the tree of Cladobranchia which the authors discuss from the few taxa
analysis.
In the following are my comments: the number indicate the line
Title and in general:
Although you write in the title that this is an initial investigation, in the first part it is said that
you resolved the Cladobranch tree. I would rather title it: “An initial phylotranscriptomic study
to analyse relationships within Cladobranchia.” You have considered 17 genera (from 10
families) out of nearly 60 recognized families (World Register of Marine Species). There are more
than a hundred valid genera. With this small dataset presented here you can not “resolve”
cladobranch relationships.
Do not use the word “resolve” at all for a purely phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenies reflect
historical processes which can not be resolved but only supported by evidences – for example by
morphological data. You mean that the algorithms actually depict a tree that, we assume , reflects
evolution. Therefore a tree is a hypothesis and can not “resolve” any relationships. The trees you
present depict Cladobranchia as monophyletic. Whether they really are, we will never know for
4
sure. BS do not give evidence for monophyly. They show the redundancy of a certain character
pattern in a given data set. They are a measure of repeatability, not a measure of correctness.
Please consider this also in the rest of the manuscript.
You produce a number of intermediate results which depend on a deliberate choice of programs
and their parameters. However, in most cases you do not specify them. Please also consider
making all your data, including important intermediate results, publicly available.
Abstract
Page 2
23 You mention only 19 taxa. What about number 20?
Introduction.
Page 3
8 Cladobranchia is not defined by the loss of the shell. This feature is a synapomorphy of the
Nudibranchia.
24 Zalypsis is not a very good example, since it is a synthetically one. At least you could name the
taxa where the alkaloids come from.
28 “Conspicuous”: Nudibranchs usually are only conspicuous when you have them in a vial
under the microscope. As soon as you search for them in their native habitat they are rather
cryptic.
What do you mean with “nudibranchs within Cladobranchia”? Cladobranchs are within
Nudibranchia.
36 You refer here to a submitted manuscript. This can only be done when it is in press. You refer
several times to this manuscript and it is difficult for me to follow arguments when there is no
access to this paper. I would suggest to remove all references to this manuscript unless it is
available.
Page 4
16 Major contributions of Carmona et al 2014 on Baeolidia and Berghia are missing.
31 It is not inefficiency when three or five genes cannot be used to infer the relationship of three
hundred taxa. A method can be inefficient. Here, the data (or the lack of it) is the problem, not the
method. I would call this insufficiency.
36 please do not use the word “resolve” for a phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenies reflect historical
processes which can not be resolved but only supported by evidences (see above)
Methods
In general, please refer to all included tables and figures in your text and be much more specific
with regard to programs and settings.
5
Page 5
3 on rare occasions – what were these rare occasions? Did you do barcoding for confirmation of
identification or not? This is not clear. If you did, please give more details. Did you use a Blast
search in NCBI or BOLD to confirm your identification? For more transparency, you could
actually mention the species with the best hits to your target species. Please also name the sources
you used for identification, especially when barcoding was not applied.
7 At what temperatures were the samples kept between the preservation in RNAlater and
freezing?
15 Why do you mention the substrate the animals were collected from? Is this important here?
Did you do any identification on these too?
44 What is the max speed you have used?
Page 6
3 Please mention the criteria that qualified your RNA samples for library preparation.
5 Which version of Illumina’s TruSeq kit did you use? You should mention that you have
sequenced paired-end reads (according to Table S1), if this is the case. What insert sizes were
used in the PE sequencing?
10 Please mention the version number (or date of download if not applicable) of autoadapt. This
also applies for all other programs, web services and published scripts you have used (HaMStR,
BLAST, FASTA, Mafft etc).
21-33 Please be more specific about the used parameters for the HaMStR search, i.e., provide the
used flags and other settings if they differ from the default values. You should do this for every
program and web service you have used.
28 10 to the power of 1 is 10. The last time I checked, HaMStR had a default cut-off of 1 for the
HMM search. Please double check this.
31 What E-value cut-off did you apply?
33 Why did you substitute FASTA? Please explain
39 How many clusters did you download?
42 I do not understand the switch from 50% to 70% similarity. Please state clearly what is meant
here.
52 Please provide more information why you have created your own substitution matrix. Did
you test whether the GASTRO50 matrix is more suitable than, for example, a Blosum62 matrix?
What are the basic properties of your matrix? In order to make your results better reproducible
you should publish the matrix along with the supplementary material.
55 Please give more details about the results of this procedure. How many blocks were in the
blocks output file? How many amino acid positions? What is the meaning of “1 seq=1388”? Did
the block contain 1388 amino acid positions?
6
Page 7
10 Which alignment strategy did you use? Please provide more details which parameters were
used (see comment above). Furthermore, how did you convert the amino acid sequences into
nucleotide alignments? If you have used a custom script, please consider publishing it along with
the supplementary material.
16 Why did you settle for at least four representatives? This is only one-fifth of your samples and
makes your matrix extremely sparse (see also below). Have you considered increasing this
number?
18 This sentence is confusing. If you remove positions, the matrix obviously does not contain the
original nucleotides sequenced at each site. What is meant by “sequenced at each site”?
30 – 49 this is extremely confusing. You should also refer here already to the figures, because one
gets completely lost, which analysis is performed with what kind of output. Include a table for
the various analyses, that might help. How you created the partitioned data sets should be part of
the paragraph above this one.
32 Default setting of web services can change without documentation. Please provide exact
details on how you did the analysis and what parameter settings were used. For example, was
the proportion of invariant sites fixed or estimated? How did you treat the equilibrium state
frequencies? These details are important to reproduce your results.
44 What kind of post-processing did you do apart from the construction of the BS consensus
trees?
48 Sentence is weird. I assume you follow protocol of Regier et al. , therefore name the authors.
Please mention in the results how many replicates were finally done for each data set.
57 Please include the official SRR accessions of your sequences in the supplementary tables.
Page 8
9-21 Your numbers (number of transcripts, N50, HaMStR matches) are only based on the newly
sequenced transcriptomic data. However you have assembled and annotated four published data
sets. Please include them in the description of your data.
13 What do you mean by “unique loci”? Are those the loci which did not show paraphyly? Are
those the “orthologous groups” which were used for further analyses?
15 According to your table, 184 is not the mean length of matching sequences – it’s the minimum
length. Please double check all your numbers and how you refer to them.
18 You started with 3854 orthologous groups and had to remove 3015 because of evidence of
paralogy – is this correct? If you had to remove some of the groups because of other reasons,
please mention this.
25 Our phylogenetic trees resolved Cladobranchia as a monophyletic group. Wording is not
correct (see also above). A tree can not “resolve” any relationships. Please consider this also in the
rest of the manuscript (e.g. in line 31, 36, 44, 55 and so on)
I was astonished to see Bathydoris as sistergroup to Cladobranchia, although with a very low
bootstrap. I wonder which alternatives have come out in your analyses. Actually there are only
few options for Bathydoris to group with: It must have grouped with the outgroup to a high
7
extent, because the expected alternative with Doris is not indicated at all and therefore must even
be below the 34 or 40 bootstrap value respectively.
31 Trying to analyse evolution of a group via assessing phylogenetic trees I would not use
hierarchical termini like “infraorder”. You probably got this information from the World Register
of Marine Species. This is ok for systematists and taxonomists, but makes no sense in
phylogenetic trees.
Discussion
Page 9
15 You declare the examination of potential methodological concerns. Although this would be
very interesting, I can’t find any of this in the discussion. Please elaborate on this topic.
16 Leave out this whole sentence “ Finally…..effect of these results on the current understanding
of the evolutionary history of Cladobranchia”. This is definitely too early and you bring no
evidences from other data sets that would support your conclusions anyway.
28 I can’t follow you here. For example, Berghia stephanieae has a higher number of transcripts
than most of the already published data sets. Please revise your wording here. Why do you
compare your data with the already published data sets? Do you draw any further conclusions
out of that?
31 Again, I cannot follow you here. The number of matches ranges from 599 to 1129. This is not
reasonable similar. Please revise your wording.
39-40 “and the resulting hypotheses…” should not be a part of the discussion of the pipeline or
the matrix construction.
44 and following: You mention the overall better support in your analysis compared to former 3
to 5 gene analysis (yours which is not available and the one from Pola and Gosliner). This is not
really a surprise. When you look at older analyses using much less taxa, support values were
usually good. I do not doubt that transcriptome analyses will help in better understanding
evolution of many gastropod groups, but do not argue with high bootstrap values in your small
taxon set in favour for using phylogenomics. This may change so quickly as was shown
subsequently for so many analyses on molluscs and insects. By the way, you have queries again
that were also in Pola et al 2010: Position of the former Arminida, monophyly of Dendronotida.
Page 10
21 Dirona is not a Dendronotida, but is usually assigned to Arminida.
44 it might be exciting for you that Melibe is back again in the Cladobranchia. Melibe shows so
many characters of the Dendronotida, nobody would actually exclude it from the cladobranchs.
Probably because of its highly aberrant life style genes might have mutated in a fast way and then
of course, as a long branch effect, it groups with the outgroups when using only a few genes.
Page 11
13 and following. The discussion of the phylogenetic relationships has of course to be really
preliminary and I wonder whether it should be done at all. Since no evidences deriving from
morphological data are included which would verify or falsify the hypotheses presented here, I
would rather suggest to concentrate more on the methodology than on any “assumed” sister taxa
8
relationships, which will certainly change with the next following analyses. The strength in the
manuscript is the new methodology.
50 and following.: Again, I would not stress the high bootstrap support values again here.
Nobody doubts the immense step forward you do here, but do not conclude here already that
you finally got the“true tree” and nothing will change when you include the next taxa.

Phylogenomics based on RNA-Seq resolves relationships within Cladobranchia (Gastropoda:
Nudibranchia): An initial investigation.
By Goodheart et al.
General comments:
This is a well written and structured work about the phylogeny of a sub-clade of Nudibranchia
sea slugs, which has been under intense debate in recent times. The authors have used genomic
data and have generated 16 new transcriptomes. This phylogenomic approach yielded sound
9
results that helped to resolve long standing controversies, for example the monophyly of
Cladobranchia, one of the two main sub-clades of nudibranchs. The monophyly of Aeolidida was
recovered, whereas Euarminida was rendered paraphyletic in line with previous works. The
phylogenetically problematic genus Melibe was strongly supported as a member of the
Cladobranchia.
Given the complex and open status of the systematics of Cladobranchia with various authors
supporting different hypotheses that include the subdivision in Euarminida / Arminida,
Dendronotida, Aeolidida, and lineages of unassigned status, I would have like to see a discussion
about the putative impact of key missing taxa in the phylogenetic outcome. Therefore, I suggest
that this work before being accepted is complemented with a couple of paragraphs along the
Discussion highlighting the chief areas of controversy in the phylogeny of Cladobranchia and
how the limited taxon sampling included in this work contributes or fell short to resolve it. There
are obvious significant contributions (highlighted above), but apparently also some short comes
in this analysis. This does not hamper in anyway the relevance of this work, which is by all
means the most complete using transciptomic data available to date to resolve the phylogeny of
Nudibranchia.
I shall add that I am now an expert of the laboratorial and bioinformatic methods used by the
authors. Based on my limited expertise on the matter it looks well done and impressive.
Specific comments:
Introduction
On the second paragraph of the Introduction the authors made reference to a work [12] as being
one of the only two available on the phylogeny of Cladobranchia, but this is not yet accepted.
Because the first author of the present manuscript is also the first author of the aforementioned
article, they obviously have privileged access to the results of the investigation, but because it is
not yet accepted I don’t think it is correct to refer to it here. There is no way for us referees to
evaluate the work and compare it with the reasoning of the authors.
On the second line of the second page of the Introduction, the authors mentioned that citation
number 15 is a work based on the 18S gene. This is not correct. The work [15] is based on three
markers (18S + 16S + COI).
Methods
In the first paragraph of the Methods it is not clear whether the authors have generated
transcriptomes for one specimen of each of the 16 species or for two specimens. Please, make it
clear.
First line of second page of Methods: “….only a visual confirmation was used for
confirmation…”. Maybe change “confirmation” by inspection?
Revise throughout the Methods the use of hyphens versus dashes (e.g. 20–100mg; dash not
hyphen because it refers to a range).
The authors refer that samples were centrifuged at maximum speed. Please specify the speed?
Discussion
Again the reference number [12] is cited here but this has not yet been published.
As I have stressed in my General Comments I feel that the Discussion lacks a couple of
paragraphs about the key conflictive parts of the internal phylogeny of Cladobranchia and how
the present work contributes to resolve it and where does it fell short. This phylogenomic
approach is surely a very significant contribution to the phylogeny of Nudibranchia, but because
10
of its reduced taxon sampling, most likely cannot address several of the standing phylogenetic
conflicts of the phylogeny of these molluscs. Please, include a couple of paragraphs discussing
these aspects.

label_comment_4
“Phylogenomics based on RNA-Seq resolves relationships within Cladobranchia (Gastropoda:
Nudibranchia): An initial investigation” by Goodheart et al. is the first phylogenomic study on a
clade of sea slugs. The authors de novo sequenced 16 transcriptomes and follow a thorough
computational pipeline to analyze their data. So far, cladobranch phylogeny could not be
satisfactorily resolved based on morphological or molecular data relying on standard markers.
Thus, this “initial investigation” will be of broad interested in the community of sea slug
researchers and also to a broader audience as an example of the bioinformatic pipeline applied by
the authors. I clearly want to recommend this manuscript for publication in Royal Society Open
Science, but I do have some concerns (listed below), which the authors should revise prior to
publication:
1) The authors put much emphasis on their “resolved” phylogeny and the high bootstrap
support at most nodes. To my knowledge bootstrapping is an inappropriate measurement for
nodal support in phylogenomic studies, due to statistical errors in large data sets always resulting
in high bootstrap values (see e.g., Dell’Ampio et al. 2013 Mol Biol Evol doi:
10.1093/molbev/mst196). In my opinion this is again underlined by the present study which 100
BS to nearly all nodes even in partially contradicting topologies. I would therefore strongly
recommend to follow the authors’ own title “initial investigation” without over-emphasizing the
robustness of their phylogenetic hypothesis as this likely presents an artifact.
2) It is a pity that the authors do not attempt any discussion on the evolution of
Cladobranchia by discussing e.g. character evolution based on their data. I believe the study
could benefit from addressing the evolutionary history of the clade. Please also provide some
pictures of the taxa you are working with.
3) The authors missed to discuss the recent paper of Maguib & Valdes 2015 in Polar Biology
which includes a molecular phylogeny on Nudibranchia including Doridoxa (rare nudibranch
with controversially debated phylogenetic affinities). This study is highly relevant for the
11
manuscript and needs to be included. Also Schrödl et al. 2001 (Zoologischer Anzeiger) on basal
nudibranch phylogeny (There are a few other papers which should be included, see below).
4) To be honest, I find it quite annoying, when I realize that the authors rely on the
reviewers in doing a final proof reading on their paper, which they apparently didn’t want to
waste their precious time with. There are numerous mistakes in the reference list (actually in
every other citation= misspelled authors’ names, capitalization errors, incomplete references…).
Such errors should be corrected PRIOR to submission!
Comments to the text:
- Page 2: Abstract: “…members within this group, neither of which were successful.”
What is successful in systematics? Maybe better rephrase to “well supported evolutionary
hypotheses”
- Page 2: Keywords: I think Cladobranchia and Nudibranchia are obsolete as already in
the title
- Page 3, Introduction: “Defined by the presence of a diverticulated digestive gland,
Cladobranchia…” – this is a bit critical. There are representatives of Cladobranchia with
holohepathic digestive gland – and in absence of a phylogenetic hypothesis we don’t know
whether this is the basal or a secondarily derived stage within Cladobranchia
- Page 3, Introduction: Citation Nr. 3 is inappropriate. This paper is entirely on sea hares
(Aplysiomorpha)!!
- Page 3, Introduction: I fully agree that systematics is the science that underpins all other
fields of biology (and in parts also pharmacology), but I find it quite odd to address
pharmacology and climate change to directly justify the need of a phylogeny of Cladobranchia?
Why do we have to advertise our science by promising the realization of some economically
important potential? Your study is no contribution to biochemically interesting products nor to
monitoring of climate change, it does address the evolutionary history of a clade and it would be
nice to read some introduction to why THIS is interesting.
- Page 3, Introduction: in the ref. list it is stated that citation 12 is submitted not published
- Page 3, Introduction: I don’t see the justification of the selection of citations? I.e. Maguib
& Valdes 2015 needs to be included and if you address Euthyneuran phylogeny you should
consider including recent systematic advances (for summary see Wägele et al. 2013 in Organsims
Diversity and Evolution)
- Page 4, Introduction: Dendronotus - Ekimova et al. 2015 (Journal of the Linnean Society)
should be included here
- Page 4, Introduction: “exploration into the use of RNA-Seq data to resolve, with high
bootstrap support, the evolutionary relationships within Cladobranchia” – see my comment on
bootstrap values above…
- Page 4, Material and Methods: please justify your sampling strategy. Taxon sampling is
the most crucial step in compiling a phylogenetic study – for which reasons did you select the
present taxa?
- Page 4, Material and Methods: “On rare occasions only a visual confirmation was used
for confirmation” – replace the first confirmation by examination
- Page 4, Material and Methods: please include the voucher numbers of the museum in a
Table in the MS
- Page 4, Material and Methods: It is nice that you collected cnidarians and it is a pity that
none of the data is mentioned in the ms later on. Either provide some data or erase from Material
and methods.
- Page 6, Material and Methods: Shuttelworth, 2013 should be replaced by 34 and citation
is incomplete
- Page 7, Material and Methods: “Orthologous groups that showed evidence of paralogy
were discarded [48]” following the workflow of 48?
- Page 8, Phylogenetic results: “derived from all analyses” – I lost track… How many?
- Page 8, Phylogenetic results: Fig. 1. I think the manuscript would really benefit from
including some pictures of the taxa you are dealing with and aim for a nicer visualization of the
tree. I also don’t understand why Dirona and Janolous are classified as “Dendronotida”? Please
12
discuss! Since “Dendronotida” is paraphyletic there is no reason to include lineages which were
previously unassigned in Cladobranchia or classified as arminids
- Page 9, Discussion: “and the resulting hypotheses of relationships within Cladobranchia
are generally well supported” but partially conflicting!
- Page 9, Discussion: Phylogenetic inference of Cladobranchia has been a difficult part of
the larger problem of resolving the evolutionary history of Nudibranchia [11,12,15,18]. Please also
consider Martin et al. 2010 (Open Marine Biology Journal) which contains a reanalyses of the
Wägele & Willan phylogeny
- Page 9, Discussion: End of page, see my concerns on bootstrap values above
- Page 10, Discussion: I consider it impossible to “confirm monophyly of Cladobranchia”
without including any of the disputed taxa (e.g. Doridoxa) – based on your data, you haven’t
tested the monophyly
- Page 11, Discussion: the last two paragraphs really need to be thoroughly revised. At the
present stage they just repeat (again) the value of phylogenomics. A discussion on your
Cladobranch systematics needs a critical evaluation how many families are included/ missing,
which problematic taxa are missing which might change the hypothesis of this “initial study” etc.
etc. …

The paper “Phylogenomics based on RNA-Seq resolves relationships within Cladobranchia
(Gastropoda: Nudibranchia): An initial investigation” by Goodheart et al. presents a phylogeny
of a group of sea slugs based on several hundreds of genes.
This is an interesting paper that makes good use of newly generated transcriptomic data from 16
species of nudibranchs. Overall, the study is well designed, uses appropriate molecular lab
methods and provides a fully resolved cladobranch, which I anticipate would be useful to many
peers and the general readership of RS Open Science.
I have several comments that the authors may want to consider when revising the manuscript:
- I think the study is among the seminal ones applying NGS data to phylogenomics of
gastropods. However, I disagree with the authors in that it is a mere “Initial investigation” (Title)
or a “preliminary exploration” (page 4, line 34) but instead a nice full contribution that advances
what we know about the systematics of Cladobranchia. Hence, I encourage the authors to be less
modest and delete those statements.
- Page 6, line 5. The real name of the kit is “TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit”. Was the
sequencing pair-ended and if so 50, 75, 100PE?
- Page 6, line 15. What was the minimum size of the transcript (contig) selected in Trinity?
Have the authors used any measure on how “good” was the assembly process? For instance, can
they report on the completeness of the assembled transcriptomes by comparison with the
CEGMA core protein set?
- Page 6, line 18. In my view, homology is similarity by descent and thus can only be
assessed through phylogenetic analyses (as performed later in the study). This “orthology
detection” is performed using similarity searches; hence, here I would suggest using “tentative”,
“preliminary”, etc. and “assignment” instead of ”detection”.
- Page 8, line 21. Could you generate for the supplementary material a pairwise matrix
showing how many of the 839 genes were present in the different species? Could you comment in
the corresponding section of the discussion whether the phylogenetic analyses could be
influenced/ biased by the 54-77% of gaps in the sequence matrices?
- Phylogenetic trees. Could you discuss on those nodes that are incompatible in the two
reconstructed trees but highly supported and to what extent the high support of the nodes maybe
misleading in phylogenomics (see Salichos and Rokas, 2013 Nature 497: 327-331)?
- Discussion. I miss a more thorough comparison of present results with those obtained in
reference #12, particularly taking into account that this reference is mentioned but not published
yet, and the reader does not know anything about it. Are the results of both studies congruent
despite the different in number of taxa and source of sequence data? Also, other relevant papers
that may be considered/ mentioned in the introduction and/ or discussion are: Bertsch et al.

Phylogenomics based on RNA-Seq resolves relationships within Cladobranchia (Gastropoda:
Nudibranchia): An initial investigation.
15
By Goodheart et al.
General comments:
This is a well written and structured work about the phylogeny of a sub-clade of Nudibranchia
sea slugs, which has been under intense debate in recent times. The authors have used genomic
data and have generated 16 new transcriptomes. This phylogenomic approach yielded sound
results that helped to resolve long standing controversies, for example the monophyly of
Cladobranchia, one of the two main sub-clades of nudibranchs. The monophyly of Aeolidida was
recovered, whereas Euarminida was rendered paraphyletic in line with previous works. The
phylogenetically problematic genus Melibe was strongly supported as a member of the
Cladobranchia.
Given the complex and open status of the systematics of Cladobranchia with various authors
supporting different hypotheses that include the subdivision in Euarminida / Arminida,
Dendronotida, Aeolidida, and lineages of unassigned status, I would have like to see a discussion
about the putative impact of key missing taxa in the phylogenetic outcome. Therefore, I suggest
that this work before being accepted is complemented with a couple of paragraphs along the
Discussion highlighting the chief areas of controversy in the phylogeny of Cladobranchia and
how the limited taxon sampling included in this work contributes or fell short to resolve it. There
are obvious significant contributions (highlighted above), but apparently also some short comes
in this analysis. This does not hamper in anyway the relevance of this work, which is by all
means the most complete using transciptomic data available to date to resolve the phylogeny of
Nudibranchia.
I shall add that I am now an expert of the laboratorial and bioinformatic methods used by the
authors. Based on my limited expertise on the matter it looks well done and impressive.
Specific comments:
Introduction
On the second paragraph of the Introduction the authors made reference to a work [12] as being
one of the only two available on the phylogeny of Cladobranchia, but this is not yet accepted.
Because the first author of the present manuscript is also the first author of the aforementioned
article, they obviously have privileged access to the results of the investigation, but because it is
not yet accepted I don’t think it is correct to refer to it here. There is no way for us referees to
evaluate the work and compare it with the reasoning of the authors.
On the second line of the second page of the Introduction, the authors mentioned that citation
number 15 is a work based on the 18S gene. This is not correct. The work [15] is based on three
markers (18S + 16S + COI).
Methods
In the first paragraph of the Methods it is not clear whether the authors have generated
transcriptomes for one specimen of each of the 16 species or for two specimens. Please, make it
clear.
First line of second page of Methods: “….only a visual confirmation was used for
confirmation…”. Maybe change “confirmation” by inspection?
Revise throughout the Methods the use of hyphens versus dashes (e.g. 20–100mg; dash not
hyphen because it refers to a range).
The authors refer that samples were centrifuged at maximum speed. Please specify the speed?
16
Discussion
Again the reference number [12] is cited here but this has not yet been published.
As I have stressed in my General Comments I feel that the Discussion lacks a couple of
paragraphs about the key conflictive parts of the internal phylogeny of Cladobranchia and how
the present work contributes to resolve it and where does it fell short. This phylogenomic
approach is surely a very significant contribution to the phylogeny of Nudibranchia, but because
of its reduced taxon sampling, most likely cannot address several of the standing phylogenetic
conflicts of the phylogeny of these molluscs. Please, include a couple of paragraphs discussing
these aspects.

Goodheart et al.
Phylogenomics based on RNA-Seq resolves relationships within Cladobranchia (Gastropoda:
Nudibranchia): An initial investigation
This is an interesting manuscript since it deals with large transcriptomic data analysing
phylogenetic relationship within a rather small taxon. Therefore it is certainly of interest, even on
a broader aspect, since it shows that transcriptomes might not only be used in analysing deeper
metazoan nodes. However there are several aspects that the authors have to consider and take
into consideration.
Some concerns are with regard to methodology, but major problems are with the remarks on
evolution based on the tree of Cladobranchia which the authors discuss from the few taxa
analysis.
In the following are my comments: the number indicate the line
Title and in general:
Although you write in the title that this is an initial investigation, in the first part it is said that
you resolved the Cladobranch tree. I would rather title it: “An initial phylotranscriptomic study
to analyse relationships within Cladobranchia.” You have considered 17 genera (from 10
families) out of nearly 60 recognized families (World Register of Marine Species). There are more
than a hundred valid genera. With this small dataset presented here you can not “resolve”
cladobranch relationships.
Do not use the word “resolve” at all for a purely phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenies reflect
historical processes which can not be resolved but only supported by evidences – for example by
morphological data. You mean that the algorithms actually depict a tree that, we assume , reflects
evolution. Therefore a tree is a hypothesis and can not “resolve” any relationships. The trees you
present depict Cladobranchia as monophyletic. Whether they really are, we will never know for
sure. BS do not give evidence for monophyly. They show the redundancy of a certain character
pattern in a given data set. They are a measure of repeatability, not a measure of correctness.
Please consider this also in the rest of the manuscript.
You produce a number of intermediate results which depend on a deliberate choice of programs
and their parameters. However, in most cases you do not specify them. Please also consider
making all your data, including important intermediate results, publicly available.

Abstract
Page 2
23 You mention only 19 taxa. What about number 20?
Introduction.
Page 3
8 Cladobranchia is not defined by the loss of the shell. This feature is a synapomorphy of the
Nudibranchia.
24 Zalypsis is not a very good example, since it is a synthetically one. At least you could name the
taxa where the alkaloids come from.
28 “Conspicuous”: Nudibranchs usually are only conspicuous when you have them in a vial
under the microscope. As soon as you search for them in their native habitat they are rather
cryptic.
What do you mean with “nudibranchs within Cladobranchia”? Cladobranchs are within
Nudibranchia.
36 You refer here to a submitted manuscript. This can only be done when it is in press. You refer
several times to this manuscript and it is difficult for me to follow arguments when there is no
access to this paper. I would suggest to remove all references to this manuscript unless it is
available.
Page 4
16 Major contributions of Carmona et al 2014 on Baeolidia and Berghia are missing.
31 It is not inefficiency when three or five genes cannot be used to infer the relationship of three
hundred taxa. A method can be inefficient. Here, the data (or the lack of it) is the problem, not the
method. I would call this insufficiency.
36 please do not use the word “resolve” for a phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenies reflect historical
processes which can not be resolved but only supported by evidences (see above)
Methods
In general, please refer to all included tables and figures in your text and be much more specific
with regard to programs and settings.
Page 5
3 on rare occasions – what were these rare occasions? Did you do barcoding for confirmation of
identification or not? This is not clear. If you did, please give more details. Did you use a Blast
search in NCBI or BOLD to confirm your identification? For more transparency, you could
actually mention the species with the best hits to your target species. Please also name the sources
you used for identification, especially when barcoding was not applied.
7 At what temperatures were the samples kept between the preservation in RNAlater and
freezing?
18
15 Why do you mention the substrate the animals were collected from? Is this important here?
Did you do any identification on these too?
44 What is the max speed you have used?
Page 6
3 Please mention the criteria that qualified your RNA samples for library preparation.
5 Which version of Illumina’s TruSeq kit did you use? You should mention that you have
sequenced paired-end reads (according to Table S1), if this is the case. What insert sizes were
used in the PE sequencing?
10 Please mention the version number (or date of download if not applicable) of autoadapt. This
also applies for all other programs, web services and published scripts you have used (HaMStR,
BLAST, FASTA, Mafft etc).
21-33 Please be more specific about the used parameters for the HaMStR search, i.e., provide the
used flags and other settings if they differ from the default values. You should do this for every
program and web service you have used.
28 10 to the power of 1 is 10. The last time I checked, HaMStR had a default cut-off of 1 for the
HMM search. Please double check this.
31 What E-value cut-off did you apply?
33 Why did you substitute FASTA? Please explain
39 How many clusters did you download?
42 I do not understand the switch from 50% to 70% similarity. Please state clearly what is meant
here.
52 Please provide more information why you have created your own substitution matrix. Did
you test whether the GASTRO50 matrix is more suitable than, for example, a Blosum62 matrix?
What are the basic properties of your matrix? In order to make your results better reproducible
you should publish the matrix along with the supplementary material.
55 Please give more details about the results of this procedure. How many blocks were in the
blocks output file? How many amino acid positions? What is the meaning of “1 seq=1388”? Did
the block contain 1388 amino acid positions?
Page 7
10 Which alignment strategy did you use? Please provide more details which parameters were
used (see comment above). Furthermore, how did you convert the amino acid sequences into
nucleotide alignments? If you have used a custom script, please consider publishing it along with
the supplementary material.
16 Why did you settle for at least four representatives? This is only one-fifth of your samples and
makes your matrix extremely sparse (see also below). Have you considered increasing this
number?
19
18 This sentence is confusing. If you remove positions, the matrix obviously does not contain the
original nucleotides sequenced at each site. What is meant by “sequenced at each site”?
30 – 49 this is extremely confusing. You should also refer here already to the figures, because one
gets completely lost, which analysis is performed with what kind of output. Include a table for
the various analyses, that might help. How you created the partitioned data sets should be part of
the paragraph above this one.
32 Default setting of web services can change without documentation. Please provide exact
details on how you did the analysis and what parameter settings were used. For example, was
the proportion of invariant sites fixed or estimated? How did you treat the equilibrium state
frequencies? These details are important to reproduce your results.
44 What kind of post-processing did you do apart from the construction of the BS consensus
trees?
48 Sentence is weird. I assume you follow protocol of Regier et al. , therefore name the authors.
Please mention in the results how many replicates were finally done for each data set.
57 Please include the official SRR accessions of your sequences in the supplementary tables.
Page 8
9-21 Your numbers (number of transcripts, N50, HaMStR matches) are only based on the newly
sequenced transcriptomic data. However you have assembled and annotated four published data
sets. Please include them in the description of your data.
13 What do you mean by “unique loci”? Are those the loci which did not show paraphyly? Are
those the “orthologous groups” which were used for further analyses?
15 According to your table, 184 is not the mean length of matching sequences – it’s the minimum
length. Please double check all your numbers and how you refer to them.
18 You started with 3854 orthologous groups and had to remove 3015 because of evidence of
paralogy – is this correct? If you had to remove some of the groups because of other reasons,
please mention this.
25 Our phylogenetic trees resolved Cladobranchia as a monophyletic group. Wording is not
correct (see also above). A tree can not “resolve” any relationships. Please consider this also in the
rest of the manuscript (e.g. in line 31, 36, 44, 55 and so on)
I was astonished to see Bathydoris as sistergroup to Cladobranchia, although with a very low
bootstrap. I wonder which alternatives have come out in your analyses. Actually there are only
few options for Bathydoris to group with: It must have grouped with the outgroup to a high
extent, because the expected alternative with Doris is not indicated at all and therefore must even
be below the 34 or 40 bootstrap value respectively.
31 Trying to analyse evolution of a group via assessing phylogenetic trees I would not use
hierarchical termini like “infraorder”. You probably got this information from the World Register
of Marine Species. This is ok for systematists and taxonomists, but makes no sense in
phylogenetic trees.
20
Discussion
Page 9
15 You declare the examination of potential methodological concerns. Although this would be
very interesting, I can’t find any of this in the discussion. Please elaborate on this topic.
16 Leave out this whole sentence “ Finally…..effect of these results on the current understanding
of the evolutionary history of Cladobranchia”. This is definitely too early and you bring no
evidences from other data sets that would support your conclusions anyway.
28 I can’t follow you here. For example, Berghia stephanieae has a higher number of transcripts
than most of the already published data sets. Please revise your wording here. Why do you
compare your data with the already published data sets? Do you draw any further conclusions
out of that?
31 Again, I cannot follow you here. The number of matches ranges from 599 to 1129. This is not
reasonable similar. Please revise your wording.
39-40 “and the resulting hypotheses…” should not be a part of the discussion of the pipeline or
the matrix construction.
44 and following: You mention the overall better support in your analysis compared to former 3
to 5 gene analysis (yours which is not available and the one from Pola and Gosliner). This is not
really a surprise. When you look at older analyses using much less taxa, support values were
usually good. I do not doubt that transcriptome analyses will help in better understanding
evolution of many gastropod groups, but do not argue with high bootstrap values in your small
taxon set in favour for using phylogenomics. This may change so quickly as was shown
subsequently for so many analyses on molluscs and insects. By the way, you have queries again
that were also in Pola et al 2010: Position of the former Arminida, monophyly of Dendronotida.
Page 10
21 Dirona is not a Dendronotida, but is usually assigned to Arminida.
44 it might be exciting for you that Melibe is back again in the Cladobranchia. Melibe shows so
many characters of the Dendronotida, nobody would actually exclude it from the cladobranchs.
Probably because of its highly aberrant life style genes might have mutated in a fast way and then
of course, as a long branch effect, it groups with the outgroups when using only a few genes.
Page 11
13 and following. The discussion of the phylogenetic relationships has of course to be really
preliminary and I wonder whether it should be done at all. Since no evidences deriving from
morphological data are included which would verify or falsify the hypotheses presented here, I
would rather suggest to concentrate more on the methodology than on any “assumed” sister taxa
relationships, which will certainly change with the next following analyses. The strength in the
manuscript is the new methodology.
50 and following.: Again, I would not stress the high bootstrap support values again here.
Nobody doubts the immense step forward you do here, but do not conclude here already that
you finally got the“true tree” and nothing will change when you include the next taxa.
21

Please make sure that the references you are using are correct. For example, [10] is incomplete,

citations).

Comments to the Author(s)
“Phylogenomics based on RNA-Seq resolves relationships within Cladobranchia (Gastropoda:
Nudibranchia): An initial investigation” by Goodheart et al. is the first phylogenomic study on a
clade of sea slugs. The authors de novo sequenced 16 transcriptomes and follow a thorough
computational pipeline to analyze their data. So far, cladobranch phylogeny could not be
satisfactorily resolved based on morphological or molecular data relying on standard markers.
Thus, this “initial investigation” will be of broad interested in the community of sea slug
researchers and also to a broader audience as an example of the bioinformatic pipeline applied by
the authors. I clearly want to recommend this manuscript for publication in Royal Society Open
Science, but I do have some concerns (listed below), which the authors should revise prior to
publication:
1) The authors put much emphasis on their “resolved” phylogeny and the high bootstrap
support at most nodes. To my knowledge bootstrapping is an inappropriate measurement for
nodal support in phylogenomic studies, due to statistical errors in large data sets always resulting
in high bootstrap values (see e.g., Dell’Ampio et al. 2013 Mol Biol Evol doi:
10.1093/molbev/mst196). In my opinion this is again underlined by the present study which 100
BS to nearly all nodes even in partially contradicting topologies. I would therefore strongly
recommend to follow the authors’ own title “initial investigation” without over-emphasizing the
robustness of their phylogenetic hypothesis as this likely presents an artifact.
2) It is a pity that the authors do not attempt any discussion on the evolution of
Cladobranchia by discussing e.g. character evolution based on their data. I believe the study
could benefit from addressing the evolutionary history of the clade. Please also provide some
pictures of the taxa you are working with.
3) The authors missed to discuss the recent paper of Maguib & Valdes 2015 in Polar Biology
which includes a molecular phylogeny on Nudibranchia including Doridoxa (rare nudibranch
with controversially debated phylogenetic affinities). This study is highly relevant for the
manuscript and needs to be included. Also Schrödl et al. 2001 (Zoologischer Anzeiger) on basal
nudibranch phylogeny (There are a few other papers which should be included, see below).
4) To be honest, I find it quite annoying, when I realize that the authors rely on the
reviewers in doing a final proof reading on their paper, which they apparently didn’t want to
waste their precious time with. There are numerous mistakes in the reference list (actually in
every other citation= misspelled authors’ names, capitalization errors, incomplete references…).
Such errors should be corrected PRIOR to submission!
Comments to the text:
- Page 2: Abstract: “…members within this group, neither of which were successful.”
What is successful in systematics? Maybe better rephrase to “well supported evolutionary
hypotheses”
22
- Page 2: Keywords: I think Cladobranchia and Nudibranchia are obsolete as already in
the title
- Page 3, Introduction: “Defined by the presence of a diverticulated digestive gland,
Cladobranchia…” – this is a bit critical. There are representatives of Cladobranchia with
holohepathic digestive gland – and in absence of a phylogenetic hypothesis we don’t know
whether this is the basal or a secondarily derived stage within Cladobranchia
- Page 3, Introduction: Citation Nr. 3 is inappropriate. This paper is entirely on sea hares
(Aplysiomorpha)!!
- Page 3, Introduction: I fully agree that systematics is the science that underpins all other
fields of biology (and in parts also pharmacology), but I find it quite odd to address
pharmacology and climate change to directly justify the need of a phylogeny of Cladobranchia?
Why do we have to advertise our science by promising the realization of some economically
important potential? Your study is no contribution to biochemically interesting products nor to
monitoring of climate change, it does address the evolutionary history of a clade and it would be
nice to read some introduction to why THIS is interesting.
- Page 3, Introduction: in the ref. list it is stated that citation 12 is submitted not published
- Page 3, Introduction: I don’t see the justification of the selection of citations? I.e. Maguib

consider including recent systematic advances (for summary see Wägele et al. 2013 in Organsims

including some pictures of the taxa you are dealing with and aim for a nicer visualization of the
tree. I also don’t understand why Dirona and Janolous are classified as “Dendronotida”? Please
discuss! Since “Dendronotida” is paraphyletic there is no reason to include lineages which were
previously unassigned in Cladobranchia or classified as arminids
- Page 9, Discussion: “and the resulting hypotheses of relationships within Cladobranchia
are generally well supported” but partially conflicting!
- Page 9, Discussion: Phylogenetic inference of Cladobranchia has been a difficult part of

Wägele & Willan phylogeny

- Page 10, Discussion: I consider it impossible to “confirm monophyly of Cladobranchia”
without including any of the disputed taxa (e.g. Doridoxa) – based on your data, you haven’t
tested the monophyly

- Page 11, Discussion: the last two paragraphs really need to be thoroughly revised. At the
present stage they just repeat (again) the value of phylogenomics. A discussion on your
Cladobranch systematics needs a critical evaluation how many families are included/ missing,
which problematic taxa are missing which might change the hypothesis of this “initial study” etc.
etc. …

ponse to Reviewer Comments (manuscript RSOS-150196):
iewer #1: I think the study is among the seminal ones applying NGS data to phylogenomics
astropods. However, I disagree with the authors in that it is a mere “Initial investigation”
le) or a “preliminary exploration” (page 4, line 34) but instead a nice full contribution that
ances what we know about the systematics of Cladobranchia. Hence, I encourage the authors
e less modest and delete those statements.
ponse: The title has been revised. We plan to continue on this trajectory and include
itional taxa along with potential pipeline adjustments to maximize useful transcript
ments. As such, this is a preliminary study to us, and to other reviewers as indicated by
ments below, and the language used reflects that.
e 6, line 5. The real name of the kit is “TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit”. Was the
uencing pair-ended and if so 50, 75, 100PE?
ponse: The name of the kit was amended to “TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit,” and the
uencing was 100 base pair paired-end reads. A statement was added to this effect.
e 6, line 15. What was the minimum size of the transcript (contig) selected in Trinity? Have
authors used any measure on how “good” was the assembly process? For instance, can they
ort on the completeness of the assembled transcriptomes by comparison with the CEGMA
e protein set?
ponse: For the Trinity assembly process the minimum size of the contig was set at 200
leotides, which was the Trinity default value. This is now stated in the methods section. As to
measure of how “good” the assembly process was, we used the N50 and the number of
ches to unique orthologous groups as a guide. A poorly assembled transcriptome would have
N50 values and a low number of matches when comparing assembled transcripts to genes in
reference database, indicating possible issues with assembly. HaMStR statistics are now
n in Table 2.
e 6, line 18. In my view, homology is similarity by descent and thus can only be assessed
ugh phylogenetic analyses (as performed later in the study). This “orthology detection” is
ormed using similarity searches; hence, here I would suggest using “tentative”,
eliminary”, etc. and “assignment” instead of ”detection”.
ponse: The word “detection” was replaced with “assignment.” We believe that this usage
cessfully indicates that the orthologous groups are assigned based on particular criteria, and
by no means definitive tests of homology.
e 8, line 21. Could you generate for the supplementary material a pairwise matrix showing
many of the 839 genes were present in the different species? Could you comment in the
responding section of the discussion whether the phylogenetic analyses could be influenced/
ed by the 54-77% of gaps in the sequence matrices?
ponse: We have added a table (Table 2) that contains the information regarding the number
enes out of 839 that were included for each species in the final data matrices. Additionally, a
graph was added to the discussion regarding the influence of missing data.
logenetic trees. Could you discuss on those nodes that are incompatible in the two
onstructed trees but highly supported and to what extent the high support of the nodes maybe
leading in phylogenomics (see Salichos and Rokas, 2013 Nature 497: 327-331)?
ponse: We have revised the manuscript by adding a discussion of the conflict between the
reconstructions, and discussion regarding possible misleading results as mentioned in
chos and Rokas (2013).
cussion. I miss a more thorough comparison of present results with those obtained in
rence #12, particularly taking into account that this reference is mentioned but not published
and the reader does not know anything about it. Are the results of both studies congruent
pite the different in number of taxa and source of sequence data? Also, other relevant papers
may be considered/ mentioned in the introduction and/ or discussion are: Bertsch et al.
09) Proc. Cal Acad Sci 60 (12) 431-446 on Tritoniidae and Gosliner and Fahey (2011) Zool.
inn Soc 161: 245-356 on Dermatobranchus.
ponse: Reference 12 has now been published online and a DOI number is included. The
lts of that study have been compared with the present results in the discussion. Mention of
tsch et al. (2009) was added to the introduction. Gosliner and Fahey (2011) is mentioned in
introduction in regards to Arminidae rather than solely Dermatobranchus.
iewer #2: This is a well written and structured work about the phylogeny of a sub-clade of
ibranchia sea slugs, which has been under intense debate in recent times. The authors have
d genomic data and have generated 16 new transcriptomes. This phylogenomic approach
ded sound results that helped to resolve long standing controversies, for example the
ophyly of Cladobranchia, one of the two main sub-clades of nudibranchs. The monophyly of
lidida was recovered, whereas Euarminida was rendered paraphyletic in line with previous
ks. The phylogenetically problematic genus Melibe was strongly supported as a member of
Cladobranchia.
en the complex and open status of the systematics of Cladobranchia with various authors
porting different hypotheses that include the subdivision in Euarminida / Arminida,
dronotida, Aeolidida, and lineages of unassigned status, I would have like to see a
ussion about the putative impact of key missing taxa in the phylogenetic outcome. Therefore,
ggest that this work before being accepted is complemented with a couple of paragraphs
ng the Discussion highlighting the chief areas of controversy in the phylogeny of
dobranchia and how the limited taxon sampling included in this work contributes or fell short
esolve it. There are obvious significant contributions (highlighted above), but apparently also
e short comes in this analysis. This does not hamper in anyway the relevance of this work,
ch is by all means the most complete using transciptomic data available to date to resolve the
logeny of Nudibranchia.
all add that I am now an expert of the laboratorial and bioinformatic methods used by the
hors. Based on my limited expertise on the matter it looks well done and impressive.
the second paragraph of the Introduction the authors made reference to a work [12] as being
of the only two available on the phylogeny of Cladobranchia, but this is not yet accepted.
ause the first author of the present manuscript is also the first author of the aforementioned
cle, they obviously have privileged access to the results of the investigation, but because it is
yet accepted I don’t think it is correct to refer to it here. There is no way for us referees to
luate the work and compare it with the reasoning of the authors.
ponse: This manuscript has now been published online and the DOI has been provided.
the second line of the second page of the Introduction, the authors mentioned that citation
ber 15 is a work based on the 18S gene. This is not correct. The work [15] is based on three
kers (18S + 16S + COI).
ponse: The sentence was updated to include the 16S and COI genes. “…based on the 18S,
and COI genes, suggested that Aeolidida is monophyletic and both Dendronotida and
rminida were paraphyletic.”
he first paragraph of the Methods it is not clear whether the authors have generated
scriptomes for one specimen of each of the 16 species or for two specimens. Please, make it
r.
ponse: The paragraph was updated to include the sentence, “This included one individual
d for RNA-Seq and one individual preserved as a voucher and deposited in the Smithsonian
ional Museum of Natural History (NMNH).”
t line of second page of Methods: “….only a visual confirmation was used for
firmation…”. Maybe change “confirmation” by inspection?
ponse: Changed to examination.
ise throughout the Methods the use of hyphens versus dashes (e.g. 20–100mg; dash not
hen because it refers to a range).
ponse: The hyphens were replaced with dashes in the instances that we were referring to a
icular range (20–100 mg, 1–2 minutes and 10–30 µL).
authors refer that samples were centrifuged at maximum speed. Please specify the speed?
ponse: The maximum speed was added (17,200 g).
in the reference number [12] is cited here but this has not yet been published.
ponse: This manuscript has now been published online and the DOI has been provided.
have stressed in my General Comments I feel that the Discussion lacks a couple of
agraphs about the key conflictive parts of the internal phylogeny of Cladobranchia and how
present work contributes to resolve it and where does it fell short. This phylogenomic
roach is surely a very significant contribution to the phylogeny of Nudibranchia, but because
s reduced taxon sampling, most likely cannot address several of the standing phylogenetic
flicts of the phylogeny of these molluscs. Please, include a couple of paragraphs discussing
e aspects.
ponse: The points of conflict are described in the discussion.
iewer #3: This is an interesting manuscript since it deals with large transcriptomic data
lysing phylogenetic relationship within a rather small taxon. Therefore it is certainly of
rest, even on a broader aspect, since it shows that transcriptomes might not only be used in
lysing deeper metazoan nodes. However there are several aspects that the authors have to
sider and take into consideration.
e concerns are with regard to methodology, but major problems are with the remarks on
lution based on the tree of Cladobranchia which the authors discuss from the few taxa
lysis.
he following are my comments: the number indicate the line
e and in general:
ough you write in the title that this is an initial investigation, in the first part it is said that
resolved the Cladobranch tree. I would rather title it: “An initial phylotranscriptomic study
nalyse relationships within Cladobranchia.” You have considered 17 genera (from 10
ilies) out of nearly 60 recognized families (World Register of Marine Species). There are
e than a hundred valid genera. With this small dataset presented here you can not “resolve”
obranch relationships.
ponse: The title has been revised to avoid use of the term “resolve,” in order to prevent
understandings.
not use the word “resolve” at all for a purely phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenies reflect
orical processes which can not be resolved but only supported by evidences – for example by
phological data. You mean that the algorithms actually depict a tree that, we assume ,
ects evolution. Therefore a tree is a hypothesis and can not “resolve” any relationships. The
s you present depict Cladobranchia as monophyletic. Whether they really are, we will never
w for sure. BS do not give evidence for monophyly. They show the redundancy of a certain
racter pattern in a given data set. They are a measure of repeatability, not a measure of
rectness. Please consider this also in the rest of the manuscript.
ponse: The term “resolved” has been replaced with more appropriate terminology throughout
rly all of the manuscript. However, we have left it in a small number of instances where we
uss whether a particular tree topology is well resolved. "Well resolved", insofar as we use it,
rs to the ability of the data to provide a strong phylogenetic hypothesis without polytomies.
produce a number of intermediate results which depend on a deliberate choice of programs
their parameters. However, in most cases you do not specify them. Please also consider
ing all your data, including important intermediate results, publicly available.
ponse: Additional detail regarding software options and parameters is contained in the
sed manuscript. Additionally, we are making our alignments, custom substitution matrix and
scriptomes available.
tract

You mention only 19 taxa. What about number 20?
ponse: The missing taxon is now included. “We sequenced 16 transcriptomes, and combined
e with four transcriptomes from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA).”
oduction.
e 3
ladobranchia is not defined by the loss of the shell. This feature is a synapomorphy of the
ibranchia.
ponse: This definition was meant to refer to Nudibranchia, but the sentence structure was not
r. We have adjusted the wording of this sentence to make it easier to understand.
Zalypsis is not a very good example, since it is a synthetically one. At least you could name
taxa where the alkaloids come from.
ponse: A specific taxon has been included at the appropriate point in the revised manuscript.
“Conspicuous”: Nudibranchs usually are only conspicuous when you have them in a vial
er the microscope. As soon as you search for them in their native habitat they are rather
ptic.
ponse: Not necessarily true. There are many nudibranchs that are often easy to detect. One of
most obvious that comes to mind (among others) is Flabellina iodinea, a commonly found
ibranch in California, of which there are hundreds of pictures on sites such as iNaturalist that
e been taken by amateurs. There are certainly others that are often seen by SCUBA divers
people that visit tide pools.
at do you mean with “nudibranchs within Cladobranchia”? Cladobranchs are within
ibranchia.
ponse: In this case we are referring to the species of nudibranchs that are specifically
sidered to be members of Cladobranchia; we are excluding members of Anthobranchia in this
ence. We have edited this sentence for clarity: “However, in order to fully realize the
ntial of nudibranch species that are considered members of Cladobranchia, a solid
erstanding of the evolutionary history of this group is necessary.”
You refer here to a submitted manuscript. This can only be done when it is in press. You refer
ral times to this manuscript and it is difficult for me to follow arguments when there is no
ess to this paper. I would suggest to remove all references to this manuscript unless it is
ilable.
ponse: This manuscript has now been published online and the DOI has been provided.
e 4
Major contributions of Carmona et al 2014 on Baeolidia and Berghia are missing.
ponse: Our revised manuscript now explicitly mentions the work of Carmona et al..
t is not inefficiency when three or five genes cannot be used to infer the relationship of three
dred taxa. A method can be inefficient. Here, the data (or the lack of it) is the problem, not
method. I would call this insufficiency.
ponse: Changed from “inefficient” to “insufficient.”
lease do not use the word “resolve” for a phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenies reflect
orical processes which can not be resolved but only supported by evidences (see above)
ponse: In our revised manuscript we have restricted our use of resolve to a very few instances
re a narrow meaning of this word is appropriate.
hods
eneral, please refer to all included tables and figures in your text and be much more specific
regard to programs and settings.
ponse: All figures and tables are now referred to in the text. We have also revised the text to
more explicit about the programs and settings we used.

rare occasions – what were these rare occasions? Did you do barcoding for confirmation of
tification or not? This is not clear. If you did, please give more details. Did you use a Blast
rch in NCBI or BOLD to confirm your identification? For more transparency, you could
ally mention the species with the best hits to your target species. Please also name the
rces you used for identification, especially when barcoding was not applied.
ponse: This particular text has been removed and the specifics regarding identification of
cies has been more fully described in the revised manusript.
what temperatures were the samples kept between the preservation in RNAlater and
zing?
ponse: Much more detailed information regarding storage temperatures of sampled material
rovided in the revised manuscript.
Why do you mention the substrate the animals were collected from? Is this important here?
you do any identification on these too?
ponse: We have eliminated this extraneous detail in the revised manuscript.
What is the max speed you have used?
ponse: We now describe the gravitational force associated rather than speed (e.g., in this
ance 17,200 g).
e 6
ease mention the criteria that qualified your RNA samples for library preparation.
ponse: The revised manuscript now included explicit description of RNA quality used to
rmine of a sample meets the criteria for library construction.
hich version of Illumina’s TruSeq kit did you use? You should mention that you have
uenced paired-end reads (according to Table S1), if this is the case. What insert sizes were
d in the PE sequencing?
ponse: Specific kit version information has been added to the revised manuscript.
Please mention the version number (or date of download if not applicable) of autoadapt. This
applies for all other programs, web services and published scripts you have used (HaMStR,
ST, FASTA, Mafft etc).
ponse: The revised manuscript now includes version numbers for all software used.
33 Please be more specific about the used parameters for the HaMStR search, i.e., provide
used flags and other settings if they differ from the default values. You should do this for
ry program and web service you have used.
ponse: All HaMStR settings are described in the text. We have taken care to mention that
ult settings were used for other programs, and have added additional information about non-
ult settings where applicable.
0 to the power of 1 is 10. The last time I checked, HaMStR had a default cut-off of 1 for the
M search. Please double check this.
ponse: We have corrected the HaMStR default value for the HMM search, and we have
ed the default value for the BLAST search.
What E-value cut-off did you apply?
ponse: We used 1e-05; this is now clearly stated in the text of the revised manuscript.
Why did you substitute FASTA? Please explain
ponse: This is now explained in the revised manuscript: “we substituted FASTA for BLAST
ause it readily accepted our custom substitution matrix (GASTRO50)”.
How many clusters did you download?
ponse: The number of clusters (39,403) is now stated in the text of the revised manuscript.
do not understand the switch from 50% to 70% similarity. Please state clearly what is meant
e.
ponse: Additional detail to explain this has been added to the text of the revised manusript.
Please provide more information why you have created your own substitution matrix. Did you
whether the GASTRO50 matrix is more suitable than, for example, a Blosum62 matrix?
at are the basic properties of your matrix? In order to make your results better reproducible
should publish the matrix along with the supplementary material.
ponse: No explicit tests were done for this particular custom substitution matrix. However, in
aitre et al. [2], use of a custom substitution matrix was shown to be advantageous. We have
provided the matrix with our supplementary material so that others can examine, evaluate
/or use it.
Please give more details about the results of this procedure. How many blocks were in the
ks output file? How many amino acid positions? What is the meaning of “1 seq=1388”? Did
block contain 1388 amino acid positions?
ponse: We have added details about the number of blocks and number of amino acid
itions. “seq=1388” indicated that the block contained 1,388 sequences; we have revised the
to make this more clear.
e 7
Which alignment strategy did you use? Please provide more details which parameters were
d (see comment above). Furthermore, how did you convert the amino acid sequences into
leotide alignments? If you have used a custom script, please consider publishing it along with
supplementary material.
ponse: We have specified the alignment algorithm used, and that we used a custom Perl
pt for alignment conversion. We have decided not to publish the script associated with this
cedure, as it is part of a larger script used for data matrix construction that is highly
syncratic for our setup.
Why did you settle for at least four representatives? This is only one-fifth of your samples and
es your matrix extremely sparse (see also below). Have you considered increasing this
ber?
ponse: Yes, but a site that has at least four representatives has the potential to be
logenetically informative. Increasing this number results in removing sites from the analysis
could be informative. In the revised manuscript we have provided results from additional
lyses with less sparse data matrices in supplemental information.
This sentence is confusing. If you remove positions, the matrix obviously does not contain the
inal nucleotides sequenced at each site. What is meant by “sequenced at each site”?
ponse: This sentence was removed to increase clarity of the revised manscript.
49 this is extremely confusing. You should also refer here already to the figures, because
gets completely lost, which analysis is performed with what kind of output. Include a table
the various analyses, that might help. How you created the partitioned data sets should be
t of the paragraph above this one.
ponse: We have revised the text for clarity and now refer to the supplementary figures. The
itioning of the data matrices is only relevant in the context of the phylogenetic analyses, as
partitioning scheme is specified only when running the analysis, not within the matrix itself.
this reason, we have left the information regarding partitioning in this section.
Default setting of web services can change without documentation. Please provide exact
ils on how you did the analysis and what parameter settings were used. For example, was
proportion of invariant sites fixed or estimated? How did you treat the equilibrium state
uencies? These details are important to reproduce your results.
ponse: The default settings mentioned here are not those of the web service, but of GARLI.
provided the other information when we addressed the model of evolution used for the
logenetic analyses.
What kind of post-processing did you do apart from the construction of the BS consensus
s?
ponse: Post-processing also included generating summary statistics.
entence is weird. I assume you follow protocol of Regier et al., therefore name the authors.
ase mention in the results how many replicates were finally done for each data set.
ponse: The sentence was removed and the number of replicates is now included in the
hods section of the revised manuscript.
Please include the official SRR accessions of your sequences in the supplementary tables.
ponse: The SRR accession numbers have been added.
e 8
1 Your numbers (number of transcripts, N50, HaMStR matches) are only based on the newly
uenced transcriptomic data. However you have assembled and annotated four published data
. Please include them in the description of your data.
ponse: These data have been included in the revised mansucript.
What do you mean by “unique loci”? Are those the loci which did not show paraphyly? Are
e the “orthologous groups” which were used for further analyses?
ponse: We have changed the terminology used to “unique orthologous groups”, so as not to
oduce new terms. We have also included in Table 2 HaMStR statistics specifically for the
orthologous groups that passed our paralogy filter and were used in the phylogenetic
lyses.
According to your table, 184 is not the mean length of matching sequences – it’s the minimum
th. Please double check all your numbers and how you refer to them.
ponse: This has been revised to reflect the true mean.
You started with 3854 orthologous groups and had to remove 3015 because of evidence of
alogy – is this correct? If you had to remove some of the groups because of other reasons,
se mention this.
ponse: This is correct, and is now stated more clearly in the methods section.
Our phylogenetic trees resolved Cladobranchia as a monophyletic group. Wording is not
rect (see also above). A tree can not “resolve” any relationships. Please consider this also in
rest of the manuscript (e.g. in line 31, 36, 44, 55 and so on)
ponse: We have edited multiple occasions where the word “resolve” was used incorrectly,
uding the particular instances mentioned.
s astonished to see Bathydoris as sistergroup to Cladobranchia, although with a very low
tstrap. I wonder which alternatives have come out in your analyses. Actually there are only
options for Bathydoris to group with: It must have grouped with the outgroup to a high
nt, because the expected alternative with Doris is not indicated at all and therefore must
n be below the 34 or 40 bootstrap value respectively.
ponse: Yes, we agree on that point.
Trying to analyse evolution of a group via assessing phylogenetic trees I would not use
archical termini like “infraorder”. You probably got this information from the World
ister of Marine Species. This is ok for systematists and taxonomists, but makes no sense in
logenetic trees.
ponse: The term “infraorder” has been removed in the case of Aeolidida and Dendronotida.

You declare the examination of potential methodological concerns. Although this would be
interesting, I can’t find any of this in the discussion. Please elaborate on this topic.
ponse: We have added analytical results addressing this issue, now discuss the effects of
sing data and research regarding potentially inflated bootstrap values in phylogenomic
lyses in the revised manusript.
Leave out this whole sentence “ Finally…..effect of these results on the current understanding
he evolutionary history of Cladobranchia”. This is definitely too early and you bring no
ences from other data sets that would support your conclusions anyway.
ponse: This sentence has been revised.
can’t follow you here. For example, Berghia stephanieae has a higher number of transcripts
n most of the already published data sets. Please revise your wording here. Why do you
pare your data with the already published data sets? Do you draw any further conclusions
of that?
ponse: This was changed to the “average” number of transcripts being lower in newly
uenced transcriptomes. As for the conclusions, a statement was added: “…indicating that
uencing depth may not be a limiting factor.”
Again, I cannot follow you here. The number of matches ranges from 599 to 1129. This is not
sonable similar. Please revise your wording.
ponse: Revised: “Importantly, the number of sequences that matched to unique orthologous
ups, and the average length of these sequences was sufficient to address this problem (Table
, indicating that sequencing depth may not be a limiting factor.”
40 “and the resulting hypotheses…” should not be a part of the discussion of the pipeline or
matrix construction.
ponse: Removed.
nd following: You mention the overall better support in your analysis compared to former 3
gene analysis (yours which is not available and the one from Pola and Gosliner). This is not
ly a surprise. When you look at older analyses using much less taxa, support values were
ally good. I do not doubt that transcriptome analyses will help in better understanding
lution of many gastropod groups, but do not argue with high bootstrap values in your small
n set in favour for using phylogenomics. This may change so quickly as was shown
sequently for so many analyses on molluscs and insects. By the way, you have queries again
were also in Pola et al 2010: Position of the former Arminida, monophyly of Dendronotida.
ponse: The potential pitfalls in regards to high support values are now addressed in the
ussion.
e 10
Dirona is not a Dendronotida, but is usually assigned to Arminida.
ponse: Revised.
t might be exciting for you that Melibe is back again in the Cladobranchia. Melibe shows so
y characters of the Dendronotida, nobody would actually exclude it from the cladobranchs.
bably because of its highly aberrant life style genes might have mutated in a fast way and
of course, as a long branch effect, it groups with the outgroups when using only a few
es.
ponse: In any case, it is nice to see that it falls within Cladobranchia in our analyses with a
onable branch length.
e 11
nd following. The discussion of the phylogenetic relationships has of course to be really
iminary and I wonder whether it should be done at all. Since no evidences deriving from
phological data are included which would verify or falsify the hypotheses presented here, I
ld rather suggest to concentrate more on the methodology than on any “assumed” sister
relationships, which will certainly change with the next following analyses. The strength in
manuscript is the new methodology.
ponse: Indeed, which is why the majority of the discussion is focused on the methodology
relationships of the larger groups. However, we feel that the comparison of this phylogeny
h those previously published gives context to the relationships, especially since some are
ported by previous analyses.
nd following.: Again, I would not stress the high bootstrap support values again here.
ody doubts the immense step forward you do here, but do not conclude here already that you
lly got the“true tree” and nothing will change when you include the next taxa.
ponse: This has been revised.

ponse: The figure has been revised to include all of the bootstrap values for both analyses.
iewer #4: “Phylogenomics based on RNA-Seq resolves relationships within Cladobranchia
stropoda: Nudibranchia): An initial investigation” by Goodheart et al. is the first
logenomic study on a clade of sea slugs. The authors de novo sequenced 16 transcriptomes
follow a thorough computational pipeline to analyze their data. So far, cladobranch
logeny could not be satisfactorily resolved based on morphological or molecular data relying
tandard markers. Thus, this “initial investigation” will be of broad interested in the
munity of sea slug researchers and also to a broader audience as an example of the
nformatic pipeline applied by the authors. I clearly want to recommend this manuscript for
lication in Royal Society Open Science, but I do have some concerns (listed below), which
authors should revise prior to publication:
The authors put much emphasis on their “resolved” phylogeny and the high bootstrap
port at most nodes. To my knowledge bootstrapping is an inappropriate measurement for
al support in phylogenomic studies, due to statistical errors in large data sets always
lting in high bootstrap values (see e.g., Dell’Ampio et al. 2013 Mol Biol Evol doi:
093/molbev/mst196). In my opinion this is again underlined by the present study which 100
o nearly all nodes even in partially contradicting topologies. I would therefore strongly
ommend to follow the authors’ own title “initial investigation” without over-emphasizing the
ustness of their phylogenetic hypothesis as this likely presents an artifact.
ponse: The potential pitfalls in regards to high support values are now addressed in the
ussion of the revised manuscript.
It is a pity that the authors do not attempt any discussion on the evolution of
dobranchia by discussing e.g. character evolution based on their data. I believe the study
ld benefit from addressing the evolutionary history of the clade. Please also provide some
ures of the taxa you are working with.
ponse: We feel that this work stands on its own, and plan to continue working on the
lutionary history of, and character evolution within, Cladobranchia in subsequent
uscripts.
The authors missed to discuss the recent paper of Maguib & Valdes 2015 in Polar
logy which includes a molecular phylogeny on Nudibranchia including Doridoxa (rare
ibranch with controversially debated phylogenetic affinities). This study is highly relevant for
manuscript and needs to be included. Also Schrödl et al. 2001 (Zoologischer Anzeiger) on
al nudibranch phylogeny (There are a few other papers which should be included, see
w).
ponse: These two papers are now addressed.
To be honest, I find it quite annoying, when I realize that the authors rely on the
ewers in doing a final proof reading on their paper, which they apparently didn’t want to
te their precious time with. There are numerous mistakes in the reference list (actually in
ry other citation= misspelled authors’ names, capitalization errors, incomplete references…).
h errors should be corrected PRIOR to submission!
ponse: The references have been edited.
mments to the text:
Page 2: Abstract: “…members within this group, neither of which were successful.”
at is successful in systematics? Maybe better rephrase to “well supported evolutionary
otheses”
ponse: Revised.
Page 2: Keywords: I think Cladobranchia and Nudibranchia are obsolete as already in
title
ponse: Agreed. These have been removed.
Page 3, Introduction: “Defined by the presence of a diverticulated digestive gland,
dobranchia…” – this is a bit critical. There are representatives of Cladobranchia with
ohepathic digestive gland – and in absence of a phylogenetic hypothesis we don’t know
ther this is the basal or a secondarily derived stage within Cladobranchia
ponse: We have removed this definition, as we do not address it at any further time in this
er.
Page 3, Introduction: Citation Nr. 3 is inappropriate. This paper is entirely on sea hares
lysiomorpha)!!
ponse: This sentence was changed to include a more appropriate citation.
Page 3, Introduction: I fully agree that systematics is the science that underpins all other
ds of biology (and in parts also pharmacology), but I find it quite odd to address
rmacology and climate change to directly justify the need of a phylogeny of Cladobranchia?
y do we have to advertise our science by promising the realization of some economically
ortant potential? Your study is no contribution to biochemically interesting products nor to
itoring of climate change, it does address the evolutionary history of a clade and it would be
to read some introduction to why THIS is interesting.
ponse: Some information regarding character evolution in Cladobranchia has been included
he introduction. However, we do believe that the evolutionary history has value in regards to
hemically interesting products and the monitoring of the effects of climate change.
Page 3, Introduction: in the ref. list it is stated that citation 12 is submitted not published
ponse: This manuscript has now been published online and the DOI has been provided.
Page 3, Introduction: I don’t see the justification of the selection of citations? I.e.
guib & Valdes 2015 needs to be included and if you address Euthyneuran phylogeny you
uld consider including recent systematic advances (for summary see Wägele et al. 2013 in
ansims Diversity and Evolution)
ponse: These papers have now been included.
Page 4, Introduction: Dendronotus - Ekimova et al. 2015 (Journal of the Linnean
iety) should be included here
ponse: This citation has been included.
Page 4, Introduction: “exploration into the use of RNA-Seq data to resolve, with high
tstrap support, the evolutionary relationships within Cladobranchia” – see my comment on
tstrap values above…
ponse: This sentence has been revised.
Page 4, Material and Methods: please justify your sampling strategy. Taxon sampling is
most crucial step in compiling a phylogenetic study – for which reasons did you select the
sent taxa?
ponse: A statement was added to the methods section: “…to attempt to maximize taxonomic
pling breadth within Cladobranchia.” While this was the strategy for collecting, many of the
icular species used were simply the ones available in the specific localities in which
ecting was done.
Page 4, Material and Methods: “On rare occasions only a visual confirmation was used
confirmation” – replace the first confirmation by examination
ponse: Replaced with examination.
Page 4, Material and Methods: please include the voucher numbers of the museum in a
le in the MS
ponse: The voucher numbers are included in Table 1.
Page 4, Material and Methods: It is nice that you collected cnidarians and it is a pity that
e of the data is mentioned in the ms later on. Either provide some data or erase from
erial and methods.
ponse: This information was removed.
Page 6, Material and Methods: Shuttelworth, 2013 should be replaced by 34 and citation
complete
ponse: Revised.
Page 7, Material and Methods: “Orthologous groups that showed evidence of paralogy
e discarded [48]” following the workflow of 48?
ponse: This sentence, in the first paragraph of the “Construction of data matrix and paralogy
ring” section, was revised.
Page 8, Phylogenetic results: “derived from all analyses” – I lost track… How many?
ponse: Four. This was added to the sentence.
Page 8, Phylogenetic results: Fig. 1. I think the manuscript would really benefit from
uding some pictures of the taxa you are dealing with and aim for a nicer visualization of the
. I also don’t understand why Dirona and Janolous are classified as “Dendronotida”?
ase discuss! Since “Dendronotida” is paraphyletic there is no reason to include lineages
ch were previously unassigned in Cladobranchia or classified as arminids
ponse: Pictures are now included.
Page 9, Discussion: “and the resulting hypotheses of relationships within Cladobranchia
generally well supported” but partially conflicting!
ponse: This statement was removed.
Page 9, Discussion: Phylogenetic inference of Cladobranchia has been a difficult part of
larger problem of resolving the evolutionary history of Nudibranchia [11,12,15,18]. Please
consider Martin et al. 2010 (Open Marine Biology Journal) which contains a reanalyses of
Wägele & Willan phylogeny
ponse: As far as we can tell, this paper contains no phylogenetic inference.
Page 9, Discussion: End of page, see my concerns on bootstrap values above
ponse: The potential pitfalls in regards to high support values are now addressed in the
ussion of the revised manuscript.
Page 10, Discussion: I consider it impossible to “confirm monophyly of Cladobranchia”
out including any of the disputed taxa (e.g. Doridoxa) – based on your data, you haven’t
ed the monophyly
ponse: We have replaced “confirmed” with “reinforced.”
Page 11, Discussion: the last two paragraphs really need to be thoroughly revised. At the
sent stage they just repeat (again) the value of phylogenomics. A discussion on your
dobranch systematics needs a critical evaluation how many families are included/ missing,
ch problematic taxa are missing which might change the hypothesis of this “initial study”
etc. …
ponse: These paragraphs have been revised.
Page 12: Dyrad numbers still lacking!!!
ponse: DOI numbers have been included for the supporting documents.
