In this study, a novel hollow iron/halloysite nanocomposites was prepared and their magnetic
and electromagnetic performance were studied. It seeks some nolveties,so I suggest it could be
accepted after a minor revision. Specific comments are as follows:
1. page 1, line 41: delete the second "used".
2. page 2, line 6-9: the basal spacing of 0.26 nm should be ascribed to the Fe2O3.
3. Could the authors compare the electromagnetic absorption performance of their materials with
other halloysite nanocompisites?
4. The layout of the Conclusion section should be consistent with other sections.

Please, answer the following remarks, and make requested corrections:
1. The literature review does not reflect the state of the art in the field of investigation. It should
be complemented with ref. like Vinokurov, V.A. et al. Science and technology of advanced
materials. 2017. Vol. 18 (1), p. 147-151 and other works concerning metal particles formation on
halloysite. Look for example recent paper also by Vinokurov& Stavitskaya, ACS Sustained
Chemistry, published on line 2017. In the review at Adv. Mater, v.28, 1227–1250, you may find
SEN pictures and of halloysite-iron nanosystems with much higher density of nanoparticles
seeded on halloysite.
2. Please explain the mechanism of the hollow particles formation and the preparation details to
meet the manuscript name. Nanoparticles are to large 20-30 nm for efficient catalysis
3. The necessity of using the halloysite for preparation of hollow iron nanospheres was not clearly
explained in the manuscript. Why using halloysite but not nanosilica for example?

Appendix A
Dear reviewers,
The comments to our article “Preparation of hollow iron/halloysite nanocomposites with enhanced
electromagnetic performances”, numbered by RSOS-171657 have been thoroughly read. Thanks for
the reviewers giving such comprehensive comments on our paper. These comments are very
constructive to our work. According to the reviewers’ instructions the corresponding issues were
carefully discussed and revised. Following are the explanations to the reviewers’ questions. The
reviewers’ comments are in black and our responses are in blue. The corresponding changes in the
manuscript are highlighted in red.
Response to Reviewer#1’s comments:
In this study, a novel hollow iron/halloysite nanocomposites was prepared and their magnetic and
electromagnetic performance were studied. It seeks some novelties, so I suggest it could be accepted
after a minor revision. Specific comments are as follows:
1. page 1, line 41: delete the second "used".
Response: The second “used” has been deleted.
2. page 2, line 6-9: the basal spacing of 0.26 nm should be ascribed to the Fe2O3.
Response: The corresponding statement has been modified. Thank you.
3. Could the authors compare the electromagnetic absorption performance of their materials with
other halloysite nanocomposites?
Response: We have compared the microwave absorption performance of our materials with other
halloysite nanocomposites (Table S1 and the last paragraph of section 3). Thank you.
4. The layout of the Conclusion section should be consistent with other sections.
Response: The layout of the Conclusion section has been modified to be consistent with other
sections.
Response to Reviewer#2’s comments:
Please, answer the following remarks, and make requested corrections:
1. The literature review does not reflect the state of the art in the field of investigation. It should be
complemented with ref. like Vinokurov, V.A. et al. Science and technology of advanced materials.
2017. Vol. 18 (1), p. 147-151 and other works concerning metal particles formation on halloysite.
Look for example recent paper also by Vinokurov& Stavitskaya, ACS Sustained Chemistry, published
on line 2017. In the review at Adv. Mater, v.28, 1227–1250, you may find SEN pictures and of
halloysite-iron nanosystems with much higher density of nanoparticles seeded on halloysite.
Response: The reference list has been updated to be state-of-the-art. The corresponding section in
Introduction has been revised accordingly.
2. Please explain the mechanism of the hollow particles formation and the preparation details to meet
the manuscript name. Nanoparticles are to large 20-30 nm for efficient catalysis
Response: (1) The formation mechanism of the hollow iron particles has been explained in Page 2, the
second paragraph. The hollow structure may be formed via a “molten salt corrosion” or Kirkendall
effect. (2) The preparation details have been listed in the Electronic Supplementary Information. (3)
Although the efficiency of catalyst is highly dependent on its particle size, our previous studies (Liu et
al., Sep Purif Technol, 2014, 135: 35-41; Chen et al., J Magn Magn Mater, 2012, 324: 1745-1751)
suggested that nanoparticles with diameter of >20 nm can also be potentially used for the catalytic
degradation of organic pollutants and microwave absorption. Thank you.
3. The necessity of using the halloysite for preparation of hollow iron nanospheres was not clearly
explained in the manuscript. Why using halloysite but not nanosilica for example?
Response: The nanotubular composite prepared from the halloysite nanotubes exhibits the following
advantages over other materials: (1) high surface area and high adsorption capacity for organic
pollutants, which is important for wastewater treatment; (2) high strength, which makes the
nanotubular composite a potential polymer filler; (3) low-density, which is an essential property for a
microwave absorber. Therefore, the performance of functional materials loaded on halloysite
nanotubes will be enhanced and their potential applications could be extended. In addition, using
natural halloysite as a raw material is important when concerning the economic development and
utilization of natural minerals. The Introduction section has been revised accordingly. Thank you.
4. The caption of Fig. 3 is not complete.
Response: The caption has been revised to be complete.
5. The articles is called “Preparation of hollow iron/halloysite nanocomposites with enhanced
electromagnetic performances”, the enhanced in comparison with what? Please provide the data on
the electromagnetic performances of the hollow iron particles without halloysite and compare you
research with the published works.
Response: The enhanced performance is in comparison with solid iron/halloysite nanocomposites (Fig.
4, Table S1). We have compared the microwave absorption performance of our materials with other
halloysite nanocomposites (Table S1 and the last paragraph of section 3). Because we focused on the
enhanced performance of hollow iron/halloysite nanocomposites over the solid iron/halloysite
nanocomposite, we didn’t study the electromagnetic performance of hollow iron particles without
halloysite. Thank you.
In addition, we have re-arranged the authorship according to the author contributions. The change of
authorship has been approved by all authors.
Thanks for your kind help on this article!
