I enjoyed reading the paper. This paper deals with a very important topic on inter-individual
differences in means (personality) as well as in intra-individual changes (plasticity) and residuals
(predictability) in animal behavior research with a sophisticated and well-articulated method.
The paper is generally well written with a clear and important message to the field. I have a few
comments and suggestions that aim to help the authors to further improve their paper.
The current paper’s approach is largely based on the general framework of behavioral reaction
norms. The authors mentioned this a couple of time in the Introduction but failed to elaborate on
this general framework. The authors could use a little more description of the framework to more
clearly describe and introduce their study.
Behavior repeatability as measured by correlation over time depends on the time intervals across
successive time points. The authors ought to make clear the average time interval mentioned in
the Fratkin et al (13) with the average correlation of 0.43.
The sentence on page 3 “hierarchical shrinkage will attenuate their estimates to the group-level
estimates” is unclear. Clarifications are needed. What are stated on page 12 in line 381 should
have been mentioned earlier here. The same applies to the next sentence, “similarly, if data are
unrepresentative….there is sufficient contradictory information.” Relatedly, it would be worthy
to further elaborate the rationale the authors choose a Bayesian analysis framework, as opposed
to conventional frequentist perspective. The current sentence “[Bayesian approach] allows the
quantification of uncertainty at all levels of analysis” is not convincing enough, as conventional
frequentist approach can also estimate these uncertainty (i.e., variance component) at all levels of
analysis.
On page 5 while giving average records per dog and for those with more than one record, please
also provide their range respectively.
If my understanding is correct, the null distribution used to compare for assessing inter-rater
reliability is just a uniform distribution (each answer within the realistic range has equal
probability of being chosen.) If so, it would be better to also mention this for easy understanding.
In the results on inter-rater reliability, it worries me that only about half of the staff chose the
right code as well as the color category for the video reacts to people aggressive. The authors did
not discuss the results (although they did mention the overall proportions for all session on page
16) and their potential substantial influences on interpreting the data and results in the context of
reacts to unfamiliar people. So it seems that staff tend to underestimate/report dogs’
aggressiveness, therefore shrinking the actual response range/variance?
For the ordinal probit model, it would be clarify that the latent continuous variable is
“insociability when meeting unfamiliar people”, given the way the responses are coded, rather
than “sociability when meeting unfamiliar people”, on page 7.
On page 8 when specifying the covariance matrix of random components in equation 4, I am not
clear why the authors specify the correlation <U+03C1> between t2vo and t2v1 to be the same between
t2vo and t2v2, as well as between t2v0 and t2v3 (all <U+03C1>vo). The same for the row of t2v1. This
possibly is a typo as this does not seem to be the case from the results presented on page 12.
I had a hard time following the part on 9 starting from “to inspect how much the rank-order
differences” until the end of the paragraph. I presume the method introduced here would be
complex and possibly beyond the understanding of many readers, so please try to write as simple
and straightforward as possible without introducing too much unnecessary information. Please
write them in separate sentences rather in a long one. To me, the cross-environmental covariance
matrix simply just estimates the covariance matrix of model-derived latent intercept and slopes at
the three standardized days -1, 0, and 1 (i.e., model estimated latent variable matrix at specific
times.) I could be wrong, but for the 3 by 3 matrix defining days, shouldn’t the last column be 1,
0, 1, instead of -1, 0 , 1, given that the last column representing quadratic time/day effects (i.e.,
days2)? I am saying this because the introduced model so far is essentially a Bayesian
specification on ordinal outcomes of a latent growth curve model with both linear and quadratic
3
slopes and individual heteroscedastic residuals, which is more commonly adopted in human
development/longitudinal research.
I wonder if, besides WAIC, the authors could also provide DIC across the 6 models for
comparison and selection.
On page 15, I am not clear what “biological-informed functions of contexts” means.
I think the authors missed the figure number on page 16 in the first line.
The authors could also discuss briefly the meaning of increasing ICC over time.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This is an interesting take on the concept of animal personality. The manuscript is well written
and the authors are obviously well acquainted with parts of the litterature. I am however a bit
disappointed in the breadth of the manuscript.
I believe that the authors could make the paper more interesting by not exclusively focussing on
shelter dogs. Although this is the main topic of their study putting it into a broader perspective
would be beneficial. There are a number of different papers looking at predictability and
heritability of personality in dogs (in general, not shelter dogs), e.g. Svartberg 2004, and Sandberg
et al 2005, Wilson & Sinn 2012. In both the papers by Svartberg and Wilson the correlation is
between the personality tests and everyday or more generals behaviour, i.e. something that
should be of large interest for persons working on shelter dogs. (A couple of papers have been
cited but there are many more.)
Introduction
I believe that the authors should at least mention the fact that situations are never the same, hence
the expected response can not be expected to be the same, this has in fact lead some researchers in
human psychology to doubt the whole concept of personality.

2.3 Data collection
I would hesitate to call this an ethogram. It does not describe the dog as much in "behavioural
coding" terms as in "behavioural rating" terms. I would suggest just calling it a questionnaire.
I would like some more information on the persons doing the data gathering. Were they e.g.
asked not to discuss the "ethograms" with each other? Was it always the same person doing the
same dog? Miminal experience with dogs? I realise that it may be difficult under the
circumstances of the study but would think that there were some guidelines.
2.5.1 Validity
I am not familiar with the R-package used. Could you give a reference or two for papers that
have used it previously?
4. Discussion
The point of taking the fluctuations into account, is that not exactly what is happening when you
are using e.g. the C-BARQ or even more if you are asking using an adjective scoring system? If
you answer that the dog *sometimes* barks at strangers you are in fact stating that there is a
variation in the reaction of the dog to strangers? Could you please discuss this?
4.2
There is a fairly large litterature on flexibility and aggression in the coping litterature (especially
on mice and rats) and I would suggest looking at that more in depth if you want to make the
points of the paragraph starting on line 522
I feel I am missing something here. So greater plasticity is associated with lower predictability
(line 564) and lower plasticity is related to lower sociability (lines 522-523), but there is no
correlation between predictability and personality (line 571). Why this difference between
predictability and plasticity in this case?
I suggest deleting the repeated measures figure, fig 1 - it only confuses.

Dear Editor and Reviewers,
Thank you for your helpful comments on our manuscript. We have addressed your
comments below and made the relevant additions to the manuscript.

Reviewer 1
I enjoyed reading the paper. This paper deals with a very important topic on inter-
individual differences in means (personality) as well as in intra-individual changes
(plasticity) and residuals (predictability) in animal behavior research with a
sophisticated and well-articulated method. The paper is generally well written with a
clear and important message to the field. I have a few comments and suggestions that
aim to help the authors to further improve their paper.
The current paper’s approach is largely based on the general framework of behavioral
reaction norms. The authors mentioned this a couple of time in the Introduction but
failed to elaborate on this general framework. The authors could use a little more
description of the framework to more clearly describe and introduce their study.
Authors: we have added further clarification in the Introduction, and have
included some future directions for behavioural reaction norms in the
Discussion.
Behavior repeatability as measured by correlation over time depends on the time
intervals across successive time points. The authors ought to make clear the average
time interval mentioned in the Fratkin et al (13) with the average correlation of 0.43.
Authors: we have added the average time interval (21 weeks) in the Introduction.
The sentence on page 3 “hierarchical shrinkage will attenuate their estimates to the
group-level estimates” is unclear. Clarifications are needed. What are stated on page
12 in line 381 should have been mentioned earlier here. The same applies to the next
sentence, “similarly, if data are unrepresentative….there is sufficient contradictory
information.”
Authors: we have made this explanation of hierarchical shrinkage clearer.
Relatedly, it would be worthy to further elaborate the rationale the authors choose a
Bayesian analysis framework, as opposed to conventional frequentist perspective. The
current sentence “[Bayesian approach] allows the quantification of uncertainty at all
levels of analysis” is not convincing enough, as conventional frequentist approach can
also estimate these uncertainty (i.e., variance component) at all levels of analysis.
Authors: we have clarified the merits of a Bayesian approach (i.e. obtaining a
posterior probability distribution) over a frequentist approach (i.e. confidence
intervals are not posterior distributions of parameter values).
On page 5 while giving average records per dog and for those with more than one
record, please also provide their range respectively.
Authors: added.
If my understanding is correct, the null distribution used to compare for assessing
inter-rater reliability is just a uniform distribution (each answer within the realistic
range has equal probability of being chosen.) If so, it would be better to also mention
this for easy understanding.

In the results on inter-rater reliability, it worries me that only about half of the staff
chose the right code as well as the color category for the video reacts to people
aggressive. The authors did not discuss the results (although they did mention the
overall proportions for all session on page 16) and their potential substantial
influences on interpreting the data and results in the context of reacts to unfamiliar
people. So it seems that staff tend to underestimate/report dogs’ aggressiveness,
therefore shrinking the actual response range/variance?
Authors: yes, we have addressed the Reacts to people aggressive code result
directly in the Discussion, which likely increased the probability of lower
category codes (more sociable responses).
For the ordinal probit model, it would be clarify that the latent continuous variable is
“insociability when meeting unfamiliar people”, given the way the responses are
coded, rather than “sociability when meeting unfamiliar people”, on page 7.
Authors: added.
On page 8 when specifying the covariance matrix of random components in equation
4, I am not clear why the authors specify the correlation <U+03C1> between t2vo and t2v1 to
be the same between t2vo and t2v2, as well as between t2v0 and t2v3 (all <U+03C1>vo). The
same for the row of t2v1. This possibly is a typo as this does not seem to be the case
from the results presented on page 12.
Authors: thanks for pointing this out. It was a typo. The correlation terms were
meant to be subscripted by two indexes (e.g. <U+0001D746><U+0001D74A><U+0001D7CE><U+0001D7CF> ).
I had a hard time following the part on 9 starting from “to inspect how much the rank-
order differences” until the end of the paragraph. I presume the method introduced
here would be complex and possibly beyond the understanding of many readers, so
please try to write as simple and straightforward as possible without introducing too
much unnecessary information. Please write them in separate sentences rather in a
long one. To me, the cross-environmental covariance matrix simply just estimates the
covariance matrix of model-derived latent intercept and slopes at the three
standardized days -1, 0, and 1 (i.e., model estimated latent variable matrix at specific
times.) I could be wrong, but for the 3 by 3 matrix defining days, shouldn’t the last
column be 1, 0, 1, instead of -1, 0 , 1, given that the last column representing
quadratic time/day effects (i.e., days2)? I am saying this because the introduced model
so far is essentially a Bayesian specification on ordinal outcomes of a latent growth
curve model with both linear and quadratic slopes and individual heteroscedastic
residuals, which is more commonly adopted in human development/longitudinal
research.
Authors: yes, thanks for identifying this. We have made this section clearer
about what the cross-environmental correlations are estimating. These models
are given a variety of names across different literatures.
I wonder if, besides WAIC, the authors could also provide DIC across the 6 models
for comparison and selection.
Authors: we are hesitant to use DIC because WAIC is considered to be much
more preferable. For instance, DIC is simply a point estimate (no estimation of
uncertainty) and assumes multivariate normality in the posterior distribution,
whereas WAIC does not. We have added why we prefer WAIC over DIC in the
text.
On page 15, I am not clear what “biological-informed functions of contexts” means.
Authors: We have removed this term to avoid confusion and made the example
in the succeeding sentence more explicit. We are implying that a lack of data
often requires people to fit simple polynomial models, but an increase in data can
allow researchers to apply and validate more mechanistic models (e.g. network
analysis models).
I think the authors missed the figure number on page 16 in the first line.
Authors: thanks, added.
The authors could also discuss briefly the meaning of increasing ICC over time.
Authors: the ICC calculation was actually wrong in our submission (missing one
term), which has been amended. The ICC now indicates an increase in
behavioural repeatability between arrival day and day 8 but no real change
between day 8 and day 15. We have clarified this in the discussion, and made
sure behavioural repeatability as measured by the ICC is clearly defined
throughout.

I am however a bit disappointed in the breadth of the manuscript.
I believe that the authors could make the paper more interesting by not exclusively
focussing on shelter dogs. Although this is the main topic of their study putting it into
a broader perspective would be beneficial. There are a number of different papers
looking at predictability and heritability of personality in dogs (in general, not shelter
dogs), e.g. Svartberg 2004, and Sandberg et al 2005, Wilson & Sinn 2012. In both the
papers by Svartberg and Wilson the correlation is between the personality tests and
everyday or more generals behaviour, i.e. something that should be of large interest
for persons working on shelter dogs. (A couple of papers have been cited but there are
many more.)
Authors: we agree that the literature on dog personality is very broad, and we
could relate our findings to other papers (a number of which we have cited).
However, the topic of predictability as we have defined and studied it here has
not been studied before, to our knowledge. That is, no study has quantified the
residual variability around personality in dogs. Studies have, however, looked at
correlations between behaviour at different time points to study consistency. As
we mentioned in the Introduction, these correlations focus on rank-order
stability of scores only and do not capture the degree of plasticity (which may, or
may not, result in rank-order change) or predictability (residual variability
around personality).
Introduction
I believe that the authors should at least mention the fact that situations are never the
same, hence the expected response can not be expected to be the same, this has in fact
lead some researchers in human psychology to doubt the whole concept of
personality.
Authors: we have added in the Introduction why intra-individual variability in
behaviour could occur (e.g. internal and external factors).
2.3 Data collection
I would hesitate to call this an ethogram. It does not describe the dog as much in
"behavioural coding" terms as in "behavioural rating" terms. I would suggest just
calling it a questionnaire.
Authors: we agree that it’s closer to a behavioural rating scale, but are hesitant
about calling it a questionnaire. We have referred to it as a qualitative ethogram
instead.
I would like some more information on the persons doing the data gathering. Were
they e.g. asked not to discuss the "ethograms" with each other? Was it always the
same person doing the same dog? Miminal experience with dogs? I realise that it may
be difficult under the circumstances of the study but would think that there were some
guidelines.
Authors: we have added some additional information.
2.5.1 Validity
I am not familiar with the R-package used. Could you give a reference or two for
papers that have used it previously?
Authors: the package just implements estimation of the consensus statistic, for
which we have referenced the original paper defining this metric.
4. Discussion
The point of taking the fluctuations into account, is that not exactly what is happening
when you are using e.g. the C-BARQ or even more if you are asking using an
adjective scoring system? If you answer that the dog *sometimes* barks at strangers
you are in fact stating that there is a variation in the reaction of the dog to strangers?
Could you please discuss this?
Authors: we have added that although it would be unrealistic to assume that
behaviour is completely stable, no studies of dog personality have actually
quantified predictability or individual differences in residual variance between
dogs.
4.2
There is a fairly large litterature on flexibility and aggression in the coping litterature
(especially on mice and rats) and I would suggest looking at that more in depth if you
want to make the points of the paragraph starting on line 522
Authors: for brevity we have avoided expanding on this topic in our paper.
I feel I am missing something here. So greater plasticity is associated with lower
predictability (line 564) and lower plasticity is related to lower sociability (lines 522-
523), but there is no correlation between predictability and personality (line 571).
Why this difference between predictability and plasticity in this case?
Authors: it is possible, statistically, for this relationship. For instance, if plasticity
caused differences in both personality and predictability, then conditioning on
plasticity (as done here) could remove any relationship between personality and
predictability. At the moment, there is little theory to assume this relationship
however, and the theory of why individuals differ in predictability is still in its
infancy. We have noted in our manuscript that personality and predictability
may only be correlated for certain personality traits.
I suggest deleting the repeated measures figure, fig 1 - it only confuses.
Authors: done.
