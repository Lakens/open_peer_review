I was the third reviewer when the manuscript had previously been submitted to Biology Letters.
Even upon reviewing the manuscript at the original submission, I had not seen any critical flaw
in it, and I had simply suggested some points that, I believe, will enhance the impact of this
study. Unfortunately, one of my suggestions, i.e., extending the model to broader cases of
harmful copulations in general, was not accepted by the authors. However, it is not any problem
now, considering the “objective peer-review” policy of RSOS. I also think that the manuscript is
now easier to read since all model details had been incorporated in the main text.
I only have very minor comments.

Lines 151-153. I agree with the importance of the result that EFGM was favored even under the
high costs of mutilation. On the other hand, It's not surprise that EFGM is favored under a high n
and ancestral last male sperm precedence, but the sentence may mislead readers to consider it as
surprising results. I think that the authors should rephrase the sentence.

Review of RSOS-171195: “Evolution of External Female Genital Mutilation: why do males harm
their mates?”
The manuscript presents a game theoretical model and shows potential evolutionary scenarios
for the emergence of external female genital mutilation (EFGM). While I am admittedly not
strong in mathematical modelling, I have found the manuscript to be well written,
understandable, and the conclusions well justified. The discussion is particularly good in putting
3
the findings into an evolutionarily understandable frame, also discussing several additional
factors that could further affect the frequency of EFGM in a spider species/population.
I have reviewed a previous version of this manuscript and the authors have addressed my few
considerations well. Reading other reviewers comments, I now only have one considerations,
stemming from the first revision. I wish for at least a brief overview of how prevalent is genital
mutilation, specifically external (or otherwise easily quantifiable if internal), in other animals,
maybe specifically arthropods. Because I suspect some type of genital mutilation is quite common
especially in insects and arachnids, I wonder whether similar models investigating the
evolutionary emergence and fixation conditions for this phenomenon? Namely, I disagree with
one of the reviewers of the previous manuscript version, stating that the here modelled scenarios
are easily predictable from already published experimental studies. Models putting experimental
data into theoretical frames in my opinion are important and very worth publishing – meeting
the expectations is not a good argument for not publishing. Unless several such models exist for
similar mating systems in other arthropods, I see the here presented research to be of high value.

3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi

5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look
forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get
in touch.

The manuscript was previously reviewed for Biology Letters, and the authors addressed the
reviewers’ concerns for their submission to RSOS. Both reviewers agree with the present version
on the condition that their remaining concerns will be addressed in the final version.

Dear Prof. Kevin Padian, Subject Editor of Royal Society Open Science,
We thank you and the two referees for this valuable review of our work which improved the quality of
he manuscript. We are very grateful for the reviewers’ suggestions and we modified the manuscript
accordingly. We addressed all the reviewers’ comments and implemented them in the revised
manuscript. Below we detailed the changes we made in response to each reviewer comment.
Sincerely yours,

Comments from reviewer 1
Line 39. A bullet point before parenthesis should be alpha. I found bullet points in other places.
Please check them.
Response:
We replaced the bullet points that had been mistakenly introduced in the manuscript by the correct
ymbols.
Lines 151-153. I agree with the importance of the result that EFGM was favored even under the
high costs of mutilation. On the other hand, It's not surprise that EFGM is favored under a high n
and ancestral last male sperm precedence, but the sentence may mislead readers to consider it as
urprising results. I think that the authors should rephrase the sentence.
Response:
Our wording was ambiguous here. We rephrased the sentence (lines 156-158) to avoid the
mpression that the latter results are surprising.
Comments from reviewer 2
wish for at least a brief overview of how prevalent is genital mutilation, specifically external (or
otherwise easily quantifiable if internal), in other animals, maybe specifically arthropods. Because I
uspect some type of genital mutilation is quite common especially in insects and arachnids, I
wonder whether similar models investigating the evolutionary emergence and fixation conditions
or this phenomenon?
Response:
We added a brief overview of genital damage in arthropods and how prevalent is external mutilation
n spiders (lines 25-32).
