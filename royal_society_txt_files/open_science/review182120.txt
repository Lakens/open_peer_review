In this manuscript, the authors described a study on low-temperature NH3-SCR performance of
Ce/TiO2 modified by Ho catalyst. A series of Ce/TiO2 catalysts with different Ho/Ti ratios were
examined and compared. The authors designed and performed several experiments such as XRD,
H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, DRIFTS analysis etc. to evaluation the effect of Ho on the Ce/TiO2 catalyst.
Adequate data and results such as SO2 and H2O tolerance, BET, NH3 adsorption, NO+O2
adsorption have been presented and discussed by the authors subsequently and appropriate
conclusion has been drawn. For example, the Ho modified Ce/TiO2 catalyst was able to
demonstrate higher intensity of NH3 and NO+O2 adsorption with increasing temperature in the
DRIFTS study which well explains the observation that Holmium could effectively improve the
low-temperature SCR activity of Ce/TiO2. From this work, the readers would be able to get new
insights on the properties of Ho modified Ce/TiO2 catalyst which shows potential applications in
various fields. Overall, the manuscript is well presented and meets the requirement as
publication on Royal Society Open Science. Therefore, I would recommend this manuscript
published after considering the following comments.
In the catalytic performance discussion, the authors presented Figure 1a which demonstrated the
curve of NO conversion against temperature. Different Ho modified Ce/TiO2 catalysts and the
unmodified catalyst were compared here. The authors also indicated that when the Ho/Ti molar
ratio rise to 0.45, the NOx conversion over Ce0.35/TiO2 at 150 <U+2103> was increased from 22 % to 56
%. However, further increasing of Ho/Ti molar ratio to 0.6 made a slight decrease of de-NOx
activity in the whole temperature range. Later on, the authors discussed the NO conversion of
NO oxidation reaction and presented Figure 7. In Figure 1, the Ho0.45Ce0.35/TiO2 has shown
higher NO conversion than Ho0.6Ce0.35/TiO2, however, the result is completely opposite in
Figure 7. It is recommended to provide a summary of these observations in the discussion to
better serve the readers. Additionally, some figure identification numbers used within the
manuscript were not correct. Please verify.

In this study, Ho was used to modify Ce/TiO2 catalyst for NH3-SCR reaction . In my opinion,
this manuscript could be accepted for publication after the following revisions:
1. Ho0.35/TiO2 catalyst should be prepared and tested.
2. The XPS spectra of Ho should be given.
3. E-R mechanism should be taken into consideration.

supplementary material and it will be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the
supplementary material includes the paper details where possible (authors, article

Response: The above requirements have been confirmed.
Response to reviewer 1:
1. However, further increasing of Ho/Ti molar ratio to 0.6 made a slight decrease
of de-NOx activity in the whole temperature range. Later on, the authors discussed
the NO conversion of NO oxidation reaction and presented Figure 7. In Figure 1,
the Ho0.45Ce0.35/TiO2 has shown higher NO conversion than Ho0.6Ce0.35/TiO2,
however, the result is completely opposite in Figure 7. It is recommended to
provide a summary of these observations in the discussion to better serve the
readers.
Response: a summary of these observations in the discussion has been provided
in the revised manuscript. Although Ho0.6Ce0.35/TiO2 obsessed the highest
oxidation activity of NO to NO2 in all samples, it exhibited a relatively lower de-
NOx activity compared with Ho0.45Ce0.35/TiO2, which may attribute to its
decreased specific surface area leading to the decreased adsorbed NH3 species.
2. Additionally, some figure identification numbers used within the manuscript
were not correct. Please verify.
Response: some incorrect figure identification numbers used within the
manuscript has been verified in the revised manuscript.
Response to reviewer 2:
1. Ho0.35/TiO2 catalyst should be prepared and tested.
Response: Ho0.35/TiO2 catalyst has be prepared and its NOx conversion has been
tested. Some characterization data for Ho0.35/TiO2 catalyst including N2 selectivity,
BET, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, NO oxidation have also been added in the revised
manuscript.
2. The XPS spectra of Ho should be given.
Response: The XPS spectra of Ho have be given in Fig. 4 (c).
3. E-R mechanism should be taken into consideration.
Response: E-R mechanism has be taken into consideration in the section 3.9.
Finally, thanks again to the editors and reviewers for giving me the opportunity to
publish my paper in Royal Society Open Science.
