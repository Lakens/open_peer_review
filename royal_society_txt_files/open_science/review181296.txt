The manuscript “Large droplets and low viscosity help aggregate glue stick to moths in
Cyratarachne akirai spider webs” by Diaz et al attempts to shed light onto a prey specialist
spider, capturing “unglueable” moths. Though this topic is fascinating and I was excited to learn
more about their specialized glue, the paper in general was rather disappointing, as their
presented results do not keep the promise of the title. The focus of the results is on the reaction of
the threads’ behaviour to changed humidity, including first aging experiments as well as first
insights in the molecular composition. These results could be interesting, but are unfortunately
neither implied with the title nor the abstract nor finally discussed. An altered title (and an
accordingly adapted manuscript) might be a good idea, stressing the impact of humidity on the
glue’s behaviour. However, in my point of view this would lead to a too specialized topic to be
published in Royal Society Open Science. Alternatively I’m missing some kind of proof that a
spreading of fluid (perfect would be the glue of the moths’ capture thread of course) on the moths
wing can indeed be beneficial to prevail over the detaching scales. And additionally I would like
to at least read a critical dispute in the discussion that “low viscosity” does not necessarily mean
better attachment. Again, it would be perfect to add data of adhesion measurements, with which
you can prove that this viscosity isn’t already too low to break off easily.

This study of the capture threads of Cyrtarachne akirai employs a wide range of techniques to
thoroughly characterize the chemical and performance features of the glue droplets of these
threads. It is a significant study because it shows that these properties have diverged greatly from
those of more well studied, typical orb-weaving spiders, giving us a better understanding of the
plasticity of orb-weaver glue. The study was competently done and the techniques used
appropriate for the questions asked. Clear and useful figures support and help explain the
results. The interpretation of the results appears sound.
A key finding is that Cyrtarachne adhesive droplets are supersaturated:
312: We hypothesize that the aggregate glue is “overloaded” with water when it is first spun. It
has more water than what would be present if the threads were equilibrated at that relative
humidity for longer time.
515: This [the study’s observations] supports that aging degrades capture thread adhesion
primarily through irreversible loss of water that begins as soon as these supersaturated droplets
are spun, even when maintained at high humidity. In other words, Cyrtarachne may
supersaturate its glue with water during spinning of capture thread to achieve large droplet
volume and rapid spreading due to low viscosity.
This conclusion seems fully warranted and well supported by the study’s findings. However, I
believe that it would be useful to offer a suggestion as to how spiders accomplish this
supersaturation during the spinning of these capture threads. The threads of orb-weavers that
have been studied are hygroscopic to varying degrees, as the authors note, and capable of taking
up atmospheric moisture. However, because Cyrtarachne have lower concentrations of LMMCs
and aren’t able to do this, I am curious about the physiological process that might underlie the
formation of supersaturated droplets. Biological systems typically “pump” water by actively
transporting ions to create an osmotic gradient that attracts water. However, the low LMMCs
concentration in Cyrtarachne droplets makes this explanation less easily applied. Could
Cyrtarachne be initially heavily loading their aggregate gland dope with LMMCs (or maybe
simply inorganic ions, if one distinguished between these two components), attracting large
amounts of water, and then, in the final stages of processing aggregate gland material, rapidly
withdrawing hygroscopic compounds? Being able to propose this or another mechanism to
explain how Cyrtarachne droplets could become supersaturated seems useful and a satisfying bit
of information for a reader to consider.
Two minor errors I noted were:
Lines 457-458: Particularly, how the glue spreads is able to spread across three1dimensional
surfaces might play a more important role on
Delete the first “ spreads”
Lie 513: This supports that aging degrades capture thread adhesion
Probably should be “This supports the hypothesis that aging degrades capture thread adhesion”

Subject Editor's comments:
Thanks for your submission. As you'll see the reviewers had varied issues to bring up and we
hope that you'll address these closely in a revised manuscript. Best wishes.
Associate Editor's comments (Professor Brooke Flammang):
Please follow the reviewers suggestions for points that require clarification - be sure to see the
attached document from Reviewer 1. Note that the title of the manuscript is potentially
misleading: while the study does investigate the glue of spiders that happen to catch moths, there
were no tests reported here that actually involved testing the stickiness on moths. Based on this,
please make necessary corrections to the title and throughout the manuscript.

Appendix B
We thank the reviewers for their comments and respond to each below. Author
responses are bold to distinguish from the comments of the reviewer. For our major
revisions we have added to the introduction, edited the discussion ,and have
completely rewritten the results section and figure legends.
Comments to the Author(s)
Author 1:
An altered title (and an accordingly adapted manuscript) might be a good idea,
stressing the impact of humidity on the glue’s behaviour.
We propose a new title that emphasizes the importance of water in
making Cyrtarachne silk unique:
Supersaturation with water explains the unusual adhesion of of aggregate glue
in the webs of the moth-specialist spider, Cyrtarachne akirai
And additionally I would like to at least read a critical dispute in the discussion that
“low
viscosity” does not necessarily mean better attachment.
We agree and lines 506-509 in the discussion explain the importance of
bulk cohesive forces and how they must be coupled with low viscosity for
proper adhesion to occur.
Again, it would be perfect to add data of
adhesion measurements, with which you can prove that this viscosity isn’t already
too low to break
off easily.
We believe this data already exists within the paper in that we show that
for fresh samples at 90% RH Cyrtarachne's viscosity is equal to other spiders at
their sub-optimum humidity. We then show this viscosity correlates instead
with other orb-weaving species maximum adhesion strength. At other
conditions (low RH, aged) the silk has higher viscosity and performs almost
unmeasurable worse. Our empirical data demonstrate that the glue performs
best at this low viscosity
- Authors’ contributions: What did Candido Diaz do? Who did the adhesion
experiments? Who did the
spreading experiments? Who...??
line 30-31: Added information about the primary author, Candido Diaz
who wrote the manuscript and conducted all experiments excluding NMR.
- Data accessibility: Though the raw data is provided, its current form is very
confusing. Please
choose a better way of presenting the raw data in a clear way, without “Marcus”,
“Penny” and
“#Div/0” (and perhaps as PDF instead of excel)
We cleaned up raw data presentation and replaced spider note names
with more professional specimen numbers
Ethics statement: Who is “I”? Why only “my” research?
Changed wording to include all authors.
Furthermore, the complete result section as well as the legends of the figures have to
be rewritten.
Please don’t start a sentence with “figure 1 shows” or similar. Please describe what
you can see in
the figures and then add a “(fig. 1)”.
We appreciate this formatting suggestion and prefer it. Thus we changed
the format of the references to figures within the text
Please use the results to emphasize why you are presenting the results and what they
do show you.
The results section has been reorganized and rewritten to provide more
insight into our data and its significance prior to the discussion.
Avoid chapters including only two sentences.
To avoid this we combined the smaller sections of the results where
possible.

Figures:
General information:
- Figures 3, 5, 6 and 9 are not suitable for black and white reprints. Please change
colours.
For these Figures we:
Added dashed line to figure 3 (now figure 4) so readers can follow the
lines in black and white
In figure 5 (now figure 6) we changed sizes of markers to make it easier
to view in black and white
For figure 6 (now figure 7) it is not possible to use enough colors to make
the figure easier to read in black and white. We were unable to make changes to
this one.
- Please remove the headings in Figures 2, 5, 6 and 9
We removed the headings from all these figures as suggested
- Please remove the repetitions in the side legends and only use them if necessary:
Include the sample description in Figure 2 on the x-axis (excluding the 90%, as all
samples where
measured at 90%)
We made all these alterations to figure 2 and the side legends of all
figures
Remove the word “normalized” in the side legend of Figure 9B
We removed normalized from the side legend of Figure 9b
- Use one font size and type in all pictures
We adjusted font size for each figure to be more consistent
- In Figure 3 and 9 think about using another scale to avoid 10x on the y-axis.
We changing the scaling for figure 9 to be less cumbersome ( J <U+2192> uJ).
Fig. 3
Are these three samples of the same spider? Otherwise pool the relative data and
think about
another way to depict the data. E.g. (by hand, so nothing is correct here)
We edited the figure to only contain the 3 glue droplets used for
statistical analysis
With the new suggested graphical depiction the chapters “aggregated glue droplet
response to
humidity” and “droplet size as a function of time” could be combined.
We combined these two sections in the new results section we have
written
Fig. 4
There is no hint to this figure in the text. I think it belongs to Fig. 3. Can they be
combined?
We added a reference to this figure within the text but since figure 3 and
5 are two different experiments we believe we should not combine them.
Fig. 5
Are Droplet 2-1 and 2-2 the same droplet / a droplet of the same spider / ...?
We removed sample 2-2 to provide clarity. It was previously shown to
express the consistency of one of our our second trial.
Are there now 3 or 4 samples?
There were 3 samples used for statistical analysis and we removed
droplet 2-2 from the figure to be consistent with this.
Please combine the raw data depicted in this figure into some data that provides
more general
information and is more easily to understand
We organized data from this figure in raw data file to be easier to follow
and read.
Please avoid using the samples names of your lab journal.
We converted the listed sample names to correlate more appropriately
with sample numbers
Fig. 6
Why does the data of the synthetic oil end sooner? Why are there only STDs for the
“normal”
Cyrtarachne?
Oil data and other species data taken was taken from the cited paper
and were not taken at the same time scales that our experiments were
conducted. STD does not exist for the aged Cyrtarachne data as all readings
were zero during testing. This has been noted in the figure legend.
Fig. 8:
The inset is not readable and please indicate what was used as blank control
We have noted in the figure legend that a sterile pipette was used as the
blank control and removed excess text on inset figure.

Comments to the Author(s)
This study of the capture threads of Cyrtarachne akirai employs a wide range of
techniques to thoroughly characterize the chemical and performance features of the
glue droplets of these threads. It is a significant study because it shows that these
properties have diverged greatly from those of more well studied, typical orb-
weaving spiders, giving us a better understanding of the plasticity of orb-weaver
glue. The study was competently done and the techniques used appropriate for the
questions asked. Clear and useful figures support and help explain the results. The
interpretation of the results appears sound.
A key finding is that Cyrtarachne adhesive droplets are supersaturated:
312: We hypothesize that the aggregate glue is “overloaded” with water when it is
first spun. It has more water than what would be present if the threads were
equilibrated at that relative humidity for longer time.
515: This [the study’s observations] supports that aging degrades capture thread
adhesion primarily through irreversible loss of water that begins as soon as these
supersaturated droplets are spun, even when maintained at high humidity. In other
words, Cyrtarachne may supersaturate its glue with water during spinning of capture
thread to achieve large droplet volume and rapid spreading due to low viscosity.
This conclusion seems fully warranted and well supported by the study’s findings.
However, I believe that it would be useful to offer a suggestion as to how spiders
accomplish this supersaturation during the spinning of these capture threads. The
threads of orb-weavers that have been studied are hygroscopic to varying degrees, as
the authors note, and capable of taking up atmospheric moisture. However, because
Cyrtarachne have lower concentrations of LMMCs and aren’t able to do this, I am
curious about the physiological process that might underlie the formation of
supersaturated droplets. Biological systems typically “pump” water by actively
transporting ions to create an osmotic gradient that attracts water. However, the low
LMMCs concentration in Cyrtarachne droplets makes this explanation less easily
applied. Could Cyrtarachne be initially heavily loading their aggregate gland dope
with LMMCs (or maybe simply inorganic ions, if one distinguished between these
two components), attracting large amounts of water, and then, in the final stages of
processing aggregate gland material, rapidly withdrawing hygroscopic compounds?
Being able to propose this or another mechanism to explain how Cyrtarachne
droplets could become supersaturated seems useful and a satisfying bit of
information for a reader to consider.
Presently it has been shown that the LMMCs of spiders are equally
dispersed through the aggregate glue dope. We believe it thus is not possible for
the spider to remove those LMMCs during the spinning process actively.
Additionally, there is no behavioral differences during web spinning which
point towards this. We believe at this time we can only comment that the water
must be actively pumped from the spider as we have stated.
I think a better strategy is state simply that we haven’t studied this interesting
physiological question
Two minor errors I noted were:
Lines 457-458: Particularly, how the glue spreads is able to spread across
three1dimensional surfaces might play a more important role on
Delete the first “ spreads”
Deleted Spreads
Lie 513: This supports that aging degrades capture thread adhesion
Probably should be “This supports the hypothesis that aging degrades capture thread
adhesion”
added hypothesis
