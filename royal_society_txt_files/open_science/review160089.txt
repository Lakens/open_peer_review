The manuscript describes a new species of Chaeropus, the pig footed bandicoot, an Australian
marsupial genus. The new finding extends the known biochron for the group covering a possible
small gap in a long gosh lineage, using the predictions of molecular studies.
These findings would have much more impact if several conclusions were supported by a
verifiable methodology:
- Pg. 2 line 31: Diagnosis “less high crowned than C. ecaudatus”
- Pg. 2 lines 35 & 36: “high crowned, but less so compared to C. ecaudatus”
This statement as written is imprecise. The height of tooth crown should be measured,
standardize and compare using a Hypsodonty Index already apply to other fossil mammals, such
as in Janis (1988) among others; see also Madden (2015).
- Pg. 4 line 37 “C. baynesi is likely to have been below 200 g.”
This statement needs to be supported with a description of how the author estimated the body
mass. There are some equations in the literature that use isolated tooth (e.g., Gordon, 2003) that
may be useful to provide a value with a verifiable methodology
- Pg. 4 lines 48 & 49 “C. baynesi, however, is unlikely to have been a grazer, but more
likely to be a mix-feeder or even omnivorous”
This observation could be supported by a number of methodologies. For example, the use of
different morphometric indexes or the analysis of the wear pattern and occlusion (Zimicz 2011)
has been used in the literature to identify dietary categories occupied by the fossil taxa.
Alternatively the analysis of stable isotopes (e.g., Wang et al 1994; MacFadden and Cerling 1996;
Prado et al. 2011, among several others), potentially applicable to the Pliocene specimen treated
in the article, could provide more accurate dietary data than currently expressed in the paper.

There is very little to criticize in this short, descriptive note. Extending the fossil record of
Chaeropus back to the Pliocene is a significant contribution, for reasons that the author explains
clearly in the text. The high-resolution images of teeth are very good, and image quality remains
sharp up to about 500X enlargement.
My only suggested revision is based on the goal of broadening the audience who can appreciate
the paper. As presented, the molar morphology on which the species description is based will be
incomprehensible to most readers. Some 25 landmarks on the occlusal surfaces are described, but
none of them are identified in the illustration. Tracing the dental terminology back to the source
cited (Travouillon et al. 2014) is not much help. The problem that mammalian dental terminology
is complicated--and the terminology for herbivorous mammals is even more complicated.

Although I could identify most of the landmarks on a set of carnivorous marsupial molars, I'm at
a complete loss to find more than a few on these lophodont-type teeth. After an hour or so of
paging through reference books and searching the internet, I could not find a single helpful
illustration. Most readers will have even less background and motivation. So... would it be
possible to include sketches of upper and lower Chaeropus molars with representative
landmarks labeled? That would be excellent.

Response to reviewers’ comments:
Reviewer: 1
- Pg. 2 line 31: Diagnosis “less high crowned than C. ecaudatus”
- Pg. 2 lines 35 & 36: “high crowned, but less so compared to C. ecaudatus”
This statement as written is imprecise. The height of tooth crown should be measured, standardize
and compare using a Hypsodonty Index already apply to other fossil mammals, such as in Janis
(1988) among others; see also Madden (2015).
<U+F0B7> The reviewer suggests to apply the hypsodonty index to the M3 specimen in order to
compare crown height. Hypsodonty index was developed on m3 only, and no m3 are
represented for C. baynesi, it is therefore not possible to do it, especially when Chaeropus
is very odd in the way it increases the height of its crown. It doesn’t increase the height by
growing taller cusps, but instead it increasing the height by elevating the talon toward the
palate, increasing the width of the tooth at an angle. The width here is therefore an
indication of the height of the crown, with wider teeth meaning increasing hypsodonty.
Considering the width of C. baynesi is less than that of C. ecaudatus, it is therefore less
high crowned. The Figure also shows the teeth of both species at the same scale, helping
to see this feature. A statement was added in the text to address this.
- Pg. 4 line 37 “C. baynesi is likely to have been below 200 g.”
This statement needs to be supported with a description of how the author estimated the body
mass. There are some equations in the literature that use isolated tooth (e.g., Gordon, 2003) that
may be useful to provide a value with a verifiable methodology
<U+F0B7> I have tried to estimate body mass based on isolated teeth, but unfortunately the
equations are not giving accurate results at all. There is another paper by Myers (2001) in
Australian Journal of Zoology, which also gives better calculations for marsupials, but it
doesn’t seem to work at all for Chaeropus. The new species is coming up to be around 400
g according to the equations, and any modern specimen I have measured also come up at
over 500 g. This is quite inaccurate seeing that there are records of the modern species
body mass weighing on average 200 grams. Considering that the fossil species has smaller
teeth than the modern species, and that teeth are correlated with size, it is only logical to
conclude that the fossil species was smaller than the modern species and therefore below
200g.
A statement was added to the text in order to make it clearer.
- Pg. 4 lines 48 & 49 “C. baynesi, however, is unlikely to have been a grazer, but more likely to
be a mix-feeder or even omnivorous”
This observation could be supported by a number of methodologies. For example, the use of
different morphometric indexes or the analysis of the wear pattern and occlusion (Zimicz 2011) has
been used in the literature to identify dietary categories occupied by the fossil taxa. Alternatively the
analysis of stable isotopes (e.g., Wang et al 1994; MacFadden and Cerling 1996; Prado et al. 2011,
among several others), potentially applicable to the Pliocene specimen treated in the article, could
provide more accurate dietary data than currently expressed in the paper.
multiple individuals, which is not the case here, as I only have an m2 and an M3 which
don’t occlude together. The research done by Wright et al. 1991 looked into the occlusion
pattern of Chaeropus and concluded that the pattern of occlusion of the teeth was
consistent with an herbivorous diet. C. baynesi though is missing some of the blade
development present in Chaeropus ecaudatus such as the poorly developed cristid
obliqua, which would be very important during the mastication process of plant material.
Considering that this species is only represented by 3 isolated teeth, a destructive
technique such analysis of stable isotopes is not recommended. Perhaps in the future if
more specimens are found, one specimen could be destroyed to recover some stable
isotopes. Meanwhile, morphology is the only tool that can be used to work out diet.
I have made no changes here because my statement was already quite cautious and
unfortunately there is nothing else I can do to test this hypothesis without more material.
