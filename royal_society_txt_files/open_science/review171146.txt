The paper reports ferroelasticity of 4,4’-dicarboxydiphenyl ether crystals. The phenomenon is
interesting, and the ferroelastic behavior is fully characterized by crystallographic analysis, stress-
strain measurement, and optical microscopy. The explanation is reasonable and understandable
that the deformed shape cannot be spontaneously recovered to the initial shape due to the much
larger critical stress (~0.14 MPa) of the ferroelastic crystal, in comparison with that (0.01-0.03
MPa) of the superelastic crystal in Ref. 8. The proposed mechanism is persuasive that the
twinning deformation is induced by the slight flipping of phenyl rings of the non-planar
molecule. The manuscript is compact and well prepared. So this paper is acceptable without any
revision.

Here the authors are presenting a study done on ferroelastic twinning of one of the polymorph of
4,4'-dicarboxydiphenyl ether. The authors clearly explaining the phenomena with adequate
experimental proof. The study is unique because this was based on non-planar organic molecule.
So I think this article can be publish without any revisions.
