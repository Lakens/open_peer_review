Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The paper is interesting, and presents a novel model as well as a robotic platform, both inspired
by inching and crawling soft-bodied animals. The proposed control approaches are highly
interesting for the fields of soft robotics and embodied intelligence, where this kind of
contribution is needed. There are, however, some issues that should be fixed and clarified before
acceptance, reason why I suggested a Major revision. Please see comments below.
pag 9 lines 33-37: Some references supporting these statements would help.
Pag 9 lines 57-59: Although well explained later (pag 10 lines 6-9), this statement could be
misleading. Challenges arising from the employment of soft materials in robotics are not due to
their “easy 3D deformability”. Please
Pag 10 line 36: please explain what prolegs are when you first mention them (also referred in Fig
1)
Pag 11 line 38: Fig. 2 is cited for the first time. The picture contains lot of information that should
be described in more detail either in the caption or in the text. I see that there's a modeling section
later, that I imagine will refer to some of the symbols appearing in the picture thus helping the
reader's comprehension, but it is difficult to understand Fig. 2 when it is first referred to in the
introduction. If you are describing the picture in greater detail later, it may be wise not to refer to
the picture in the intro at all. Besides that, please define the RTS acronym also in the caption of
the figure.
Pag 13 lines 35-39: Please make this sentence more fluid.
Pag 14 line 20: the term “anterograde oscillatory pattern” appears for the first time. Looks like it is
a very specific and not very common term, that should be defined.
Pag 15 Tab 2: There may be an error in the caption, as you never refer to model (iii) in the second
sentence.
Pag 15 line 56: “using with three different” <U+2192> “using three different”
Pag 15 lines 59-60: you may want to insert a sentence on explaining why oscillator phases
presents an oscillatory pattern in Fig 3b, and what does it means. Also, regarding the “near
stability” of those phases, model(i) in fig 3(b) looks clearly increasing, and thus not stable. A
slight rising trend is observable also for model (ii). Please clarify these doubts. Also, please report
in the caption of Fig. 3 which curve refers to which locomotion strategy, for the reader's
convenience.
Pag 16 lines 8-15: you state that model (ii) refers to configurations in which the caterpillar has legs
in the middle of the body. The most intuitive choice for alpha appears to be, to an unexperienced
reader, something like “0 0 0 0 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 0”, i.e. non-zero values in the center, an maybe
symmetry. Model ii, on the other hand, displays a different pattern, that I feel should be better
3
explained. It looks like an almost arbitrary choice that doesn not appear to match your
explanation. Please provide more details. I think that a figure that clarifies the choice of alpha
values would help, maybe clearly comparing to the species mentioned in the text. Figure 1 may
be part of the solution to this doubt, but please try to better clarify these doubts.
Page 16 lines 20-24: same concerns as before regarding the specific choice and biological
plausibility of alpha.
Pag 15 – 2.3 Numerical experiments:
From Eq. 5 and Tab. 2 I understand that you are simulating a surface offering very good grip,
with high static friction at gripping points (probably never allowing feet slipping in a dynamic
friction regime). Is it correct? I so, you may want to make this clear to the reader, maybe referring
to the type of locomotion exhibited by the model animals. Although I tend to believe that this is a
reasonable choice, this is not a trivial assumption, that should be motivated. Also, referring to
Tab. 2, why did you pick exactly 10 as alpha value? A reader may also expect different
experiments with different friction values. You should explain if and why you performed
experiments only for this choice of alpha. Finally, details regarding the implementation of the
model could be useful. I don't know if you are providing those later in the paper. Also: is the
model and the simulation data made available with this publication? This would improve the
soundness of the work, allowing reproducibility. This could be even judged as required for
publication, as supporting data are required as a condition of publication.
Pag 16 line 46. Why do you use 12 segments in your simulations, but then work with a robot with
just 4? I guess you are going to compare the model against the behavior of the robot, but this
discrepancy makes a huge difference between the two. Model-robot discrepancies should always
be reduced, and this one is definitely under your control. I can see that building a 12 segments
robot would be more complex, but then, why did you simulate a 12 segments robot in the first
place? Even with a comment explaining the rationale behind this choice, I would regard it as a
very strange one.
Pag 16 Line 53: “[...] of the robot segment”
Pag 16 line 59: Did you 3D-print a mold, or are you using a 3D-printer that directly prints soft
matter? Please provide a few details on the fabrication procedure.
Page 18 – On what type of surface was the robot moving in your experiments, and why? It looks
that your model only describes static friction. Did you observe slipping phenomena in your
robot, that may be one of the reasons behind the discrepancy among robotic trials and
experiments? Did you try it on different surfaces? Please elaborate a bit on this.
Page 18 line 24: how did you replicate these arrangements when downscaling from 12 to 4
segments?
Page 18 line 29: “to setting”
Pag 18 line 34: From Fig 6, it looks like the fastest configuraton allows the robot to move, roughly,
at 6 cm/min. The focus of the paper is not, clearly, on building a fast robot, but the reader will
notice that the robot is rather slow. Having an idea of how fast the animals that inspired this
design move could better sustain your work. If you make such a comparison, please normalize
distances and speeds referring to body lengths.
Pag 18 lines 34-36: I would not say from Fig 6b,c, that all phase states are stable. It seems that
there's indeed some variability (particularly clear in theta3 in Fig 6c). Please elucidate this.
4
Reporting limit cycles could help when talking about stability. (As a side note, there are
duplicated entries in the legend.)
General note regarding robotic trials: single observations are generally considered weak,
especially when analyzing complex phenomena in which variability can occur. All your
statements would be much stronger if you could support them with data gathered in more than
one trial and with some proper statistical analysis. The same holds for numerical simulations.
However, it does not look like there is any source of noise/variability in your model, so you
should be safe here.
Page 19 lines 11-13: If I understand correctly, different species can exhibit both crawling and
inching by modifying their morphology, affecting the gripping points, this reconfiguration being
controlled by what their proprioceptive information, affected by the substrate they are working
on. From the point of view of robotics and embodied intelligence, it would be extremely
interesting to observe an automatic transition between those two gaits when the robot moves on
different terrains, determined by proprioceptive information (instead of manually altering the
morphology, as you did with the tape). It would be interesting either if this transition
spontaneously emerged from the interaction of a fixed body with a changing environment, or
controlled by slightly modifying the body (e.g. maybe just modifying the inclination of the feet).
This would be a great example of a robot sensing the environment through the body, and
modifying in turn the behavior by controlling morphological adaptation. This idea of altering the
behavior by altering the body is very intruguing and promising. It is sometimes referred to as
morphosis/morphing in embodied intelligence literature. You may want to elaborate a bit on
this, as your setting has lot of potential in this direction. Doing so, you could consider referring to
previous work hinting at this concept:
F. Corucci, M. Calisti, H. Hauser, C. Laschi "Shaping the body to shape the behavior: a more
active role of the morphology in the brain-body trade-off", 13th European Conference on
Artificial Life (ECAL 2015) in York, United Kingdom, 20-24 July 2015
F. Corucci, M. Calisti, H. Hauser, C. Laschi, "Novelty-based evolutionary design of morphing
underwater robots", Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO), July 11-15
2015, Madrid, Spain
In those works the change in the behavior arose from a manually controlled morphological
reconfiguration (similarly to what you did by placing tape below the feets to change the friction).
Your platform could, however, allow the automatic trigger of such reconfigurations, which is
more powerful.
Pag 19 lines 48-51: plesae support this statement with a reference.
Page 20 line 26: “surficial” deformation. Did you mean “superficial”?
Discussions: There are big discrepancies among the robot and the model, such as the different
number of segments. This and other possible sources of discrepancies should be made clear and
further discussed. In general, the discussion of the model/robot discrepancy (which is a very
relevant issue) is a bit short, and could be improved.

Comments:
The paper presents both a theoretical model that was tested numerically, and a physical robot
implementation of a caterpillar like robot. The authors hypothesise that many animals use real
time evaluation of friction forces in order to adapt the control of locomotion. Based on this
perspective, the authors propose a decentralised control scheme for locomotion of multi
segmented structures that uses local feedback of structure deformation to estimate friction forces
acting on the flexible body. Three models were tested in numerical simulation, each model
differing by the number of feet per segment that can be in contact with the ground. The numerical
simulation showed corresponding gaits to the animal with similar proleg structure. However, the
robot experiment seemed not to fully match the predicted behaviour.
This paper is presented in a technically sound form and is well written. The authors hypothesise
a very interesting approach to decentralised control and how local feedback could be used to
synchronise the complex locomotion system. However, there are some major and a couple of
minor issues the authors might want to consider:
Major issues:
The authors’ main message is that local feedback and decentralised control is solving the problem
of coordination between the individual segments. However, there is no proof in the paper to
validate this claim. How can the success of locomotion be attributed to the implementation of the
third term in equation 6? Equation 6 has three terms, and as far as I understood the authors
thought of the last "discrepancy" term and implemented it in the model and robot. It is however
not clear if the locomotion properties are actually influenced by this novel term, or if the
emerging gait is already defined with the first two terms. What is the influence of the three terms
on the locomotion behavior in detail? Please elaborate on why these terms are important and how
they contribute to the overall locomotion behaviour.
Furthermore, it is unclear if the theoretical model was built to explain biological systems, or to
predict the robotic implementation’s motion. It is questionable if the model can represent both
systems, given that acting friction forces are different a 1cm long caterpillar where adhesive
forces become more important (insects make use of adhesive or hairy pads) than for a heavier
and larger 20cm long robot where adhesive interactions with the ground can be neglected. Why
did the authors decide to use a dynamic friction model rather than a static one, given that
caterpillars and the robot presumably don’t slip? I understand the position of the authors as
bioroboticists, trying to learn more about nature by building robots even though robots can never
be a complete replication of the biological counterpart. From that perspective it is natural to have
some degree of discrepancies between robot and animal, though I would feel more comfortable if
the model was verified much more carefully and clearly states the boundary conditions for which
the model was made to be accurate.
Furthermore, after these considerations above, the most important point we should consider is
whether this “pseudo animal model” could give any insights into the biological systems. As
pointed out by many bio-roboticists in the past, the most important (at least for biologists) is the
process in which the discovery in robot platforms should be fedback to biology as hypotheses
and verified them in animals. I’m not sure this paper can be concluded only by saying “these
results can shed light on the basic principles of animals” at last, but it needs to clearly discuss
what principles this paper has actually discovered. Without further detailed discussion about
what we learnt about animals from these experiments, this paper looks only half-way done.
7
Minor issues:
The concept of RTS is new for me, so please explain it in detail, and also spell out the term in
figure 2. Please elaborate the degrees to which this is novel and different from the other
technologies such as parallel elasticity or adjustable stiffness actuators, etc.
Why is figure 3 only plotted until t=50? It seems like some of the models have not yet reached
steady state. Please increase the shown time.
It would be nice to have a comparison between the robot and the model, e.g. comparing the
graphs shown in figure 3.
In figure 7, why start after 80 and 46 seconds? The visibility of gaits is bad, could you improve the
figure?
Friction forces are usually with respect to the contact point velocity rather than the centre of mass
velocity. The way it is implemented may be correct for rigid bodies in translation, but certainly
not for soft bodies that are twisting and bending. Please reconsider the implementation of
friction.
Reference 2 has a mistake, with the authors names repeated twice.
In conclusion, this paper presents an interesting control method based on decentralised control
and local feedback which was implemented in a robot model and which should elucidate the
control principles used in the animal. Although the approach seems rather promising, the
analysis of the proposed hypothesis for control was not done very carefully. As I think that the
authors have used the right approach for answering the question of how motion is controlled in
caterpillar like animals (building theoretical model and testing it in a physical model), I would
suggest revising the model and to resubmit a paper with a generous analysis of the stated
hypothesis.

Comments to the Author:
The original reviewers from RS Interface were not available, so your manuscript was sent to new
expert reviewers. All three reviewers praise the authors’ approach to the interesting problem of
soft-bodied locomotion. However, whereas Reviewer 2 was happy with the paper as it currently
stands, Reviewers 1 and 3 both raise concerns that require major revisions. While I appreciate
that the authors have already made revisions to their previous version, Reviewers 1 and 3 have
raised reasonable and constructive concerns. Reviewer 1 suggests that the authors need to
improve the discussion about discrepancies between the simulation and physical
implementation, which was also a concern raised in the original RS-Interface reviews.
Additionally, Reviewer 1 would like further results and discussion on variability in the
performance of the physical robot. Reviewer 3 requests a more thorough analysis of the specific
importance of the third term in equation 6 for the overall locomotor performance, as this
‘discrepancy function’ term is the specific novel contribution of the authors’ control scheme. It
would be helpful if the authors included simulations with and without this term. Reviewer 3 also
asks the authors to better address in the discussion what specific biological insights might be
drawn from this work. Are there specific hypotheses and predictions that can be made about
caterpillar locomotion based on the findings here? Please elaborate further on this.

did the authors decide to use a dynamic friction model rather than a static one, given that
caterpillars and the robot presumably don’t slip? I understand the position of the authors as
bioroboticists, trying to learn more about nature by building robots even though robots can never
be a complete replication of the biological counterpart. From that perspective it is natural to have
some degree of discrepancies between robot and animal, though I would feel more comfortable if
the model was verified much more carefully and clearly states the boundary conditions for which
the model was made to be accurate.
Furthermore, after these considerations above, the most important point we should consider is
whether this “pseudo animal model” could give any insights into the biological systems. As
pointed out by many bio-roboticists in the past, the most important (at least for biologists) is the
process in which the discovery in robot platforms should be fedback to biology as hypotheses
and verified them in animals. I’m not sure this paper can be concluded only by saying “these
results can shed light on the basic principles of animals” at last, but it needs to clearly discuss
what principles this paper has actually discovered. Without further detailed discussion about
what we learnt about animals from these experiments, this paper looks only half-way done.
Minor issues:
The concept of RTS is new for me, so please explain it in detail, and also spell out the term in
figure 2. Please elaborate the degrees to which this is novel and different from the other
technologies such as parallel elasticity or adjustable stiffness actuators, etc.
Why is figure 3 only plotted until t=50? It seems like some of the models have not yet reached
steady state. Please increase the shown time.
It would be nice to have a comparison between the robot and the model, e.g. comparing the
graphs shown in figure 3.
In figure 7, why start after 80 and 46 seconds? The visibility of gaits is bad, could you improve the
figure?
Friction forces are usually with respect to the contact point velocity rather than the centre of mass
velocity. The way it is implemented may be correct for rigid bodies in translation, but certainly
not for soft bodies that are twisting and bending. Please reconsider the implementation of
friction.
Reference 2 has a mistake, with the authors names repeated twice.
In conclusion, this paper presents an interesting control method based on decentralised control
and local feedback which was implemented in a robot model and which should elucidate the
control principles used in the animal. Although the approach seems rather promising, the
analysis of the proposed hypothesis for control was not done very carefully. As I think that the
authors have used the right approach for answering the question of how motion is controlled in
caterpillar like animals (building theoretical model and testing it in a physical model), I would
suggest revising the model and to resubmit a paper with a generous analysis of the stated
hypothesis.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Monica Daley):
Associate Editor: 1
Comments to the Author:
The original reviewers from RS Interface were not available, so your manuscript
was sent to new expert reviewers. All three reviewers praise the authors’
approach to the interesting problem of soft-bodied locomotion. However,
whereas Reviewer 2 was happy with the paper as it currently stands, Reviewers 1
and 3 both raise concerns that require major revisions. While I appreciate that
the authors have already made revisions to their previous version, Reviewers 1
and 3 have raised reasonable and constructive concerns. Reviewer 1 suggests
that the authors need to improve the discussion about discrepancies between
the simulation and physical implementation, which was also a concern raised in
the original RS-Interface reviews. Additionally, Reviewer 1 would like further
results and discussion on variability in the performance of the physical robot.
Reviewer 3 requests a more thorough analysis of the specific importance of the
third term in equation 6 for the overall locomotor performance, as this
‘discrepancy function’ term is the specific novel contribution of the authors’
control scheme. It would be helpful if the authors included simulations with and
without this term. Reviewer 3 also asks the authors to better address in the
discussion what specific biological insights might be drawn from this work. Are
there specific hypotheses and predictions that can be made about caterpillar
locomotion based on the findings here? Please elaborate further on this.
In order to improve the parts that the reviewer pointed out, we mainly revised and added the
following three points:
<U+F0FC> More description and analysis about the local sensory feedback and how it does work are
added focusing on the friction force and its modeling.
<U+F0FC> The paper consists of two-stage process: first part is modeling for extracting the
control/design principals from the real animal, and second part is building a prototype to
verify the principles. The logic flow of the revised paper is emphasized.
<U+F0FC> Description of the real animal and comparison the model/prototype with the real animal are
added.
The details of the amendments are described below.

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The paper is interesting, and presents a novel model as well as a robotic
platform, both inspired by inching and crawling soft-bodied animals. The
proposed control approaches are highly interesting for the fields of soft robotics
and embodied intelligence, where this kind of contribution is needed. There are,
however, some issues that should be fixed and clarified before acceptance,
reason why I suggested a Major revision. Please see comments below.

Page 9 lines 57-59: Although well explained later (pag 10 lines 6-9), this
statement could be misleading. Challenges arising from the employment of soft
materials in robotics are not due to their “easy 3D deformability”. Please
This comment is not finished so we can only guess what the reviewer would like to say. We
presume it would be that deformation in three dimensional space without complex deformation
does not make the designer/operator difficult to control using conventional robotics approaches.
Yes, it is true and the sentence was misleading. So the sentence is amended as follows.
soft materials deform into complex shapes (twisting, buckling, wrinkling and so on) easily in
three-dimensional space which makes them difficult to control using conventional robotics
approaches.
Page 10 line 36: please explain what prolegs are when you first mention them
(also referred in Fig 1)
Sorry for using the unfamiliar word for some readers. A footnote is added to explain what a
proleg is: A proleg is a fleshy leg that develops on an abdominal segment of some insect larvae,
which disappear in the adult. (They are confirmed in the middle and rear segments in the Fig. 1
(a) and the rear segments in Fig. 1 (b)).
Page 11 line 38: Fig. 2 is cited for the first time. The picture contains lot of
information that should be described in more detail either in the caption or in the
text. I see that there's a modeling section later, that I imagine will refer to some
of the symbols appearing in the picture thus helping the reader's
comprehension, but it is difficult to understand Fig. 2 when it is first referred to
in the introduction. If you are describing the picture in greater detail later, it may
be wise not to refer to the picture in the intro at all. Besides that, please define
the RTS acronym also in the caption of the figure.
The citation is deleted and we defined the RTS acronym. We appreciate the kind advice.
Page 13 lines 35-39: Please make this sentence more fluid.
We are afraid that the sentence is too long, which may readers confused. So the sentence is
divided to make it simple.
As can be seen in figure 1, legs on the real caterpillar grip when the body segment elongates
and the legs are in contact with the substrate. Meanwhile, legs can release the substrate as the
segment contracts.
Page 14 line 20: the term “anterograde oscillatory pattern” appears for the first
time. Looks like it is a very specific and not very common term, that should be
defined.
Considering the reason of this comment, we thought that we should not only add an explanation
of “anterograde oscillatory pattern” but also illustrate why such wave pattern is needed for
inching and crawling locomotion. So the following explanation about the locomotion forms are
added before the paragraph:
Caterpillar’s locomotion can be classified into two distinct locomotion forms: crawling and
inching [19]. Larger caterpillars tend to have prolegs in the middle segments and to use
crawling locomotion. In the locomotion form, a wave of steps is initiated at the posterior, and
the wave is transmitted to front segments. This bending and contrasting wave patterns from the
rear to front is called anterograde wave. By contrast, smaller caterpillars tend to lack prolegs
in the middle segments and to produce inching locomotion. In inching locomotion, the posterior
legs are pulled forward to grip the substrate just behind the front (thoracic) segments, the front
grip is released, and then the body is extended forward. This locomotion form also requires an
anterograde wave in the sense that the first step is started from the rear, which is sent to the
front.
Page 15 Tab 2: There may be an error in the caption, as you never refer to model
(iii) in the second sentence.
The error was corrected. We are grateful for the comment.
Page 15 line 56: “using with three different” <U+2192> “using three different”
The typo is corrected. Thank you so much.
Page 15 lines 59-60: you may want to insert a sentence on explaining why
oscillator phases presents an oscillatory pattern in Fig 3b, and what does it
means. Also, regarding the “near stability” of those phases, model(i) in fig 3(b)
looks clearly increasing, and thus not stable. A slight rising trend is observable
also for model (ii). Please clarify these doubts. Also, please report in the caption
of Fig. 3 which curve refers to which locomotion strategy, for the reader's
convenience.
We have to apologize the insufficient expiation about why oscillator phases presents an
oscillatory pattern in figure 4b (which used to be Fig 3b). The following explanation was added
in the second paragraph in ‘2.5 Numerical experiment’:
Model (i) is a mathematical model in which all segments have legs. This produced the most
marked posterior to anterior phase shift (approximately 2p, figure 5) and the slowest
locomotion. Given that the second term (diffusion term) in equation (6) serves to produce in-
phase oscillation with the neighboring oscillators, the local sensory feedback (the third term in
equation (6)) provides the phase shift for generating crawling locomotion. What is happening
locally is that the local sensory feedback modifies the own phase so as to increase the ground
friction when it moves backward whereas so as to decrease the ground friction when it moves
forward (as equations (5-7) indicate).
With regards to whether it is nearly stable or not, I am afraid that the previous plot was not
sufficiently long (0-50 sec) so I replotted the data 0-200 sec. The renewed plot looks stable
conditions of Models i, ii, and iii.
Page 16 lines 8-15: you state that model (ii) refers to configurations in which the
caterpillar has legs in the middle of the body. The most intuitive choice for alpha
appears to be, to an unexperienced reader, something like “0 0 0 0 10 10 10 10 0
0 0 0”, i.e. non-zero values in the center, an maybe symmetry. Model ii, on the
other hand, displays a different pattern, that I feel should be better explained. It
looks like an almost arbitrary choice that doesn’t not appear to match your
explanation. Please provide more details. I think that a figure that clarifies the
choice of alpha values would help, maybe clearly comparing to the species
mentioned in the text. Figure 1 may be part of the solution to this doubt, but
please try to better clarify these doubts.
In order to show that the alpha arrangements in Models ii and iii are based on the morphological
structure of the crawling and inching caterpillars, a new figure is inserted instead of Table 2 as
figure 3. The figure clearly shows that why alpha values of some segments are zero whereas the
other are set as positive.
Page 16 lines 20-24: same concerns as before regarding the specific choice and
biological plausibility of alpha.
With regard to biological plausibility, we inserted the following description in the first
paragraph of `2.5 Numerical experiment’:
It is known that gripping system of the real caterpillars is very sophisticated: only one pair of
proleg is good enough to support the entire body of the real caterpillar [20]. Hence, we assume
value of p should be sufficiently high for the model and set p to 10 in this section.
Furthermore, the positive value putting in alpha, p, is important parameter for the propose
model, but we didn’t a good job about it. To compensate this, we inserted the simulation using
different value for alpha (figure 9) and description of how alpha-arrange affects the behavior in
the second paragraph of `4 Discussion’:
Such switching would require local information about the interaction of the animal with its
substrate. For instance, we can simulate less interactive circumstance between the model and
its substrate by decreasing the value of p. Figure 9 represents the phase gap from the tail to
front oscillators with smaller value of p. The plots indicate that crawling and inching switching
(the distinct gap from the tail to head between Models ii and iii) disappears with less friction
from the substrate.
Pag 15 – 2.5 Numerical experiments:
From Eq. 5 and Tab. 2 I understand that you are simulating a surface offering
very good grip, with high static friction at gripping points (probably never
allowing feet slipping in a dynamic friction regime). Is it correct? I so, you may
want to make this clear to the reader, maybe referring to the type of locomotion
exhibited by the model animals. Although I tend to believe that this is a
reasonable choice, this is not a trivial assumption, that should be motivated.
Also, referring to Tab. 2, why did you pick exactly 10 as alpha value? A reader
may also expect different experiments with different friction values. You should
explain if and why you performed experiments only for this choice of alpha.
Finally, details regarding the implementation of the model could be useful. I don't
know if you are providing those later in the paper. Also: is the model and the
simulation data made available with this publication? This would improve the
soundness of the work, allowing reproducibility. This could be even judged as
required for publication, as supporting data are required as a condition of
publication.
Please see the above response to the previous comment.
Movies of the numerical and prototype experiments will be submitted as attached files.
Page 16 line 46. Why do you use 12 segments in your simulations, but then work
with a robot with just 4? I guess you are going to compare the model against the
behavior of the robot, but this discrepancy makes a huge difference between the
two. Model-robot discrepancies should always be reduced, and this one is
definitely under your control. I can see that building a 12 segments robot would
be more complex, but then, why did you simulate a 12 segments robot in the first
place? Even with a comment explaining the rationale behind this choice, I would
regard it as a very strange one.
I think it’s natural that the reviewer has the doubt (why does 12-segment model in simulation
become 4-segment prototype?). I have to apologize the point.
The paper is constructed with two parts. One is a mathematical model for extracting the
mechanical and control design from the real caterpillars. To this end, the segment number of the
model was set as 12 which corresponds to the real caterpillars (crawling and inching ones).
Another is to design a prototype using the finding from the mathematical model. This doesn’t
require to mimic every detail of the real caterpillar since robotics technology has still many
limitations compared to living system (e.g., power-to-weight ratio compared to muscle,
microfabrication, energy efficiency and buttery). Therefore, we downsize the 12-segmented
mathematical model to 4-segmented prototype.
In the context, we amended the last paragraph of `1. I introduction’, the first paragraph of `2
Mathematical model’, first paragraph of `2.5 Numerical experiment’, the beginning of section 3
as follows:
(Last paragraph of `1. I introduction’)
…Section 2 first introduces a mathematical model that represents the body designs of
real crawling and inching caterpillars. The model consists of a series of oscillators with
coupled mechanical outputs that together form a decentralized control system. This is
implemented in a numerical simulation that produces organized locomotion. Based on
the findings from the numerical experiments, Section 3 then…(the last paragraph of `1. I
introduction’)
(First paragraph of 2 Mathematical Model)
This section is for extracting the control mechanism from the two distinct caterpillars (crawling
and inching ones). In this end we first model the deformable structure and motion control
mechanism of the real caterpillars. The goal here is to keep the mathematical model as simple
as possible but still mimic the relationship between the segment length and gripping/releasing
mechanism of the leg.
(First paragraph of 2.5 Numerical experiment)
To validate this control scheme we conducted a numerical simulation. The number of module,
N, is set as 12, which corresponds to the body structures of the real crawling and inching
caterpillars (figure 3). a_i is set as a positive coefficient, p, when the segment has prolegs,
whereas a_i is set as zero when the segment doesn’t have proleg. It is known that gripping
system of the real caterpillars is very sophisticated: only one pair of proleg is good enough to
support the entire body of the real caterpillar [20]. Hence, we assume value of p should be
sufficiently high for the model and set p to 10 in this section. We will discuss how decreasing
the value effects the model in 4. Discussion. Three different sets of leg-arrangement are
prepared as Models i, ii and iii (figure 3).
Furthermore, we added the following paragraph to explain why we change the segment number
from 12 (simulation) to 4 (the prototype) as the last paragraph of `2.5 Numerical experiment’:
Overall, phase shift from the rear to front of the anterograde wave depends on the proleg
arrangements. We will discuss the more these results and compare them with real animals in
Section 4. It should be noted that the oscillators of the segments `without prolegs’ (i.e., without
the local sensory feedback) in Models i and ii oscillate nearly in-phase between the neighboring
oscillators (figure 5). The results also indicate that the same number of segments is not
necessary when we design the prototype.
Finally, we also added the following paragraph in the beginning of section 3:
Based on the findings from the numerical experiments, we build a prototype of the model. The
purpose is not for imitation of the real caterpillar but for validation of the extracted control
mechanism from the mathematical model. Needless to say, the state-of-art robotics technology
has still many limitations compared to living system (e.g., power-to-weight ratio compared to
muscle, microfabrication technology, energy efficiency of actuators, and energy storage
capacity of butteries). Therefore, we downsize the 12-segmented mathematical model to 4-
segmented porotype.
Pag 16 Line 53: “[...] of the robot segment”
Thank you so much for this kind correction. The part is amended.
Pag 16 line 59: Did you 3D-print a mold, or are you using a 3D-printer that
directly prints soft matter? Please provide a few details on the fabrication
procedure.
We use a 3D-printer that directly print soft matter. The following sentence are added in ‘3.1
The hardware design’:
These parts are directly printed at once using a multimaterial printer (Objet, Connex 500).
Page 18 – On what type of surface was the robot moving in your experiments,
and why? It looks that your model only describes static friction. Did you observe
slipping phenomena in your robot, that may be one of the reasons behind the
discrepancy among robotic trials and experiments? Did you try it on different
surfaces? Please elaborate a bit on this.
The prototype is also slipping with the ground as the attached movie shows (especially in the
beginning of the experiment because the phase relation for locomotion is not generated yet).
Unfortunately, the robot legs choose the surface. We tested several surfaces. Acrylic plate is too
sticky for the legs and it requires more power (sometimes the legs were damaged since the legs
stuck completely). Iron plate has the same problem. We added the following sentence in the end
of the first paragraph of `3.2 Experimental result with the robot’:
The robot is placed on a copy paper which is glued on a leveled table.
Page 18 line 24: how did you replicate these arrangements when downscaling
from 12 to 4 segments?
The reason is explained as the response of the above commend “Page 16 line 46. Why do
you use 12 segments in your simulations…”.
Page 18 line 29: “to setting”
The typo is collected. Thank you so much indeed.
Pag 18 line 34: From Fig 6, it looks like the fastest configuration allows the robot
to move, roughly, at 6 cm/min. The focus of the paper is not, clearly, on
building a fast robot, but the reader will notice that the robot is rather slow.
Having an idea of how fast the animals that inspired this design move could
better sustain your work. If you make such a comparison, please normalize
distances and speeds referring to body lengths.
The sale of normalized distance traveled are added. We are grateful for the comment.
Page 18 lines 34-36: I would not say from Fig 6b,c, that all phase states are
stable. It seems that there's indeed some variability (particularly clear in theta3 in
Fig 6c). Please elucidate this. Reporting limit cycles could help when talking
about stability. (As a side note, there are duplicated entries in the legend.)
I am afraid that `stable’ is not a suitable word especially for this experiment under the complex
friction changes in the real world. One sure thing about the experiment is that, once the
prototype generates an anterograde wave, the prototype consistently generates crawling and
inching locomotion gaits depending on the morphology. This is reproduced every time we
experiment. That’s why we present the one data. To avoid the confusion, the paragraph is
revised and add more explanation:
Locomotion was produced in each of these configurations (figure 7a) and the oscillators
successfully generate anterograde oscillatory pattern (figure 7b, c). It is notable that phase shift
between the oscillators is amended so as to maintain anterograde oscillatory pattern every time
the phase shift is perturbed: phase relation between <U+03B8>_1-<U+03B8>_0 and <U+03B8>_2-<U+03B8>_0 becomes inverse
around 80 sec and 95 sec in figure 7b but is recovered to an anterograde oscillatory pattern
afterward.
This self-recovering of the phase relation is achieved by the local sensory feedback with the soft
body. Considering that the robot form is a continuum and deformable beam with friction on
ground, once upward bending is occurred, it can be easily sent to the peripheral segments (like
a wave motion of a rope on a ground). The proposed feedback controls the direction of the wave
motion, which also produces an anterograde wave eventually.
General note regarding robotic trials: single observations are generally
considered weak, especially when analyzing complex phenomena in which
variability can occur. All your statements would be much stronger if you could
support them with data gathered in more than one trial and with some proper
statistical analysis. The same holds for numerical simulations. However, it does
not look like there is any source of noise/variability in your model, so you should
be safe here.
We agree that the statistical analysis is not need in the numerical experiment since noise is not
implemented in the simulations. With regard to the experiment with the prototype, we’ve
already responded the comment (why we think the highlight data is good enough).
Page 19 lines 11-13: If I understand correctly, different species can exhibit both
crawling and inching by modifying their morphology, affecting the gripping
points, this reconfiguration being controlled by what their proprioceptive
information, affected by the substrate they are working on. From the point of
view of robotics and embodied intelligence, it would be extremely interesting to
observe an automatic transition between those two gaits when the robot moves
on different terrains, determined by proprioceptive information (instead of
manually altering the morphology, as you did with the tape). It would be
interesting either if this transition spontaneously emerged from the interaction of
a fixed body with a changing environment, or controlled by slightly modifying
the body (e.g. maybe just modifying the inclination of the feet). This would be a
great example of a robot sensing the environment through the body, and
modifying in turn the behavior by controlling morphological adaptation. This
idea of altering the behavior by altering the body is very intriguing and
promising. It is sometimes referred to as morphosis/morphing in embodied
intelligence literature. You may want to elaborate a bit on this, as your setting
has lot of potential in this direction. Doing so, you could consider referring to
previous work hinting at this concept:
F. Corucci, M. Calisti, H. Hauser, C. Laschi "Shaping the body to shape the
behavior: a more active role of the morphology in the brain-body trade-off", 13th
European Conference on Artificial Life (ECAL 2015) in York, United Kingdom, 20-
24 July 2015
F. Corucci, M. Calisti, H. Hauser, C. Laschi, "Novelty-based evolutionary design
of morphing underwater robots", Genetic and Evolutionary Computation
Conference (GECCO), July 11-15 2015, Madrid, Spain
In those works the change in the behavior arose from a manually controlled
morphological reconfiguration (similarly to what you did by placing tape below
the feets to change the friction). Your platform could, however, allow the
automatic trigger of such reconfigurations, which is more powerful.
We really appreciate the valuable comments but we are afraid that the idea (changing the proleg
arrangement or surface condition dynamically) could not be along the context since proleg-
arrangement depends on the species and is fixed. This is why the legs of the prototype were
manually altered. With regard to friction change, the gripping mechanism of the real caterpillar
is too good so the friction change does not change their behavior. We really want to take the
direction when I will write a purely robotic content.

Yes. The wrong word was corrected.
Discussions: There are big discrepancies among the robot and the model, such
as the different number of segments. This and other possible sources of
discrepancies should be made clear and further discussed. In general, the
discussion of the model/robot discrepancy (which is a very relevant issue) is a
bit short, and could be improved.
We are grateful for the kind comment. We already added why we chose 12 segments in
simulation and 4 segment in the prototype. The discussion are amended as we already
mentioned.

Comments to the Author(s)
Comments:
The paper presents both a theoretical model that was tested numerically, and a
physical robot implementation of a caterpillar like robot. The authors hypothesise
that many animals use real time evaluation of friction forces in order to adapt the
control of locomotion. Based on this perspective, the authors propose a
decentralised control scheme for locomotion of multi segmented structures that
uses local feedback of structure deformation to estimate friction forces acting on
the flexible body. Three models were tested in numerical simulation, each model
differing by the number of feet per segment that can be in contact with the ground.
The numerical simulation showed corresponding gaits to the animal with similar
proleg structure. However, the robot experiment seemed not to fully match the
predicted behaviour.
This paper is presented in a technically sound form and is well written. The
authors hypothesise a very interesting approach to decentralised control and how
local feedback could be used to synchronise the complex locomotion system.
However, there are some major and a couple of minor issues the authors might
want to consider:
Major issues:
The authors’ main message is that local feedback and decentralised control is
solving the problem of coordination between the individual segments. However,
there is no proof in the paper to validate this claim. How can the success of
locomotion be attributed to the implementation of the third term in equation 6?
Equation 6 has three terms, and as far as I understood the authors thought of the
last "discrepancy" term and implemented it in the model and robot. It is however
not clear if the locomotion properties are actually influenced by this novel term,
or if the emerging gait is already defined with the first two terms. What is the
influence of the three terms on the locomotion behavior in detail? Please elaborate
on why these terms are important and how they contribute to the overall
locomotion behaviour.
We apologize that our explanation and claim about the proposed decentralized control is not
enough. To improve the point, we should have explained how the oscillators work more carefully.
In the revised manuscript, we added the description in the second and fifth paragraphs.
<Second paragraph in 2.5 Numerical experiment>
…Given that the second term (diffusion term) in equation (6) serves to produce in-phase
oscillation with the neighboring oscillators, the local sensory feedback (the third term in equation
(6)) provides the phase shift for generating crawling locomotion. What is happening locally is
that the local sensory feedback modifies the own phase so as to increase the ground friction when
it moves backward whereas so as to decrease the ground friction when it moves forward.
<Fifth paragraph in 2.5 Numerical experiment>
Overall, phase shift from the rear to front of the anterograde wave depends on the proleg
arrangements. It should be noted that the oscillators of the segments `without prolegs’ (i.e.,
without the local sensory feedback) in Models i and ii oscillate nearly in-phase between the
neighboring oscillators (figure 5). The results also indicate that the same number of segments is
not necessary when we design the prototype. We will discuss the more these results and compare
them with real animals in Section 4.
Furthermore, in order to illustrate the effect of the local sensory feedback to the behavior
(locomotion form), additional numerical experiments are added as Figure 9. The description is
inserted in the second paragraph in `4 Discussion’:
To discuss further about the importance of the local mechanosensory information, we simulated
less interactive circumstance between the model and its substrate by decreasing the value of p.
Figure 9 represents phase gap from the rear to front oscillators with smaller values of p. The
plots indicate that crawling and inching switching (the distinct gap from the rear to head between
Models ii and iii) disappears with less friction from the substrate. This simulation result
indicates that a real caterpillar may not be able to produce appropriate locomotion gait in the
circumstance where interaction between the body and environment is not enough. One of the most
extreme cases is placing Maduca sexta on soft substrate: the animal cannot generate gait pattern
and stop locomotion on the soft substrate.
Furthermore, it is unclear if the theoretical model was built to explain biological
systems, or to predict the robotic implementation’s motion. It is questionable if
the model can represent both systems, given that acting friction forces are
different a 1cm long caterpillar where adhesive forces become more important
(insects make use of adhesive or hairy pads) than for a heavier and larger 20cm
long robot where adhesive interactions with the ground can be neglected. Why did
the authors decide to use a dynamic friction model rather than a static one, given
that caterpillars and the robot presumably don’t slip? I understand the position of
the authors as bioroboticists, trying to learn more about nature by building robots
even though robots can never be a complete replication of the biological
counterpart. From that perspective it is natural to have some degree of
discrepancies between robot and animal, though I would feel more comfortable if
the model was verified much more carefully and clearly states the boundary
conditions for which the model was made to be accurate.
The prototype is slipping too. Our goal is to keep the mathematical model as simple as possible
but still mimic the relationship between the segment length and gripping/releasing mechanism of
the leg. As the reviewer pointed out, it is ideally better to use a static friction in the simulation
model because it is close to real situation. However, modeling a static friction is not an easy task.
We attempted to keep the model as simple as possible, and thus, we used a dynamic friction. In
spite of such discrepancy between the simulation and real environments, the results obtained from
the simulations and the real-world experiments are qualitatively identical. Hence, we do not
consider that the difference in the friction model (dynamic vs. static friction) is a crucial problem.
Furthermore, after these considerations above, the most important point we
should consider is whether this “pseudo animal model” could give any insights
into the biological systems. As pointed out by many bio-roboticists in the past,
the most important (at least for biologists) is the process in which the discovery
in robot platforms should be fedback to biology as hypotheses and verified them
in animals. I’m not sure this paper can be concluded only by saying “these results
can shed light on the basic principles of animals” at last, but it needs to clearly
discuss what principles this paper has actually discovered. Without further
detailed discussion about what we learnt about animals from these experiments,
this paper looks only half-way done.
We appreciate this precious comment. We are afraid that there are three points missing in the
previous submitted manuscript. One is the insufficient description of the real animal and
plausibility of the model. We amend this point: we illustrate the details of crawling and inching
caterpillars and how the proposed model matches them. Another is that the logic structure was
not emphasized enough: first part is modeling for extracting the control/design principals from
the real animal, and second part is building a prototype to verify the principles. Final one is that
a declaration about our contribution to the biology is missing. So we added the following sentence
in the conclusion:
The results correspond to the morphological difference between crawling and inching
caterpillars, which indicates that the animals also use the similar motion control regardless of
the morphological difference.
Minor issues:
The concept of RTS is new for me, so please explain it in detail, and also spell out
the term in figure 2. Please elaborate the degrees to which this is novel and
different from the other technologies such as parallel elasticity or adjustable
stiffness actuators, etc.
We are grateful for the comment. We add insert the footnote to alleviate this:
We have developed such passively-deformable actuator called RTS. For instance, we developed
a coil spring that can alter its resting length forcibly wound/unwound by DC motor [17]. Passivity
can be emulated by DC motor with Proportional–Derivative control, which is used in this paper.
Why is figure 3 only plotted until t=50? It seems like some of the models have not
yet reached steady state. Please increase the shown time.
We replotted until t=200 sec. Thank you for the comment.
It would be nice to have a comparison between the robot and the model, e.g.
comparing the graphs shown in figure 3.
We appreciate the comment. The comparing data with the simulations is shown as <U+03B8> <U+03B8> . This
description is added in Figure 7.
In figure 7, why start after 80 and 46 seconds? The visibility of gaits is bad, could
you improve the figure?
It takes more time to generate the continuous crawling oscillatory pattern compared to the inching
one (These match the numerical results). That’s why we chose the snapshots start after 80 sec
for crawling and 46 sec for inching. With regard to the visibility of gaits, we also attach a movie
for the experiment (describing the difference between the gait patterns has limitation with the
snapshots. That’s why we put arrows in the figure.)
Friction forces are usually with respect to the contact point velocity rather than
the centre of mass velocity. The way it is implemented may be correct for rigid
bodies in translation, but certainly not for soft bodies that are twisting and bending.
Please reconsider the implementation of friction.
The mechanism of grip and release of the real caterpillar’s legs is more complicated than any
combination of nonlinear viscous and elasticity of the complex leg-shape deformation. Modeling
such friction is not our aim. Given the result and grip/release relationship with the segment length,
we don’t feel any necessity to us. As the reviewer pointed out, it is ideally better to use a static
friction in the simulation model because it is close to real situation. However, modeling a static
friction is not an easy task. We attempted to keep the model as simple as possible, and thus, we
used a dynamic friction. In spite of such discrepancy between the simulation and real
environments, the results obtained from the simulations and the real-world experiments are
qualitatively identical. Hence, we do not consider that the difference in the friction model
(dynamic vs. static friction) is a crucial problem.
Reference 2 has a mistake, with the authors names repeated twice.
We correct it. Much obliged!
In conclusion, this paper presents an interesting control method based on
decentralised control and local feedback which was implemented in a robot model
and which should elucidate the control principles used in the animal. Although the
approach seems rather promising, the analysis of the proposed hypothesis for
control was not done very carefully. As I think that the authors have used the right
approach for answering the question of how motion is controlled in caterpillar like
animals (building theoretical model and testing it in a physical model), I would
suggest revising the model and to resubmit a paper with a generous analysis of
the stated hypothesis.
