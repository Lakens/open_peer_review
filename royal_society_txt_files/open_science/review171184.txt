This manuscript describes the effect of carbohydrate-based superabsorbent polymer on seed
germination and seeding growth of maize. It has not been written carefully and not checked by
the authors before submission. It does not contain useful results sufficiently. The quality of
English is poor. This is not a comprehensive study. The organization and presentation of the
manuscript are not good. This manuscript does not have sufficiently high impact for publication
in Royal Society Open Science.
Some of my other opinions and comments about the manuscript are as follows:
1) Page 1, line 26: “fourier” should be replaced by “Fourier”.
2) English must be improved. In the manuscript, there are many grammatical errors and
instances of badly constructed sentences. Some examples are:
• Page 1, lines 29-31: This sentence should be revised.
• Page 1, lines 31 and 32: This sentence should be revised.
• Page 1, lines 44 and 45: This sentence should be revised.
• Page 1, lines 51 and 52: This sentence should be revised.
• Page 1, lines 52 and 53: This sentence should be revised.
• Page 2, lines 5 and 6: This sentence should be revised.
• Page 2, lines 18 and 19: This sentence should be revised.
• Page 2, lines 21 and 22: This sentence should be revised.
3) Page 1, line 43: “Superabsorbent polymers (SAP) is” should be replaced by “Superabsorbent
polymers (SAPs) are”.
4) Page 2, lines 9-16, section 2.2: The method used in the preparation of superabsorbent is not
clearly described and is not sufficiently informative to allow replication of the research. What is
the amount of polymer? What is the amount of palygorskite? What are the amounts of initiator
and cross linking agent? How did the authors decide these amounts?
5) Characterization of superabsorbent is not sufficient.
6) What are the effects of polymer concentration, palygorskite concentration, initiator
concentration, cross linking concentration, reaction time, etc. on the water uptake of
carbohydrate-based superabsorbent polymer used on seed germination and seeding growth of
maize?
7) Page 2, line 18: It is stated that “The samples were scanned with FTIR-FTS3000 at wavelengths
of 400-4000 cm-1”. This statement is wrong!!!
8) Page 2, line 25: The symbol of kilo is not “K”.
9) Page 3, line 5: What is the meaning of “MS-g-PAA/PGS”?
10) Page 9, Fig. 1: Please indicate the name of y-axis in Fig. 9.

The manuscript presents original results, but unfortunately their presentation is too poor, and

Here is a list of my comments:
1. Page 2, line 2: “(ii) to determine the effects of SAP in improving seed germination and seedling

2. Page 2, 2.2. Preparation of superabsorbent: This section is too brief. Please add all the useful
information’s (concentrations, volumes, elementary operations, etc.).
3. Page 3, lines 11-12: “In combination with FTIR spectra analysis, PAA chains have been
successfully grafted into the MS macromolecular chains.” How this was done? Please indicate the
peaks which show the “successfully binding”.
4. Page 4, lines 2-12: “From the research results can be clearly seen that… their stored water is
available for plant absorption [31].” All these observations must be more rigorous interpreted.
Also, some experiments related to the amount of water retained by SAP itself must be added in
the manuscript, in order to sustain these observations.
5. Page 9, Fig. 1: Please indicate in Figure 1 the wave numbers for important peaks.
6. What means “a, b, c…” letters from inside of Figures 4-8. These are not explained.
7. The authors must check very carefully the English grammar and spelling, because in the

This work reports the effects of eco-friendly carbohydrate-based supersorbent polymers on seed
germination and seed growth of maize. The paper is interesting and characterization of the SAP
is sufficient but with minor pitfalls. Overall, I would recommend publication after the following
comments have been addressed.
1. The authors should label the important IR peaks on the figure to easily follow.
2. The degradation temperatures of AA, PGS and MS should also be discussed.
3. Since the authors talk about the ability of SAP to use in arid and semiarid areas, some
experiments need to be conducted in order the see the seed germination and seed growth at

This manuscript describes the effect of carbohydrate-based superabsorbent polymer
on seed germination and seeding growth of maize. It has not been written carefully
and not checked by the authors before submission. It does not contain useful results
sufficiently. The quality of English is poor. This is not a comprehensive study. The
organization and presentation of the manuscript are not good. This manuscript does
not have sufficiently high impact for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Some of my other opinions and comments about the manuscript are as follows:
1. Page 1, line 26: “fourier” should be replaced by “Fourier”.
Response: Thanks for the Reviewer's careful correction, I have made changes as: We
synthesized superabsorbent polymers with carbohydrate and characterized by Fourier
transform infrared spectra analyses, scanning electron microscopy and
thermogravimetric /differential thermal analyses.
2. English must be improved. In the manuscript, there are many grammatical errors
and instances of badly constructed sentences. Some examples are:
• Page 1, lines 29-31: This sentence should be revised.
• Page 1, lines 31 and 32: This sentence should be revised.
• Page 1, lines 44 and 45: This sentence should be revised.
• Page 1, lines 51 and 52: This sentence should be revised.
• Page 1, lines 52 and 53: This sentence should be revised.
• Page 2, lines 5 and 6: This sentence should be revised.
• Page 2, lines 18 and 19: This sentence should be revised.
• Page 2, lines 21 and 22: This sentence should be revised.
Response: Thank you very much for your helpful comments, these comments are
very significant to modify our manuscript. I have revised these questions you raised.
Since this is the first English article I wrote, there are many places I need to study.
Thank you so much for your careful and commendable comments so that I can learn a
lot. Really appreciate your comments! The detailed modifications are listed below:
• Page 1, lines 29-31: This sentence was revised as: The results showed that adding an
appropriate amount of superabsorbent polymers could improve root length, shoot
length, total biomass, germination potential and germination rate.
• Page 1, lines 31 and 32: This sentence was revised as: It indicates that this
superabsorbent polymers is not toxic to plant and can promote seed germination of
plant, and at the same time provides a possibility to replace other substrates.
• Page 1, lines 44 and 45: This sentence was revised as: Superabsorbent polymers
(SAPs) is known for its ultra-strong water absorbing power. It can quickly absorb the
equivalent of tens or even thousands of times the weight of liquid water[6], mainly
due to its three-dimensional network and a large number of hydrophilic groups[7].
• Page 1, lines 51 and 52: This sentence was revised as: Different preparation methods,
raw materials, experimental conditions and other factors will cause a tremendous gap
in the performance of SAPs[17, 18].
• Page 1, lines 52 and 53: This sentence was revised as: Therefore, it is very important
for us to prepare a SAPs which is easy to degrade, eco-friendly, strong water retention,
abundant raw materials and low cost.
• Page 2, lines 5 and 6: This sentence was revised as: Maize straw (MS), Acrylic acid
(AA), N,N-Methylenebisacrylamide (MBA), potassium persulfate (KPS),
palygorskite clay (PGS), Maize seeds (MS, Beijing baofeng seed Co., Ltd, Beijing,
China).
• Page 2, lines 18 and 19: This sentence was revised as: The samples were analyzed
by FTIR spectrometer (FTIR-FTS3000) at the wavenumber of 400-4000 cm-1 and the
samples dispersed in KBr pellets, respectively.
• Page 2, lines 21 and 22: This sentence was revised as: The thermogravimetric
analysis had been examined on an America TA Company Instruments (TGAQ100) at
the temperature range of 0 to 600<U+2103> and with a heating rate of 10<U+2103> min-1 under an
atmosphere of nitrogen.
3. Page 1, line 43: “Superabsorbent polymers (SAP) is” should be replaced by
“Superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) are”.
Response: Thanks for the Reviewer's helpful comments, I have revised this question.
The “Superabsorbent polymers (SAP)” was revised as “Superabsorbent polymers
(SAPs)”
4. Page 2, lines 9-16, section 2.2: The method used in the preparation of
superabsorbent is not clearly described and is not sufficiently informative to allow
replication of the research. What is the amount of polymer? What is the amount of
palygorskite? What are the amounts of initiator and cross linking agent? How did the
authors decide these amounts?
Response: Thank you very much for your question. I have described the preparation
of superabsorbent polymers with a more clear and more sufficiently information in
this manuscript. So this part was changed as: The preparation method of
superabsorbent polymers as showed below: first, using a mechanical mixer of the
maize straw amount of dispersion in the 250 mL three-necked flask filled with a
proper amount of distilled water. The reactor was in a water bath heating to 70<U+2103>, and
stirring for 1 hour to complete the gelatinization reaction. Let the chain of maize straw
extend as far as possible to ensure the carry out follow-up reaction. Then, neutralized
acrylic acid, 0.4 g palygorskite clay and 0.03 g crosslinking agent MBA was mixed
and added into a three-necked flask, further reaction. Finally, adding 0.1 g KPS under
nitrogen protection, polymerization and keep 30 min for the reaction to be complete.
The samples were dried in a drying oven at 70<U+2103> until a constant weight is achieved.
Then samples were milled, and made this all of the samples can pass 70 meshes sieves
to make them of the same size and can be utilized further.
5. Characterization of superabsorbent is not sufficient.
Response: Thank you very much. I've already added part of the superabsorbent in the
manuscript. We added 2.4. Swelling and water retention investigation: The
measurement of the equilibrium water absorption is carried out as follows: under
room temperature, some dry samples are immersed in excess distilled water to reach a
balance of swelling. The excess water in the swollen superabsorbent polymer is then
filtered through a gauze bag. Then calculate the equilibrium water absorption using
the following formula (1):
In this formula, W1 is the dry weight of superabsorbent polymers. W2 is the
swollen weight of superabsorbent polymers. Qeq is the equilibrium water absorbency
of superabsorbent polymers.
The water retention property is determined by the following steps: the swollen
superabsorbent polymers into the oven at 35<U+2103>. At regular intervals, weighed and
recorded. Formula (2) is used to calculate the water retention at different time.
In this formula, W3 is the weight of swollen superabsorbent polymers at different
time on different temperatures.
6. What are the effects of polymer concentration, palygorskite concentration, initiator
concentration, cross linking concentration, reaction time, etc. on the water uptake of
carbohydrate-based superabsorbent polymer used on seed germination and seeding
growth of maize?
Response: Thank you for your comments, because this article focuses on the effects
of eco-friendly carbohydrate-based superabsorbent polymers on seed germination and
seeding growth of maize, so there is no detailed explanation of crosslinking agent,
initiator and other factors on the effect of superabsorbent polymers. In fact, raw
materials, initiator concentration and cross linking concentration have influence on
the preparation of SAPs. Among them, the crosslinking agent can make hydrophilic
groups such as carboxyl and amide groups from the spatial structure of cross-linked,
when the content is small, the polymer is too much soluble linear macromolecules. It
can not form an effective cross-linked network structure. When there is too much
cross linking concentration, the increase of the cross-linking density leads to a
decrease in the space of the network structure. In both cases, the water can’t be well
absorbed; the initiator concentration can affect the concentration of free radicals,
resulting in changes in monomer conversion, affecting the water absorption capacity
of the graft copolymer; the addition of inorganic fillers can improve the performance
of water-retaining agent, which is mentioned in the article; The reaction time will
directly affect the degree of graft copolymerization reaction. The reaction time is too
short, the reaction is not complete.
7. Page 2, line 18: It is stated that “The samples were scanned with FTIR-FTS3000 at
wavelengths of 400-4000 cm-1”. This statement is wrong!!!
Response: Thank you very much for pointing out my mistake. I have revised it in the
manuscript. The “sentence” was revised as: The samples were analyzed by FTIR
spectrometer (FTIR-FTS3000) at the wavenumber of 400-4000 cm-1 and the samples
dispersed in KBr pellets, respectively.
8. Page 2, line 25: The symbol of kilo is not “K”.
Response: Thank you very much for asking this question. In fact, maybe my
statement in the manuscript is not very clear, which makes you unable to understand it
well. I have made a clearer statement in the manuscript. “K” does not represent the
kilogram. The 5KV represents an acceleration voltage of 5 kilovolt. And the symbol
of “KV” is the abbreviation of kilovolt.
9. Page 3, line 5: What is the meaning of “MS-g-PAA/PGS”?
Response: Thank you very much for reading my article so seriously. I'm sorry. This is
my mistake. I didn't explain it clearly. In order to understand, I've changed another
way of expression. In fact, "MS-g-PAA/PGS" is eco-friendly carbohydrate-based
superabsorbent polymers that we have prepared. Among them, “MS” represents
Maize straw, “g” is the abbreviation of graft, which indicates graft copolymerization
occurs, “PAA” stands for polyacrylic acid, and “/PGS” indicate palygorskite clay
(PGS) as a filler.
10. Page 9, Fig. 1: Please indicate the name of y-axis in Fig. 9.
Response: Thank you very much for having taken time to write your comments. I
have modified it according to your requirements. As showed in the figure1:
Fig.1. FTIR spectra of (A) PGS, (B) AA, (C) MS and (D) SAP
11. Page 10, Fig. 2: In Fig. 2, the name of y-axis (left side) given as “TG (%)” is

Response: Thank you very much for pointing out my mistake. I have revised it in the
Fig. 2. Thank you again for your comments on my manuscript!

Response: Thank you very much for the major revision you have made. The helpful
comments you give are very significant for me in revising the article. About this
question, Completely randomized experiment was designed with three replicates in
this paper. We analyzed the effects of superabsorbent polymers on germination and
growth of maize through researching for the application amount and application
methods of Superabsorbent polymers. The effect of different treatments on the results
is significant, not difficult to choose the best application amount and application
methods, the experimental results show that the rational use of Superabsorbent
polymers can effectively improve the total biomass, germination potential and
germination rate, etc., so we can determine the effects of SAP in improving seed
germination and seedling growth of maize.
2. Page 2, 2.2. Preparation of superabsorbent: This section is too brief. Please add all
the useful information’s (concentrations, volumes, elementary operations, etc.).
Response: I have described the preparation of water retaining agent with a more clear

water bath heating to 70<U+2103>, and stirring for 1 hour to complete the gelatinization
reaction. Let the chain of maize straw extend as far as possible to ensure the carry out
follow-up reaction. Then, neutralized acrylic acid, 0.4 g palygorskite clay and 0.03 g
crosslinking agent MBA was mixed and added into a three-necked flask, further
reaction. Finally, adding 0.1 g KPS under nitrogen protection, polymerization and
keep 30 min for the reaction to be complete. The samples were dried in a drying oven
at 70<U+2103> until a constant weight is achieved. Then samples were milled, and made this
all of the samples can pass 70 meshes sieves to make them of the same size and can
be utilized further.

been successfully grafted into the MS macromolecular chains.” How this was done?
Please indicate the peaks which show the “successfully binding”.
Response: From the FTIR spectra of maize straw, it can be seen that at 2924 cm-1
there are characteristic peaks due to the C-H stretching vibration, Compare with the
infrared spectrum of maize straw (presented in Fig.1A.), at 2930 cm-1, sample showed
a change in migration and a change in the intensity of the C-H peak’s. At the same
time, there are some new peaks at 1560 and 1409 cm-1, which are attributed to the
asymmetric stretching and symmetric stretching of -COO- groups. These groups are
derived from polyacrylic acid. In other words, the characteristic peaks of maize straw
and acrylic acid appeared in the samples we prepared, and the characteristic peaks
were weakened, indicating that graft copolymerization occurred.
4. Page 4, lines 2-12: “From the research results can be clearly seen that… their stored
water is available for plant absorption [31].” All these observations must be more
rigorous interpreted. Also, some experiments related to the amount of water retained
by SAP itself must be added in the manuscript, in order to sustain these observations.
Response: Thank you very much for the special advice, Due to lack of experience in
English writing, there are many shortcomings, not very standardized, your comments
of great help to me, let me learn a lot of writing. I have revised this part as your
comments to make this part more rigorous. The specific modifications are as follows:
from the results, we can see that the using of swollen SAPs have a significant role in
water retention. It is better to confirm each other with the conclusion that SAPs has
strong power of water absorption and water retention. And the water it absorbs and
retains could be used to release water slowly during germination and growth of maize.
According to the results of previous studies, the water absorptive capacity of plant
roots is greater than that of the water retention agent, the water absorbed by the SAPs
can supply the plant[29]. Compared with the control group, adding the swollen SAPs
consumes less water. This is mainly due to swollen SAPs itself contains a certain
amount of water. Because this part of water is absorbed, there is no way to directly
evaporate in the process of maize to grow under normal conditions. That is to say the
equivalent of direct reduction of water evaporation, which plays a role in retaining
moisture. When the maize under growing circumstances, it will utilize the closest
water which SAPs contained. When this part of the water gradually absorbed as time
goes by, the water in swollen SAPs is released slowly, like releasing fertilizer[30, 31]
and supply water for plant growths. Therefore, in the case of the same other
conditions, adding the swollen SAPs could reduce the water consumption and have an
outstanding water resources saving effect at a great extent. According to previous
studies, it is also known that 95% of their stored water is available for plant
absorption[32].
At the same time, some experiments related to the amount of water retained by SAP
itself have been added to the manuscript.

Response: Thank you very much for pointing out my deficiencies. I have revised
them in the article. I have indicated in Figure 1 the wave numbers for important
peaks.

6. What means “a, b, c…” letters from inside of Figures 4-8. These are not explained.
Response: Thank you very much for asking this question. I'm sorry for these are not
explained. I didn't make myself clear, which makes you unable to understand it well.
These letters are the evaluation of the otherness of data on statistics, which are a level
of inspection and a significant level. Usually, the results of the experiment reach 0.05
levels, which can be said to have a significant difference between the data. When
letters are different, there are significant differences. It also shows that different
treatment groups have obvious effects on the experimental results.
7. The authors must check very carefully the English grammar and spelling, because
in the manuscript are too many errors and these make that the text to be difficult to
read.
Response: Thanks for the Reviewer's helpful comments about English grammar and
spelling, these comments are not only very significant to modify our manuscript, but
also help to improve my English level. I have checked very carefully the English
grammar and spelling. While modifying the manuscript, I learned a lot of useful
things. I sincerely thank you again for your comments on my manuscript!

This work reports the effects of eco-friendly carbohydrate-based supersorbent
polymers on seed germination and seed growth of maize. The paper is interesting and
characterization of the SAP is sufficient but with minor pitfalls. Overall, I would
recommend publication after the following comments have been addressed.
1. The authors should label the important IR peaks on the figure to easily follow.
Response: Thank you very much for pointing out my deficiencies. I have revised
them in the article. I have labeled the important IR peaks on the figure.

2. The degradation temperatures of AA, PGS and MS should also be discussed.
Response: Thank you for your comments! This manuscript mainly focuses on the
seed germination and seedling growth of plants prepared by the Superabsorbent
polymers (SAPs) I have prepared. Therefore, we only explored the thermal stability of
SAPs which the products obtained by graft copolymerization of AA, PGS and MS,
but did not discuss the degradation temperatures of AA, PGS and MS separately.
3. Since the authors talk about the ability of SAP to use in arid and semiarid areas,
some experiments need to be conducted in order the see the seed germination and
seed growth at different temperature conditions.
Response: In arid and semi-arid areas, water resources are the main factors that
restrict the growth of plants. And SAPs is famous for super water absorption, so we
want to use SAPs resin as a water source. Through experiments, we found that
superabsorbent polymers can not only provide moisture but also promote seed
germination and seedling growth, which provides a possibility that SAPs can replace
other substrates. In this manuscript, the experimental conditions for temperature are
actually set up two different temperatures for daytime and night. The purpose is to
better simulate the corn growing environment. The detailed experimental conditions
in Table 2, which may not be clearly expressed in the text of the manuscript, cause
you to have no good understanding, and I sincerely apologize for the
misunderstanding. I am glad to receive your comments. Your pertinent comments are
very helpful to me. Your kind assistance on this is very much appreciated!
According to the Reviewers’ suggestions, we have made a major revisions for our
original manuscript. All of changes were marked by blue font color in the modified
manuscript.
We will be appreciated if the revised manuscript is considered to be published in
Royal Society Open Science. Please contact with me if there has any questions.
Best wishes!
