The work presented by Li et al. reports on the dispersibility properties of MWCNTs in two very
common surfactants. In reported literature is possible to find very similar publications since more
than 15 years up to now. I can not see any new information or contribution in the experimental
protocol, characterization techniques or new results. Royal Society Open Science is an
interdisciplinary journal. The present work is a routine protocol for the processing of MWCNTs,
thus I do not suggest its publication.

The novel nano-carbon based materials such as CNT, C60 and GR et. al show great application
potential in the modern life. The improvements of material performance and the safety
application in practice are both significantly important for the promising nanomaterials. In this
study, Li and his co-authors systematic investigated the dispersion, sedimentation and
aggregation of the multi-walled carbon nanotubes under conditions of single and binary mixed
surfactants in aqueous solution. Overall the approach is not novel, the results are very interesting
and do contribute to new scientific knowledge on the design of surfactant mixtures and the
prediction on the behavior and fate of MWCNTs in the water environment. What’s more, the
organization and writing of the manuscript is well. After a through reading of this manuscript, I
think this study is sound with only some comments that need to be addressed before this could
be considered for publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Special comments:
3
1. There are some grammatical and writing errors, which should be checked throughout the text,
such as line 71, line 75, line 147 etc.
2. In this study, for what’s reason the authors select the surfactants TX-100 and SDS as the
representative surfactant, nor the surfactants such as SDBS, CTAB and Tween 80 et al, which
should be state clearly in the manuscript.
3. In page 9, line 175-181, the authors have described the variation tendency of the Dh with the
different addition of SDS concentration, and the results show two different properties of
MWCNT suspensions in the single and mixed surfactants. I suggest the authors explain the
different dispersed phenomenon form the basic structure and properties of the two surfactants in
the manuscript.
4. In page 12, Figure 3, I suggest the authors compare the sedimentation kinetics of MWCNT in
the condition of bare TX-100 and SDS as surfactant in the manuscript, which can combine with
the data of Dh and <U+03BE>-Potential in Table 1.
5. In page 13, line 239~244, why the CCC values for the MWCNT dispersed in TX100 and TX100-
SDS show little difference under the condition of CaCl2, while the CCC values have a distinct
change in the NaCl treatment.
6. The style of reference should be uniform in the manuscript, some writing errors should be
revised, eg. line 325, line 341 etc. In addition, the reference’s DOI also need to provide in the
manuscript to ensure that it conforms to the standard of the journal.

The manuscript deals with carbon nanotubes dispersion in surfactant systems. Although there
are a number of works on this aspect, the topic is interesting and there are new aspects worth of
being published. Introduction is not up-to-date. Recent references on micro-sized nanotubes
stabilization by surfactant systems have to be added ( see for instance: Ceramics International
2019, 45 (2, Part B), 2858–2865. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.289.; Langmuir 2015,

Thanks. Although there are a lot of publications on the dispersion of
MWCNTs by single surfactant, how the mixture of these surfactants
on the behaviors of MWCNTs in water environment still remains
unknown. We believe that our results are helpful on the design of
surfactant mixtures and the prediction on the behavior and fate of
MWCNTs in the water environment.

2. In this study, for what’s reason the authors select the surfactants
TX-100 and SDS as the representative surfactant, nor the
surfactants such as SDBS, CTAB and Tween 80 et al, which should
be state clearly in the manuscript.
SDS and TX100 were employed because they had been widely
used to disperse nano-materials. Moreover, the effects of their
mixture on the dispersion, sedimentation, and aggregation of
MWCNTs still remains unknown. Please see P. 4, lines 73-76.
3. In page 9, line 175-181, the authors have described the variation
tendency of the Dh with the different addition of SDS concentration,
and the results show two different properties of MWCNT
suspensions in the single and mixed surfactants. I suggest the
authors explain the different dispersed phenomenon form the basic
structure and properties of the two surfactants in the manuscript.
We try to explain the difference in the Dh from the molecular size of
SDS and TX100, please see P. 9-10, lines 186-188. Moreover, the
increase of Dh with increasing SDS concentration was explained in
the manuscript. Please see P. 9, lines 184-185.
4. In page 12, Figure 3, I suggest the authors compare the
sedimentation kinetics of MWCNT in the condition of bare TX-100
and SDS as surfactant in the manuscript, which can combine with
the data of Dh and <U+03BE>-Potential in Table 1.

The comparison on the sedimentation kinetics of MWCNTs
dispersed by bare TX 100 and SDS were conducted. Please see P.
12, lines 226-228.
5. In page 13, line 239~244, why the CCC values for the MWCNT
dispersed in TX100 and TX100-SDS show little difference under the
condition of CaCl2, while the CCC values have a distinct change in
the NaCl treatment.
The insignificant change of CCC in the presence of CaCl2 can be
attributed to the bridging effect of calcium ions. Please see P. 13,
lines 258-261.
6. The style of reference should be uniform in the manuscript, some
writing errors should be revised, eg. line 325, line 341 etc. In addition,
the reference’s DOI also need to provide in the manuscript to ensure
that it conforms to the standard of the journal.
Thanks. We corrected the errors in the references and added the
DOI numbers. Please see P. 16-19, lines 299-393.
