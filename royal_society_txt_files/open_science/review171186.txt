The selenium-based compounds are a new type of potential materials for high-performance
supercapacitors. The current work adopts the all-selenium compounds to fabricate asymmetric
supercapacitor. The story is important for other researchers to get new insights. However, there
are some issues should be revised before the publication:
1). Where is the BET data for the Bi18SeO29/BiSe sample?
2). The physical-chemistry mechanisms underlying the high-performance should be commented

Comments to the Author(s)
The selenium-based compounds are a new type of potential materials for high-performance
supercapacitors. The current work adopts the all-selenium compounds to fabricate asymmetric
supercapacitor. The story is important for other researchers to get new insights. However, there are
some issues should be revised before the publication:
1). Where is the BET data for the Bi18SeO29/BiSe sample?
Response: Thanks for the Reviewer's helpful comments, these comments are very significant to
modify our manuscript. We are very sorry for our carelessness. According to the reviewer’s
suggestion, we have added the BET data for the Bi18SeO29/BiSe sample, as shown in the Figure
2a.
Figure 2. (a) Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and inset pore size distributions of the
Bi18SeO29/BiSe.
2). The physical-chemistry mechanisms underlying the high-performance should be commented
and improved.
Response: Thanks for your question, According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added the
some comment and improvement of the physical-chemistry mechanisms underlying the
high-performance as following:
For negative electrode materials (Bi18SeO29/BiSe):
There is a pair of redox peaks can be clearly observed in the CV curves of Bi18SeO29/BiSe
composite at different scan rates, showing it has typical Faradaic pseudocapacitance behavior. In
detail, the oxidation peaks were seen in forward CV scans, while the reduction peaks were seen in
the reverse CV scans. In high alkaline solution, the hydroxide ions are generated naturally, which
likely to be gravitate towards the cathode at high potentials. Thus, the reduction peak 0.7 V
corresponds to the Bi3+ transformed into Bi(OH)2+ in the reduction process. The oxidation peak at
about -0.48 V and -0.35 V corresponds to Bi3+/Bi0 transformation. Those peaks are also seen in
some articles [27, 41, 42]. It may be catalyzed by the induction or oxidation of some unconverted
Bi0 during the reduction process, the process has the following reaction [43, 27]:
Bi3+ + 2OH- <U+2192> Bi(OH)2+
2Bi(OH)2+ + 2OH- <U+2192> Bi2O3 + 3H2O
Bi2O3+2OH- <U+2192> 2BiO2- + H2O
Bi18SeO29/BiSe + 2OH- <U+2192> Bi18SeO30H/BiSeOH+ e-
BiO2- + e- <U+2192> BiO22-
BiO22- + 2H2O <U+2192> BiO2- + 4OH- + Bi0
Bi0 <U+2192> Bimet
Where Bi0 is active atoms, Bimet is the metal bismuth.
There are characteristic redox peaks of the electrode were observed from -1 to 0 V which
correspond to the reversible intercalation/deintercalation of OH- ions occurring in the
Bi18SeO29/BiSe bulk and at the interface of Bi18SeO29/BiSe and electrolyte to increase the
discharge time.
For positive electrode materials (Co0.85Se):
From Figure 6a, it is clear that the area surrounded by the CV curve of Co0.85Se exhibits the
peaks of two pairs redox peaks, which might be attributed to standard Faradaic pseudocapacitance
behavior. The two pairs ascribed to the reversible redox reaction can be takes place according to
[50]:
Co0.85Se + OH- <U+2192> Co0.85SeOH + e-
Co0.85SeOH + OH- <U+2192> Co0.85SeO + H2O + e-

3). The referential data in the Table 1 is not suitable, because of the lack of the data about the
selenium compounds.
Response: Thanks for your suggestion, It is really true as Reviewer suggested that the referential
data in the Table 1 is not suitable. According to the Reviewer’s suggestion, we have deleted the the
Table 1 data and the corresponding figure 7d data.
4). The recent progress of the selenium-based compounds for electrochemical application should
be cited.

5). There are some typos in the manuscript, for example, the word “elctrode” in the abstract
section.
Response: We are very sorry for our negligence of terms of writing. We have modified the words
"elctrode" into "electrode".
6). In the experiment section, please give some comment for the use of benzyl alcohol as the
solvent. I think the detailed statement about the experiment can attract the attention based on the
synthesis aspect.
Response: Thanks for your suggestion. According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added the
some comment for the use of benzyl alcohol as the solvent as following:
In addition, the benzyl alcohol route in particular have been proven to be versatile for the
synthesis of various metal oxide nanoparticles with good control over particle phase, size and
shape [28,29]. The fact that the benzyl alcohol route is typically applied without the use of
surfactants makes this approach ideal for mechanistic studies. Additives such as surfactants
complicate the interpretation of the results due to their possible influence on nucleation and
growth by complexation of the cations [30,31]. Therefore, in a two component system just
consisting of a precursor and solvent the complexity is decreased to a minimum, although benzyl
alcohol itself may play a multiple role as reaction medium, oxygen source and/or capping agent.8
Another unique feature of nonaqueous systems is the possibility to monitor the organic reactions
occurring in parallel to nanoparticle formation by standard analytical techniques, Thus, the use of
benzyl alcohol as a solvent (without any template and surfactant) to synthesize transition metal
selenium-based compounds is a very desirable route.

suggested that the figure caption of Fig.5 (a) is wrong. We have modified it as "(a) Nitrogen

Comments to the Author(s)
1 The Ms is poorly organized with some grammar mistakes. For examples, Wang et al. a flexible
all-solid-state supercapacitor was made based on 3D hierarchical GeSe2 nanomaterials; Where Bi0
is active atoms, Bimet is the metal bismuth.
Response: Thanks for the reviewer's helpful comment, these comments are very significant to
modify our manuscript. We are very sorry for our incorrect grammatical writing. We have made
correction according to the Reviewer’s comments, and We have made our best effort to check the
English language and the tense of all the sentences of original manuscript and revised accordingly.
We have modified the words "Wang et al. a flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor was made based
on 3D hierarchical GeSe2 nanomaterials" into "Wang et al. prepared a flexible all-solid-state
supercapacitor based on 3D hierarchical GeSe2 nanomaterials, which has a high specific
capacitances of 300 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1" and "Where Bi0 is active atoms, Bimet is
the metal bismuth" into "Where Bi0 is active atoms, Bimet is the metal bismuth".
2 Why is composite material Bi18SeO29/BiSe used as negative electrode rather than single one?
Response: Thanks for your question. According to many previous reports, the composite material
is superior to single materials in both electrochemical performance and in terms of morphology. In
this work, we synthesized one dimensional (1D) lamella-like structure of Bi18SeO29/BiSe
composite material, which exhibited high specific capacitance (471.3 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1), high
conductivity, outstanding cycling stability, as well as good rate capability. However, the single
material of the electrochemical performance is poor, Such as Shrikant S. Raut et al. prepared
interconnected needle-like Bi2O3, which the electrochemical tests manifest the pseudocapacitive
behavior of Bi2O3 thin-film electrode with a specific capacitance of 329.6 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1 scan
rate [1]. And Zheng et al. Synthesised of hierarchical rippled Bi2O3 nanobelts, which specific
capacitance is only 250 F g-1 [2]. Furthermore, According to research, the BiSe as an electrode
material is hardly reported, its electrochemical performance is also poor [3].

3. What is the merit of metal selenide in comparison with oxide?
Response: Thanks for your comment. According to previous reports compared with oxides, the
two-dimensional (2D) layered transition metal selenide have been paid less attention. And the
weak van der Waals force of 2D layered metal selenide is beneficial to insertion of guest species.
Thanks to their superior electronic structure and physical properties, the 2D nanosheets structural
materials have obtained to abundant attention compared to the corresponding bulk materials [20].
Recently, some transition metal selenide have been displayed outstanding electrochemical
performance. Balasingam et al. synthesized few-layered MoSe2 nanosheets via simple
hydrothermal method and further studied its electrochemical charge storage properties. It is shown
that the MoSe2 nanosheet electrode possesses the symmetric device exhibits 49.7 F g-1 with a scan
rate of 2 mV s-1 and a largest specific capacitance of 198.9 F g-1 [21]. Wang et al. prepared a
flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor based on 3D hierarchical GeSe2 nanomaterials, which has a
high specific capacitances of 300 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 [22]. Choi et al. synthesized
the SnSe2 nanoplate-graphene composites and used as the novel anode materials for lithium ion
batteries [23]. Tang et al. synthesized a new type of binder-free electrode material of NiSe/NF
(NiSe nanowire film on nickel foam) via utilized one-step hydrothermal method, it has a high
specific capacitance of 1790 F g-1 at a current density of 5 A g-1 [24]. And Yang et al. developed
interconnected Co0.85Se nanomaterials on nickel foam directly through a facile single-step
hydrothermal method, which exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1528 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and
excellent cycling stability [25]. the literature depicts that the transition metal selenide has excellent
electrochemical performance for supercapacitor. But the synthesis of different selenium
compounds as positive and negative electrodes of supercapacitor in the same system is not well
explored so far. Therefore, the transition metal selenides possess outstanding electrochemical
energy storage properties and deserves to be further investigated as advanced electrode materials
for supercapacitor application.

4. GCD curves of synthesized Bi18SeO29/BiSe electrode in Fig. 3b imply it is a typical
battery-style material. Why is it used in a supercapacitor?
Response: Thanks for your question, It is really true as Reviewer suggested that the GCD curves
of synthesized Bi18SeO29/BiSe electrode in Fig. 3b imply it is a typical battery-style material. We
used it a supercapacitor, because of in general, based on energy storage mechanism,
supercapacitor electrodes can be divided into three types 1: (1) electrochemical double layer
electrodes, in which energy storage and release depend on nanoscale charge separation at the
electrode/electrolyte interface. Typical electrode materials are carbonaceous materials with a large
specific surface area. [1,2] (2) Pseudocapacitive electrodes, in which energy storage arises from
faradaic reactions on electrode surfaces and a relatively constant capacitance value is obtained
within a potential window (RuO2, MnO2) [3]. (3) Battery-type electrodes, in which energy storage
is also faradaic, but their specific capacitance value changes with voltage window and thus
specific capacity in C g-1 or mA h g-1 is adopted as the metric (Co3O4, NiO, ZnCo2O4, Fe2O3, and
NiCo2O4) [4, 5]. Therefore, pseudo-capacitance and battery-type are usually classified as a class.
Battery-type electrodes, exhibiting noncapacitive electrochemical behaviors, are commonly used
in hybrid supercapacitors coupled with electrical double layer electrodes to balance the
characteristic of batteries (high energy output) and supercapacitors (high power output). So we can
use it in supercapacitors.

5. In Fig. 7c, it is strange the y axis is marked as “vs. HgO/Hg”. In addition, there exits great IR
drop. Please explain it.
Response: Thanks for your question, we are very sorry for our negligence. We have modified the
y axis words "Potential / V vs. HgO/Hg" into "Potential / V".
It is really true as Reviewer suggested that there exits large IR drop. Because we synthesized
the electrode materials (positive and negative) which are nano-selenium pseudostructure material.
According to a large number of literature, pseudo-capacitance material contains a certain IR drop
(1-3). In addition, the electrode material containing the transition metal Bi generally has an IR
drop, so that the combined asymmetric supercapacitor contains IR drop. In addition, it can be seen
from the three-electrode system that Bi18SeO29/BiSe has an IR drop, so that the assembled
asymmetrical supercapacitor has a big impedance value and IR drop.
