Review ms Koplenig
Marc Brysbaert
I must admit I like the ms, even though I thought the niche hypothesis had good credibility (it has
been argued that in Dutch too the language simplified at times of mass immigration). This is
surely going to rock the boat. However, as far as I can judge, the author is completely transparent
about the variables used (mainly coming from other sources) and the analyses done.
My main concern was that the niche hypothesis not really requires control for population size. It
is just the proportion of non-native adult speakers that matters. So, I am not 100% convinced the
present analyses will be enough for everyone (although it is true that the effect does not survive
control for other random factors either and that the effect of population size remains significant
when L2 proportion is partialed out). I was reminded of a recent article in which the conclusion
was that for this type of correlational questions the conclusions largely depend on the statistics
used and the variables taken into account or not (see
http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245917747646). So, different authors may come to
different conclusions.
The following were minor questions I had:
Lines 93-94 (and further on again): Does this mean that 3 and 4 were scored double? Why not 3
and lower and 4 and higher, or lower than 4 and higher than 3?
Line 120: Are you sure about this equation for population size? It seems to indicate that the
parameter increases the higher estimated L2 proportion is (going to infinity for a language in
which everyone is L2 speaker; e.g., Esperanto).
It is always good to keep in mind that zero correlations can also be caused by unreliable
variables. If other people were to compile the same measures, how much would they correlate
with the present ones? To some extent, I am satisfied to see that all measures have been collected
from good sources (and are made available), but still it is something to keep in mind, certainly
because we are talking about quite a few understudied languages here.

The paper tests the hypothesized link between proportion of L2-speakers and morphological
complexity for a significantly larger sample of languages than has been attempted previously.
The findings show that when population size is partialled out then neither vehicularity (an
indicator as to whether a language is used by L2-speakers) nor proportion of L2-speakers show
an independent association with morphological complexity or with information-theoretical
entropy. Instead, there is an indication that population size is associated with lower
morphological complexity and higher entropy pointing towards explanations of change in
linguistic structure to do with the size and structure of social networks.
Having previously expressed doubts myself that there should be a plausible link between
proportion of L2-speakers and morphological complexity I am very sympathetic to the overall
aims of this paper. I therefore would like my comments to be viewed as suggestions for
improvement before publication.
My main concern is that in order to make a strong contribution I find that the paper needs to
improve in clarity to appeal to a broader audience beyond computational linguistics.
Specifically, at the beginning of the Methods Section, I suggest a clearer roadmap for the analyses.
There is some redundancy in the explanation of the permutation process at the expense of clarity
with respect to the overall logic of the analysis. While reading through it the first time, it was not
always clear to me whether the paper focuses on testing the relationship between proportion of
L2-speakers and morphological complexity (as the title suggests), the relationship between total
number of speakers and proportion of L2-speakers, the relationship between total number of
speakers and morphological complexity or all three of them. More clarity about the specific aims
is needed. In particular, the author has opted for using partial correlations but having established
a link between population size and morphological complexity/entropy I was wondering whether
a mediation analysis (Hayes, 2009) is a more appropriate and comprehensive way of testing what
the Linguistic Niche Hypothesis asserts -- that the link between population size and
morphological complexity is mediated by proportion of L2-speakers.
Hayes, A. F. (2009). Beyond Baron and Kenny: Statistical mediation analysis in the new
millennium. Communication monographs, 76(4), 408-420.
In addition, it would be desirable to provide a clear summary of how the various constructs
(proportion of L2-speakers, morphological complexity and information-theoretic
complexity/entropy) are operationalized computationally, and what the rationale is. This needs
to be explained in the text so readers can appreciate whether the measures chosen are good
measures. Especially in light of the result showing a link between population size and entropy,
and the associated discussion, a clearer explanation in the Methods section of how entropy is
4
calculated would be necessary, to understand the links between morphological complexity and
redundancy (e.g. intra-word vs. between words). For example, how would redundant gender
marking in determiner-adjective-noun agreement patterns (e.g. German: eine warme Suppe) be
accounted for in the entropy measures?
Below, I am listing some more specific concerns and suggestions (numbers = lines):
97: “In this paper, I use available information on both L2 users and on vehicularity to test the
assumed relationship between the proportion of adult speakers and both morphological and
information-theoretic complexity…” -- At this point, the author should provide a clear
hypothesis as to what to expect if the formulation of the LNH that attributes a link between
population size and morphological complexity to the proportion of L2-speakers is true. I would
have expected something along the lines of ‘According to the Linguistic Niche Hypothesis,
languages with an EGIDS > 3 (or with vehicularity = 1) should have higher entropy/lower
morphological complexity when statistically controlling for population size’.
104: The author introduces measures of geographical language area yet the theoretical relevance
of this variable has not been explained and it does not seem to figure as a random effect in the
analyses.
115: The statement “Language with an EGIDS value of 3 and higher are
categorised as vehicular, while languages with an EGIDS of 4 or lower are categorized as non-
vehicular.” leaves it unclear as to how languages with an EGIDS of 3 are categorised. I suspect it
may be the other way around: 3 and lower are vehicular? Also, correct ‘Language’ to
‘Languages’.
145: ‘The median estimated speaker population size is 15,000; the median estimated proportion of
L2 speakers is 0 for non-vehicular languages and 0.233 for vehicular languages. Moreover, the
statement in line 151 suggests ‘According to the definition of the Ethnologue, a vehicular
language should have a significant number of L2 users, while no L2 users are expected for non-
vehicular languages.’ Contradicting these two statements, the data file in the Supplementary
Materials shows that some non-vehicular languages are listed with a certain proportion of L2
speakers. It is thus not clear as to what exactly proportion of L2-speakers measures. For example,
the proportion of 0.62 of L2 speakers for English with a vehicularity index of 1 seems to suggest
that 62% of English speakers use it as an L2 (or L3) in addition to their L1. But then the data file
also lists an L2 proportion of 0.26 for Balkan Romani, which has a vehicularity index of 0. This
suggests that 26% of speakers for whom Romani is the L1 also know another L2, given that
Romani is not categorised as a vehicular language. The paper seems to treat these two situations
as equivalent: if a language is being spoken by a lot of non-native speakers as in the case of
English this is apparently treated in the same way as a native language some speakers of which
also use another L2. If there is mutual influence in both cases then the underlying cognitive
mechanisms must be fundamentally different: accommodation to non-native grammar learning
difficulties in the former case vs. language attrition in the latter. I have my strong reservations as
to whether it is correct to equate those two very different situations. In any case, the relationship
between the two variables and the fact that not all languages with a vehicularity of 0 have 0 L2
speakers needs to be dealt with openly. I wonder whether it is an artefact of the way proportion
of L2-speakers is calculated in Ethnologue.
As indicated above, the paragraph between lines 181 and 200 is rather redundant as it seems to
explain the rationale behind the permutation process again – this could be summarised more
succinctly as pertaining to both sets of analyses.
183: Explain what is meant by ‘functional form’ of a variable.
5
211: Explain the rationale behind conducting analyses for 6 language families and language areas.
254/255: The sentence should be edited to refer to information-theoretical and not morphological
complexity.
267-270: Please rephrase as the findings do not contradict an influence of the environment per se,
as the link between population size and entropy/morphological complexity indicates; they just
do not support the idea that this influence is due to the proportion of L2 speakers.

This is a revision of a ms I reviewed favorably before. Given that the author has responded well
to the suggestions made, I am happy to recommend the paper for publication now.
I foresee that the present analyses will be called into question and that alternative analyses will
provide some (small) support for the linguistic niche hypothesis. However, this is a discussion
that must take place openly in the literature and not as part of hidden reviews. Koplenig has a
strong case to question the niche hypothesis and now it is up to the proponents to show him and
the readers what they have misunderstood. If the proponents are not able to do so convincingly,
Koplenig's alternative hypothesis can be the start of further progress.

The author did an excellent job addressing the concerns I expressed in my previous review,
including providing a clear statement of hypotheses. This is very helpful.
I particularly welcome the additional analysis that remove the languages with a vehicularity
index of 0 and a proportion of L2-speakers > 0. However, I think languages that lack the estimate
of L2 proportion should also be removed. I am sorry I am being very nit-picky about this but I am
still not convinced that vehicularity is a good proxy for proportion of adult L2-speakers of a
language. The author states that where there was no estimated proportion of L2 speakers
available an estimated proportion of 0 was entered but this may not be a good way of dealing
with this lack of information. Take Scottish Gaelic. It is listed with a vehicularity index of 1 and
misses the estimate of L2 speakers. Presumably a 0 was entered here. However, this would
mischaracterise the situation that there are no monolingual Gaelic speakers in Scotland and that
one would be hard-pressed to argue that all Gaelic speakers use the language as an L2. Gaelic is a
12
clear case of communal bilingualism where the language is acquired by children alongside
English, not just in the home but increasingly in Gaelic-medium schools. How many other
languages are there in the relatively small set of 241 vehicular languages where it is not clear
what the L1 and what the L2 is? I am presenting this example only to express my doubts that
vehicularity is a good estimate for the role of adult L2-learners. I think the assumption that inter-
generational disruption as measured by the EGIDS is linked to use as an L2 is probably not
correct. If anything, I would think that languages with high EGIDS values may also be heritage
languages, i.e. languages learned incompletely by children. While this also may affect language
structure in interesting ways it is different from the assumption that it is the learning constraints
of adults that influence these languages, as stated by the LNH.
Because I think that the point the author makes is a very important one I want to make sure the
arguments and the underpinning statistics are compelling. I would therefore suggest presenting
the analysis that removes the 78 languages with a vehicularity index of 0 and a proportion of L2-
speakers > 0, and also exclude those languages that have no estimated proportion of L2-users
(like Scottish Gaelic), and present this more conservative analysis in the main paper rather than in
the Supplementary materials.
This then raises another issue: When those 78 languages with ambiguous vehicularity are
removed both DVs show a weak but significant relationship with proportion of L2-speakers. I
think it is therefore not be very convincing to entirely reject the idea that L2-speakers are a
driving force behind morphological simplification in languages with more speakers. I suggest
rephrasing the discussion a bit more cautiously by saying that proportion of L2-speakers may
only play a minor role compared to other factors associated with population size, rather than
stating that it plays no role altogether. Because I think the point the author makes is a very
important one I am just encouraging him to be as cautious and conservative as possible, to
convince those who attribute (undue -- in my view) importance to adult L2-learning as a driving
force.
While the quantification of entropy has been made much clearer, I think some readers may still
be confused about the quantification of morphological complexity. Especially the notion of
‘feature value’ is not immediately clear without further explanation. I had to consult the Bentz et
al. (2016) Proceedings paper to fully understand what is meant by this. Providing an example,
e.g. with respect to gender, might be helpful here. I also think that some more critical comments
about this particular way of quantifying complexity may be in order, especially when it comes to
explaining the lack of the expected correlation between entropy and morphological complexity:
One reason may be that feature value is not a good, or should I say, sufficient, way of quantifying
complexity. Take gender again: In languages where gender is marked by systematic
morphological cues, e.g. Russian or Spanish, within-word entropy should be smaller than in
gender languages where there is a lot of arbitrariness in the gender category assignment, like
German. I understand this is a more substantial debate to be had and the author alludes to that
but I think readers may expect a slightly more thorough discussion of this issue – perhaps add
one or two sentences about the pros and cons of quantification of morphological complexity in
this way and how this may relate to entropy, in addition to the interesting comments about
within- and between-word entropy.
The suggestion that greater variability associated with larger population sizes may contribute to
higher entropy is an interesting one but should be reconciled with the literature on phonological
category learning which has demonstrated that being exposed to more speakers facilitates
learning as it allows learners to distinguish indexical from category-relevant acoustic features.
Again, this is a big and interesting debate to be had but a reference to this literature may be in
order.

The abstract refers to ‘adult speakers’. This is misleading as any native speaker will eventually

Comments to the Author(s)
The author did an excellent job addressing the concerns I expressed in my previous review,
including providing a clear statement of hypotheses. This is very helpful.
I particularly welcome the additional analysis that remove the languages with a vehicularity
index of 0 and a proportion of L2-speakers > 0. However, I think languages that lack the estimate
of L2 proportion should also be removed. I am sorry I am being very nit-picky about this but I am
still not convinced that vehicularity is a good proxy for proportion of adult L2-speakers of a
language. The author states that where there was no estimated proportion of L2 speakers
available an estimated proportion of 0 was entered but this may not be a good way of dealing
with this lack of information. Take Scottish Gaelic. It is listed with a vehicularity index of 1 and
misses the estimate of L2 speakers. Presumably a 0 was entered here. However, this would
mischaracterise the situation that there are no monolingual Gaelic speakers in Scotland and that
one would be hard-pressed to argue that all Gaelic speakers use the language as an L2. Gaelic is a
clear case of communal bilingualism where the language is acquired by children alongside
English, not just in the home but increasingly in Gaelic-medium schools. How many other
languages are there in the relatively small set of 241 vehicular languages where it is not clear
what the L1 and what the L2 is? I am presenting this example only to express my doubts that
vehicularity is a good estimate for the role of adult L2-learners. I think the assumption that inter-
generational disruption as measured by the EGIDS is linked to use as an L2 is probably not
correct. If anything, I would think that languages with high EGIDS values may also be heritage
languages, i.e. languages learned incompletely by children. While this also may affect language
structure in interesting ways it is different from the assumption that it is the learning constraints
of adults that influence these languages, as stated by the LNH.
Because I think that the point the author makes is a very important one I want to make sure the
arguments and the underpinning statistics are compelling. I would therefore suggest presenting
the analysis that removes the 78 languages with a vehicularity index of 0 and a proportion of L2-
speakers > 0, and also exclude those languages that have no estimated proportion of L2-users
(like Scottish Gaelic), and present this more conservative analysis in the main paper rather than in
the Supplementary materials.
This then raises another issue: When those 78 languages with ambiguous vehicularity are
removed both DVs show a weak but significant relationship with proportion of L2-speakers. I
think it is therefore not be very convincing to entirely reject the idea that L2-speakers are a
driving force behind morphological simplification in languages with more speakers. I suggest
rephrasing the discussion a bit more cautiously by saying that proportion of L2-speakers may
only play a minor role compared to other factors associated with population size, rather than
stating that it plays no role altogether. Because I think the point the author makes is a very
important one I am just encouraging him to be as cautious and conservative as possible, to
convince those who attribute (undue -- in my view) importance to adult L2-learning as a driving
force.

While the quantification of entropy has been made much clearer, I think some readers may still
be confused about the quantification of morphological complexity. Especially the notion of
‘feature value’ is not immediately clear without further explanation. I had to consult the Bentz et
al. (2016) Proceedings paper to fully understand what is meant by this. Providing an example,
e.g. with respect to gender, might be helpful here. I also think that some more critical comments
about this particular way of quantifying complexity may be in order, especially when it comes to
explaining the lack of the expected correlation between entropy and morphological complexity:
One reason may be that feature value is not a good, or should I say, sufficient, way of quantifying
complexity. Take gender again: In languages where gender is marked by systematic
morphological cues, e.g. Russian or Spanish, within-word entropy should be smaller than in
gender languages where there is a lot of arbitrariness in the gender category assignment, like
German. I understand this is a more substantial debate to be had and the author alludes to that
but I think readers may expect a slightly more thorough discussion of this issue – perhaps add
one or two sentences about the pros and cons of quantification of morphological complexity in
this way and how this may relate to entropy, in addition to the interesting comments about
within- and between-word entropy.
The suggestion that greater variability associated with larger population sizes may contribute to
higher entropy is an interesting one but should be reconciled with the literature on phonological
category learning which has demonstrated that being exposed to more speakers facilitates
learning as it allows learners to distinguish indexical from category-relevant acoustic features.
Again, this is a big and interesting debate to be had but a reference to this literature may be in
order.
Minor points:
The abstract refers to ‘adult speakers’. This is misleading as any native speaker will eventually
end up being an adult. I think you mean ‘adult learners’ and I would stick with this label.

This is a revision of a ms I reviewed favorably before. Given that the author has responded well
to the suggestions made, I am happy to recommend the paper for publication now.
I foresee that the present analyses will be called into question and that alternative analyses will
provide some (small) support for the linguistic niche hypothesis. However, this is a discussion
that must take place openly in the literature and not as part of hidden reviews. Koplenig has a
strong case to question the niche hypothesis and now it is up to the proponents to show him and
the readers what they have misunderstood. If the proponents are not able to do so convincingly,
Koplenig's alternative hypothesis can be the start of further progress.

Review ms Koplenig
Marc Brysbaert
must admit I like the ms, even though I thought the niche hypothesis had good credibility (it
has been argued that in Dutch too the language simplified at times of mass immigration). This
s surely going to rock the boat. However, as far as I can judge, the author is completely
ransparent about the variables used (mainly coming from other sources) and the analyses
done.
*Thank you very much, below are my comments.
My main concern was that the niche hypothesis not really requires control for population
size. It is just the proportion of non-native adult speakers that matters. So, I am not 100%
convinced the present analyses will be enough for everyone (although it is true that the effect
does not survive control for other random factors either and that the effect of population size
remains significant when L2 proportion is partialed out). I was reminded of a recent article in
which the conclusion was that for this type of correlational questions the conclusions largely
depend on the statistics used and the variables taken into account or not (see
http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245917747646). So, different authors may
come to different conclusions.
*I agree. I changed the abstract, the title and the Introduction, to better clarify the aims of the
paper. In addition, I added three new sections to the electronic supplementary material in
order to improve the manuscript in terms of the raised concern: Section 5 contains a validation
of the permutation test that suggests that it is indeed population size that explains the apparent
elationship between vehicularity and complexity (morphological/information-theoretic).
Section 6 contains an alternative permutation test that supports the results presented in the
main part of the paper. Section 9 presents the results of a mediation analysis that was
suggested by the second reviewer, so in a certain sense, this simulates a “different author”.
The results of this test are in line with the other results.
The following were minor questions I had:
Lines 93-94 (and further on again): Does this mean that 3 and 4 were scored double? Why
not 3 and lower and 4 and higher, or lower than 4 and higher than 3?
*I agree that this is ambiguous and modified this paragraph accordingly. Languages with an
EGIDS value of 1, 2 or 3 are categorized as vehicular, while languages with an EGIDS value
of 4 to 10 are categorized as non-vehicular.
Line 120: Are you sure about this equation for population size? It seems to indicate that the
parameter increases the higher estimated L2 proportion is (going to infinity for a language in
which everyone is L2 speaker; e.g., Esperanto).
*I agree that this was wrong. I modified the equation accordingly. In the analysis of the paper,
use the L1 estimate. I added a section in the electronic supplementary (§8) where the total
number of speakers (L1 + L2) is used as a measure of population size (see below).
t is always good to keep in mind that zero correlations can also be caused by unreliable
variables. If other people were to compile the same measures, how much would they correlate
with the present ones? To some extent, I am satisfied to see that all measures have been
collected from good sources (and are made available), but still it is something to keep in
mind, certainly because we are talking about quite a few understudied languages here.
*I agree. That is one of the reasons why I present separate analyses regarding morphological
complexity on the full dataset (at least one available feature) and on a subset of languages
where at least six features are available (50% of all languages have information on at least six
eatures). I modified the corresponding paragraph accordingly. I also modified the Discussion
section to highlight the need for a common analytical approach in this context.
n addition to the actual p-values, I now also present Bonferroni adjusted p-values to account
or multiple testing. The procedure is described in the Material and Methods section. I also
added two new sections to the electronic supplementary material: Section 8 uses the total
number of speakers as the measure of population size instead of the number of L1 speakers.
Section 7 presents separate analyses where all non-vehicular languages that are listed by the
Ethnologue as having a proportion of L2 speakers > 0 are dropped. All results presented in §7
and §8 generally support the results presented in the main part of the paper.
Reviewer: 2
The paper tests the hypothesized link between proportion of L2-speakers and morphological
complexity for a significantly larger sample of languages than has been attempted previously.
The findings show that when population size is partialled out then neither vehicularity (an
ndicator as to whether a language is used by L2-speakers) nor proportion of L2-speakers
show an independent association with morphological complexity or with information-
heoretical entropy. Instead, there is an indication that population size is associated with
ower morphological complexity and higher entropy pointing towards explanations of change
n linguistic structure to do with the size and structure of social networks.
Having previously expressed doubts myself that there should be a plausible link between
proportion of L2-speakers and morphological complexity I am very sympathetic to the overall
aims of this paper. I therefore would like my comments to be viewed as suggestions for
mprovement before publication.
*Thank you very much, below are my comments.
My main concern is that in order to make a strong contribution I find that the paper needs to
mprove in clarity to appeal to a broader audience beyond computational linguistics.
Specifically, at the beginning of the Methods Section, I suggest a clearer roadmap for the
analyses. There is some redundancy in the explanation of the permutation process at the
expense of clarity with respect to the overall logic of the analysis. While reading through it
he first time, it was not always clear to me whether the paper focuses on testing the
relationship between proportion of L2-speakers and morphological complexity (as the title
suggests), the relationship between total number of speakers and proportion of L2-speakers,
he relationship between total number of speakers and morphological complexity or all three
of them. More clarity about the specific aims is needed.
*I agree, I modified the abstract, the title and the Introduction to better clarify the aims of the
paper. The redundancy regarding the permutation test has now been reduced.
n particular, the author has opted for using partial correlations but having established a link
between population size and morphological complexity/entropy I was wondering whether a
mediation analysis (Hayes, 2009) is a more appropriate and comprehensive way of testing
what the Linguistic Niche Hypothesis asserts -- that the link between population size and
morphological complexity is mediated by proportion of L2-speakers.
Hayes, A. F. (2009). Beyond Baron and Kenny: Statistical mediation analysis in the new
millennium. Communication monographs, 76(4), 408-420.
*I agree that this is another interesting idea to interpret and test the Linguistic Niche
Hypothesis. Accordingly, I added a new section to the electronic supplementary material (§9)
hat presents a binary mediation analysis. The results demonstrate that the indirect effect of
vehicularity is not significantly different from zero in all investigated scenarios (this is
checked via bootstrap confidence intervals with 10,000 repetitions each). This indicates that
n essence the mediated proportion is meaningless and thus supports the results presented in
he main part of the paper.
n addition, it would be desirable to provide a clear summary of how the various constructs
proportion of L2-speakers, morphological complexity and information-theoretic
complexity/entropy) are operationalized computationally, and what the rationale is. This
needs to be explained in the text so readers can appreciate whether the measures chosen are
good measures. Especially in light of the result showing a link between population size and
entropy, and the associated discussion, a clearer explanation in the Methods section of how
entropy is calculated would be necessary, to understand the links between morphological
complexity and redundancy (e.g. intra-word vs. between words). For example, how would
redundant gender marking in determiner-adjective-noun agreement patterns (e.g. German:
eine warme Suppe) be accounted for in the entropy measures?
*I agree. I added an equation for all key quantities of interest. In addition, I added a whole
new paragraph that explains how exactly the entropy rate is calculated and the underlying
ationale. Regarding the question how linguistic redundancy translates into descriptional (i.e.
nformation-theoretic) redundancy: I would like to remain rather agnostic here, because I
believe that the results demonstrate that the relationship between both kinds of redundancy
might not be as direct as previously asserted, for example by Lupyan and Dale (2010,
Language Structure Is Partly Determined by Social Structure) or Nettle (2012, Social scale
and structural complexity in human languages). I added a sentence to the Discussion section
o highlight the need for additional research in this context.
Regarding the determiner-adjective-noun agreement example: from an information-theoretic
point of view, the gender marking pattern could be understood in reference to data
compression. Shannon showed that the minimal code length of an item with probability p is
og2(1/p). If we assume that somewhere in the text/corpus before the sentence of interest,
here is a sentence like “eine warme Farbe”, then the compressor could use that information to
compress/predict the example sentence, e.g. the conditional probability of “e” after “eine
warm”, i.e. p(“e”|“eine warm”) will be very high, almost 1, so the code length will be almost
og2(1/1)˜0. Therefore, the redundancy in gender marking can be used to compress the data.
Below, I am listing some more specific concerns and suggestions (numbers = lines):
97: “In this paper, I use available information on both L2 users and on vehicularity to test the
assumed relationship between the proportion of adult speakers and both morphological and
nformation-theoretic complexity…” -- At this point, the author should provide a clear
hypothesis as to what to expect if the formulation of the LNH that attributes a link between
population size and morphological complexity to the proportion of L2-speakers is true. I
would have expected something along the lines of ‘According to the Linguistic Niche
Hypothesis, languages with an EGIDS > 3 (or with vehicularity = 1) should have higher
entropy/lower morphological complexity when statistically controlling for population size’.
*Agree, I have done so at the end of the Introduction.
104: The author introduces measures of geographical language area yet the theoretical
relevance of this variable has not been explained and it does not seem to figure as a random
effect in the analyses.
*As described at the beginning of the Results section, both speaker population size and
geographical range size are used to test whether vehicularity can be used to indirectly test the
nductive argument of the linguistic niche hypothesis. I have changed the Introduction to
highlight this upfront.
115: The statement “Language with an EGIDS value of 3 and higher are
categorised as vehicular, while languages with an EGIDS of 4 or lower are categorized as
non-vehicular.” leaves it unclear as to how languages with an EGIDS of 3 are categorised. I
suspect it may be the other way around: 3 and lower are vehicular? Also, correct ‘Language’
o ‘Languages’.
*I agree and modified this paragraph accordingly. Languages with an EGIDS value of 1,2 or 3
are categorized as vehicular, while languages with an EGIDS value of 4 to 10 are categorized
as non-vehicular.
145: ‘The median estimated speaker population size is 15,000; the median estimated
proportion of L2 speakers is 0 for non-vehicular languages and 0.233 for vehicular
anguages. Moreover, the statement in line 151 suggests ‘According to the definition of the
Ethnologue, a vehicular language should have a significant number of L2 users, while no L2
users are expected for non-vehicular languages.’ Contradicting these two statements, the data
ile in the Supplementary Materials shows that some non-vehicular languages are listed with
a certain proportion of L2 speakers. It is thus not clear as to what exactly proportion of L2-
speakers measures. For example, the proportion of 0.62 of L2 speakers for English with a
vehicularity index of 1 seems to suggest that 62% of English speakers use it as an L2 (or L3)
n addition to their L1. But then the data file also lists an L2 proportion of 0.26 for Balkan
Romani, which has a vehicularity index of 0. This suggests that 26% of speakers for whom
Romani is the L1 also know another L2, given that Romani is not categorised as a vehicular
anguage. The paper seems to treat these two situations as equivalent: if a language is being
spoken by a lot of non-native speakers as in the case of English this is apparently treated in
he same way as a native language some speakers of which also use another L2. If there is
mutual influence in both cases then the underlying cognitive mechanisms must be
undamentally different: accommodation to non-native grammar learning difficulties in the
ormer case vs. language attrition in the latter. I have my strong reservations as to whether it
s correct to equate those two very different situations. In any case, the relationship between
he two variables and the fact that not all languages with a vehicularity of 0 have 0 L2
speakers needs to be dealt with openly. I wonder whether it is an artefact of the way
proportion of L2-speakers is calculated in Ethnologue.
* In the corresponding Materials and Methods section, I write that “non-vehicular languages
with no available information on L2 users are assigned an L2 proportion of 0”. However, the
eviewer is correct and I agree that I have not pointed this out clearly enough. I modified the
section accordingly. Ethnologue asserts that for non-vehicular languages, “L2 users are not
expected”. However, there are in total 78 non-vehicular languages where Ethnologue reports
an L2 proportion that is greater than 0 (with a median estimate of 0.086). To rule out the
possibility that those exceptions to the rule in the Ethnologue categorization scheme affect the
esults, separate analyses where those 78 languages are dropped are now presented in the
electronic supplementary material (§7). In addition, the idea of using vehicularity as an
ndicator as to whether a language is used by L2-speakers in addition to the correlation
analysis of L2 proportion is also partly due to this.
As indicated above, the paragraph between lines 181 and 200 is rather redundant as it seems
o explain the rationale behind the permutation process again – this could be summarised
more succinctly as pertaining to both sets of analyses.
* I modified this accordingly.
183: Explain what is meant by ‘functional form’ of a variable.
*I modified this accordingly.
211: Explain the rationale behind conducting analyses for 6 language families and language
areas.
*I agree. Section 4 of the electronic supplementary material now explains how the
amilies/areas were selected.
254/255: The sentence should be edited to refer to information-theoretical and not
morphological complexity.
*The sentence has been modified accordingly.
267-270: Please rephrase as the findings do not contradict an influence of the environment
per se, as the link between population size and entropy/morphological complexity indicates;
hey just do not support the idea that this influence is due to the proportion of L2 speakers.
*Agree, the paragraph has been modified accordingly.
Page 19, line 48: Table 2 is mislabelled as Table 1.
* I agree, this typo has been changed.

Reviewer: 2
The author did an excellent job addressing the concerns I expressed in my previous review,
ncluding providing a clear statement of hypotheses. This is very helpful.
*Thank you very much, below are my comments.
particularly welcome the additional analysis that remove the languages with a vehicularity
ndex of 0 and a proportion of L2-speakers > 0. However, I think languages that lack the
estimate of L2 proportion should also be removed. I am sorry I am being very nit-picky about
his but I am still not convinced that vehicularity is a good proxy for proportion of adult L2-
speakers of a language.
*According to how the Ethnologue categorizes languages, vehicularity is a direct proxy for
whether a language is used as an L2. As such it is treated in all analyses that use vehicularity
as a binary predictor variable. Here is a corresponding interesting quote from the editors of
he Ethnologue that shows how languages are classified: “Based on the use of the phrase
"vehicular language" by some as a synonym for lingua franca, we use the term vehicular to
efer to the extent to which a language is used to facilitate communication among those who
speak different first languages. If a language is characterized here as being Vehicular, it is
used by others as an L2 in addition to being used by the community of L1 speakers.” [1; my
emphasis]. In relation to the further comments below, I added a corresponding section to the
Discussion section.
The author states that where there was no estimated proportion of L2 speakers available an
estimated proportion of 0 was entered but this may not be a good way of dealing with this
ack of information. Take Scottish Gaelic. It is listed with a vehicularity index of 1 and misses
he estimate of L2 speakers. Presumably a 0 was entered here. However, this would
mischaracterise the situation that there are no monolingual Gaelic speakers in Scotland and
hat one would be hard-pressed to argue that all Gaelic speakers use the language as an L2.
Gaelic is a clear case of communal bilingualism where the language is acquired by children
alongside English, not just in the home but increasingly in Gaelic-medium schools.
*As written in the main part of the paper and in correspondence with the categorization
scheme of the Ethnologue [2], only non-vehicular languages with no available information on
L2 users are assigned an L2 proportion of 0, because, as argued in the Ethnologue “such a
anguage is by definition, a local language and L2 users are not expected” [2]. Scottish Gaelic
s a good example here. It is categorized as being a vehicular language (EGIDS = 2). Since it
misses the estimate of L2 speakers, it is only included in the vehicularity analyses, but it is not
ncluded in any of the correlation analyses. In the vehicularity analyses, it is treated as a
anguage that is used as an L2.
How many other languages are there in the relatively small set of 241 vehicular languages
where it is not clear what the L1 and what the L2 is? I am presenting this example only to
express my doubts that vehicularity is a good estimate for the role of adult L2-learners. I
hink the assumption that inter-generational disruption as measured by the EGIDS is linked to
use as an L2 is probably not correct. If anything, I would think that languages with high
EGIDS values may also be heritage languages, i.e. languages learned incompletely by
children. While this also may affect language structure in interesting ways it is different from
he assumption that it is the learning constraints of adults that influence these languages, as
stated by the LNH.
*Of the 241 vehicular languages, 89 have information on the proportion of L2 speakers, the
emaining 152 languages are not used in any of the correlation analyses.
Because I think that the point the author makes is a very important one I want to make sure
he arguments and the underpinning statistics are compelling. I would therefore suggest
presenting the analysis that removes the 78 languages with a vehicularity index of 0 and a
proportion of L2-speakers > 0, and also exclude those languages that have no estimated
proportion of L2-users (like Scottish Gaelic), and present this more conservative analysis in
he main paper rather than in the Supplementary materials.
*As written above, the analyses are already conservative. Vehicular languages that lack
nformation on L2 users are excluded from the correlation analyses. Only non-vehicular
anguages with no available L2 information are assigned an L2 proportion of 0. However, to
ully convince the reviewer, I added a further section (10) to the electronic supplementary
material. Here, I present additional analyses where only vehicular languages with available
nformation rearding the proportion of L2 speakers were used. I believe this to be a strong test
or the linguistic niche hypothesis. As Table 12 demonstrates, this analysis does not lend
support to the LNH, too. So, even for vehicular languages only, we cannot say that a high
proportion of L2 users is statistically associated with low morphological complexity and high
entropy (when statistically controlling for the speaker population size).
This then raises another issue: When those 78 languages with ambiguous vehicularity are
removed both DVs show a weak but significant relationship with proportion of L2-speakers. I
hink it is therefore not be very convincing to entirely reject the idea that L2-speakers are a
driving force behind morphological simplification in languages with more speakers. I suggest
rephrasing the discussion a bit more cautiously by saying that proportion of L2-speakers may
only play a minor role compared to other factors associated with population size, rather than
stating that it plays no role altogether. Because I think the point the author makes is a very
mportant one I am just encouraging him to be as cautious and conservative as possible, to
convince those who attribute (undue -- in my view) importance to adult L2-learning as a
driving force.
*Here, I am not sure what the reviewer means. Please note that Table 7 and Table 8 (Section
7) support the results presented in the main part of the paper. Compared to the main part of
he paper, the only qualitative difference is row 2 of Table 8. It shows that there is a weak but
significant negative correlation between morphological complexity and the L2 proportion.
However, when controlling for the speaker population size, the correlation strength is sharply
educed (both absolute values are below 0.1) and only the correlation for the full dataset (at
east one available WALS feature) is significant. In addition, both part correlation coefficients
do not reach statistical significance after the Bonferroni adjustment. Apart from this point,
here are no qualitative differences between Table 1 and Table 2 of the main part of the paper
and Table 7 and Table 8. Thus, neither morphological complexity nor the entropy rate show a
significant relationship with the L2 proportion as soon as the estimated speaker population
size is controlled for.
aggree that it is a good idea to be more cautiously in the Discussion section, I updated it
accordingly.
While the quantification of entropy has been made much clearer, I think some readers may
still be confused about the quantification of morphological complexity. Especially the notion
of ‘feature value’ is not immediately clear without further explanation. I had to consult the
Bentz et al. (2016) Proceedings paper to fully understand what is meant by this. Providing an
example, e.g. with respect to gender, might be helpful here.
*Agree, added the suggested example.
I also think that some more critical comments about this particular way of quantifying
complexity may be in order, especially when it comes to explaining the lack of the expected
correlation between entropy and morphological complexity: One reason may be that feature
value is not a good, or should I say, sufficient, way of quantifying complexity. Take gender
again: In languages where gender is marked by systematic morphological cues, e.g. Russian
or Spanish, within-word entropy should be smaller than in gender languages where there is a
ot of arbitrariness in the gender category assignment, like German. I understand this is a
more substantial debate to be had and the author alludes to that but I think readers may
expect a slightly more thorough discussion of this issue – perhaps add one or two sentences
about the pros and cons of quantification of morphological complexity in this way and how
his may relate to entropy, in addition to the interesting comments about within- and between-
word entropy.
*Agree, I updated the Discussion section accordingly.
The suggestion that greater variability associated with larger population sizes may contribute
o higher entropy is an interesting one but should be reconciled with the literature on
phonological category learning which has demonstrated that being exposed to more speakers
acilitates learning as it allows learners to distinguish indexical from category-relevant
acoustic features. Again, this is a big and interesting debate to be had but a reference to this
iterature may be in order.
*Thank you for that, I added a corresponding remark and a literature reference.
Minor points:
The abstract refers to ‘adult speakers’. This is misleading as any native speaker will
eventually end up being an adult. I think you mean ‘adult learners’ and I would stick with this
abel.
*Agree, I change that.
Page 11, line 59: The sentence that starts with ‘But also relevant…’ is incomplete – please
rephrase.
*Agree, I changed that.
