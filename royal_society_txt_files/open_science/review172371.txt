Analyses of 3D muscle deformation during contraction as well as changes of inner muscle
architecture (e.g. pennation angles, fascicle lengths) is a basic prerequisite to better understand
the contractile behavior as well as the interaction of muscles with each other. The study proved
the accuracy of 1D, 2D, and 3D structural muscle models to predict fascicle lengths and pennation
angles of human gastrocnemius medialis during cycling. Muscle activation, muscle belly length,
and tendon length, serving as input parameters for the models, were determined experimentally
using ultrasound and EMG analyses. The 1D model is based on simple assumptions (no change
in muscle thickness, no aponeurosis stretch). It provides reasonable predictions for fascicle
lengths and pennation angles compared to experimental data. Interestingly, more complicated 2D
(allowing aponeurosis stretch) and 3D (allowing aponeurosis stretch and bi-directional bulging of
individual fascicles) do not significantly improve the model prediction. The manuscript is well
written and the experiments performed are sufficient for model evaluation. From my point of
view, the manuscript deals with a very important and current topic in the field of muscle
physiology and muscle modelling: the evaluation of muscle models to reproduce changes in
muscle geometry (pennation angles, fascicle lengths) during contraction. However, there are
some concerns which should be addressed in the revision.
Major comments:
Calculation of aponeurosis strain is unclear. If I understand you correctly, time-varying activation
a(t) reaches the value 1 when maximum EMG amplitude was measured during dynamic
contractions (during “maximum effort” sprint trails; p4, line 1). Aponeuroses compliance (C_apo)
was given for contractions with maximum isometric force (p5, line 52). However, it is unknown
which muscle activation (maybe >1) occurs during isometric contraction. Thus it seem unclear
how you calculate the aponeurosis stretch based on eq.5? Did you measure maximum isometric
muscle force and corresponding aponeurosis strain as well as muscle activity?
P1, line 51. You state that “dynamic muscle shape changes alter the force output”. I assume you
mean the shape changes of a single isolated muscle during contraction. However, muscles were
mostly surrounded by other muscles, which may transfer transversal forces (Reinhard et al. 2016),
thereby compressing these inside muscles. This might additionally influence muscle shape
during contraction. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated, that muscle compression influences
muscle force (e.g. Siebert et al. 2016). This potential influence on muscle force should be
addressed additionally.

muscle force. J Exp Biol, 219(Pt 15), 2311-2319.
Siebert et al. (2016). Force reduction induced by unidirectional transversal muscle loading is
independent of local pressure. J Biomech, 49(7), 1156-1161.
P4, line 35: Determination of muscle belly velocity during contraction from the tracked 3D
locations of the ultrasound probe (and thus of the muscle-tendon junction) and the calcaneus
seems accurate. However, muscle fascicle velocity was determined by measurement of the
projection of a representative fascicle in the ultrasound scanning plane. I assume that the
representative fascicle was within the ultrasound scanning plane in the passive state. During
muscle contraction there is a 3D movement of the fascicles and thus they might rotate out of the
3
scanning plane. The influence of this artifact on fascicle velocity and muscle belly gearing should
be discussed.
P9, paragraph “Influence of aponeurosis properties on dynamic shape change”: For the simple
structured unipennate GM it might be true, that effects of aponeurosis compliance on muscle
shape change are potentially minor. However, there exist muscles with much more complicated
inner muscle architectures and complex, inhomogeneous aponeurosis deformations during active
contractions like rabbit M. plantaris (Böl et al. 2015). Furthermore 3D muscle shape is influenced
by changes in aponeurosis width, too. Both aspects should be discussed.

Minor comments:
Summary: Please specify the muscle, the exercise, and the mechanical condition in the summary.
P1, line 50: The statement that up to 50% of cross-bridge forces do not contribute to longitudinal
muscle force is interesting. It shifts the focus on the almost neglected fact, that muscle generates
forces in multiple directions. However, it should be explained in more detail (for the reader)
under which circumstances the muscle generates radial forces (e.g. dependent on muscle (or
sarcomere) length, filament lattice, pennation angle, or transversal muscle loading).
P3, line 43: Subjects pedalled at frequencies up to 140 rpm, which is particularly high and results
in high accelerations of the ultrasound probe attached to the gastrocnemius medialis muscle. You
measured the 3D movement of this ultrasound probe. Are there any increasing movements or
vibrations of the ultrasound probe with increasing cycling frequency? Are there correlations
between increasing pedaling frequency and deviations from the circular path of the ultrasound
probe? What is the impact on the measurements?
P3, line 50: Wakeling et al. (2013) observed effects of external muscle compression by elastic
bandages on muscle thickness, pennation angle and gearing within the muscle. The ultrasound
probe was secured over the muscle using a stretchy adhesive bandage. Potential influence of this

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
In the manuscript, Dick and Wakeling evaluate the accuracy of 1D, 2D, and 3D models for
predicting human gastrocnemius pennation angle and fascicle length during cycling. Predictions
from the model are compared with in vivo measurements from B-mode ultrasound during a
range of mechanical conditions. The authors find that a 1D model is sufficient for predicting
fascicle length trajectories. They also find that the 3D model is most accurate with low values of
5
aponeurosis strain and shape change occurring primarily in the thickness direction. This finding
is a valuable insight and may explain why the 1D and 2D models are accurate because additional
parameters included in the 2D and 3D models do not substantially influence model predictions.
The manuscript is well-written and the experiments are carefully executed. I have a few
comments and suggestions, which are described in detail below.
Major comments
1. While the authors describe their 1D model in the introduction, they do not describe the
additional parameters included in the 2D and 3D models. While the full descriptions of the
models are in the methods, can they state what additional parameters are included in the 2D and
3D models in the introduction?
2. The authors refer to a second hypothesis throughout the results and discussion but only one
hypothesis is clearly stated in the introduction. Can the authors make their hypotheses more clear
in the introduction?
3. In the results, the authors state that there were greater differences between the 1D and 2D
model predictions and 1D and 3D model predictions at low load compared to high load
conditions. How was this evaluated statistically? In the description of the statistics, there is no
explanation of how the magnitude of difference is compared among models. Or was the
difference between 1D and 2D models significant at low load and not high load? Can the authors
describe how this comparison was made in more detail? Furthermore, are the high and low load
conditions referring to crank torque magnitude? That's also not clear here.
4. The authors state that the RMSE is lowest in the 3D model for pennation angle and in the 2D
model for fascicle length. However, both the 2D and 3D models fall within the lowest RMSE
values for pennation angle (2.8 degs) and fascicle length (9.4%Lf) in the plot in figure 5. Given
this plot, how do the authors infer that either the 2D or 3D model is more accurate?
5. While the results suggest that aponeurosis longitudinal compliance has little effect on
predicted fascicle lengths and pennation angles, the models did not include any aponeurosis
width-wise stretch or compliance and other studies have shown substantial width wise stretch
during contractions (Arellano et al. 2016 J Biomech 49:1812-1817). Can the authors comment on
the potential influence of width-wise stretch on gearing and make it clear that this was not
included in the model?
6. The section on the appropriateness of constant volume models seems unwarranted given that
nothing in the authors' models suggest that volume is not constant. If this section is included, can
the authors make it clear that their models do not suggest model accuracy would be increased by
relaxing the isovolumetric constraint?
Minor comments (page, line number)
1. (1, 50) This sentence should read "…force is generated in the radial outwards (or inwards)
direction…"
2. (1, 54) In previous sentences, the authors state that dynamic shape changes are fundamentally
important for muscle mechanical output but then this sentence refers to "The limited ability for
muscle to undergo changes in geometry..." It is not clear that this "limited ability" for shape
change is referring to limitations that occur with aging and disease. Can the sentence instead be
restructured to state something along the lines of "Declines in locomotor performance with
ageing and disease may be due to the limited ability… in these conditions."
3. (2,1) It would be helpful if the authors more clearly defined gearing in this paragraph.
4. (2, 5) It is not clear what the authors are referring to when they state "forces develop in the
opposite direction" after fibres "compress in cross-sectional area". Do they mean compress in one
dimension of their cross-sectional area and expand in another direction to maintain a constant
volume?
5. (2,45) Models that neglect variable gearing also potentially underestimate muscle velocity (ie,
see Azizi et al. 2008 figure 6).
6. (3,19) Relevant is misspelled.
6
7. (3,46) How were data collected from the muscle belly and MTJ synchronized?
8. (8, 28) The range of LF RMSE should be 9.4-10.6%LF.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
The manuscript presents a study on how well 1D, 2D and 3D muscle models can predict in vivo
measurements of fascicle lengths and pennation angles during dynamic, cyclic contractions at
various speeds and loads. The mechanical effect of 3D shape changes of muscles in isolated
animal muscle preparations has been demonstrated previously, and this study adds to this field
of research by extending the commonly used Hill-type model from 1D to 2D and 3D versions,
and evaluating the performance of these models with experimental data. Contrary to expectation,
it was found that the 2D and 3D models did not perform better than the 1D version. Various
explanations for this finding are discussed.
The manuscript is clearly written with just the right amount of detail necessary to understand the
rather complex data analysis. I only have a few comments that I would like to see addressed.
Major comments:
1. Muscle activation was estimated from surface EMG measurements, normalized to the
maximum EMG measured during maximum effort trials. Although frequently done, estimating
muscle activation/force from surface EMG during dynamic tasks is very difficult, and possibly
inaccurate because of cross-talk artifacts, shifting of electrodes relative to the muscle belly, and
varying maximum EMG measurements at different muscle lengths and velocities. Were all
measurements normalized to one peak EMG measured during the maximum effort trial used for
normalization, or were ‘crank-angle’-specific maximum EMG values used? Is it possible to give
an idea of the effect of inaccurate muscle force estimates on fascicle length and pennation angle
predictions by the models?
2. P7/L55: “…[the models] were able to capture the general features of the ultrasound
measurements…”. Figure 3 shows that this statement is not entirely accurate, especially for
fascicle lengths, because there are some clear differences between the experimental data and the
7
models. All models predict a peak in fascicle length at a crank angle around 90°, which is quite
different from the peak in the experimental data. The fascicle excursion predicted by the model is,
in all cases, substantially larger than the experimentally observed excursion. The natural
conclusion from this is that either all three models do not predict the observed behaviour, or that
there are inaccuracies in the measurements. The experimental errors are discussed in the
Discussion, but the option that none of the models adequately predicts the observed behaviour is
not really discussed.
3. P4/L14-17: Were points on the aponeurosis manually labelled on all ultrasound images? Why
weren’t tracking algorithms used? And did the aponeurosis appear to curve during the cycling,
i.e. was a linear fit through the three points on the aponeurosis appropriate?
Minor comments:
4. P1/L50: This was demonstrated in insect’s flight muscles, which might be different from
mammalian muscles.
5. P3/L18: typo in ‘relevant’ (relavent)
6. P12/L9: typo: ‘l’ missing in extracellular (extracelluar)
7. P18/Figure 3: y-axis of fascicle length panels seem an order of magnitude off (0.2 to 0.6 m
should probably be 0.02 to 0.06 m). Also, it would helpful to add, in the figure or in the legend, a
description of what 0° and what 180° represents (crank down/up).

Comments to the Author(s)
In the manuscript, Dick and Wakeling evaluate the accuracy of 1D, 2D, and 3D models for
predicting human gastrocnemius pennation angle and fascicle length during cycling. Predictions
from the model are compared with in vivo measurements from B-mode ultrasound during a
range of mechanical conditions. The authors find that a 1D model is sufficient for predicting
fascicle length trajectories. They also find that the 3D model is most accurate with low values of
aponeurosis strain and shape change occurring primarily in the thickness direction. This finding
is a valuable insight and may explain why the 1D and 2D models are accurate because additional
parameters included in the 2D and 3D models do not substantially influence model predictions.
The manuscript is well-written and the experiments are carefully executed. I have a few
comments and suggestions, which are described in detail below.
Major comments
1. While the authors describe their 1D model in the introduction, they do not describe the
additional parameters included in the 2D and 3D models. While the full descriptions of the
models are in the methods, can they state what additional parameters are included in the 2D and
3D models in the introduction?
2. The authors refer to a second hypothesis throughout the results and discussion but only one
hypothesis is clearly stated in the introduction. Can the authors make their hypotheses more clear
in the introduction?
3. In the results, the authors state that there were greater differences between the 1D and 2D
model predictions and 1D and 3D model predictions at low load compared to high load
conditions. How was this evaluated statistically? In the description of the statistics, there is no
explanation of how the magnitude of difference is compared among models. Or was the
difference between 1D and 2D models significant at low load and not high load? Can the authors
describe how this comparison was made in more detail? Furthermore, are the high and low load
conditions referring to crank torque magnitude? That's also not clear here.
4. The authors state that the RMSE is lowest in the 3D model for pennation angle and in the 2D
model for fascicle length. However, both the 2D and 3D models fall within the lowest RMSE
values for pennation angle (2.8 degs) and fascicle length (9.4%Lf) in the plot in figure 5. Given
this plot, how do the authors infer that either the 2D or 3D model is more accurate?
5. While the results suggest that aponeurosis longitudinal compliance has little effect on
predicted fascicle lengths and pennation angles, the models did not include any aponeurosis
width-wise stretch or compliance and other studies have shown substantial width wise stretch
during contractions (Arellano et al. 2016 J Biomech 49:1812-1817). Can the authors comment on
the potential influence of width-wise stretch on gearing and make it clear that this was not
included in the model?
6. The section on the appropriateness of constant volume models seems unwarranted given that
nothing in the authors' models suggest that volume is not constant. If this section is included, can
the authors make it clear that their models do not suggest model accuracy would be increased by
relaxing the isovolumetric constraint?
Minor comments (page, line number)
1. (1, 50) This sentence should read "…force is generated in the radial outwards (or inwards)
direction…"
13
2. (1, 54) In previous sentences, the authors state that dynamic shape changes are fundamentally
important for muscle mechanical output but then this sentence refers to "The limited ability for
muscle to undergo changes in geometry..." It is not clear that this "limited ability" for shape
change is referring to limitations that occur with aging and disease. Can the sentence instead be
restructured to state something along the lines of "Declines in locomotor performance with
ageing and disease may be due to the limited ability… in these conditions."
3. (2,1) It would be helpful if the authors more clearly defined gearing in this paragraph.
4. (2, 5) It is not clear what the authors are referring to when they state "forces develop in the
opposite direction" after fibres "compress in cross-sectional area". Do they mean compress in one
dimension of their cross-sectional area and expand in another direction to maintain a constant
volume?
5. (2,45) Models that neglect variable gearing also potentially underestimate muscle velocity (ie,
see Azizi et al. 2008 figure 6).
6. (3,19) Relevant is misspelled.
7. (3,46) How were data collected from the muscle belly and MTJ synchronized?
8. (8, 28) The range of LF RMSE should be 9.4-10.6%LF.

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript presents a study on how well 1D, 2D and 3D muscle models can predict in vivo
measurements of fascicle lengths and pennation angles during dynamic, cyclic contractions at
various speeds and loads. The mechanical effect of 3D shape changes of muscles in isolated
animal muscle preparations has been demonstrated previously, and this study adds to this field
of research by extending the commonly used Hill-type model from 1D to 2D and 3D versions,
and evaluating the performance of these models with experimental data. Contrary to expectation,
it was found that the 2D and 3D models did not perform better than the 1D version. Various
explanations for this finding are discussed.
The manuscript is clearly written with just the right amount of detail necessary to understand the
rather complex data analysis. I only have a few comments that I would like to see addressed.
Major comments:
1. Muscle activation was estimated from surface EMG measurements, normalized to the
maximum EMG measured during maximum effort trials. Although frequently done, estimating
muscle activation/force from surface EMG during dynamic tasks is very difficult, and possibly
inaccurate because of cross-talk artifacts, shifting of electrodes relative to the muscle belly, and
varying maximum EMG measurements at different muscle lengths and velocities. Were all
measurements normalized to one peak EMG measured during the maximum effort trial used for
normalization, or were ‘crank-angle’-specific maximum EMG values used? Is it possible to give
an idea of the effect of inaccurate muscle force estimates on fascicle length and pennation angle
predictions by the models?
2. P7/L55: “…[the models] were able to capture the general features of the ultrasound
measurements…”. Figure 3 shows that this statement is not entirely accurate, especially for
fascicle lengths, because there are some clear differences between the experimental data and the
models. All models predict a peak in fascicle length at a crank angle around 90°, which is quite
different from the peak in the experimental data. The fascicle excursion predicted by the model is,
in all cases, substantially larger than the experimentally observed excursion. The natural
conclusion from this is that either all three models do not predict the observed behaviour, or that
there are inaccuracies in the measurements. The experimental errors are discussed in the
Discussion, but the option that none of the models adequately predicts the observed behaviour is
not really discussed.
14
3. P4/L14-17: Were points on the aponeurosis manually labelled on all ultrasound images? Why
weren’t tracking algorithms used? And did the aponeurosis appear to curve during the cycling,
i.e. was a linear fit through the three points on the aponeurosis appropriate?
Minor comments:
4. P1/L50: This was demonstrated in insect’s flight muscles, which might be different from
mammalian muscles.
5. P3/L18: typo in ‘relevant’ (relavent)
6. P12/L9: typo: ‘l’ missing in extracellular (extracelluar)
7. P18/Figure 3: y-axis of fascicle length panels seem an order of magnitude off (0.2 to 0.6 m
should probably be 0.02 to 0.06 m). Also, it would helpful to add, in the figure or in the legend, a
description of what 0° and what 180° represents (crank down/up).

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
Analyses of 3D muscle deformation during contraction as well as changes of inner muscle
architecture (e.g. pennation angles, fascicle lengths) is a basic prerequisite to better
understand the contractile behavior as well as the interaction of muscles with each other.
The study proved the accuracy of 1D, 2D, and 3D structural muscle models to predict fascicle
lengths and pennation angles of human gastrocnemius medialis during cycling. Muscle
activation, muscle belly length, and tendon length, serving as input parameters for the
models, were determined experimentally using ultrasound and EMG analyses. The 1D model
is based on simple assumptions (no change in muscle thickness, no aponeurosis stretch). It
provides reasonable predictions for fascicle lengths and pennation angles compared to
experimental data. Interestingly, more complicated 2D (allowing aponeurosis stretch) and
3D (allowing aponeurosis stretch and bi-directional bulging of individual fascicles) do not
significantly improve the model prediction. The manuscript is well written and the
experiments performed are sufficient for model evaluation. From my point of view, the
manuscript deals with a very important and current topic in the field of muscle physiology
and muscle modelling: the evaluation of muscle models to reproduce changes in muscle
geometry (pennation angles, fascicle lengths) during contraction. However, there are some
concerns which should be addressed in the revision.
Major comments:
Calculation of aponeurosis strain is unclear. If I understand you correctly, time-varying
activation a(t) reaches the value 1 when maximum EMG amplitude was measured during
dynamic contractions (during “maximum effort” sprint trails; p4, line 1). Aponeuroses
compliance (C_apo) was given for contractions with maximum isometric force (p5, line 52).
However, it is unknown which muscle activation (maybe >1) occurs during isometric
contraction. Thus it seem unclear how you calculate the aponeurosis stretch based on eq.5?
Did you measure maximum isometric muscle force and corresponding aponeurosis strain as
well as muscle activity?
The amount of aponeurosis strain during each of the trials was determined from Eq. 6
whereby the amount of force applied to the aponeurosis, and thus causing it to stretch was
determined from a Hill-type model (equation 5) and its compliance, which we varied from 0
to 0.15. We did not experimentally measure the maximum amount of aponeurosis stretch
during maximum isometric conditions. We provide reference our previous paper Dick et al,
2017 which gives further details regarding the Hill-type model parameters (ie: normalization
of FL and FV properties based on subject specific max isometric force capacity). To clarify
this, we have revised this section (Line 171-172).

forces predicted by Hill-type muscle models and estimated from ultrasound images. J Exp
Biol, 220(9), 1643-1653.
P1, line 51. You state that “dynamic muscle shape changes alter the force output”. I assume
you mean the shape changes of a single isolated muscle during contraction. However,
muscles were mostly surrounded by other muscles, which may transfer transversal forces
(Reinhard et al. 2016), thereby compressing these inside muscles. This might additionally
influence muscle shape during contraction. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated, that
muscle compression influences muscle force (e.g. Siebert et al. 2016). This potential
influence on muscle force should be addressed additionally.
Reinhardt et al. (2016). Intermuscular pressure between synergistic muscles correlates with
muscle force. J Exp Biol, 219(Pt 15), 2311-2319.
Siebert et al. (2016). Force reduction induced by unidirectional transversal muscle loading is
independent of local pressure. J Biomech, 49(7), 1156-1161.
The reviewer has raised an important body of research. The authors have included
Reinhardt et al., 2016 and Seibert et al., 2016 within the discussion to highlight the potential
influence of surrounding muscles and external forces (Line 345-346). In the context of the
introduction, we have decided to focus on shape changes within single isolated muscles to
explicate the comparisons with in situ animal data where much of our muscle shape change
knowledge comes from.
P4, line 35: Determination of muscle belly velocity during contraction from the tracked 3D
locations of the ultrasound probe (and thus of the muscle-tendon junction) and the
calcaneus seems accurate. However, muscle fascicle velocity was determined by
measurement of the projection of a representative fascicle in the ultrasound scanning
plane. I assume that the representative fascicle was within the ultrasound scanning plane in
the passive state. During muscle contraction there is a 3D movement of the fascicles and
thus they might rotate out of the scanning plane. The influence of this artifact on fascicle
velocity and muscle belly gearing should be discussed.
We thank the reviewer for highlighting this limitation. We have revised the discussion to
include the potential influence of out of plane fascicle movement (Line 407-410).
P9, paragraph “Influence of aponeurosis properties on dynamic shape change”: For the
simple structured unipennate GM it might be true, that effects of aponeurosis compliance
on muscle shape change are potentially minor. However, there exist muscles with much
more complicated inner muscle architectures and complex, inhomogeneous aponeurosis
deformations during active contractions like rabbit M. plantaris (Böl et al. 2015).
Furthermore 3D muscle shape is influenced by changes in aponeurosis width, too. Both
aspects should be discussed.
Böl et al. (2015). Novel microstructural findings in M. plantaris and their impact during
active and passive loading at the macro level. J Mech Behav Biomed Mater, 51, 25-39.
The authors agree with the reviewer such that in muscles with increasingly complex
architectures, aponeurosis compliance may play a different functional role. We have revised
this section of the discussion to include this information (Line 349-352).
Minor comments:
Summary: Please specify the muscle, the exercise, and the mechanical condition in the
summary.
We have included these three additional methodological details within the summary (Line
3-16).
P1, line 50: The statement that up to 50% of cross-bridge forces do not contribute to
longitudinal muscle force is interesting. It shifts the focus on the almost neglected fact, that
muscle generates forces in multiple directions. However, it should be explained in more
detail (for the reader) under which circumstances the muscle generates radial forces (e.g.
dependent on muscle (or sarcomere) length, filament lattice, pennation angle, or
transversal muscle loading).
The authors have revised this statement within the manuscript to highlight that this is a
cross-bridge phenomenon that leads to forces in multiple directions (Line 23-26).
P3, line 43: Subjects pedalled at frequencies up to 140 rpm, which is particularly high and
results in high accelerations of the ultrasound probe attached to the gastrocnemius medialis
muscle. You measured the 3D movement of this ultrasound probe. Are there any increasing
movements or vibrations of the ultrasound probe with increasing cycling frequency? Are
there correlations between increasing pedaling frequency and deviations from the circular
path of the ultrasound probe? What is the impact on the measurements?
The reviewer highlights an interesting point. The authors found that the tracked features of
the ultrasound image sequences (the 2D points from each B-mode image that were
subsequently projected into 3D lab space) followed a similar trajectory to the pedal (with
the exception of fascicle and tendon strain deviations). However, the ultrasound probe was
secured with adhesive tape and then wrapped in Co-ban (another semi-adhesive dressing)
to ensure the probe did not vibrate or slide medially towards the crank of the bike. Given
that we tracked the 3D position of the probe, and particularly for the coordinates of the MTJ
which were projected into 3D space, probe movements would have not affected this
specific parameter. However, we note that further research into the influence of probe
movement during increasingly dynamic tasks on ultrasound measurements is necessary.
P3, line 50: Wakeling et al. (2013) observed effects of external muscle compression by
elastic bandages on muscle thickness, pennation angle and gearing within the muscle. The
ultrasound probe was secured over the muscle using a stretchy adhesive bandage. Potential
influence of this bandage on the results should be discussed.
Wakeling et al. (2013). The effect of external compression on the mechanics of muscle
contraction. J Appl Biomech, 29(3), 360-364.
We have revised the discussion to include the potential influence of external compression
and the particular steps we took in this study to limit its effect (Line 411-416).
P4, line 16: It is well known, that muscles exhibit a distribution of fascicle lengths (Bolsterlee
et al. 2015, Schenk et al. 2013). Please define “representative muscle fascicle length”. What
is the influence of measuring a representative fascicle length which might deviate from the
mean fascicle length?

parameters from ultrasound and diffusion tensor images. J Biomech, 48(6), 1133-1140.
Schenk et al. (2013). Determination of three-dimensional muscle architectures: validation of
the DTI-based fiber tractography method by manual digitization. J Anat, 223(1), 61-68.
We have defined ‘representative muscle fascicle length’ (Line 116). Indeed, skeletal muscle
fascicle lengths are heterogeneous. However, the potential for this to affect our modelling
predictions is likely minor given that fascicle lengths and velocities were normalized before
input into the Hill-type models (eg: a shorter fascicle should change length less but the
normalized length change would be similar across fascicles).
P4, line 39: Add “maximum” before “… fascicle shortening velocity occurred…”
The authors have updated this sentence to include ‘maximum’ (Line 130).
P5, line 26: Reference to Fig. 1 is unclear.
This reviewer is correct. The reference should be to Figure 2 rather than Figure 1. We have
updated this.
P5, eq.3: Indices “i” and “c” should be defined.
We have defined indices “I” and “c” within the text of the methods (line 161-162) and
within Table 1.
P6, line 1: Please give the hill-type muscle parameters used for calculations is a separate
table or the appendix.
We have included a supplementary file (Suppl File 1) with the hill-type muscle model
parameters used in this study.
Fig. 3. Assign the specific model (1D, 2D, and 3D) to each of the colored lines (similar to Fig.
4). Furthermore, you should term the specific color of the plotted traces in the text (chapter
4, first paragraph) when comparing the models. This makes it easier for the reader to follow
your argumentation. Model simulation referred in the text (p8, line 1) “…where c_apo=0.1
and <U+0001D45B>=0.05 (Fig. 3)…” is not presented in Fig.3.
We have made 3 changes to reflect this comment from the reviewer:
1. We have updated the figure 3 caption to assign each of the models to the coloured
lines (similar to Fig. 4).
2. We have defined the specific colour for each models’ trace in the text of the results
such that it is easier for the reader to follow the text and the figure when comparing
the models (Line 236-244)
3. We have updated the text to indicate the most extreme 3D model is “…where
c_apo=0.1 and <U+0001D45B>=0.5 (Fig. 3)…”. (Line 243-244)
P8, line 28: Please check if “…10.4 to 10.6% L_0…” should be “...9.4 to 10.6% L_0…”
We have updated this sentence to match Figure 5 (9.4 to 10.6 %) (Line 262).
Fig. 5. This is an innovative and meaningful figure.
We thank the reviewer for this positive comment.

Comments to the Author(s)
In the manuscript, Dick and Wakeling evaluate the accuracy of 1D, 2D, and 3D models for
predicting human gastrocnemius pennation angle and fascicle length during cycling.
Predictions from the model are compared with in vivo measurements from B-mode
ultrasound during a range of mechanical conditions. The authors find that a 1D model is
sufficient for predicting fascicle length trajectories. They also find that the 3D model is most
accurate with low values of aponeurosis strain and shape change occurring primarily in the
thickness direction. This finding is a valuable insight and may explain why the 1D and 2D
models are accurate because additional parameters included in the 2D and 3D models do
not substantially influence model predictions. The manuscript is well-written and the
experiments are carefully executed. I have a few comments and suggestions, which are
described in detail below.
Major comments
1. While the authors describe their 1D model in the introduction, they do not describe the
additional parameters included in the 2D and 3D models. While the full descriptions of the
models are in the methods, can they state what additional parameters are included in the
2D and 3D models in the introduction?
As per the reviewers’ request, we have introduced the parameters included in the 2D and
3D models within the introduction of our manuscript (Line 49-53).
2. The authors refer to a second hypothesis throughout the results and discussion but only
one hypothesis is clearly stated in the introduction. Can the authors make their hypotheses
more clear in the introduction?
We thank the reviewer for noting this and have updated the results and discussion to reflect
one hypothesis rather than two.
3. In the results, the authors state that there were greater differences between the 1D and
2D model predictions and 1D and 3D model predictions at low load compared to high load
conditions. How was this evaluated statistically? In the description of the statistics, there is
no explanation of how the magnitude of difference is compared among models. Or was the
difference between 1D and 2D models significant at low load and not high load? Can the
authors describe how this comparison was made in more detail? Furthermore, are the high
and low load conditions referring to crank torque magnitude? That's also not clear here.
The difference between the 1D and 2D and 1D and 3D (but not the 2D and 3D) was
significant at low loads but not at high loads. We tested this using an ANOVA, which is
specified in the methods.
Further, the reviewer is correct in that load refers to crank torque magnitude. We have
clarified this for the reader within the results (Line 245).
4. The authors state that the RMSE is lowest in the 3D model for pennation angle and in the
2D model for fascicle length. However, both the 2D and 3D models fall within the lowest
RMSE values for pennation angle (2.8 degs) and fascicle length (9.4%Lf) in the plot in figure
5. Given this plot, how do the authors infer that either the 2D or 3D model is more
accurate?
We have removed this sentence from the results given that both the 2D and 3D models
result in similar predictions.
5. While the results suggest that aponeurosis longitudinal compliance has little effect on
predicted fascicle lengths and pennation angles, the models did not include any aponeurosis
width-wise stretch or compliance and other studies have shown substantial width wise
stretch during contractions (Arellano et al. 2016 J Biomech 49:1812-1817). Can the authors
comment on the potential influence of width-wise stretch on gearing and make it clear that
this was not included in the model?
The reviewer highlights an interesting point. The authors note that previous attempts were
made to include bi-directional force/compliance dependent aponeurosis properties in these
models, but this remains quite challenging. Although we did not directly test this, Figure 5
perhaps highlights the potential effect. If fascicle shape factor (n) is less than 0.5, this
indicates that the muscle is bulging more in the width direction (and thus increasing the
transverse stretch of the aponeurosis). With increasing width-wise stretch, the aponeurosis
will become less compliant (decrease in Capo).
We have highlighted the presence and potential influence of bi-directional properties of
aponeurosis on our modelling predictions within the discussion (Line 329-338).
“When contracting muscles bulge, the aponeuroses not only strain longitudinally, but also
transversely (width-wise) (Azizi et al. 2008; Azizi and Roberts, 2009, Arellano et al., 2016).
During active contractions, these biaxial strains have been shown to modulate longitudinal
aponeurosis properties, whereby increases in aponeurosis width lead to increases in
longitudinal stiffness (decrease in <U+0001D436>apo ). Although the models presented here did not
explicitly test the influence of these biaxial properties, our results suggest that reducing
aponeurosis compliance (equivalent to increasing stiffness) from 3 % to 1 % has relatively
minor effects on fascicle behaviour and gearing. Further, transverse aponeurosis strains
have been shown to plateau at approximately 20 % of maximum isometric force [Azizi and
Roberts, 2009], and thus these biaxial effects are likely more functionally relevant at low
levels of force and during active lengthening contractions which are different mechanical
conditions than those tested in the current study. ”
6. The section on the appropriateness of constant volume models seems unwarranted given
that nothing in the authors' models suggest that volume is not constant. If this section is
included, can the authors make it clear that their models do not suggest model accuracy
would be increased by relaxing the isovolumetric constraint?
The authors have revised the discussion surrounding the appropriateness of constant
volume models to clarify that our models do not explicitly test these effects nor directly
suggest that relaxing the isovolumetric constraint will lead to more accurate models, but
rather highlight that small changes in volume could have significant effects on shape change
behaviour (Line 380-385).
Minor comments (page, line number)
1. (1, 50) This sentence should read "…force is generated in the radial outwards (or inwards)
direction…"
The authors have revised this sentence based on another reviewers comment and thus this
sentence has been removed.
2. (1, 54) In previous sentences, the authors state that dynamic shape changes are
fundamentally important for muscle mechanical output but then this sentence refers to
"The limited ability for muscle to undergo changes in geometry..." It is not clear that this
"limited ability" for shape change is referring to limitations that occur with aging and
disease. Can the sentence instead be restructured to state something along the lines of
"Declines in locomotor performance with ageing and disease may be due to the limited
ability… in these conditions."
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have updated this statement in the
manuscript (Line 28, page 1).
3. (2,1) It would be helpful if the authors more clearly defined gearing in this paragraph.
The authors have revised this paragraph to include a definition of gearing (Line 24-25, page
2).
4. (2, 5) It is not clear what the authors are referring to when they state "forces develop in
the opposite direction" after fibres "compress in cross-sectional area". Do they mean
compress in one dimension of their cross-sectional area and expand in another direction to
maintain a constant volume?
We have revised this sentence (Line 17- page 2) to clarify the directionality of the forces we
are referring to.
5. (2,45) Models that neglect variable gearing also potentially underestimate muscle velocity
(ie, see Azizi et al. 2008 figure 6).
Azizi et al. (2008) show that if variable gearing occurs, it can result in higher gearing at low
force. Higher gearing would allow for lower fibre velocity (relative to the belly velocity), and
thus permit the fibre to generate greater force (due to its FV effect). For this reason,
neglecting variable gearing would result in an underestimation of force. This has been
stated in the Introduction (paragraph 2).
The Azizi et al., 2008 figures highlight the flip side of this argument: if variable gearing
occurs, it can result in higher gearing at low force. Higher gearing would speed up the belly
velocity relative to the fibre velocity, and this is what they show in their Fig. 6.
The authors would like to highlight that these two observations are directly related and not
in conflict.

7. (3,46) How were data collected from the muscle belly and MTJ synchronized?
Data collected from the muscle belly and MTJ was synchronized using the 3D coordinates of
LED markers placed on the right pedal. We have revised the methods to include these
details (Line 98-101).

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript presents a study on how well 1D, 2D and 3D muscle models can predict in
vivo measurements of fascicle lengths and pennation angles during dynamic, cyclic
contractions at various speeds and loads. The mechanical effect of 3D shape changes of
muscles in isolated animal muscle preparations has been demonstrated previously, and this
study adds to this field of research by extending the commonly used Hill-type model from 1D
to 2D and 3D versions, and evaluating the performance of these models with experimental
data. Contrary to expectation, it was found that the 2D and 3D models did not perform
better than the 1D version. Various explanations for this finding are discussed.
The manuscript is clearly written with just the right amount of detail necessary to
understand the rather complex data analysis. I only have a few comments that I would like
to see addressed.
Major comments:
1. Muscle activation was estimated from surface EMG measurements, normalized to the
maximum EMG measured during maximum effort trials. Although frequently done,
estimating muscle activation/force from surface EMG during dynamic tasks is very difficult,
and possibly inaccurate because of cross-talk artifacts, shifting of electrodes relative to the
muscle belly, and varying maximum EMG measurements at different muscle lengths and
velocities. Were all measurements normalized to one peak EMG measured during the
maximum effort trial used for normalization, or were ‘crank-angle’-specific maximum EMG
values used? Is it possible to give an idea of the effect of inaccurate muscle force estimates
on fascicle length and pennation angle predictions by the models?
The reviewer highlights an important point. The EMG was normalized to the peak intensity
that could have occurred for any pedal revolution during the series of maximum speed and
load trials conducted. We had multiple ways (max cadence and max power, both pretest
and posttest) to identify the maximum EMG for each muscle, but the normalization could
have occurred for any muscle length. In this type of modelling study, the effect of fascicle
length and velocity on EMG measurements and their subsequent influence on the force
predictions from the models is likely minor in comparison to other modelling parameters
(eg: optimal fibre length). Further, the 1D model does not use force, and so is not sensitive
at all to the EMG measures. Whilst we have not done a sensitivity analysis for the 2D and 3D
models with respect to muscle excitation, the effect of these errors is likely small. The
maximum activation for the medial gastrocnemius during the conditions elicited here was
approximately 45% (Dick and Wakeling, 2017, J Appl Physiol). If the EMG normalization was
in error by 10%, then the error on aponeurosis length (with 15% compliance and the
maximum of 45% activation) would have been 0.6%, and is thus minimal.
2. P7/L55: “…[the models] were able to capture the general features of the ultrasound
measurements…”. Figure 3 shows that this statement is not entirely accurate, especially for
fascicle lengths, because there are some clear differences between the experimental data
and the models. All models predict a peak in fascicle length at a crank angle around 90°,
which is quite different from the peak in the experimental data. The fascicle excursion
predicted by the model is, in all cases, substantially larger than the experimentally observed
excursion. The natural conclusion from this is that either all three models do not predict the
observed behaviour, or that there are inaccuracies in the measurements. The experimental
errors are discussed in the Discussion, but the option that none of the models adequately
predicts the observed behaviour is not really discussed.
To highlight the potential inability for the models to predict the experimental
measurements, we have updated the manuscript (Line 236-238) to emphasise the
inconsistencies in the models’ predictions when compared to the time-varying experimental
data for fascicle length and pennation angle.
3. P4/L14-17: Were points on the aponeurosis manually labelled on all ultrasound images?
Why weren’t tracking algorithms used? And did the aponeurosis appear to curve during the
cycling, i.e. was a linear fit through the three points on the aponeurosis appropriate?
Yes, the authors manually digitized points on the superficial and deep aponeurosis in each
of the ultrasound images. The authors chose not to use tracking algorithms based on their
experiences in a previous study (Hodson-Tole, Wakeling, Dick, 2016) whereby they used
semi-automated tracking methods and found minor differences in results and, surprisingly,
increases in the time taken to use the combination of automated aponeurosis tracking and
manual fascicle approaches as compared to an entirely manual approach. The authors also
note that automated fascicle tracking algorithms are not suitable for the higher cycling
cadences in this study. Across the range of loads and cadences tested here, the aponeurosis
did not curve by substantial amounts and thus a linear fit was determined to be
appropriate.

Minor comments:
4. P1/L50: This was demonstrated in insect’s flight muscles, which might be different from
mammalian muscles.
We appreciate this comment from the reviewer. It is possible that the dynamic shape
changes of skeletal muscle may not be entirely consistent between insect and mammalian
muscle however without sufficient evidence to support this, we have chosen for the
sentence to remain as previous.
5. P3/L18: typo in ‘relevant’ (relavent)
We have update this typo (Line 75).
6. P12/L9: typo: ‘l’ missing in extracellular (extracelluar)
We have updated this typo (Line 440).
7. P18/Figure 3: y-axis of fascicle length panels seem an order of magnitude off (0.2 to 0.6 m
should probably be 0.02 to 0.06 m). Also, it would helpful to add, in the figure or in the
legend, a description of what 0° and what 180° represents (crank down/up).
We thank the reviewer for noting this. We have updated the Y axis on Figure 3 (from 0.02 to
0.06 m) and also included images of the leg position throughout the pedal cycle within the
figure.
