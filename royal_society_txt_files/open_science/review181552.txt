The authors examine the accuracy in sexual unfaithfulness judgments of female and male face
done by same and opposite sex raters. Both female and male raters were accurate at judging the
likelihood of men to cheat and poach but not the likelihood to be unfaithful by females. These
judgement seem to be driven by sexual dimorphism, which appears to be a valid cue of infidelity
at least for men. The manuscript is well written and overall convincing. Yet, I have two major
concerns, which makes me doubt the importance of these findings. The first one is the null result
for female faces. Although, it seems plausible that it is more difficult to find cues to infidelity in
women’s faces, a more reasonable explanation, which the authors also acknowledge, is the
limited variability of the self-reported cheating & poaching behavior in women. As the effect
sizes are really small of these findings it seems impossible to find any cues to infidelity in female
faces. The second major concern is the importance of these findings, it seems to add very little to
the already existing literature – males can judge infidelity in male faces with accuracy of 4%.
Some other minor points are the following:
What is the scale of the ratings for attractiveness, sexual dimorphism, and trustworthiness?
4% predictability, significant above chance individual rater-level accuracy with only 14.1% to
18.0% of individual raters 14.1% to 18.0% achieved above-chance accuracy in their ratings; are
those findings meaningful at all?
Why does the df in table 4 vary? Did you exclude some participants and if yes what the criteria
were?
I did not understand the reason behind the analysis reported in table 7, some further clarification
is necessary.

This is a really nice paper which not only assesses potential accuracy in judgements of sexual
behaviour at zero acquaintance by also examines what drives both perceptions and accuracy in
perceptions of observers. This is an important step which isn’t often taken and really makes this
worthwhile.
I have only one slight correction to make re references to our work on perceptions of
sociosexuality (Boothroyd et al 2008, 2011) which is cited here as relating to cheating but
generally is more about uncommitted sex and number of partners. It’s a weakness of the SOI in
fact that it doesn’t explicitly address cheating.
It’s also worth noting that we found more evidence of accuracy in judgements for female faces
across our studies than we did for male - the converse of the current results and possibly because
of the difference in measure used.
I was really pleased to see nuanced discussion of the effect size and modest individual accuracy
rates, as well as discussion of facial cues.
This paper is a lovely addition to the literature.

I received two contrasted reviews. While the second reviews (L. Boothroyd) has only
minor points and supports the publications of the manuscript, the first reviewer is more
critical, in particular of the null result for female faces and the small effect reported for
male faces (accuracy of 4% in judging infidelity from faces). The authors should at

sent to the same reviewer.
We would like to thank both reviewers for their comments. We are very glad that both
reviewers have enjoyed reading our MS and found it well-written and convincing. We
are also thankful for the opportunity to respond to the comments and further clarify
some of the points that we have made. Our detailed comments to the reviewers can be
found in the sections below.
Comments from Reviewer 1
The authors examine the accuracy in sexual unfaithfulness judgments of female and
male face done by same and opposite sex raters. Both female and male raters were
accurate at judging the likelihood of men to cheat and poach but not the likelihood to be
unfaithful by females. These judgement seem to be driven by sexual dimorphism, which
appears to be a valid cue of infidelity at least for men.
The manuscript is well written and overall convincing.
Thanks!
Yet, I have two major concerns, which makes me doubt the importance of these findings.
The first one is the null result for female faces. Although, it seems plausible that it is
more difficult to find cues to infidelity in women’s faces, a more reasonable
explanation, which the authors also acknowledge, is the limited variability of the self-
reported cheating & poaching behavior in women. As the effect sizes are really small of
these findings it seems impossible to find any cues to infidelity in female faces.
Indeed, the women’s self-reported cheating and poaching behaviours in our dataset have
limited variance. In particular, the standard deviation of the women’s self-reported
poaching was at least half of the variance of the men’s self-reported cheating and
poaching.
Critically, however, the mean and standard deviation of the women’s self-reported
cheating was comparable to that of men’s self-reported poaching (for which we did find
some degree of accuracy). Therefore, we think it is unlikely that the lack of accuracy for
women’s faces is due solely to limited variance in the self-reported behaviours.
However, we do agree that it is important to discuss these issues and we have now
added a paragraph to our Discussion addressing the issue of limited variability in the
self-reported cheating and poaching behaviour of the women’s faces (pp. 20-21, line
397-408).
The second major concern is the importance of these findings, it seems to add very little
to the already existing literature – males can judge infidelity in male faces with
accuracy of 4%.
We believe the finding that men can also rate men’s faces has two important
implications. The first implication is theoretical. This finding is consistent with the
expectation of evolutionary theory that accuracy in our judgments of unfaithfulness
from the face might represent an evolved adaptation for detecting not just opposite-sex
cheaters, but also same-sex poachers (see pp. 17-18, lines 319-334 in the Discussion).
Second, this result changes our interpretation of previous findings on this topic. As we
have mentioned in our Introduction and Discussion, previous papers have only tested
accuracy in perception of unfaithfulness from opposite-sex faces. The results from these
previous studies appear to show that women could rate men’s faces with some accuracy
while men could not for women’s faces. These findings have led to suggestions that
women might be more accurate at perceiving unfaithfulness compared to men.
However, our findings here indicate that at least for this face set, the difference is
instead due to the sex of the faces rather than the sex of the participants.
We have now re-emphasized these two important points in the concluding paragraph of
our Discussion section (pp. 21, line 409-416).
Some other minor points are the following:
What is the scale of the ratings for attractiveness, sexual dimorphism, and
trustworthiness?
We have now added the scale of the ratings for attractiveness, sexual dimorphism, and
untrustworthiness to our Methods section (pp. 7, line 152-155). We thank the reviewer
for noting this omission.
4% predictability, significant above chance individual rater-level accuracy with only
14.1% to 18.0% of individual raters 14.1% to 18.0% achieved above-chance accuracy
in their ratings; are those findings meaningful at all?
The relative importance of a 4% effect size depends on the level of explanation sought.
A 4% effect size can have substantial evolutionary consequence if that effect is
consistently selected for over multiple generations. We have mentioned that our effect
size is typical of what is found in evolutionary biology studies. Therefore, the effect
sizes in this study can have important evolutionary consequences. We have now added
another reference showing that effect sizes that are much smaller than 4% can still have
substantial evolutionary impact (pp. 18, line 332).
One point that we did not address in our original manuscript is how our effect sizes
compare to other effect sizes in the field of psychology. Importantly, our effect sizes fall
within the range of typical effect sizes not just in the field of evolutionary biology, but
also in psychology. Several recent studies have shown that effect sizes in psychology
averages around r = 0.2 (i.e. 4%). Therefore, although the amount of variance shared
between rated and actual unfaithfulness is modest, it may still have psychological
relevance. We have now added this information to our Discussion section (pp. 18, line
335-340).
As we have mentioned in our original Discussion, however, despite the potential
evolutionary and psychological impact at the group level, we do agree that it is very
important to clarify that our results do not mean that individual judgments of
unfaithfulness are diagnostic. That is, we are not trying to claim that our results are
meaningful in everyday social terms. This point is important to emphasize, especially
since several recent papers/commentaries, including our own, have cautioned against
interpreting average significant accuracy as evidence of individual diagnosticity
(Sutherland et al., 2018; Todorov, Olivola, Dotsch, & Mende-Siedlecki, 2015). We have
now expanded on this point to further clarify the difference between average statistical
significance and individual diagnosticity in our Discussion (pp. 18, line 341 - 346).
Why does the df in table 4 vary? Did you exclude some participants and if yes what the
criteria were?
The individual rater-level negative binomial regression model failed to converge and
provide an estimate of the regression slope in 11 instances (two men and three women
predicting cheating men’s faces, one man and one woman predicting cheating in
women’s faces, one man and three women predicting women’s poaching). These
instances were treated as missing data, hence the changes in the dfs. This information
was deleted by mistake from an earlier draft of the MS. We have now included it in the
Results section (pp. 10, line 214-218) and apologise for this omission.
I did not understand the reason behind the analysis reported in table 7, some further
clarification is necessary.
Table 7 was presented to show that the relationship between rated unfaithfulness and
actual infidelity in men’s faces was accounted for by sexual dimorphism. We have now
added the following sentence to clarify the point of the analysis, “If sexual dimorphism
was used by raters to make valid judgments of sexual unfaithfulness, then entering
sexual dimorphism together with rated unfaithfulness would reduce the relationship
between rated unfaithfulness and actual infidelity” (pp. 15 – 16, line 283-286).
We have also changed the description of Table 7 slightly to clarify its purpose. The
description now reads. “Results of negative binomial generalized linear models showing
that sexual dimorphism accounted for the relationship between ratings of unfaithfulness
and actual infidelity, indicating that sexual dimorphism is a driver to accuracy in men’s
faces” (pp. 16, Table 7).
Comments from Reviewer 2
This is a really nice paper which not only assesses potential accuracy in judgements of
sexual behaviour at zero acquaintance by also examines what drives both perceptions
and accuracy in perceptions of observers. This is an important step which isn’t often
taken and really makes this worthwhile.
Thanks!
I have only one slight correction to make re references to our work on perceptions of
sociosexuality (Boothroyd et al 2008, 2011) which is cited here as relating to cheating
but generally is more about uncommitted sex and number of partners. It’s a weakness of
the SOI in fact that it doesn’t explicitly address cheating.
We have now changed our description of these two references as looking at attitudes
towards uncommitted sex and multiple matings (pp. 5, line 97 & pp. 17, line 318).
It’s also worth noting that we found more evidence of accuracy in judgements for
female faces across our studies than we did for male - the converse of the current
results and possibly because of the difference in measure used.
We thank the Reviewer for pointing this difference out. We have now included this
point in our Discussion (pp. 19, line 368 - 375).
I was really pleased to see nuanced discussion of the effect size and modest individual
accuracy rates, as well as discussion of facial cues.
This paper is a lovely addition to the literature.
We are very pleased with the Reviewer’s overall positive review and in particular for
noting our careful discussion of the effect sizes.
