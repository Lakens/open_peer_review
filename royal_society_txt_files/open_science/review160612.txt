Associate Editor Comments to Author:
There looks to be much of interest in this manuscript, but there are still some omissions from the
data presented that make the paper a little confusing to read. For example, one of the previous
referees commented on the fact that it appears that a large number of taxa have been sampled,
judging from the list provided in the supplementary information, but the ontogenetic data from
these is not provided. This still seems to be the case in this revised manuscript. In connection with
this, there are a number of mismatches between the taxa for which photographic documentation
of the ontogenetic changes is provided and the taxa shown in the graphs given in Fig.3 (and
dimension values provided in section B of the supplementary information). The text and list of
taxa mentioned in the supplementary give the distinct impression that the author has a lot of data
on which the conclusions are being based. But the actual data presented seems to be only a
selection of this data. This then creates a mismatch between the text and the results provided,
which needs to be rectified. If the author can provide the measurements, ideally alongside
4
photographic evidence, for all of the taxa for which an ontogenetic range has been examined then
this should make a very strong manuscript.
There are also a number of typographical errors throughout the manuscript which need to be
corrected.
1) The author uses a comma to designate a decimal point. This should be changed to a full-stop in
both the main text and supplementary information.
2) The author tends to use “preys” throughout when “prey” is almost always sufficient and more
appropriate.
3) There are a number of instances of missing or inappropriate words, such as ‘the’, ‘on’ and ‘in’,
which could be corrected by the manuscript being edited by a native English speaker. Such
English editing should also correct the cases of odd word ordering or incorrect tense usage.

Associate Editor
Comments to the Author:
The author has still not dealt with the main criticism from one of the original referees that I
highlighted in my previous comments. The author is not presenting extensive amounts of data
that they say they are basing their conclusions on, with regards to postnatal ontogenetic
sequences. In the author’s response he mentions that he has analysed more than 30 postnatal
ontogenetic sequences to provide an acceptable sample for the conclusions. This corresponds to
the list of 34 species specifically named in the supplementary information as having been
measured for postnatal ontogeny. However, the table in section B of the supplementary
information lists the measurements for only eight species, which corresponds to the eight species
depicted in Fig.3. The author does present the measurements of juvenile and adult skulls for one
or two more species within the other figures, but this certainly does not constitute the data for
more than 30 species on which the author says that he is basing his conclusions. I can understand
why the author restricts Fig.3 to a selection of only eight species in order to not over-complicate
the figure. Nevertheless, the measurement data for all 34 species listed in the supplementary
information as having been analysed for postnatal ontogeny needs to be provided before the
manuscript can be considered for acceptance.
Author's Response to Decision Letter for (RSOS-160612.R1):
Dear Editor,
I've reduced the postnatal series listed in the supplementary material as the Associate editor
suggested, so this list includes only the species that are represented in the plots plus the species
figured in the manuscript and the supplementary material. I´ve uploaded the new version of the
Electronic Supplementary Material on Dryad.
Kindest regards

ear Dr. Dunn,
have now reviewed the manuscript, based on the suggestions and criticisms of the Associate Editor.
lease, find below comments on each point raised by the Associate Editor:
omment 1
here looks to be much of interest in this manuscript, but there are still some omissions from the data
resented that make the paper a little confusing to read. For example, one of the previous referees
ommented on the fact that it appears that a large number of taxa have been sampled, judging from the
st provided in the supplementary information, but the ontogenetic data from these is not provided. This
till seems to be the case in this revised manuscript. In connection with this, there are a number of
mismatches between the taxa for which photographic documentation of the ontogenetic changes is
rovided and the taxa shown in the graphs given in Fig.3 (and dimension values provided in section B of
he supplementary information). The text and list of taxa mentioned in the supplementary give the
istinct impression that the author has a lot of data on which the conclusions are being based. But the
ctual data presented seems to be only a selection of this data. This then creates a mismatch between
he text and the results provided, which needs to be rectified. If the author can provide the
measurements, ideally alongside photographic evidence, for all of the taxa for which an ontogenetic
ange has been examined then this should make a very strong manuscript.
agree with the Associate Editor about some mismatches between ontogenetic sequences analysed and
he performed graphics of Figure 3. To solve this I discriminated in the electronic supplementary
material the specimens that conform postnatal ontogenetic sequences to the adult specimens examined.
´ve analysed more than 30 postnatal ontogenetic sequences, so I consider my conclusions are based in
n acceptable sample. Of these ontogenetic sequences, I chose some of them to represent major snake
lades (i.e. scolecophidians, basal alethinophidians, underground and superficial macrostomatans) in the
metric analysis. However, it is important to emphasize that my conclusions are based in both the
natomical and metric analysis. Regrettably, it is not possible to provide the photographic evidence of
he sequences analysed because simply I don´t have images of all specimens, which were observed
uring several years in many different institutional collections.

here are also a number of typographical errors throughout the manuscript which need to be corrected.
The author uses a comma to designate a decimal point. This should be changed to a full-stop in both

revised the manuscript in order to correct these typographical and grammatical mistakes. Changes are
ecorded as track changes in the main manuscript.
