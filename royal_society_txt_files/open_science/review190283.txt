This is an excellent experimental study conclusively demonstrating behavioral adaptation of a
Malagasy ant species to a predator, and hinting at a complex possible symbiosis with another
species of snake that may help to deter the predatory blindsnake.
The frequent occurrence of Madagascarophis (and a few other snakes) in at nests in wetsren
Madagascar is a long-known mystery, and this is the first paper providing a biologically sound
explanation with experimental evidence for it. I greatly enjoyed reading it, and strongly
recommend its publication.
Note that in my reviews, I very often provide long lists of comments, suggestionss and
corrections, but in this case I could find only few points that warrant consideration during
revision, all minor. Overall this is an excellent study!

Overall, I think this is an interesting study which makes a valuable and novel contribution to the
literature. The authors show that ants (Aphaenogaster swammerdami) respond differently to 3
snake species: an ant-eating snake (Madatyphlops decorsei), a frog-eating snake (Thamnosophis
lateralis), and a snake-eating snake (Madagascarophis colubrinus). Specifically, the ants respond
to the ant-eating snake with alertness and evacuation of brood, to the frog-eating snake with
some agonistic behaviour, but do not show any significant agonism towards the snake-eating
snake. This suggests that not only have the ants evolved direct anti-predator responses
(responding selectively to the ant-eating snake), but they have also evolved to not repel snakes
that could indirectly protect them from predators (by accepting the snake-eating snake). The
experiments are well-thought out and the discussion is appropriate to the results presented, and
raises some interesting questions about the evolution of ant-snake symbioses.
My concerns with this paper are about clarity and methodology, and can be addressed in a
revision.
Abstract & Introduction:
In the abstract it is not clear what the roles of the three snakes are. It is clear that the blindsnake is
a predator, and the Thamnosophis snake is a control, but it is not clear what the role of the
lamprophiid snake is, it is simply referred to as occurring in active nests. The key point, its
predation on the blindsnake, is not mentioned until the end of the abstract.
In the introduction, it becomes clear that the lamprophiid snake’s role in the study is as a
contrasting predator of the first snake - but in this section the control snake is not mentioned at
all, making it hard to interpret the results and work out which comparisons are the important
ones. This just needs to be clearer.
Methods.
Line 100. How was activity quantified? Or do you just mean the entrance to the nest was
recorded, i.e. video recorded? Please make this clearer
Lines 117-124. Was extraction from the videos performed blind to the hypothesis? behaviours
such as alertness and biting can be subjective to determine, risking unconscious observer bias if
the hypothesis is known. As the analysis was done from video data, there are no logistic
restrictions to prevent the data extraction being carried out blind to the identity of the snake, i.e.
by a person unfamiliar with the hypothesis of the experiment and the various snake species. If the
analysis has been performed blind, please add a note to this effect. If it has not been performed
blind, the authors should address this by providing more information about the behavioural
criteria used, and also discuss their effect sizes in the context of possible bias, or they should
reanalyse a subset of their videos blind to check for observer bias effects.
I’m 124. Was the baseline activity level taken into consideration in these models? Please add a
table of the model output.
Minor points:
Line 129. Number of ants doing what? Is this all the ants on screen?

The paper would also benefit from thorough proof-reading for grammar. For example, in the first
few lines of the abstract, line 17, "for" should read "of"; line 19 "worker's" should read "workers' ",
line 22 "in" should read "on"; "termites" should read "termites' ", etc. I have not commented on
other typographical and grammatical errors throughout the text.

Many thanks for the encouraging words.
> Lines 55-56: Something is wrong with this sentence. Please rephrase.
This has been changed to “The colonies of a myrmicine ant found in Madagascar,
Aphaenogaster swammerdami, include approximately 100–1,500 workers inhabit large,
underground nests that have one large entrance hole and a conspicuous mound’’. See
revised p. 4 lines 56-59.
> Line 152: In how many cases (of N=11 in this treatment) was this behavior observed?
This has been changed to “Workers exhibited cooperative evacuation behaviour in all
trials using M. decorsei, and only after the presentation of the blindsnake”. See revised p.
11 lines 170-171.
> Lines 195-196: Higher risk of predation – but of other predators, not the blindnsnake, right?
Please rephrase to be more clear.
This has been changed to “they face a higher risk of attack by predators other than
blindsnakes’’. See revised p. 14 lines 215-216.
> Lines 240-242: Please rephrase to make more clear that this idea of additional ant-snake

Thank you for your good advice. Although unknown species of blind snakes have been
obtained from a stomach of M. colubrinus at our study site (A. Mori 2012, unpublished
data), predation of our subject blind snake species, M. decorsei, by the snake-eating snake
is yet to be confirmed. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the
discriminatory capacity of ants and their responses to snake species exhibiting different
ecological interactions including predation or symbiosis. We proposed a potential
mutualism between the snake-eating snake and the ants. Our future study would
investigate the predation of M. decorsei by M. colubrinus and test whether the relationship
between ants and snakes in Madagascar represents mutualism or commensalism. To
clarify it, we have corrected abstract and introduction.
> In the introduction, it becomes clear that the lamprophiid snake’s role in the study is as a
contrasting predator of the first snake - but in this section the control snake is not mentioned at
all, making it hard to interpret the results and work out which comparisons are the important ones.
This just needs to be clearer.
We agree with you and have added the sentence “and Thamnosophis lateralis (a sympatric
frog-eating snake as control)” and removed relevant sentences from materials & methods.
See revised p. 5 lines 77-79 and p. 6 line 95-p. 7 line 99.
> Line 100. How was activity quantified? Or do you just mean the entrance to the nest was
recorded, i.e. video recorded? Please make this clearer
Because it is difficult to observe behaviour of all the ants, we only recorded and observed
the behaviour of ants within the field of view of this video camera. To clarify we have
added the sentence “We only observed the behaviour of ants within the field of view as it
would be a challenge to analyse the behavior of all ants”. See revised p. 7 lines 106-108.
> Lines 117-124. Was extraction from the videos performed blind to the hypothesis? behaviours
such as alertness and biting can be subjective to determine, risking unconscious observer bias if
the hypothesis is known. As the analysis was done from video data, there are no logistic
restrictions to prevent the data extraction being carried out blind to the identity of the snake, i.e.
by a person unfamiliar with the hypothesis of the experiment and the various snake species. If
the analysis has been performed blind, please add a note to this effect. If it has not been
performed blind, the authors should address this by providing more information about the
behavioural criteria used, and also discuss their effect sizes in the context of possible bias, or
they should reanalyse a subset of their videos blind to check for observer bias effects.
We agree with you and have added more precise definition of ants’ behaviour and
comments on the effect sizes in the context of possible bias. See revised p. 8 line 129-p.
9 line 136 and p. 11 lines 166-169.
> I’m 124. Was the baseline activity level taken into consideration in these models? Please add
a table of the model output.
We did not include the baseline activity to prevent the model becoming too complex. We
have added the table to show output of the model. See added table 1.
> Line 129. Number of ants doing what? Is this all the ants on screen?
We have changed the sentence “the number of all the ants on screen”. See revised p. 9
lines 143-144.

first few lines of the abstract, line 17, "for" should read "of"; line 19 "worker's" should read "workers'

Thank you for your comments. We have made the corrections as suggested. The English
in this document has been checked by at least two professional editors, both native
speakers of English.
In addition, we have addressed following matters pointed out when the manuscript was
unsubmitted.
> -- Data Availability --
As your paper contains multiple ESM files, please update your data availability statement to specify
which data are uploaded as supplementary material. For example: "The XXXX video file and XXXX
data are uploaded as supplementary material".
We have made the corrections as suggested. See revised p. 19 line 285.
> -- Ethics --
Please expand your Ethics statement to comply with journal policies. We note that: "we could not
maintain all three
120 species of snakes for an adequate duration,"; please expand upon this statement, and clarify the
fate of these snakes. Authors should include details of animal welfare (such as species, number,
gender, age, weight, housing conditions, welfare, training and the fate of ALL animals at the end of the
experiment) and relevant details of steps taken to ameliorate suffering.
We agree with you and have added more detail explanation. See revised p. 8 lines 120-
122.
> -- ESM Titles and Legends --
Your manuscript was unsubmitted because unfortunately the headings and/or legends you have
provided for your supplementary files are not sufficiently informative. Supplementary files will be
published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on the online figshare repository (for
Royal Society Publishing examples, please see https://rs.figshare.com/). By making ESM available on
the figshare website, we hope to increase the visibility of your data, thus ensuring it is available for and
to the benefit of a wide audience.
The heading and legend provided for each supplementary file during the submission process will be
used to create the figshare page, so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your
files can be found in searches (ie: the titles should not be given only as "Supplementary X" within the
ScholarOne submission form). Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before
the accompanying article so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI, thus
allowing the data to be cited more easily.
We have added legends for supplementary files as suggested. See revised p. 30 lines 419-
422.

Many thanks for the encouraging words.
> Lines 55-56: Something is wrong with this sentence. Please rephrase.
This has been changed to “The colonies of a myrmicine ant found in Madagascar,
Aphaenogaster swammerdami, include approximately 100–1,500 workers inhabit large,
underground nests that have one large entrance hole and a conspicuous mound’’. See
revised p. 4 lines 56-59.
> Line 152: In how many cases (of N=11 in this treatment) was this behavior observed?
This has been changed to “Workers exhibited cooperative evacuation behaviour in all
trials using M. decorsei, and only after the presentation of the blindsnake”. See revised p.
11 lines 168-169.
> Lines 195-196: Higher risk of predation – but of other predators, not the blindnsnake, right?
Please rephrase to be more clear.
This has been changed to “they face a higher risk of attack by predators other than
blindsnakes’’. See revised p. 14 lines 213-214.
> Lines 240-242: Please rephrase to make more clear that this idea of additional ant-snake
symbioses in Madagascar is a hypothesis you are proposing here, but no experimental (and I
think not even anecdotal?) evidence exists so far to support it.
We agree with your comment. We have added the sentence “although no experimental
evidence exists to support their symbiosis”. See revised p. 18 lines 263-264.
> Line 258: "de l’Environnement et des Forêts"
We have changed “de L’environnement et des Forets” to “de l’Environnement et des
Forêts”. See revised p. 19 line 278.
> Line 266: We
We have changed “I” to “We”. See revised p. 19 line 286.
Comments from Reviewer #2:
General:
Overall, I think this is an interesting study which makes a valuable and novel contribution to the
literature. The authors show that ants (Aphaenogaster swammerdami) respond differently to 3
snake species: an ant-eating snake (Madatyphlops decorsei), a frog-eating snake (Thamnosophis
lateralis), and a snake-eating snake (Madagascarophis colubrinus). Specifically, the ants respond
to the ant-eating snake with alertness and evacuation of brood, to the frog-eating snake with some
agonistic behaviour, but do not show any significant agonism towards the snake-eating snake.
This suggests that not only have the ants evolved direct anti-predator responses (responding
selectively to the ant-eating snake), but they have also evolved to not repel snakes that could
indirectly protect them from predators (by accepting the snake-eating snake). The experiments
are well-thought out and the discussion is appropriate to the results presented, and raises some
interesting questions about the evolution of ant-snake symbioses.
My concerns with this paper are about clarity and methodology, and can be addressed in a
revision.
Sincerest thanks for your comments on our manuscript.
> In the abstract it is not clear what the roles of the three snakes are. It is clear that the blindsnake
is a predator, and the Thamnosophis snake is a control, but it is not clear what the role of the
lamprophiid snake is, it is simply referred to as occurring in active nests. The key point, its
predation on the blindsnake, is not mentioned until the end of the abstract.
Thank you for your good advice. Although unknown species of blind snakes have been
obtained from a stomach of M. colubrinus at our study site (A. Mori 2012, unpublished data),
predation of our subject blind snake species, M. decorsei, by the snake-eating snake is yet
to be confirmed. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the
discriminatory capacity of ants and their responses to snake species exhibiting different
ecological interactions including predation or symbiosis. We proposed a potential mutualism
between the snake-eating snake and the ants. Our future study would investigate the
predation of M. decorsei by M. colubrinus and test whether the relationship between ants
and snakes in Madagascar represents mutualism or commensalism. To clarify it, we have
corrected abstract and introduction.
> In the introduction, it becomes clear that the lamprophiid snake’s role in the study is as a
contrasting predator of the first snake - but in this section the control snake is not mentioned at
all, making it hard to interpret the results and work out which comparisons are the important ones.
This just needs to be clearer.
We agree with you and have added the sentence “and Thamnosophis lateralis (a sympatric
frog-eating snake as control)” and removed relevant sentences from materials & methods.
See revised p. 5 lines 77-79 and p. 6 line 95-p. 7 line 99.
> Line 100. How was activity quantified? Or do you just mean the entrance to the nest was
recorded, i.e. video recorded? Please make this clearer
Because it is difficult to observe behaviour of all the ants, we only recorded and observed
the behaviour of ants within the field of view of this video camera. To clarify we have
added the sentence “We only observed the behaviour of ants within the field of view as it
would be a challenge to analyse the behavior of all ants”. See revised p. 7 lines 106-108.
> Lines 117-124. Was extraction from the videos performed blind to the hypothesis? behaviours
such as alertness and biting can be subjective to determine, risking unconscious observer bias if
the hypothesis is known. As the analysis was done from video data, there are no logistic
restrictions to prevent the data extraction being carried out blind to the identity of the snake, i.e.
by a person unfamiliar with the hypothesis of the experiment and the various snake species. If
the analysis has been performed blind, please add a note to this effect. If it has not been
performed blind, the authors should address this by providing more information about the
behavioural criteria used, and also discuss their effect sizes in the context of possible bias, or
they should reanalyse a subset of their videos blind to check for observer bias effects.
We agree with you and have added more precise definition of ants’ behaviour and
comments on the effect sizes in the context of possible bias. See revised p. 8 line 127-p.
9 line 134 and p. 11 lines 164-167.
> I’m 124. Was the baseline activity level taken into consideration in these models? Please add
a table of the model output.
We did not include the baseline activity to prevent the model becoming too complex. We
have added the table to show output of the model. See added table 1.
> Line 129. Number of ants doing what? Is this all the ants on screen?
We have changed the sentence “the number of all the ants on screen”. See revised p. 9
lines 141-142.
> The paper would also benefit from thorough proof-reading for grammar. For example, in the
first few lines of the abstract, line 17, "for" should read "of"; line 19 "worker's" should read "workers'
", line 22 "in" should read "on"; "termites" should read "termites' ", etc. I have not commented on
other typographical and grammatical errors throughout the text.
Thank you for your comments. We have made the corrections as suggested. The English
in this document has been checked by at least two professional editors, both native
speakers of English.
