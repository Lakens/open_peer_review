I reviewed this manuscript previously for Biology Letters, and I found it a bit data-light and the
claims of the paper not quite justified by the data. Although I still think it is a bit data-light, the
authors of the paper have qualified some of their earlier claims to the point where I think it is fine
to publish as is. I think it will be a useful contribution to the literature.

ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files

The study by Angelier et al. aims to test whether the corticosterone acute stress
ponse is predictive of the ability of rock pigeons to adjust to captivity. They found that birds
sferred to captivity had higher baseline corticosterone a day after initial capture. The most
resting finding was that stress-induced corticosterone levels at first capture were correlated
h body mass change and baseline corticosterone after a day of captivity. The writing is clear
hough I have listed a few minor grammatical errors below) and the statistical analyses are
erally appropriate.
neral comments
I like the idea of trying to find a measure that predicts how well an animal adjusts to
tivity, and I believe successfully find such a measure would be of interest to a range of
ogists. However, for multiple reasons I believe this aim is not reached with the present study
currently has limited applied benefits.
First, what the authors considered successfully (or unsuccessfully) adjusting to captivity
s poorly defined. The last sentence of the first paragraph gives the reader an idea, but it was
made clear whether these are what the authors considered, and none of these were
erved in the current study. The authors measured change in body mass over the first week
aptivity, but I am not convinced that this is the most salient proxy for adjusting to captivity.
eed, all birds gained weight within a week and none of the birds died, so it seems that all of
birds successfully adjusted. In other words, there was little variation in whether they
usted to captivity. A better test of the authors’ hypothesis would be to use a study system in
ch there is substantial variation in ability to adjust. I realize the ethical issues with studying
ether animals die, which is exactly why other measures of ability to adjust are required. For
mple, food intake, locomotor activity, or successfully breeding would be meaningful
asures of adjusting to captivity.
Second, as the authors state in line 42, it is crucial to assess the ability to adjust to
tivity before animals are brought into captivity. However, in the last paragraph of the
cussion the authors point out that it is simply not feasible to measure corticosterone this
ckly. Therefore, corticosterone fails as a measure of an animal’s ability to adjust to captivity
ore they are brought into captivity. This is not to say that measuring corticosterone has no
ue as a proxy of adjusting to captivity, but it fails to meet the author’s own goal of the study.
In my view, the authors’ conclusion (line 123) that the corticosterone response to a
ndardized stress protocol can be a reliable predictor of the ability of wild individuals to adjust
aptivity is unjustified by the findings of the current study. All the authors’ can really say with
se data is that the stress response predicts body mass loss a day after entering captivity.
s is an interesting finding, but it does not adequately address the goals of the study.
The authors seem to suggest (line 135) that the elevated baseline corticosterone after a
of captivity is due to the stress of being transferred to captivity. This conclusion is also
ustified given the study design. To make this claim, the study would also need a treatment
up of birds that were caught and sampled on day one, then released back into the wild and
aptured and sampled 24 hours later. Without such a group, the authors cannot rule out that
elvated baseline corticosterone 24 hours after transfer is simply a lag from the previous
’s stress.
or comments
e 38: replace ‘don’t’ with ‘do not’.
e 47: Should be ‘cope’, not ‘coping’.
e 72: Somewhere it should describe the number of males and females.
e 75: It is typical to measure a stress response over 30 minutes, not 60. I realize this is
inly convention, but the authors might consider describing in the supplementary materials
y they chose 60 minutes.
e 87: I realize that the authors cite a previous paper for the hormone assay methods, but
y should still briefly describe this method (in the supplementary materials would be fine).
o, more details of the methods in general should be provided in the supplementary materials.
e 103: I am not sure it is appropriate to perform post-hoc tests when there is not a significant
raction effect.
eneral suggestion: The authors might consider following the excellent advice of Donald
odsma when writing figure legends (Kroodsma 2000. A quick fix for figure legends and table
dings. Auk 117, 1081-1083). In my view, this slight modification to how figure legends are
ten make them vastly more readable and informative.
