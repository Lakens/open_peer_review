Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The authors investigated motor flexibility in pigeons and large-billed crows using experiments
where birds had food to retrieve with and without bill extension. Pigeons’ performance of food
acquisition dropped significantly after attachment of the bill extension and remained lower
throughout the testing period, with some implication of motor adjustment. Crows, on the other
hand, did not show sizeable effects of bill extension, except for the impaired performance right
after the attachment of the bill extension. While this study provides intriguing and valuable data
about motor control of birds, the manuscript requires some amendments before being suitable for
publication.
I have listed detailed comments below, but my main points are: (i) it was not entirely clear why
the authors chose pigeons and large-billed crows as the subjects; (ii) the relative size of the bill
extension appeared unfairly large in pigeons compared to crows; (iii) there was not data or
discussion about the effect of handling by experimenters; and (iv) the results could be discussed
in broader contexts.
Some of my comments are on stylistic issues, and I am happy for the authors to decide whether to
include my suggestions or not.
Abstract:
Line 32: It was felt a little too abrupt to bring out tool use in crows here. The previous sentence is
about grasping object, which all animals (incl. birds) do. Even limiting the topic to tool use for
foraging, there are also non-corvid avian tool users as the authors mention later in the main text.
Would it be possible to rephrase and broaden the example here?
L36: The authors could remove ‘without improvement’, as it is clear what they meant without
this part.
L37: The authors could remove ‘with the bill extension’, as it is clear what they meant without
this part.
L37-38: This sentence, particularly this part: ’the advancement of the bill grasping onset’, was
hard to understand. Could the authors rephrase it into something like ‘After the bill removal,
pigeons started bill grasping earlier, indicating motor adaptation to…’?
Background:
L78: There is no reference about woodpecker finches included in ref. 12-19, and papers cited seem
heavily skewed towards crow species. Also, is ref. 16 suitable here? There are some fantastic
work done about woodpecker finches by Sabina Tebbich and other people. Please cite
appropriate papers.
L87: ‘non-tool user’ -> ‘non-tool users’
L91-94: This is quite a long sentence and was difficult to follow. Perhaps the authors could
shorten some parts, or split this sentence into multiple sentences?
L95-96: It was not spelled out exactly why the authors chose to use pigeons and large-billed
crows (although implied throughout Background). I think it is important to be clear about this
and it would also help general discussion. Please clarify the reason why the authors chose these
species.
L100: ‘scenarios’ instead of ‘effects’? I am guessing that these three effects are not three
independent hypotheses, but that two extreme and an intermediate scenarios of the effect
spectrum. This is however a suggestion and I’m happy for the authors to decide.
Materials and methods
L138-140: Pigeons could have maximum of 10 pecking opportunities (10 seeds) per trial, but each
of these pecking opportunities slightly varied in terms of distance from the pigeon’s body. Was
3
there any effect of this, for instance between the closest and furthest seeds from the stop panel, on
pigeons’ performance and kinematics?
L158-161: Were 1-cm extension for pigeons and 2-cm extensions for crows equivalent in terms of
the relative size compared to the original bill lengths? In other words, was additional 1 cm in
pigeons not unfairly large compared to additional 2 cm in crows? In Figure 1c & d, it seems that
the bill extension was disproportionately larger in pigeons. Could the authors also present the
original bill lengths of the subjects?
Procedures and bill-attachment: It read that all of the subjects in both species went through the
bill attachment and the experiments (i.e., there were no subjects which had a sham treatment). I
wonder whether birds had any influence from being handled by humans for the bill-attachment
surgery, and if so, whether the degree of the effect differed between the two species (i.e., crows
were more tolerant with being handled by humans). Could the authors add any observation or
data to discuss this possibility?
L191-193: Did the authors check for overdispersion and the fit of the models? If not please do,
and if they did, please specify how and report the results.
L204-206: Did mean head-reaching velocity and acceleration have one value per one pecking
respectively? It read that there were one value per two frames of every pecking, and thus many
data points of the velocity and acceleration existed per pecking. Please rephrase.
L211-213: What was the random factor in these mixed models, and how was the fit of the models
examined?
L215-217: This sentence was hard to read. It could be rephrased, e.g., ‘…, since the velocity and
movement distance were correlated with each other, and this could result in unreliable
regression…’.
Results:
L227-228: Do ‘S’s stand for ‘sessions’? It would be easier to understand for readers if they were
clearly specified in the beginning. e.g., ’49 in S1’ -> ‘49 in session(S)1’
L242-243, 245 and 246-247: These parts were slightly confusing, as they seemingly contradicted
each other (‘motor learning did not occur’, ‘implicit motor learning’, and ‘pecking adaptation to
the bill extension was confirmed’). Although I understood after reading here a couple of times
that these parts were referring to different aspects of learning, could the authors rephrase and
clarify?
L258-260: This sentence was hard to understand. Split the sentence into two?
L275-276 (‘rapid adjustment of pecking…’): Could this be because the relative size of the bill
extension was smaller in crows compared to pigeons? Also see my comments in Methods and
Discussion.
L284: ‘fewer’ -> ‘less’, ‘weaker’ etc.
Discussion:
L298-329: The authors discussed the possibilities that between-species differences in motor
adjustment are due to (i) the task being easier in crows; and (ii) differences in pecking
experiences. If the effect of the bill extension is markedly different between crows and pigeons,
then the results can also be influenced, but this possibility was not mentioned. Could the authors
discuss this point?
L373-386: Generally, it was felt that the scope of discussion was quite narrow and there was little
discussion above and beyond motor control specifically in pigeons and crows. There are exciting
topics that could be discussed in relation to the results of this study. For instance, flexibility in
reaching and grasping moving targets is important for carnivorous species in general, and not
only tool-using species but most birds built nests by manipulating various objects including
twigs, grass leaves and artificial materials. In addition, the authors could also go back to
comparing dexterity between primates and birds, which might match nicely with the beginning
of the Background section. Please broaden the scope of discussion, particularly in the concluding
paragraph.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This study investigates the extent to which two avian species, a columbiform and a corvid, adjust
the kinematics of their pecking actions in response to the attachment of a bill extension. Results
suggest that crows are capable of more accurate adjustment than the pigeon. The manipulation is
a clever one, and to my knowledge, a rare attempt to investigate this aspect of motor flexibility.
The species difference is an interesting one and although the present study is limited to just two
species, I think the manipulation could be replicated easily in a large collection of species, making
it potentially an important contribution to the field.
On a less positive note, I feel the quality of the manuscript is far from that required for
publication. First, I am concerned by the difference in methodology in crow and pigeon testing, a
point on which I provide more detail below. Second, the analysis methods, results and figures are
so unclear that it is currently impossible to evaluate the validity of the data. Third, I think the
study rationale could really benefit from some up-front explanations as to what strategies the
birds could employ to compensate for an extended beak. At the moment, a reader unaccustomed
to analyzing the kinematics of body parts is left mostly to guess what sorts of dynamic
adjustments might improve pecking success. Fourth, it also seems to me that there is more
adjustment in pigeons during the bill extension phase than is described in the ms, but statistics on
this point are currently lacking. Fifth, It would be well worth linking differences in motor
flexibility to other research lines quantifying motor flexibility in columbiforms, passerines and
corvids (Griffin & Diquelou 2015 Animal Behaviour; Diquelou et al. 2015, Behavioural Ecology).
5
Lastly, the manuscript would benefit from a reading by a native English speaker to improve
prose in some places (e.g. L49).
All these issues would need to be addressed before the manuscript could be evaluated reliably.
Detailed comments are as follows:
L87: given that large-billed crows are non-tool users in the wild, this suggests that active role of
vision in flexible motor control has not evolved in response to the demands of tool use contrary to
the way the story seems to be unfolding in the introduction.
L119: I wonder whether it is not ethically questionable that wild captured birds, the size of crows,
should be held in cages 40 x 60 x 50 cm. More details are needed as to how long they were held in
such confined conditions and how often they were transferred to aviaries.
L131: it is currently not clear whether the birds are transferred to the experimental chamber to be
tested, how often they are transferred and the extent to which they feed in the non experimental
chamber. My understanding is that the birds feed both in the experimental chamber and in the
home cage, so experience with the extended beak is being gained outside the experimental
context; how was this experience equated across the two species? Details need to be provided and
differences and impacts discussed.
L136: in what way do they differ? Please provide more detail; the difference in testing
methodology needs to be justified much more strongly; for example, why was it not possible to
provide one food item to the pigeons, just like the crows? Why did the crows have to lean over an
obstacle when the pigeons could peck through a slit?
L139: unclear whether crows peck repeatedly at the piece of cheese or consume it in one go; is the
piece of cheese then replaced by an experimenter? How does this compare with the pecking
behaviour of the pigeon exposed to a line of foods? Does the pigeon raise its head fully between
each successive peck? Although I note that the authors argue in the discussion that species
differences found here are not attributable to differences in amount of experience and testing,
these are nevertheless important details which need to be, at the very least, thoroughly described
and justified. Why was it not possible to equate experience and testing methodology more
closely?
L147-52: much more detail is needed here as to the distribution of sessions across time. How
many days did it take to run 15/45 sessions? Were the birds placed back in their home cages and
free to feed (with the extended beak)? If pigeons peck numerous times during one trial, why then
did they not require fewer (rather than more) trials to reach 15 instances of pecking behaviour in
one trial than the crows who only pecked once during a trial?
L160: the percentage elongation is provided in a figure legend but also needs to be specified here.
L192: performance is measured as success, but is it not easier for crows because they have to aim
at the same location consistently, whereas pigeons have to move to a new spot as they move
along the array? Would it not have been more equivalent to make the crows peck at food items in
wells laid out the same way as for pigeons to make them also move horizontally or alternatively
to also provide one food item to pigeons?
L202: 20% of the maximum grasping aperture measured where? At the tip of the bill? Of the
extended beak or the real beak? Perhaps a diagram here would help the reader understand
exactly what was measured. This could replace the photos which are too dark to see properly; for
example, on my reproduction, I cannot see whether the crow’s eye is open or closed. A slowed
down video could be provided in the supp materials instead of the photos.
L210: please specify predictions more clearly: adapt to this temporal effect by doing what? This is
where a much more thorough description of how a bird can change the kinematics of its beak
movement to compensate for an elongated beak could be made.
L212: timing of the grasping onset: from the head being immobile? I presume this should state
dependent variable?
L230-237: does all this text refer to figure? Figure 3 is incomprehensible; the legend states it is a
depiction of movement trajectory, but what are the measurements on the x and y-axis? Please
describe in detail how this figure should be read as it is key to the paper’s conclusions.
6
L232: “no clear …representing overshot pecking: this sentence needs to be grammatically
modified to make clearer that birds that do not compensate by decreasing their grasping aperture
are overshooting. Personally, I think the use of ‘overshooting’ here to describe the fact that the
birds’ beak is too wide open to grasp the food at the point in time when contact would normally
occur is not ideal here. Overshooting means going past which is not really the case here.
L244: Although I can see in figure 4 that performance is decreased from S2 onwards relative to
the control phase, there seems to be some improvement from S3 onwards relative to S2. If this is
the case, then it seems misplaced to state that there was no improvement in performance, and
also contradictory to state that there was a decrease during removal, as there cannot be a decrease
if there was never any increase. Some sort of pairwise comparison is needed across sessions to
describe performance changes more accurately.
L250: am I correct in interpreting positive temporal delay as meaning that the time interval
between the head being in a fixed position and the point in time when it is at 20% of its maximum
aperture is longer? In any case, it would be helpful if the authors could explain in more detail
what positive temporal delay actually means in terms of the morphology of the peck. Given that
PSOS is a general readership journal, it seems fair to request this.
L256-260: “The temporally advancing… extension”: this sentence is incomprehensible. Please re-
write; running the ms past a native English speaker would help here I think.
L259_26): sentence difficult to understand.

Abstract:
Line 32: It was felt a little too abrupt to bring out tool use in crows here. The previous sentence is
about grasping object, which all animals (incl. birds) do. Even limiting the topic to tool use for
foraging, there are also non-corvid avian tool users as the authors mention later in the main text.
Would it be possible to rephrase and broaden the example here?
L36: The authors could remove ‘without improvement’, as it is clear what they meant without
this part.
L37: The authors could remove ‘with the bill extension’, as it is clear what they meant without
this part.
L37-38: This sentence, particularly this part: ’the advancement of the bill grasping onset’, was
hard to understand. Could the authors rephrase it into something like ‘After the bill removal,
pigeons started bill grasping earlier, indicating motor adaptation to…’?
Background:
L78: There is no reference about woodpecker finches included in ref. 12-19, and papers cited seem
heavily skewed towards crow species. Also, is ref. 16 suitable here? There are some fantastic
work done about woodpecker finches by Sabina Tebbich and other people. Please cite
appropriate papers.
L87: ‘non-tool user’ -> ‘non-tool users’
9
L91-94: This is quite a long sentence and was difficult to follow. Perhaps the authors could
shorten some parts, or split this sentence into multiple sentences?
L95-96: It was not spelled out exactly why the authors chose to use pigeons and large-billed
crows (although implied throughout Background). I think it is important to be clear about this
and it would also help general discussion. Please clarify the reason why the authors chose these
species.
L100: ‘scenarios’ instead of ‘effects’? I am guessing that these three effects are not three
independent hypotheses, but that two extreme and an intermediate scenarios of the effect
spectrum. This is however a suggestion and I’m happy for the authors to decide.
Materials and methods
L138-140: Pigeons could have maximum of 10 pecking opportunities (10 seeds) per trial, but each
of these pecking opportunities slightly varied in terms of distance from the pigeon’s body. Was
there any effect of this, for instance between the closest and furthest seeds from the stop panel, on
pigeons’ performance and kinematics?
L158-161: Were 1-cm extension for pigeons and 2-cm extensions for crows equivalent in terms of
the relative size compared to the original bill lengths? In other words, was additional 1 cm in
pigeons not unfairly large compared to additional 2 cm in crows? In Figure 1c & d, it seems that
the bill extension was disproportionately larger in pigeons. Could the authors also present the
original bill lengths of the subjects?
Procedures and bill-attachment: It read that all of the subjects in both species went through the
bill attachment and the experiments (i.e., there were no subjects which had a sham treatment). I
wonder whether birds had any influence from being handled by humans for the bill-attachment
surgery, and if so, whether the degree of the effect differed between the two species (i.e., crows
were more tolerant with being handled by humans). Could the authors add any observation or
data to discuss this possibility?
L191-193: Did the authors check for overdispersion and the fit of the models? If not please do,
and if they did, please specify how and report the results.
L204-206: Did mean head-reaching velocity and acceleration have one value per one pecking
respectively? It read that there were one value per two frames of every pecking, and thus many
data points of the velocity and acceleration existed per pecking. Please rephrase.
L211-213: What was the random factor in these mixed models, and how was the fit of the models
examined?
L215-217: This sentence was hard to read. It could be rephrased, e.g., ‘…, since the velocity and
movement distance were correlated with each other, and this could result in unreliable
regression…’.
Results:
L227-228: Do ‘S’s stand for ‘sessions’? It would be easier to understand for readers if they were
clearly specified in the beginning. e.g., ’49 in S1’ -> ‘49 in session(S)1’
L242-243, 245 and 246-247: These parts were slightly confusing, as they seemingly contradicted
each other (‘motor learning did not occur’, ‘implicit motor learning’, and ‘pecking adaptation to
the bill extension was confirmed’). Although I understood after reading here a couple of times
that these parts were referring to different aspects of learning, could the authors rephrase and
clarify?
L258-260: This sentence was hard to understand. Split the sentence into two?
L275-276 (‘rapid adjustment of pecking…’): Could this be because the relative size of the bill
extension was smaller in crows compared to pigeons? Also see my comments in Methods and
Discussion.
L284: ‘fewer’ -> ‘less’, ‘weaker’ etc.
Discussion:
L298-329: The authors discussed the possibilities that between-species differences in motor
adjustment are due to (i) the task being easier in crows; and (ii) differences in pecking
experiences. If the effect of the bill extension is markedly different between crows and pigeons,
10
then the results can also be influenced, but this possibility was not mentioned. Could the authors
discuss this point?
L373-386: Generally, it was felt that the scope of discussion was quite narrow and there was little
discussion above and beyond motor control specifically in pigeons and crows. There are exciting
topics that could be discussed in relation to the results of this study. For instance, flexibility in
reaching and grasping moving targets is important for carnivorous species in general, and not
only tool-using species but most birds built nests by manipulating various objects including
twigs, grass leaves and artificial materials. In addition, the authors could also go back to
comparing dexterity between primates and birds, which might match nicely with the beginning
of the Background section. Please broaden the scope of discussion, particularly in the concluding
paragraph.

This study investigates the extent to which two avian species, a columbiform and a corvid, adjust
the kinematics of their pecking actions in response to the attachment of a bill extension. Results
suggest that crows are capable of more accurate adjustment than the pigeon. The manipulation is
a clever one, and to my knowledge, a rare attempt to investigate this aspect of motor flexibility.
The species difference is an interesting one and although the present study is limited to just two

differences found here are not attributable to differences in amount of experience and testing,
these are nevertheless important details which need to be, at the very least, thoroughly described
and justified. Why was it not possible to equate experience and testing methodology more
closely?
L147-52: much more detail is needed here as to the distribution of sessions across time. How
many days did it take to run 15/45 sessions? Were the birds placed back in their home cages and
free to feed (with the extended beak)? If pigeons peck numerous times during one trial, why then
did they not require fewer (rather than more) trials to reach 15 instances of pecking behaviour in
one trial than the crows who only pecked once during a trial?
L160: the percentage elongation is provided in a figure legend but also needs to be specified here.
L192: performance is measured as success, but is it not easier for crows because they have to aim
at the same location consistently, whereas pigeons have to move to a new spot as they move
along the array? Would it not have been more equivalent to make the crows peck at food items in
wells laid out the same way as for pigeons to make them also move horizontally or alternatively
to also provide one food item to pigeons?
L202: 20% of the maximum grasping aperture measured where? At the tip of the bill? Of the
extended beak or the real beak? Perhaps a diagram here would help the reader understand
exactly what was measured. This could replace the photos which are too dark to see properly; for
example, on my reproduction, I cannot see whether the crow’s eye is open or closed. A slowed
down video could be provided in the supp materials instead of the photos.
L210: please specify predictions more clearly: adapt to this temporal effect by doing what? This is
where a much more thorough description of how a bird can change the kinematics of its beak
movement to compensate for an elongated beak could be made.
L212: timing of the grasping onset: from the head being immobile? I presume this should state
dependent variable?
L230-237: does all this text refer to figure? Figure 3 is incomprehensible; the legend states it is a
depiction of movement trajectory, but what are the measurements on the x and y-axis? Please
describe in detail how this figure should be read as it is key to the paper’s conclusions.
L232: “no clear …representing overshot pecking: this sentence needs to be grammatically
modified to make clearer that birds that do not compensate by decreasing their grasping aperture
are overshooting. Personally, I think the use of ‘overshooting’ here to describe the fact that the
birds’ beak is too wide open to grasp the food at the point in time when contact would normally
occur is not ideal here. Overshooting means going past which is not really the case here.
L244: Although I can see in figure 4 that performance is decreased from S2 onwards relative to
the control phase, there seems to be some improvement from S3 onwards relative to S2. If this is
the case, then it seems misplaced to state that there was no improvement in performance, and
also contradictory to state that there was a decrease during removal, as there cannot be a decrease
if there was never any increase. Some sort of pairwise comparison is needed across sessions to
describe performance changes more accurately.
12
L250: am I correct in interpreting positive temporal delay as meaning that the time interval
between the head being in a fixed position and the point in time when it is at 20% of its maximum
aperture is longer? In any case, it would be helpful if the authors could explain in more detail
what positive temporal delay actually means in terms of the morphology of the peck. Given that
PSOS is a general readership journal, it seems fair to request this.
L256-260: “The temporally advancing… extension”: this sentence is incomprehensible. Please re-
write; running the ms past a native English speaker would help here I think.
L259_26): sentence difficult to understand.

authors investigated motor flexibility in pigeons and large-billed crows using experiments where birds had food to
eve with and without bill extension. Pigeons’ performance of food acquisition dropped significantly after
chment of the bill extension and remained lower throughout the testing period, with some implication of motor
stment. Crows, on the other hand, did not show sizeable effects of bill extension, except for the impaired
ormance right after the attachment of the bill extension. While this study provides intriguing and valuable data
ut motor control of birds, the manuscript requires some amendments before being suitable for publication.
I have listed detailed comments below, but my main points are: (i) it was not entirely clear why the authors chose
ons and large-billed crows as the subjects; (ii) the relative size of the bill extension appeared unfairly large in
ons compared to crows; (iii) there was not data or discussion about the effect of handling by experimenters; and
the results could be discussed in broader contexts.
We appreciate the reviewer’s positive evaluation and instructive suggestions. We revised the entire manuscript
cordingly. In the following paragraphs, we will describe the revisions we made, and the reasoning underlying them.
ract:
32: It was felt a little too abrupt to bring out tool use in crows here. The previous sentence is about grasping object,
ch all animals (incl. birds) do. Even limiting the topic to tool use for foraging, there are also non-corvid avian tool
s as the authors mention later in the main text. Would it be possible to rephrase and broaden the example here?
We agree with this suggestion and revised the abstract to broaden the example with such as crows and finches as
llows:
evised MS, L32:
milar capacities have evolved in birds, such as tool-use in corvids and finches, which represent…
: The authors could remove ‘without improvement’, as it is clear what they meant without this part.
Corrected as suggested.
: The authors could remove ‘with the bill extension’, as it is clear what they meant without this part.
Corrected as suggested.
-38: This sentence, particularly this part: ’the advancement of the bill grasping onset’, was hard to understand.
ld the authors rephrase it into something like ‘After the bill removal, pigeons started bill grasping earlier,
cating motor adaptation to…’?
Corrected as suggested.
kground:
: There is no reference about woodpecker finches included in ref. 12-19, and papers cited seem heavily skewed
ards crow species. Also, is ref. 16 suitable here? There are some fantastic work done about woodpecker finches by
na Tebbich and other people. Please cite appropriate papers.
Appropriate studies of woodpecker finches were cited and the reference 16 was removed.
: ‘non-tool user’ -> ‘non-tool users’
Corrected as suggested.
-94: This is quite a long sentence and was difficult to follow. Perhaps the authors could shorten some parts, or split
sentence into multiple sentences?
Corrected as follows;
evised MS, L92-:
ese recent studies in birds suggested that head reaching and bill grasping as a basis for motor control of extended
dy parts are not feedforwardly controlled, but are more flexible than previously documented in research primarily
ing pigeons.
-96: It was not spelled out exactly why the authors chose to use pigeons and large-billed crows (although implied
ughout Background). I think it is important to be clear about this and it would also help general discussion. Please
ify the reason why the authors chose these species.
.Visual blocking with an opaque shield to occlude the tool tip and target food during manipulation deviated the tool
anipulation trajectory from that without visual blocking, suggesting the contribution of vision to on-going tool
anipulation. These recent studies in birds suggested that head reaching and bill grasping as a basis for motor control
extended body parts are not feedforwardly controlled, but are more flexible than previously documented in research
imarily using pigeons. However, to our knowledge, no empirical study has tested the flexibility of reaching-based
cking control with extended body parts in birds.
To bridge our understanding of flexible pecking control for dextrous foraging skills at the mechanism level in
rds, we investigated motor adjustment ability of pecking with artificially extended bills. In this study, we tested
ows, in which flexible foraging skills have been documented in the wild and experimental settings [13, 14, 16–18,
, 24], compared with pigeons, in which sensorimotor mechanisms for pecking have been extensively studied
evious research [5–11]. For these two species, the effects of attaching and removing the bill extension were
amined in terms of the success rate and kinematics….
0: ‘scenarios’ instead of ‘effects’? I am guessing that these three effects are not three independent hypotheses, but
two extreme and an intermediate scenarios of the effect spectrum. This is however a suggestion and I’m happy for
authors to decide.
Exactly. We realized that these three effects were extreme cases, but could be a continuum of phenomena at the level
the sensorimotor mechanism. However, for non-expert readers in the motor-control field of study, it might be better
re to state the expected effects as slightly extreme cases as we described in the previous manuscript. Although we
preciate and completely agree with this suggestion, we would like to keep the referenced sentences as they were.
erials and methods:
8-140: Pigeons could have maximum of 10 pecking opportunities (10 seeds) per trial, but each of these pecking
ortunities slightly varied in terms of distance from the pigeon’s body. Was there any effect of this, for instance
een the closest and furthest seeds from the stop panel, on pigeons’ performance and kinematics?
To examine the effect of the distance of a pigeon’s body to the target of pecking, we needed to video-track the basal
rt of the neck to measure the distance to the target seed because this part is the anchor point of the necking-reaching
ovement. However, video-tracking this part was quite difficult because of the feathers. Therefore, we could not
ictly examine the effect of distance of the pigeon’s body to the target. Instead, as suggested by reviewer-1 (as well
reviwer-2), we examined the effects of the target seed position and also the order in a series of pecking on both
rformance and kinematics using mixed model analyses with the data from the control phase and found no
nificant effect of these factors on either performance or kinematics. The statistical tests allowed us to treat each
cking instance in a series of pecks as independent events. To state that these potential factors had no effect on the
rformance and kinematics for readers, we added a new paragraph to justify why we treated each pecking instance as
independent event based on statistical results as follows:
evised MS, L268-:
To verify whether pecking performance and kinematics could be influenced by the position of target and order of
cks in a series at an array of seeds, mixed model analyses were employed for normal pecking behaviour using the
ta from the control phase. For pecking performance, we executed a binomial mixed-model analysis that included
asping success (i.e. success or failure for each peck) as the dependent variable, ‘target position’, ‘order’ in a series
pecks, and their interaction as independent variables, and individual as a random factor. The output of model
alysis revealed no significant effect of any independent variable (target position, <U+03C7>²(1) = 0.01, p = 0.91, ns; number,
1) = 0.07, p = 0.79, ns; target position × number, <U+03C7>²(1) = 2.07, p = 0.15, ns; Figure S2), indicating no effect of the
sition of the target or the order of pecks in a series on performance. For grasping onset of pecking kinematics, we
ecuted a linear mixed-model analysis that included grasping onset as the dependent variable, target position, order
pecks in a series, and their interaction as the independent variables, and individual as a random factor. The output
the model analysis failed to reveal significant effects of any independent variable (position, <U+03C7>²(1) = 0.03, p = 0.99,
; number, <U+03C7>²(1) = 0.09, p = 0.76, ns; position ×number, <U+03C7>²(1) = 0.02, p = 0.88, ns; Figure 3S a, b). In addition, a
milar mixed-model analysis was conducted for the movement distance but, again, there were no effects of any
dependent variable (target position, <U+03C7>²(1) = 1.55, p = 0.21, ns; pecking order <U+03C7>²(1) = 1.95, p = 0.16, ns; target
sition × pecking order = 0.0001, p = 0.99, ns; Figure 3S c, d). These statistical results indicated no effect for the
der and target position factors of successive pecks on both grasping onset and movement distance for each peck.
8-161: Were 1-cm extension for pigeons and 2-cm extensions for crows equivalent in terms of the relative size
pared to the original bill lengths? In other words, was additional 1 cm in pigeons not unfairly large compared to
tional 2 cm in crows? In Figure 1c & d, it seems that the bill extension was disproportionately larger in pigeons.
ld the authors also present the original bill lengths of the subjects?
As suggested by the reviewer, the relative size of bill extension was slightly longer in pigeons than in crows.
ecifically, the mean bill-extension length relative to the original one was 1.45 for pigeons and 1.31 for crow. We
lieve that this 10% difference in the relative bill-extension length between the two species was not crucial and did
t solely cause the behavioural differences because the bill extension actually produced immediate deterioration in
cking (i.e. S1) in both pigeons and crows. Thus, the difference of the relative bill-extension length alone cannot
plain the present results. However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the difference in the relative
l-extension length had effects on pecking differentially between pigeons and crows. Thus, we additionally
scussed this possibility in the Discussion of the revised MS:
evised MS, L174-:
ith this attachment, bills were extended approximately 1 and 2 cm past the original bill length of pigeons (mean ±
M = 2.3 ± 0.1 cm) and crows (6.5 ± 0.1 cm), respectively. Thus, the mean (± SEM) relative length of bill-extension
the original bill was 1.43 ± 0.02 and 1.31 ± 0.01 for pigeons and crows, respectively.
evised MS, L391-:
The contrasting performance in pecking adjustment to bill extensions between pigeons and crows could be
plained by the difference in the bill-extension lengths. The bill-extension lengths relative to the original bills of
geons were slightly longer than those of crows. Longer bill-extensions for the pigeons might have been responsible
r their poorer pecking adjustment to the extended bills in comparison to that of crows. However, immediately after
e bill extension in S1, pecking performance significantly deteriorated in both pigeons and crows. This indicated that
e bill extension was effective in pecking control not only in pigeons but also in crows. In addition, if differences of
e bill extension length primarily influenced pecking adjustment to the extended bill, then pecking performance and
nematics would not be in contrast as they were in the present results, but rather would be quantitatively different
tween pigeons and crows. Specifically, pecking performance of pigeons would be improved through the number of
cking experiences, which was higher for pigeons that pecked arrays of seeds than for crows that pecked small
eces of cheese in our experimental setting. Nevertheless, no clear improvement occurred in pecking performance in
geons in contrast to the rapid improvement of crows. Although there was a small effect caused by the difference of
ative bill-extension lengths between pigeons and crows on pecking, it is unlikely that such difference primarily
used the contrasting results of motor adaptation between the two species.
cedures and bill-attachment:
ad that all of the subjects in both species went through the bill attachment and the experiments (i.e., there were no
ects which had a sham treatment). I wonder whether birds had any influence from being handled by humans for the
attachment surgery, and if so, whether the degree of the effect differed between the two species (i.e., crows were
e tolerant with being handled by humans). Could the authors add any observation or data to discuss this
ibility?
None of the pigeons and crows showed any disturbance in general behaviour after surgery, but respond in the
perimental session. We added a sentence to note there was no disturbance of general behaviour in both pigeons and
ows following the surgery and our handling in the Procedure as follows:
evised MS, L197--:
is note that both pigeons and crows exhibited the response in the experimental session after the surgery without any
sturbance of general behaviour, such as nonspecific effects caused by the handling and surgery per se.
1-193: Did the authors check for overdispersion and the fit of the models? If not please do, and if they did, please
ify how and report the results.
Dispersion parameters (= residual values divided by residual degrees of freedom) was checked for overdispersion of
e model, but not reported in the previous MS. Our model fit was not overdispersed, but moderate. We added the
ethod and results of testing for overdispersion with an additional reference in the revised MS as follows:
evised MS, L217-:
verdispersion of the model was checked by a dispersion parameter, which was defined as the residual divided by the
ixed model analyses on success rate revealed the significant effect on the session variable (<U+03C7>²(7) = 189.41, p < .001,
erdispersion parameter = 1.26).
evised MS, L334-:
ixed model analyses exhibited the significant effect of the phase variable (<U+03C7>²(7) = 53.52, p < .001, overdispersion
rameter = 1.10).
4-206: Did mean head-reaching velocity and acceleration have one value per one pecking respectively? It read that
e were one value per two frames of every pecking, and thus many data points of the velocity and acceleration
ted per pecking. Please rephrase.
The suggested sentences were revised as follows:
evised MS, L226-:
ean head-reaching velocity was calculated as the average of instantaneous velocities, each of which was calculated
two subsequent frames, from head fixation to grasping onset in each pecking event. Mean head-reaching
celeration was calculated as the average of instantaneous acceleration, each of which was calculated by two
bsequent velocities, from fixation to grasping onset in each pecking event.
1-213: What was the random factor in these mixed models, and how was the fit of the models examined?
‘Individual’ was the random factor in our model. The goodness of fit of our linear models was assessed by the
efficient of determination, R². Specifically, marginal R² for the fixed effect was 0.852 and 0.67 for pigeons and
ows, respectively. Conditional R² for considering both the fixed and random effects was 0.853 and 0.77 for pigeons
d crows, respectively. In the revised MS, we added the methods of R² and the statistical values of R² as follows:
evised MS, L238-:
we executed linear mixed models, which consisted of the timing of grasping onset from head fixation as a
pendent variable, the experimental phase, movement distance, and mean acceleration as explanatory variables, and
dividuals as a random factor, for each species.
evised MS, L246-:
the experimental phases. The goodness of fit of the linear model was accessed by marginal and conditional R²
lues. All of these analyses were performed using R 3.1.2. [26] with packages ‘lme4’ for the linear mixed model [27],
ar’ for the likelihood ratio test [28], and ‘MuMIn’ for marginal and conditional R² values [29, 30].
evised MS, L297-:
near mixed-model analysis for grasping onset (marginal R²=.85, conditional R²=.85) revealed significant effects of
e phase (<U+03C7>²(7) = 2927.26, p < .001), movement distance (<U+03C7>²(1) = 1991.59, p < .001), and mean acceleration (<U+03C7>²(1) =
42.40, p < .001).
evised MS, L334-:
ixed model analyses (marginal R² = 0.67, conditional R² = 0.77) revealed the significant effect of the phase variable
(7) = 53.52, p < 0.001, overdispersion parameter = 1.10).

5-217: This sentence was hard to read. It could be rephrased, e.g., ‘…, since the velocity and movement distance
e correlated with each other, and this could result in unreliable regression…’.
Corrected as suggested.

ch other, and unreliable regression results could occur if we used both parameters in the analysis of one model
igure S1). ….

nning. e.g., ’49 in S1’ -> ‘49 in session(S)1’
2-243, 245 and 246-247: These parts were slightly confusing, as they seemingly contradicted each other (‘motor
ning did not occur’, ‘implicit motor learning’, and ‘pecking adaptation to the bill extension was confirmed’).
ough I understood after reading here a couple of times that these parts were referring to different aspects of
ning, could the authors rephrase and clarify?
Sentences were revised to discriminatively state (1) the absence of improvement at the performance level and (2)

indicating that no improvement of pecking success occurred at the performance level during the bill extension
ssions. Interestingly, poor pecking performance continued immediately after the removal of the bill extension,
pporting the possibility that a motor adaptation to the bill extension implicitly occurred during the bill-extension
ssions.
At the kinematic level, pecking motor adaptation to the extended bill was confirmed because the effects on
asping onset continued across the sessions….

We corrected to shorten the suggested sentence as follows:

the follow-up phase, indicating the grasping onset was recovered to the normal after a-week experience with normal
l.
5-276 (‘rapid adjustment of pecking…’): Could this be because the relative size of the bill extension was smaller in
s compared to pigeons? Also see my comments in Methods and Discussion.
Similar to our comments above, the difference of the relative bill-extension lengths to the original bills was not great
tween pigeons and crows. Thus, we believe that the difference of the relative bill-extension length alone could not
use such contrasting results in both pecking performance and kinematics between the two species. However, we
nnot completely discard the possibility that the difference in the relative bill-extension length might influence
cking disproportionately between the two species. Thus, we added a new paragraph to discuss the suggested
ssibility in the Discussion of the revised MS as follows:
evised MS, L392-:
The contrasting performance in pecking adjustment to bill extensions between pigeons and crows could be
plained by the difference in the bill-extension lengths. The bill-extension lengths relative to the original bills of
geons were slightly longer than those of crows. Longer bill-extensions for the pigeons might have been responsible
r their poorer pecking adjustment to the extended bills in comparison to that of crows. However, immediately after
e bill extension in S1, pecking performance significantly deteriorated in both pigeons and crows. This indicated that
e bill extension was effective in pecking control not only in pigeons but also in crows. In addition, if differences of
e bill extension length primarily influenced pecking adjustment to the extended bill, then pecking performance and
nematics would not be in contrast as they were in the present results, but rather would be quantitatively different
tween pigeons and crows. Specifically, pecking performance of pigeons would be improved through the number of
cking experiences, which was higher for pigeons that pecked arrays of seeds than for crows that pecked small
eces of cheese in our experimental setting. Nevertheless, no clear improvement occurred in pecking performance in
geons in contrast to the rapid improvement of crows. Although there was a small effect caused by the difference of
ative bill-extension lengths between pigeons and crows on pecking, it is unlikely that such difference primarily
used the contrasting results of motor adaptation between the two species.

Corrected as suggested.
ussion:
8-329: The authors discussed the possibilities that between-species differences in motor adjustment are due to (i)
ask being easier in crows; and (ii) differences in pecking experiences. If the effect of the bill extension is markedly
rent between crows and pigeons, then the results can also be influenced, but this possibility was not mentioned.
ld the authors discuss this point?

3-386: Generally, it was felt that the scope of discussion was quite narrow and there was little discussion above and
nd motor control specifically in pigeons and crows. There are exciting topics that could be discussed in relation to
results of this study. For instance, flexibility in reaching and grasping moving targets is important for carnivorous
ies in general, and not only tool-using species but most birds built nests by manipulating various objects including
s, grass leaves and artificial materials. In addition, the authors could also go back to comparing dexterity between
ates and birds, which might match nicely with the beginning of the Background section. Please broaden the scope
iscussion, particularly in the concluding paragraph.
We thoroughly revised the last paragraph in the Discussion to provide a wilder scope with additional references
rresponding to the first part of the Introduction as follows.
evised MS, L472-:
In conclusion, our present study revealed that crows are capable of rapid motor adjustment of pecking to
l-extension, but pigeons are not, although they possessed plasticity in a form of motor adaptation. These contrasting
sults of sensorimotor flexibility to body-part extension suggest different mechanisms underpinning pecking control
tween pigeons and crows: feedforward and offline feedback control in pigeons and, presumably, online feedback
ntrol in crows. These differences in pecking control mechanisms might be related to their foraging behaviour. Less
astic pecking in pigeons is optimal and even efficient to feed on static seeds and grains on the ground. On the other
nd, flexible head-reaching and bill-grasping in crows might be crucial for omnivorous/carnivorous foraging to catch
oving targets, such as insects and small vertebrates. Similar motor flexibility of omnivorous/carnivorous birds was
ported in Australian ravens (C. coronoides), compared to pigeons and small passerines, in a recent study, suggesting
e close relevance of motor flexibility to innovative foraging behaviour [24]. Similar relationships between flexible
otor control and innovative foraging behaviour might be applicable in omnivorous/carnivorous mammals [33],
rticularly in tool use of human and non-human primates [4, 34, 35]. However, there is the possibility that the
xible motor control in birds might be associated, at ultimate mechanism level, with nest building [36, 37].
oximate mechanisms of sensorimotor flexibility for dextrous motor control such as seen in crows are still open to
estions. The sensory feedback signals and how they operate in online control, such fast reaching within 100-150 ms
crows, require investigation. Also, it is necessary to investigate what “body schema [34]” is represented and
corporated to the extended bill in the large multisensory pallium of crows [38, 39]. These lines of future
ychophysical and neurophysiological studies would be needed to understand the different or similar mechanisms
derlying the analogously dextrous foraging skills, such as tool use, between the animals with different body
uctures.

study investigates the extent to which two avian species, a columbiform and a corvid, adjust the kinematics of their
ing actions in response to the attachment of a bill extension. Results suggest that crows are capable of more
rate adjustment than the pigeon. The manipulation is a clever one, and to my knowledge, a rare attempt to
stigate this aspect of motor flexibility. The species difference is an interesting one and although the present study is
ted to just two species, I think the manipulation could be replicated easily in a large collection of species, making it
ntially an important contribution to the field.
We appreciate the reviewer’s understanding and positive evaluation of our study.
a less positive note, I feel the quality of the manuscript is far from that required for publication. First, I am
cerned by the difference in methodology in crow and pigeon testing, a point on which I provide more detail below.
nd, the analysis methods, results and figures are so unclear that it is currently impossible to evaluate the validity of
data. Third, I think the study rationale could really benefit from some up-front explanations as to what strategies the
s could employ to compensate for an extended beak. At the moment, a reader unaccustomed to analyzing the
matics of body parts is left mostly to guess what sorts of dynamic adjustments might improve pecking success.
rth, it also seems to me that there is more adjustment in pigeons during the bill extension phase than is described in
ms, but statistics on this point are currently lacking. Fifth, it would be well worth linking differences in motor
bility to other research lines quantifying motor flexibility in columbiforms, passerines and corvids (Griffin &
uelou 2015 Animal Behaviour; Diquelou et al. 2015, Behavioural Ecology). Lastly, the manuscript would benefit
a reading by a native English speaker to improve prose in some places (e.g. L49).
hese issues would need to be addressed before the manuscript could be evaluated reliably.
We appreciate the reviewer’s detailed and instructive suggestions. The manuscript was completely revised to
dress the reviewer’s suggestions. Revision details will be described in the following paragraphs.
: given that large-billed crows are non-tool users in the wild, this suggests that active role of vision in flexible motor
rol has not evolved in response to the demands of tool use contrary to the way the story seems to be unfolding in the
oduction.
This reviewer’s comment is correct. Revisions were made to replace the finding of visual contribution to tool use in
n-tool-using crows in the context of dextrous skills in foraging behaviour in the revised MS as follows:
evised MS, L85-:
The active role of vision in flexible motor control based on head-reaching and bill-grasping components was also
ggested in trained tool-using behaviour by large-billed crows (C. macrorhynchos), which are generalist
nivorous/carnivorous foragers, but non-tool users in the wild [23]. In this study, the crows were trained to
anipulate an L-shaped rake tool by bill holding it to retrieve a food item on a table, and then tested for the effect of
sual blocking on tool-use trajectory during tool manipulation. Visual blocking with an opaque shield to occlude the
ol tip and target food during manipulation deviated the tool manipulation trajectory from that without visual
ocking, suggesting the contribution of vision to on-going tool manipulation. These recent studies in birds suggested
at head reaching and bill grasping as a basis for motor control of extended body parts are not feedforwardly
ntrolled, but are more flexible than previously documented in research primarily using pigeons. However, to our
owledge, no empirical study has tested the flexibility of reaching-based pecking control with extended body parts in
rds.
To bridge our understanding of flexible pecking control for dextrous foraging skills at the mechanism level in
rds, we investigated motor adjustment ability of pecking with artificially extended bills. In this study, we tested
ows, in which flexible foraging skills have been documented in the wild and experimental settings [13, 14, 16–18,
, 24], compared with pigeons, in which sensorimotor mechanisms for pecking have been extensively studied
evious research [5–11]….
9: I wonder whether it is not ethically questionable that wild captured birds, the size of crows, should be held in
es 40 x 60 x 50 cm. More details are needed as to how long they were held in such confined conditions and how
n they were transferred to aviaries.
Details of animal housing conditions were added in the revised MS as follows:
evised MS, L120-:
geons and crows were kept in different rooms and housed individually in stainless steel-mesh home cages (W 35 cm
D 30 cm ×H 35 cm for pigeons, W 43 cm × D 60 cm ×H 50 cm for crows) for approximately 1 month for the
riod, crows were regularly transferred into an outdoor aviary (1.5 m × 2.8 m × H 1.7 m) for bathing and direct
cial interactions with other conspecifics, but without feeding there, for 2-3 hrs after these daily sessions. After the
d of the experiment, birds were transferred back to relatively-large outdoor aviaries for group housing (3 m² × H 1.5
for pigeons, 100 m² × H 5 m for crows) and used for other behavioural studies.
1: it is currently not clear whether the birds are transferred to the experimental chamber to be tested, how often they
transferred and the extent to which they feed in the non experimental chamber. My understanding is that the birds
both in the experimental chamber and in the home cage, so experience with the extended beak is being gained
ide the experimental context; how was this experience equated across the two species? Details need to be provided
differences and impacts discussed.
We conducted one session (i.e. 50 trials for pigeons and 15 trials for crows) per day across 21 successive days. After
ily sessions, the crows were transferred to the outdoor aviary for bathing and social interactions, but were not fed
ere. Feeding outside the experimental situation was allowed only in the home cage for both pigeons and crows.
od in metal cups was provided with free access until 3 hrs before the next session. We could not completely remove
e possibility of the influence of experiences outside the experiment in the home cage, such as feeding from
od-filled cups, on the use of the bill extension because there were many uncontrollable factors causing individual
d species differences in the amount of bill-use experience. However, feeding from food-filled cups is very easy for
th pigeons and crows, and allowed them to ingest foods with no fine bill-grasping at a specific target necessary, just
erely bill-opening into the cups was enough to take food into the mouth without fine skills. Indeed, both pigeons and
ows consumed foods without any difficulties from the cups, irrespectively of the bill extension. We agree with the
ggestion to discuss the potential effects of experience outside the experimental situation. Thus, we added a new
ragraph to discuss this point in the Discussion of the revised MS as follows:
evised MS, L407-:
Pecking experiences outside the experimental situation, such as feeding in home cages were unlikely to cause
ntrasting results between pigeons and crows. Both pigeons and crows were allowed to feed from cups filled with
ods in their home cages. Feeding from food-filled cups was easy for both pigeons and crows even with bill
tensions, because no accurate control of pecking at a specific target, such as occurred in the experiment, was
cessary to ingest foods, but rather just the bill-opening action into the cups was sufficient to take foods into the
outh. Indeed, both pigeons and crows were observed to ingest foods from the cups without any difficulty,
espectively of the bill extension. Thus, feeding in the home cages did not cause critical differences of bill-use
periences that could explain the contrasting results between pigeons and crows.
6: in what way do they differ? Please provide more detail; the difference in testing methodology needs to be justified
h more strongly; for example, why was it not possible to provide one food item to the pigeons, just like the crows?
did the crows have to lean over an obstacle when the pigeons could peck through a slit?
9: unclear whether crows peck repeatedly at the piece of cheese or consume it in one go; is the piece of cheese then
aced by an experimenter? How does this compare with the pecking behaviour of the pigeon exposed to a line of
s? Does the pigeon raise its head fully between each successive peck? Although I note that the authors argue in the
ussion that species differences found here are not attributable to differences in amount of experience and testing,
e are nevertheless important details which need to be, at the very least, thoroughly described and justified. Why was
t possible to equate experience and testing methodology more closely?
Both the comments on L136 and L139 are in regard to the comparability of the data between pigeons and crows
cause of different methodology. We responsed to both comments together here. The suggested concerns include four
ints; [1] difference of apparatus (i.e. stop panel), [2] difference in food presentation and pecking patterns [3] data
mparability between the instances of successive pecks in pigeons and between those in pigeons and crows, and [4]
fference in the level of pecking experiences.
] Difference of apparatus (i.e. stop panel):
e different design of the stop panel between pigeons and crows was to facilitate their pecking along the comparable
rved-movement trajectory. When we tried to use the slit-open panel for crows, they exhibited pecking straightway
ong the floor to the target through the slit. We used the non-open panel for crows to prevent pecking with such
aight-line trajectory and to facilitate pecking with a curved trajectory by leaning over the panel. For pigeons, as
scribed in the previous MS (L.134-), we used the slit-open panel to allow pecking the seeds while blocking the body,
evised MS, L141-:
e stop panel for pigeons had a 4.5-cm gap in which pigeons could peck seeds on the table through this opening
hile keeping their body in front of the table (Figure 1a). The panel for crows was closed and 8-cm high, to prevent
ow from pecking straightway along the floor to the target and to facilitate their pecking over the panel along the
rved trajectory comparable to the pecking of pigeons (Figure 1b).
] Difference in food presentation way and pecking patterns:
e different methods of food presentation between pigeons and crows were designed to analyse natural pecking
haviour due to the difficulty in experimentally manipulating pigeons and crows to show a similar pattern of pecking.
is difficulty could be derived from potential constrains of spices-specific pecking patterns in natural feeding, such
successive pecks in pigeons and shingle-shot pecks in crows. Large-billed crows used in this study, unlike typical
ows with ground-probe feeding in Europe and the U.S. (e.g. Corvus corone) are more like common ravens, and
pically exhibit single-shot pecking to catch moving targets, such as flying insects and small vertebrates in the wild.
ch pecking patterns of large-bill crows could prevent them from successive pecking to catch a target. Although we
esented multiple pieces of cheese to crows in pilot attempts, they did not exhibit successive pecks like pigeons, but
gle-shot pecks with relatively long intervals of a few seconds or more. On the other hand, when we presented one
ed to pigeons, they still sometimes showed successive pecks to ingest the single item. This means that even if one
ed was presented for pigeons in every trial, a certain proportion of the data would still contaminate successive pecks.
sed on the difficulty of experimental manipulation, we changed the strategy to compare the data not based on the
milarity of behavioural patterns, but on movement kinematics. Our study employed a way to present multiple seeds
an array, despite that they exhibited sequential pecks incomparably to crows at the level of behavioural patterns.
owever, this strategy required us to clarify the comparability of the data from the different pecking patterns. Such
arification was insufficient in the previous MS, and thus we have clarified this point. Revisions were made to clarify
e method of food presentation in relation to specific pecking patterns in natural feeding of each species as follows:
evised MS, L147-:
ven the different behavioural patterns of pecking under natural feeding situations, food used as pecking targets was
esented on the table in different ways to pigeons and crows in each trial. For pigeons, which typically exhibit
quential pecking of seeds and grains scattered on the ground, an array of 10 hempseeds was presented at 10 specific
sitions in a line with 1-cm intervals (Figure 1c and Movie S1). For crows, which typically exhibit non-sequential
gle-shot pecking at a target, a small piece of cheese (ca. <1 cm sphere) was presented 10 cm front of the stop panel
d on the tip of a metal wire to lift it 1 cm above the table (Figure 1b and Movie S2).
] Comparability of peck data:
the reviewer pointed out, head raises of successive pecks were varied as represented by the variation in the
ovement distance (Figure 6 in the previous MS). Such variations from successive pecks might include the
er-relevance of sequential pecks, which violated comparing successive pecks as independent instances. To clarify
e independence of successive pecks, we examined the effect of successive pecks on the kinematic parameters using
xed model analyses. Specifically, we tested the effects of the order of pecks and also the target position on
nematic parameters, such as movement distance and grasping onset. The analysis revealed no significant effects for
e order of pecks or the target position on both kinematic parameters, indicating that successive pecks were
dependent instances in our pigeon data. This clarification of data independence between successive pecks in pigeons
rther supported their comparability to single-shot pecks in crows, despite the different apparatus and behavioural
tterns. A new paragraph for this clarification using statistical analyses was added in the Results as follows:
evised MS, L268-:
To verify whether pecking performance and kinematics could be influenced by the position of target and order of
cks in a series at an array of seeds, mixed model analyses were employed for normal pecking behaviour using the
ta from the control phase. For pecking performance, we executed a binomial mixed-model analysis that included
asping success (i.e. success or failure for each peck) as the dependent variable, ‘target position’, ‘order’ in a series
pecks, and their interaction as independent variables, and individual as a random factor. The output of model
alysis revealed no significant effect of any independent variable (target position, <U+03C7>²(1) = 0.01, p = 0.91, ns; number,
1) = 0.07, p = 0.79, ns; target position × number, <U+03C7>²(1) = 2.07, p = 0.15, ns; Figure S2), indicating no effect of the
sition of the target or the order of pecks in a series on performance. For grasping onset of pecking kinematics, we
ecuted a linear mixed-model analysis that included grasping onset as the dependent variable, target position, order
pecks in a series, and their interaction as the independent variables, and individual as a random factor. The output
milar mixed-model analysis was conducted for the movement distance but, again, there were no effects of any
dependent variable (target position, <U+03C7>²(1) = 1.55, p = 0.21, ns; pecking order <U+03C7>²(1) = 1.95, p = 0.16, ns; target
sition × pecking order = 0.0001, p = 0.99, ns; Figure 3S c, d). These statistical results indicated no effect for the
der and target position factors of successive pecks on both grasping onset and movement distance for each peck.
sed on these results, we were able to treat successive pecks at an array of seed as independent events.
4] Difference in the amounts of pecking experiences:
e introduced trials for pigeons and crows to experience 45 and 15 pecks, respectively, in a daily session (although
e birds terminated pecking before completing those numbers of pecks in some sessions; see Table S1). This means,
stated by the reviewer, that pigeons experienced triple the amounts of pecks in comparison to crows. We introduced
ese unbalanced amounts of experiences between pigeons and crows based on our unpublished study, which was
ne as the master thesis by the first author, with other pigeons and crows using a trial model of artificial
l-extension. In the unpublished study, we found that pigeons rarely improved their pecking performance with the
l extension through experiences of 10-15 pecks × 10 daily sessions, which was a similar amount of experiences for
ows in the present study. This unpublished data suggests that pigeons require much more experience or could be
able to improve their performance of pecking with bill extensions. Given the results in the unpublished study, we
ovided the experiences of 45 pecks x 10 sessions for pigeons to confirm whether or not they improved the pecking
rformance with the bill extension in the current study. The 45 pecks for pigeons and 15 pecks for crows were the
aximum amount of pecks needed to keep their motivation in a daily session under their limited capacity of food
nsumption. We clarify the unbalanced amount of experiences between pigeons and crows with a short description of
r unpublished data in the revised MS as follows:
evised MS, L159-:
e conducted one session per day for 20-22 successive days with a 1-week interval between the bill-extension
moval and follow-up control phase. Each daily session consisted of 5 trials for pigeons and 15 trials for crows. In
ch trial, an array of 10 hempseeds and a small piece of cheese was presented to pigeons and crows, respectively,
hich allowed us to record 50 pecks from pigeons and 15 pecks from crows in most daily sessions. We tripled the
mber of pecks for pigeons relative to that of crows because pigeons failed to improve their pecking performance
th the bill extension through 10-15 pecks × 10 sessions [Matsui, unpublished thesis]. A trial was terminated when
e subject consumed the presented food(s) or the subject did not respond to the food within 5min for both pigeons
d crows.
7-52: much more detail is needed here as to the distribution of sessions across time. How many days did it take to
15/45 sessions? Were the birds placed back in their home cages and free to feed (with the extended beak)? If
ons peck numerous times during one trial, why then did they not require fewer (rather than more) trials to reach 15
ances of pecking behaviour in one trial than the crows who only pecked once during a trial?
We agree that the suggested sentences in the submitted MS were confusing. We revised the sentences to specify
hat was a session and trial and how many days the experiment was run as follows:
he reason for the different trial numbers between pigeons and crows was clarified in the above response to L136 &
39.)
evised MS, L159-:
e conducted one session per day for 20-22 successive days with a 1-week interval between the bill-extension
moval and follow-up control phase. Each daily session consisted of 5 trials for pigeons and 15 trials for crows. In
ch trial, an array of 10 hempseeds and a small piece of cheese was presented to pigeons and crows, respectively,
hich allowed us to record 50 pecks from pigeons and 15 pecks from crows in most daily sessions. We tripled the
mber of pecks for pigeons relative to that of crows because pigeons failed to improve their pecking performance
th the bill extension through 10-15 pecks × 10 sessions [Matsui, unpublished thesis]. A trial was terminated when
e subject consumed the presented food(s) or the subject did not respond to the food within 5min for both pigeons
d crows.
0: the percentage elongation is provided in a figure legend but also needs to be specified here.
Discussion of relative length of the bill extension to the original bill were added to the suggested sentences in the
vised MS as shown below. Also, the rough percentage in the figure legend in the submitted MS was corrected
cordingly.
M = 2.3 ± 0.1 cm) and crows (6.5 ± 0.1 cm), respectively. Thus, the mean (± SEM) relative length of bill-extension
the original bill was 1.43 ± 0.02 and 1.31 ± 0.01 for pigeons and crows, respectively.
2: performance is measured as success, but is it not easier for crows because they have to aim at the same location
istently, whereas pigeons have to move to a new spot as they move along the array? Would it not have been more
valent to make the crows peck at food items in wells laid out the same way as for pigeons to make them also move
zontally or alternatively to also provide one food item to pigeons?
The reviewer suggested the possibility that pecking a piece of cheese for crows could be easier (or more difficult)
an for pigeons to peck a seed from an array because pigeons had to move every time for pecking the targets at
fferent positions. We think this is unlikely for three reasons. First, in the control phase (Figure 4), pigeons and crows
owed the comparable level of performance at approximately 90% success, suggesting no difference in the difficulty
pecking targets between the two species. Second, all pecks analyzed in this study were confirmed to execute after a
ort-time standstill (‘fixation’) in both pigeons and crows, indicating that no moving component could be involved in
cking execution. Third, as seen in the plots in Figure 6, the pecking movement distance to the target at the same
sition was varied between instances in crows. This was true also for pigeons. As we clarified in the response to
36 & 139 above, mixed model analyses revealed no significant effects of the target position on both pecking
rformance and kinematic parameters, such as movement distance and grasping onset, in pigeons. These statistical
sults suggest that the distance of pecking to a seed at the same position was varied between instances in pigeons. For
ese reasons, it is unlikely that the different methods of target presentation between pigeons and crows caused a
fference in difficulty to peck the target(s) and was as an advantage or disadvantage for either species. In the revised
S, we added a new paragraph to discuss this possibility in the Discussion as follows:
ustification for using the different way of food presentation between pigeons and crows was provided in the above
sponse to L136 & L139.)
evised MS, L376-:
There is a possibility that pecking a piece of cheese was easier for crows than pecking seed from an array was for
geons because pigeons needed to move every time between different positions to peck. However, this possibility is
likely for three reasons. First, during the control phase, as shown in Figure 4, pigeons and crows showed
mparable levels of performance, approximately 90% success, suggesting there was no difference in the level of
fficulty of pecking targets between the two species. Second, all pecks analysed in this study were confirmed to
ecute after a short stop (i.e. ‘head fixation’) in both pigeons and crows, indicating that successive pecks of pigeons
ere treated as independent events comparable to single-shot pecks of crow. Third, as seen in the plots in Figure 6, the
ovement distance in crows was varied between pecks even at the same locations of the target. This was true for
geons. The mixed model analyses of pigeon pecks in the control phase revealed no significant effects of the target
sition on both pecking performance and kinematic parameters, such as movement distance and grasping onset.
ese statistical results suggested that the distance to a seed at the same location was still varied between peck events
pigeons. Therefore, it is unlikely that the different manner of target presentation between pigeons and crows was
vantageous for either species and caused the differences in the difficulty observed in pecking the target(s).
2: 20% of the maximum grasping aperture measured where? At the tip of the bill? Of the extended beak or the real
k? Perhaps a diagram here would help the reader understand exactly what was measured. This could replace the
os which are too dark to see properly; for example, on my reproduction, I cannot see whether the crow’s eye is open
losed. A slowed down video could be provided in the supp materials instead of the photos.
Grasping apertures were measured as the distance between the markers on the tips of ‘real’ bills when without
tension (i.e. control, removal, and follow-up phases), but also those of the extended bills when with extension (i.e.
l-extension phases). Thus, revision was made to specify this point in the suggested sentence and also the Methods
below. A new figure of a diagram to represent the time course of bill aperture as an instance of pecking was added.
e photos (Figure 2 in the previous MS) were removed from the manuscript and instead slowed down video-clips
ere added as supplementary materials.
evised MS, L199-:
movable white markers (<1 cm² square) were attached to the tips of the upper and lower bills for tracking
l-grasping movements (Figures 1c-f). The markers were placed on the tips of the original bills without the
tension (i.e. during control, removal, and follow-up phases; Figures 1c, 1d), and on the extended bills when present
asping onset was defined as a 20% opening of the maximum grasping aperture, which was measured as the
aximum distance between the marker positions of original or extended upper and lower bills in each pecking event
igure 2).
0: please specify predictions more clearly: adapt to this temporal effect by doing what? This is where a much more
ough description of how a bird can change the kinematics of its beak movement to compensate for an elongated
k could be made.
We agree with this suggestion. We revised this to clearly state what kinematic change would occur and why it would
cur with the bill extension as follows:
evised MS, L232-:
we hypothesised that bill extensions would cause a certain temporal shift in adjustment in the pecking action
cause the bill extension should shorten the time for the bill tip to contact a target food compared to pecking with
rmal bills; thus, birds needed to adapt to this temporal effect with a certain kinematic change, such as opening
tended bills earlier than with normal bills to compensate for the shortened time to contact with the target. If this
pothesis is true, the timing of grasping onset from head fixation would be earlier after the attachment of bill
tension than before its attachment.
2: timing of the grasping onset: from the head being immobile? I presume this should state dependent variable?
Exactly. Correction was made appropriately as follows:
evised MS, L238-:
we executed linear mixed models, which consisted of the timing of grasping onset from head fixation as a
pendent variable, and the experimental phase, the movement distance,…
0-237: does all this text refer to figure? Figure 3 is incomprehensible; the legend states it is a depiction of
ement trajectory, but what are the measurements on the x and y-axis? Please describe in detail how this figure
uld be read as it is key to the paper’s conclusions.
Revision was made on the legend to describe the full details to specify the measurement of the X/Y axes as follows:
e corrected X axis of each panel to place the target food position as the origin in Figure 3.
evised MS, captions of Figure 3:
ovement trajectories reconstructed by the tracking markers on the tips of original upper and lower bills during
cking of pigeons (a) and crows (b) across the phases. Two solid lines in each panel show the mean trajectories of
arker-tracked upper and lower tips of the original bill. X-Y axis represents the relative distance of the
arker-tracked bill tips to the target food as the origin. Dashed lines represent 1 SD. A filled small dot at the bottom
the panel indicates the target food.
2: “no clear …representing overshot pecking: this sentence needs to be grammatically modified to make clearer
birds that do not compensate by decreasing their grasping aperture are overshooting. Personally, I think the use of
rshooting’ here to describe the fact that the birds’ beak is too wide open to grasp the food at the point in time when
act would normally occur is not ideal here. Overshooting means going past which is not really the case here.
Agree with this comment. Overshooting is not actually an ideal way to describe what occurred here. We revised the
ggested sentences to describe what occurred more clearly without ‘overshooting’ as follows:
evised MS, L259-:
ter attachment of the bill extension in S1, no clear decrease in grasping aperture appeared before contact with food
igure 3a, S1; also see Movie P2), indicating that pigeons did not compensate by decreasing their grasping aperture
on after their bills were extended. No decrease in grasping aperture before contact with food and the movement
jectories similar to as in the control phase were kept through the bill-extension phases (Figure 3a, S2-4 - S8-10).
4: Although I can see in figure 4 that performance is decreased from S2 onwards relative to the control phase, there
s to be some improvement from S3 onwards relative to S2. If this is the case, then it seems misplaced to state that
e was no improvement in performance, and also contradictory to state that there was a decrease during removal, as
e cannot be a decrease if there was never any increase. Some sort of pairwise comparison is needed across sessions
escribe performance changes more accurately.
l-extension phases and the removal phases, supporting no improvement across these phases as we stated in the
evious MS. However, as suggested by the reviewer, this sentence was still somewhat confusing. Thus, we corrected
e sentence as shown below. Also, the legend for Figure 4 was corrected accordingly.
evised MS, L293-:
terestingly, poor pecking performance continued immediately after the removal of the bill extension, supporting the
ssibility that a motor adaptation to the bill extension implicitly occurred during the bill-extension sessions.
evised MS, the legend for Figure 4:
ccess rates for ingesting foods across the phases in pigeons (a) and crows (b). Different letters above the box plots
dicate a significant difference from the control phase based on 95% confidence intervals (see Table S1 for
tistics)..
0: am I correct in interpreting positive temporal delay as meaning that the time interval between the head being in a
d position and the point in time when it is at 20% of its maximum aperture is longer? In any case, it would be
ful if the authors could explain in more detail what positive temporal delay actually means in terms of the
phology of the peck. Given that PSOS is a general readership journal, it seems fair to request this.
The reviewer’s interpretation is correct. According to this suggestion, the sentences were revised to specify clearly
e meaning of the ‘delay’ and ‘advancement’ of the grasping onset for general readers as follows:
evised MS, L299-:
As shown in Figure 5a, we found that estimated parameters for grasping onset shifted toward positive values
mediately after the attachment of the bill extension in S1, indicating a delay in the grasping onset because of
achment of the bill extension. In other words, their bills were kept opening, but did not start closing even at the
cation of the target. This temporal delay indicated that bills with extensions started to open at the same time as the
iginal bills did, despite the fact that time for the extended bills to start opening should be required earlier than that of
e original bills to because of shortened distance to the target caused by the extended length of the bills. The
mporarily delayed shift of grasping onset appeared to remain across all bill extension phases (S2-4 – S8-10),
hough their confidence intervals were not clearly different from those of the control phase. In contrast, the
timated parameter in the bill-extension removal phase was found to shift towards more negative values in relation to
at in the control phase, indicating the temporal advancement of grasping onset immediately after removing the bill
tension. More specifically, immediately after the removal of the bill extension, pigeons without bill extension
rted to open their bills earlier than they did in the control phase. This temporal advancement of grasping onset
ggests the pecking motor adjustment to compensate the temporal delay of grasping onset by the bill extension….
6-260: “The temporally advancing… extension”: this sentence is incomprehensible. Please re-write; running the ms
a native English speaker would help here I think.
The suggested sentences were re-write as follows.
evised MS, L307-:
contrast, the estimated parameter in the bill-extension removal phase was found to shift towards more negative
lues in relation to that in the control phase, indicating the temporal advancement of grasping onset immediately
er removing the bill extension. More specifically, immediately after the removal of the bill extension, pigeons
thout bill extension started to open their bills earlier than they did in the control phase. This temporal advancement
grasping onset suggests the pecking motor adjustment to compensate the temporal delay of grasping onset by the
l extension. However, the temporarily advancement of grasping onset in the bill removal phase disappeared in the
llow-up phase, indicating that grasping onset was recovered to normal after one-week with a normal bill.
9_26): sentence difficult to understand.
This comment is similar to that addressed just above. Please see above.
ank the authors for their careful attention to my comments. I think the paper is much clearer now in terms of its
hods; my other comments regarding the narrow focus on tool use, and the suggestion that feed-forward control
n adaptation to tool use, have also been removed. I think the paper will make a very nice contribution to
S.
We appreciate very much for that the reviewer’s positive evaluation.
: it is stated that pigeons close their eyes during pecking, which is clearly visible in the videos, but what about
ws? I gather they don't (suggesting that visual information for feed-forward control is available) but this is not
tioned and cannot be gleaned from the videos because they are too dark.
We added a sentence to mention that crows kept open the eyes during pecking in the Discussion as below.
o, the video clips were replaced by the brighter ones.
evised MS, L453-454:
addition, crows kept open the eyes during pecking contrastingly to that pigeons often closed the eyes during
cking (see Movies C1-3, P1-3).
2-306: temporal shift is now clearer, but this sentence would benefit from some re-writing, perhaps by the copy
or?
Revision was made by re-writing the suggested sentences as follows:
evised MS, L301-303:
we found that estimated parameters for grasping onset shifted toward positive values immediately after the
achment of the bill extension in S1, indicating a delay in the grasping onset because of attachment of the bill
tension. This temporal delay indicated that pigeons failed to start to open the extended bills earlier than they did the
iginal bills, in order to compensate the shortened distance to the target caused by the extended length of the bills.
e temporarily delayed shift of grasping onset appeared….
