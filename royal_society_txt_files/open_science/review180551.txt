In this work, the authors isolated an oleaginous fungus, Mucor circinelloides Q531 and studied
its lipid-producing ability and the composition of the lipid. However, the written English of this
manuscript should be promoted. Most importantly, the novelty of this manuscript is insufficient.
So many previous have screened several microbes with lipid-producing ability and the lipid
produced by M. circinelloides Q531 is less than previous work (reference 51).
There are some comments as following:
1. The authors described that ‘lipid yield decreased dramatically after d 6’ in page 4, however,
additional significance test can make this result being more persuasive.
2. Check throughout the manuscript and figures, all of the species names should be italic, and
abbreviation of species name firstly occurred should be avoided.

The manuscript entitled " Microbial oil production from solid-state fermentation by newly
isolated oleaginous fungi from mulberry branches" provided a newly isolated fungi that could
convert mulberry branches to valuable product oil. The biomass and oil yield with cellulase
activity, composition of the substrate and fatty acids were illustrated along with fermentation
time. This paper need be carefully revised before being accepted in Royal Society Open Science.

Major problems:
1. Since the peak value of the liquid was achieved at d 6. Authors should focus the discussion
during d 0 to d 6. From Fig 5, slightly decrease of cellulose (from 45% to ~43% at d 6) could be
observed (estimate p value >0.05, if do ANOVA). Lignin almost unchanged (~37%) and
Hemicellulose changed from 32% to 31% (d 6). However, yield of liquid increased significantly
from 5-45 mg/gds. What is the real substrate for producing oil considering the carbon mass
balance? The authors are suggested to provide the carbon mass balance analysis.
2. One page 4 line 37, since the authors use “significant” to express the decrease, ANOVA should
be provided.
Minor problems:
1. Suggestion for Tile: add the name of the fungi Mucor circinelloides to the title.
2. Suggestions for Summary: detail the time to obtain the GC analysis in line27: like at what day
achieved palmitic acid (C16:0, 18.42%), palmitoleic acid (C16:1, 5.56%), stearic acid (C18:0, 5.87%),
oleic acid (C18:1, 33.89%), et al. rephrase the sentence in line30 “Meanwhile, the oleaginous fungi
have a high enzyme activity of…” Language and expressions should be polished carefully,
rephrase the sentence in line23 : “The a high yield…reached by…”,
3. Introduction part: the authors are suggested to emphasize the key innovative point in the
introduction part, but the current manuscript is just a plain description of SSF and natural fungal
species. What problems did the authors solve? And Why this is interesting to the readership?
Like newly isolated? Why the productivity of this strain is higher than the literature?
4. Detail the screening process in chapter 3.2 from Materials and Methods, like what are the nine
types? And what is the lipid content of the selected fungi from others?
What is the total substrate for solid-state fermentation in 3.3 chapter? Also add one sentence that
indicate which fermentative indexes assayed, including liquid yield, cellulase activity, fungal
biomass, et al.” Combine 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 as one chapter.
5. Integrate Fig. 3 and Fig 4 as one Figure, which could be referred to the Fig.2 from one literature
(Waste Management, 2018, 76, 414-422). Be uniform as mentioned in Table 1 and Table 2 that the

Appendix A
Dear Editor and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments
concerning our manuscript entitled “Microbial oil production from
solid-state fermentation by newly isolated oleaginous fungi from
mulberry branches” (No.: RSOS-180551). Those comments are all
valuable and very helpful for improving our paper, and they are also an
important reference to our future researches. We have carefully
considered the comments and have made corrections. Revisions are
marked in the revised version.
Reviewer # 1:
Comments to authors:
In this work, the authors isolated an oleaginous fungus, Mucor
circinelloides Q531 and studied its lipid-producing ability and the
composition of the lipid. However, the written English of this
manuscript should be promoted. Most importantly, the novelty of
this manuscript is insufficient. So many previous have screened
several microbes with lipid-producing ability and the lipid produced
by M. circinelloides Q531 is less than previous work (reference 51).
Response: We appreciate the reviewer's positive comments.
We have polished the written English of our manuscript.
Mucor sp. is a natural fungal species, which can be used to
produce phytase in SSF processes and has been successfully
employed in the production of lipids in SmF processes (Vicente et
al., 2009; Roopesh et al., 2006). However, researches of Mucor sp.
on producing microbial lipid by SSF have not been reported,
moreover, lipid productivity of other species by SSF of biomass
was still low (Peng et al., 2007; Immelman et al., 1997). In this
study, we investigated the feasibility of direct bioconversion of
mulberry branches into microbial lipids by using a newly isolated
filamentous fungus that has been identified as Mucor
circinelloides Q531. The results confirmed the lipid productivity
of this strain was higher than that of the literatures because the
strain was fitted better for SSF to produce lipid using Mulberry
branches as raw material compared with other species and
biomass.
1. Comment: The authors described that ‘lipid yield decreased
dramatically after d 6’ in page 4, however, additional significance
test can make this result being more persuasive.
Response: We have added the significance test of the data, and
revised the fig.3.
2. Comment: Check throughout the manuscript and figures, all of the
species names should be italic, and abbreviation of species name
firstly occurred should be avoided.
Response: We have checked throughout the manuscript and
figures, and revised the font of species names. The abbreviation of
species name firstly occurred has been defined.

The manuscript entitled " Microbial oil production from
solid-state fermentation by newly isolated oleaginous fungi from
mulberry branches" provided a newly isolated fungi that could
convert mulberry branches to valuable product oil. The biomass and
oil yield with cellulase activity, composition of the substrate and
fatty acids were illustrated along with fermentation time. This paper
need be carefully revised before being accepted in Royal Society
Open Science.
Response: We appreciate the reviewer's positive comments. We
have revised our manuscript carfully.
1.Comment: Since the peak value of the liquid was achieved at d 6.
Authors should focus the discussion during d 0 to d 6. From Fig 5,
slightly decrease of cellulose (from 45% to ~43% at d 6) could be
observed (estimate p value >0.05, if do ANOVA). Lignin almost
unchanged (~37%) and Hemicellulose changed from 32% to 31% (d
6). However, yield of liquid increased significantly from 5-45
mg/gds. What is the real substrate for producing oil considering the
carbon mass balance? The authors are suggested to provide the
carbon mass balance analysis.
Response: The data in Fig.5 just showed changes of the
proportion of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose during SSF.
Although there were no changes significantly , the loss of
lignocellulose was obvious during SSF(see Table.S1). The
calculation of carbon mass balance was very complex, and we need
to obtain more extra data to calculate it accurately. However, we
still estimated the carbon mass balance according to our existing
data. The loss of lignocellulose was 12.35% (370.5mg) after 6 days
of SSF, among which the loss of cellulose and hemicellulose was
about 218.3mg and 149.5mg, respectively. In addition to cell
growth and residue sugar, the lost carbon (about 90mg) was used to
produce lipid, which is balance with the increase of carbon
(87.75mg) in lipid during SSF.
2. Comment: One page 4 line 37, since the authors use “significant”
to express the decrease, ANOVA should be provided.
Response: We are so sorry for the mistake of the expression
“significant”. As shown in Fig.5, the content of cellulose, in
comparison to hemicellulose and lignin, was decreased, but not so
significant. So, we have deleted “significant”.
3. Comment: Suggestion for Tile: add the name of the fungi Mucor
circinelloides to the title.
Response: We have added the name of the fungi Mucor
circinelloides Q531 to the title.
4. Comment: Suggestions for Summary: detail the time to obtain the
GC analysis in line27: like at what day achieved palmitic acid
(C16:0, 18.42%), palmitoleic acid (C16:1, 5.56%), stearic acid
(C18:0, 5.87%), oleic acid (C18:1, 33.89%), et al. rephrase the
sentence in line30 “Meanwhile, the oleaginous fungi have a high
enzyme activity of…” Language and expressions should be
polished carefully, rephrase the sentence in line23 : “The a high
yield…reached by…”,
Response: We have detailed the time (add “after 2 d of SSF”)to
obtain the GC analysis in line 27 of Summary. We have rephrase the
sentence in line30 “Meanwhile, the oleaginous fungi have a high
enzyme activity of…” . The revised sentence is “Meanwhile, the
oleaginous fungi have a high cellulase activity of 1.39 ± 0.09
FPU/gds”. And, we have rephrased the sentence in line23 : “The a
high yield…reached by…”. The revised sentence is “The highest
yield and the maximum lipid content produced by the fungal cells
were 42.43 ± 4.01 mg/gram dry substrate (gds) and 28.8 ± 2.85%,
respectively”.
5. Comment: Introduction part: the authors are suggested to
emphasize the key innovative point in the introduction part, but the
current manuscript is just a plain description of SSF and natural
fungal species. What problems did the authors solve? And Why this
is interesting to the readership? Like newly isolated? Why the
productivity of this strain is higher than the literature?
Response: We have revised the introduction part to emphasize
the key innovation point of our manuscript. Mucor sp. is a natural
fungal species, which can be used to produce phytase in SSF
processes and has been successfully employed in the production of
lipids in SmF processes (Vicente et al., 2009; Roopesh et al., 2006).
However, researches of Mucor sp.on producing microbial lipid by
SSF have not been reported, moreover, lipid productivity of other
species by SSF of biomass was still low (Peng et al., 2007;
Immelman et al., 1997). In this study, we investigated the feasibility
of direct bioconversion of mulberry branches into microbial lipids
by using a newly isolated filamentous fungus that has been
identified as Mucor circinelloides Q531. The results confirmed the
lipid productivity of this strain was higher than that of the
literatures because the strain was fitted better for SSF to produce
lipid using Mulberry branches as raw material compared with other
species and biomass.
6. Comment: Detail the screening process in chapter 3.2 from
Materials and Methods, like what are the nine types? And what is
the lipid content of the selected fungi from others?
What is the total substrate for solid-state fermentation in 3.3 chapter?
Also add one sentence that indicate which fermentative indexes
assayed, including liquid yield, cellulase activity, fungal biomass, et
al.” Combine 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 as one chapter.
Response: We have detailed the screening process in chapter 3.2
from Materials and Methods. In this study, we isolated nine
lipid-producing fungal strains, and we found that Q531 had the
highest lipid content among these strains, so we focused on the
study of Q531. In our revised manuscript we have added the lipid
content data of all the selected fungi (see Fig.S1).
The total substrate for SSF in chapter 3.3 was 3g ( has described
in the manuscript). We have added the sentence: “Lipid yield,
cellulase activity, fungal biomass, residual sugars, component of
biomass and fatty acid composition were detected at different time
during SSF” at the end of part 3.3.
We have combined 3.4, 3.5,3.6,3.7,3.8 and 3.9 as one chapter.
7. Comment: Integrate Fig. 3 and Fig 4 as one Figure, which could be
referred to the Fig.2 from one literature (Waste Management, 2018,
76, 414-422). Be uniform as mentioned in Table 1 and Table 2 that
the fermentation time (days in Fig.3 to Fig. 6) should be changed to
(d).
Response: We have integrated Fig.3 and Fig.4 as one figure
(Fig.3) according to the reviewer’s comment. The units of Fig.3 to
Fig.6 have been uniformed according to the reviewer’s comment.
8. Comment: The GC data in line 55 on page 4 should be exhibited
with the fermentation time. When did the compositions obtained?
Response: The GC data showed the compositions at different
fermentation time. The compositions were obtained after 2 d of SSF.
And we have added the time (after 2 d of SSF ) in the manuscript.

An isolated strain can directly use mulberry branches as
materials to produce microbial lipid, which is an interesting works
and dramatically saves the cost of fermentation. Besides, the
writing of the manuscript is good. Attention, I think that the fourth
suggestion is very important, you should make a serious
consideration.
Response: We appreciate the reviewer's positive comments. We
have revised our manuscript carfully.
1. Comment: For the part of introduction, line 3 to 10, page 2, please
supplement more information so that readers can understand how to
resolve the shortcomings of SmF by SSF.
Response: We have revised the part of introduction, and added
some information and references of resolving the shortcomings of
SmF by SSF.
2. Comment: Line 47-49, page 2, the content can’t be read. Revise it.
Response: We have revised the sentence. The revised sentence is:
“Three grams of dried lignocellulosic materials and 6 mL of
mineral salt solution (MS solution contained (NH4)2SO4, 1.7 g;
KH2PO4, 2.0 g; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.5 g; CaCl2·2H2O, 0.2 g;
FeSO4·7H2O, 0.01 g; ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.01 g; MnSO4·4H2O, 0.001 g;
CuSO4·5H2O, 0.0005 g; 0.1% Tween-80 (w/v), pH adjusted to
6.5) were well mixed and added to culture dishes”.
3. Comment: Part 4.2, no information showing the change of
lignocellulose was observed. Please check it.
Response: Fig.3 did not show the change of lignocellulose, so we
delete “lignocellulose” in the sentence. The change of
lignocellulose was shown in Fig.5.
4. Comment: Part 4.3, Cellulase activity has indirect effect on the
lipid yield. The change in sugars concentration (glucose, maltose, etc.)
during the fermentation is better beneficial to interpret the increase or
decline of lipid yield. So, supplement the experimental data.
Response: We have added the data of sugars, including
cellobiose, glucose, xylose and arabinose (see Fig.4).
