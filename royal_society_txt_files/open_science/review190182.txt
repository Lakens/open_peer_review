The manuscript entitled “Synthesis and photoluminescence properties of Silica-modified
SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb@SiO2, SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb-L@SiO2 core-shell-shell nanostructured composites”
reports the synthesis and characterization of new core-shell-shell nanostructures, which show
better luminescence stability and stronger luminescent properties than their homologous terbium
core-shell nanostructured composites. This work is continuation of previous papers of this
research group [29,44].
In my opinion, the major weakness is the proposed potential biomedical application, as bio-
imaging and optical probe for medical diagnosis. Both the large particle size of the core-shell-
shell nanostructures (around 200 nm) and the UV irradiation are two important inconveniences
for its biomedical use. For instance, the particle size affects directly to its blood circulation time

specially for inorganic nanoparticles [e.g. Nanoparticles for biomedical imaging, Expert Opin.
Drug Deliv. 2009, 6, 1175–1194] while the UV irradiation can produce cell damage and DNA
mutations [e.g. The Mechanisms of UV Mutagenesis. J. Radiat. Res. 2011, 52, 115–125]. Therefore,
I would recommend to the authors the proposition of other type of applications, or they should
include several references, demonstrating that similar nanostructures (i.e. both with similar
inorganic-particle size and excitation by UV radiation) were used in photonic-based biomedical
sciences.
Other minor comments:
(1) The authors use too many abbreviations both in the title (e.g. ANA, Tb and L) and in the
abstract (phen, TTA, TEOS, CTAB, etc.). They should avoid the use of abbreviations in the title or
define them previously in the abstract.
(2) Figure 2 should include the RDX spectra of SiO2 and SiO2@ANA-Si.
(3) EDX plots included in Figure 3 and 4 have poor quality. Authors should improve these EDX
graphical representations.
(4) Figure 10 shows photoluminiscence emission spectra of three different core-shell-shell
nanostructures after different incubation times in aqueous solution. In all cases, the spectra are
overlapped, and it is impossible to appreciate any difference between different times.

erwise, it is difficult to confirm that the SiO2 shell was successfully created on the surface of the

rently reported in the ESI, in order to facilitate the comprehension of the peaks attribution.
he comments about the XRD data should be revised and probably smoothed because also the

Appendix B
Dear Editor,
I quite appreciate your favorite consideration and the reviewer’s insightful comments.
Now I have revised the RSOS-190182 exactly according to the reviewer’s comments.
Those comments are all valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our
paper, as well as the important guiding significance to our researches. We have
studied comments carefully and have made correction which we hope meet with
approval. Revised portions are marked in red in the paper. The main corrections in the
paper and the responds to the reviewer’s comments are as follows.
Comments to Reviewer 1:
We want to begin by thanking Reviewer 1 for writing that “The authors describe
the preparation of the core-shell and core-shell-shell nanosystems composed of a
silica core and Tb complexes on the surface. A second silica shell was introduced to
stabilize the luminescent entities and improve the properties of photoluminescence.
The novelty compared to the previous systems reported in the literature is the
incorporation of the second inorganic layer. This strategy is interesting and its
effectiveness has been demonstrated by the authors. This topic can be interesting for a
wide range of readers and the manuscript is suitable for publication after some
suggested changes here”. We also appreciated the constructive criticism and
suggestion. We addressed all the points raised by the reviewer, as summarized below.
Point 1: The authors exploit the EDX analysis to determine the load of Tb on the
surface. This approach is suitable for a preliminary knowledge of the chemical
composition. However, a more precise quantification of metal ions should be
performed by ICP-MS or ICP-OES analysis. These tests must be performed for
samples and data reported in the revised version.
Response 1: We are grateful to the reviewer for pointing out ICP-MS or ICP-OES
analysis. We are very sorry for this question. In the core-shell nanostructured
composite, the terbium organic complex is acted as the shell layer. Because the
complexes containing organic matter could not be measured for ICP-MS or ICP-OES,
this test has not been carried out in the revised version. In addition, in order to further
study the elemental distribution of the core-shell nanostructured composites, the
STEM-EDX elemental mappings have been complemented. It can be seen from figure
4a-d that O and Tb were uniformly distributed in the silica-based spheres-like area.
Furthermore, the element mappings of Si, O and Tb in SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb
composite (figure 4a-d) revealed that O and Tb were uniformly distributed in the
silica-based spheres-like area.
Figure 4. Bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image of a single
SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb (a) and the associated EDX element mappings images (b-d).
Point 2: IR section: Spectra should be normalized to compare the bands absorbance
for all samples. Otherwise, it is difficult to confirm that the SiO2 shell was
successfully created on the surface of the core-shell materials. Furthermore, in
paragraph 3.3.2, the authors should insert the relative figure, currently reported in the
ESI, in order to facilitate the comprehension of the peaks attribution.
Response 2: Thanks for the reviewer’s carefully reading and great suggestion. We
have revised FT-IR spectra according to the Reviewer’s suggestion. The spectra have
be normalized to compare the bands absorbance for all samples. Besides, figure 7
have been inserted in the revised manuscript.
Figure 6. FT-IR spectra of ANA-Si (a), SiO2 (b), SiO2@ANA-Si (c), SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb (d) and
SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb@SiO2 (e).
Figure 7. FT-IR spectra of phen (a), SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb-phen (b), SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb-phen@SiO2 (c), TTA (d),
SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb-TTA (e) and SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb-TTA@SiO2 (f).
Point 3: The comments about the XRD data should be revised and probably
smoothed because also the pattern of SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb shows a weak band at 7-8°
2theta. The differences in the pattern reported in the figure 6 are mainly related to the
intensity ratios that change in the samples.
Response 3: Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion very much. We have revised this
part according to the Reviewer’s suggestion as follows.
After surface modification with organosilane (ANA-Si), as shown in figure 8b, no
diffraction peak was observed except for the broad bands, which were the
characteristic peak for amorphous SiO2. The XRD patterns of SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb
(figure 8c), the intensity of the diffraction pattern appeared at 2<U+03B8> = 7-8° became
weaker. Careful view showed that there were some weak peaks centered at 6.4°, 7.9°,
9.1°, 10.2° and 11.1°, also providing evidence for the Tb-(ANA-Si)-ClO4 complexes
coated onto the surface of SiO2 core. As illustrated in figure 8d, the two broad bands
of SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb@SiO2 core-shell-shell nanostructured composite appeared at 2<U+03B8>
= 7-8° and 23° were in coincidence with the stander XRD pattern for SiO2 core
(figure 8a), which further illustrated that an amorphous SiO2 was coated onto the
surface of SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb.
Figure 8. XRD pattern of SiO2 (a), SiO2@ANA-Si (b), SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb (c) and SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb@SiO2 (d).
Point 4: The excitation bands at 332, 322 and 331 nm require a precise attribution.
Response 4: We are very grateful for the reviewer’s suggestion. Further to investigate
the attribution of excitation bands at 332, 322 and 331 nm. The broad absorption
bands correspond to the 4f8-4f75d transition of Tb(III).
Point 5: Authors should describe the methodology used to determine the quantum
yields of solid state samples.
Response 5: We are very grateful for the reviewer’s suggestion. The detailed
description of the test methodology has been added in the revised manuscript as
follows.
2.8. Test methodology for the quantum yields
The absolute fluorescence quantum yield of the solid powder sample was measured
by an integrating sphere using the photoluminescence spectrometer (FL; Edinburgh
S980, UK) at room temperature. First, the excitation and emission spectra of the
sample should be acquired in order to identify the best excitation wavelength and
emission range. Subsequently, the integrating sphere was put in the sample chamber.
In powder samples, the blank sample measurements were made by replacing the
PTFE powder vessel with the BENFLEC scattering platform. An emission spectrum
covering the excitation light and the full emission spectrum was recorded. This
measurement should be done with 0.1 nm step size and 0.3 second integration time,
1-5 repeats (depending on the accuracy required). Monitor the counts per second on
the emission detector until there was sufficient intensity on the detector (500000-1
million cps). Then the emission spectrum of the solid powder samples covering the
excitation light and the full emission spectrum were recorded. This measurement
should be done with the same settings as before. Finally, the quantum yield function
was used to select the spectra and define the calculation region for scatter and
emission. After this was completed, the quantum yield was obtained.
Point 6: Luminescence stability is defined by photobleaching tests in which the
luminescence intensity is followed as a function of time under continuous light
irradiation. This test should be performed in order to demonstrate that the luminescent
stability of the core-shell-shell sample is better than the core-shell materials.
Response 6: Thanks for the helpful comments and suggestions. We are very sorry for
this question. Owing to the limitation of experimental conditions, the photobleaching
test had not been measured. Meanwhile, to further investigate the photoluminescence
stability of the core-shell-shell nanostructured composites in aqueous solution, the
SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb-phen@SiO2 composite was dissolved in deionized water at a
concentration of 0.1 g L-1 and under the continuous UV light irradiation at 365 nm.
The luminescence property was observed after irradiated 0 h, 16 h, 40 h at room
temperature using the photoluminescence spectrometer (FL; Edinburgh S980, UK)
with the slit width of 2.0 nm. With the time increasing from 0 h to 40 h, the decrease
degree of emission intensity was smaller. The core-shell-shell composite also
exhibited better luminescence stability under the continuous UV light irradiation. This
result was consistent with the photoluminescence stability of the core-shell-shell
nanostructured composite in figure 12 under intermittently UV light irradiation.
Therefore, the introduction of an amorphous silica shell not only can suppress OH
groups quenching effect from the surrounding environment, but it can also protect the
internal structure of the core-shell composites.

aqueous solution and under the continuous UV light irradiation at 365 nm.
Point 7: Minor comments: The English should be deeply revised. Some grammatical
errors are for instance indicated. In the abstract, line 45: “all” should be removed.
Response 7: Thanks for the helpful comments and suggestions. Throughout the
article, we have carefully examined and made reasonable corrections and grammatical
corrections. Moreover, in the abstract, line 45: “all” has been removed.
Point 8: page 2, line 28: please remove “improved” before “stability”.
Response 8: Thanks for the helpful suggestion. We have removed the “improved”
before “stability”.
Point 9: page 2, line 32: “silicon” should be replaced by “silica”.
Response 9: We are very grateful for the reviewer’s crucial comment. We have
replaced the statements of “silicon” by “silica”.
Point 10: page 3, lines 19 and 45: please replace luminous with luminescent.
Response 10: We are very grateful for the reviewer’s suggestion. We have replaced
the statements of “luminous” by “luminescent” in lines 19 and 45.
Point 11: page 3, lines 47-51: the sentence is not clear.
Response 11: Thanks for the reviewer’s comment. This sentence has been revised for
more clearly description as follows.
In addition, such silica-modified core-shell-shell nanostructured composites
simultaneously show excellent properties with regard to non-toxicity and
luminescence that plays a significant role in the development of bio-imaging, medical
diagnosis and biological labeling [46,47].
Point 12: page 7, line 18: please replace micrograph with micrographs.
Response 12: We are very grateful for the reviewer’s excellent suggestion. We have
revised the statements of “micrograph” by “micrographs”.
Point 13: page 7, lines 36-40: the sentence is not clear.
Response 13: Thanks for the suggestion. We have revised this sentence for more
clearly description as follows.
In order to study the elemental composition of the core-shell nanostructured
composites, the as-prepared SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb, SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb-phen and
SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb-TTA microspheres were subsequently analyzed by EDX
spectrometer in figure 3d and figure S1a. The presence of Si, O, N, Cl and Tb atoms
in the EDX spectra suggested the formation of the SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb,
SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb-phen and SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb-TTA core-shell nanostructured
composites.
Comments to Reviewer 2:
We should like to express my appreciation to reviewer 2 for suggesting how to
improve our paper. We have made extensive modification on the original manuscript.
The main corrections in the paper and the responds to the reviewer’s comments are as
follows.
Point 1: In my opinion, the major weakness is the proposed potential biomedical
application, as bio-imaging and optical probe for medical diagnosis. Both the large
particle size of the core-shell-shell nanostructures (around 200 nm) and the UV
irradiation are two important inconveniences for its biomedical use. For instance, the
particle size affects directly to its blood circulation time specially for inorganic
nanoparticles [e.g. Nanoparticles for biomedical imaging, Expert Opin. Drug Deliv.
2009, 6, 1175–1194] while the UV irradiation can produce cell damage and DNA
mutations [e.g. The Mechanisms of UV Mutagenesis. J. Radiat. Res. 2011, 52,
115–125]. Therefore, I would recommend to the authors the proposition of other type
of applications, or they should include several references, demonstrating that similar
nanostructures (i.e. both with similar inorganic-particle size and excitation by UV
radiation) were used in photonic-based biomedical sciences.
Response 1: We are very grateful for the reviewer’s crucial comment. For biological
applications, the prepared core-shell-shell nanostructured composites should be
luminescent stability and water-solubility. The silica shell can not only prevent rare
earth core-shell nanostructured composites from quenching of the external
environment, but also improve the solubility and luminescent stability of the
core-shell nanostructured composite material. In addition, these core-shell-shell
composites with surface-attached abundant Si-OH groups are easily available for
conjugation with biomolecules. Therefore, they could be used for the realistic testing
of the biomedical field. According to the reported literature, there are sufficient
researches on core-shell composite materials with SiO2 as the core and the rare earth

and biological labeling. Here are some references to refer to: (1) J. Chem. Sci., 2016,

Point 2: The authors use too many abbreviations both in the title (e.g. ANA, Tb and L)
and in the abstract (phen, TTA, TEOS, CTAB, etc.). They should avoid the use of
abbreviations in the title or define them previously in the abstract.
Response 2: Thanks for the suggestion. We have revised this part according to the
reviewer’s suggestion. The abbreviations both in the title (e.g. ANA, Tb and L) and in
the abstract (phen, TTA, TEOS, CTAB, etc.) have been defined previously in the
abstract.
Point 3: Figure 2 should include the XRD spectra of SiO2 and SiO2@ANA-Si.
Response 3: Thanks for the reviewer’s comment. According to the suggestions, we
have revised this part. The XRD spectra of SiO2 and SiO2@ANA-Si have been
inserted in Figure S2.

SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb-TTA@SiO2 (d).
Point 4: EDX plots included in Figure 3 and 4 have poor quality. Authors should
improve these EDX graphical representations.
Response 4: We are very grateful for the reviewer’s crucial comment. We have
revised this part according to the reviewer’s suggestion in the EDX spectra. Owing to
an amorphous silica layer that was coated onto the surface of SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb,
SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb-phen and SiO2@ANA-Si-Tb-TTA core-shell nanostructured
composites, eventually causing the reduction of Tb content when compared with the
corresponding core-shell nanostructured composites.

composites (b).
Point 5: Figure 10 shows photoluminiscence emission spectra of three different
core-shell-shell nanostructures after different incubation times in aqueous solution. In
all cases, the spectra are overlapped, and it is impossible to appreciate any difference
between different times.
Response 5: We are grateful to the reviewer for pointing out the problem. We have
revised this part in Figure 12.
