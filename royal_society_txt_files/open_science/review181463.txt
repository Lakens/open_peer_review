Dear Dr. Cartwright and coauthors,
You have written a fairly clear and concise paper on a timely topic. It needs some clarification;
hence, I have recommended minor revisions and I encourage the journal to publish quickly.
A few line by line suggestions:
Page 4 Line 48 Describe what you mean by ‘carrying capacity’, because this term is hard to define
and varies in the literature. Do you mean the population has surpassed ‘K’’? If so, describe what
‘K is for this DPS. Or do you mean the ecosystem has shifted so fewer whales can be sustained?
Page 5 Lines 20-37 I suggest using an effort table to include years, ‘season’, days on the water of
Beaufort 2 or less and nm surveyed. A table would be easier for the reader to see where the data
gaps exist, if any.
3
Page 6 Line 3 Were the observers the same? Was there observer experienced? Convince the
reader the data were collected by trained experienced observers and not an intern from Kansas.
Line 17 Describe what you mean by escorts.
Line 20 Were iPads used to record GPS in all study years?
Page 7 Line 19 explain ESRI
Page 8 Statistical Analysis and Environmental Parameters
How did you deal with the correlation among oceanographic events? Or were they considered as
independent events? I suggest you seek the advice of an oceanographer who may have insights
you have not considered.
Encounter rates
Page 9 Line 37 Results
As a reader I would like to see a comparison of effort between the two time periods. If it
is presented anywhere it is not obvious. This will inform the reader if there is validity in
documenting a downward trend if the type of effort is balanced among the early and later years.
The number of days and nm transected would be easy to add to the other tables if Being a rate it
is the number of groups with calves over some unit but that unit is unclear.
In the following sentence, the reader has no idea if the drop in encounter rates was due to effort
In days surveyed or nm transected.
‘Of these, 149 groups were encountered in 2013-2014 and 65 groups were encountered in 2017-
2018, reflecting the changes in encounter rates between these time periods.’
Page 11 Line 6 This section made me dizzy. Could you present the two groups of years and then
the individual years in a table? Lots of information but a bit confusing to follow. In thinking
about how to make this easier to follow are the early, mid and late divisions really necessary?
Could you pick the timing that best represents the years. While I don’t mind the three seasons
and find the differences interesting it is hard to follow. I suggest present the results as an overall
grouping between the two sets of years and then add the necessary seasons to support your
findings.
Page 12 Line 25 In the methods this is called Environmental Parameters….be consistent in the
headers and layout between Methods and Results
Page 13
Line 49 Encounter rates of calves? M/C? Adults?
Line 52ish How does the timing work for the nutritional stress hypothesis? If declines were
before 2015 could this indicate the warm water events impacted whales earlier?
Page 14 Line 42 Correction Gabriele not Gabrielle. Double check HMMC numbers from their
2018 season report.
Page 15 Line 45 GulfWatch Alaska has studied PWS humpback and herring since 2006. Results
through 2009 are reported in a special issue from Deep Sea Research 2 Other surveys are
reported in survey reports available from the AOOS website portal. This might be a good time to
discuss the year prior to pregnancy as a year a female needs to be in top fitness. If warm water
events first began impacting GOA productivity in 2013 the subsequent poor calving years should
4
have started to be seen in HI in 2015 and beyond. This is because poor body condition from
nutritional stress on the feeding grounds in 2013 would have made 2014 a poor year to sustain a
pregnancy in HI and AK and the resulting poor calving year would be first documented in HI the
winter of 2015.
Page 16 Line 12ish Again think of the vagueness of the carrying capacity concept and explain
your thinking in saying they really reached some point that caused a rapid decline in calves.
Page 17
Line 20 Krill is not the primary prey in SEAK
Line 45 Again consult with an oceanographer to fully understand how the three oceanographic
events interplay among each other.
Page 18
Line 28 This is speculative and not based on actual data. Females MAY overwinter, a few have,
in Alaska, but it is more likely they spend little time on the breeding grounds (or only go part
way) and more time feeding because the migration is staggered hence giving the appearance of
whales staying all winter in Alaska.
Line 42 ish Again carrying capacity needs to be clear as to what you mean by this term.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Denise Greig):
This is a nice dataset surveying whale presence on a nursery ground in the Hawaii from 2008 to
2018 and the impact of climate anomalies on whale numbers. The paper is timely given the basin
wide impact of these oceanographic anomalies on multiple taxa.
Two supportive reviewers categorized their comments as minor revisions, but I think some of
their requests are fairly extensive so I am calling the revisions major, recognizing that they will
take some effort on your part to address. In additions to their comments, I just have a few minor
questions
Page 2, line 15. I wonder if you mean “signal” rather than “sentinel”
Page 3, line 40. I wonder why you chose “adiposity” as opposed to “body condition”. Adiposity
implies obesity in humans – I have not seen it defined in reference to whales.
Page 5, line 25. What is the time persiod for “the entire season”?
Page 5, lines 42-49. This was confusing to read with distance measured in degrees, minutes, and
meters – can it be converted to meters and kilometers with the degrees and minutes in
parentheses?
Page 6, line 24. What is g(0)? Detection probability? Or percent time on the surface?
Page 19, line 18, what is a teleconnection?
Tables. Please remove the vertical lines (and any of the horizontal lines that are not needed).
Tables 4 and 6, please describe the explanatory variables in the table title or footnote even if they
are descibed in the text (i.e. what is s(year, 2.34)?, SST, PDO…)

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Denise Greig):
Really well done response to reviewers! Thank you for all the information.
I would change this sentence in the abstract to keep all the verbs in agreement
From “Rates initially increased, tracking projected growth rates for this population segment,
reaching a peak in 2013, and then declining through 2018.”
To “Rates initially increased, tracking projected growth rates for this population segment,
reached a peak in 2013, and then declined through 2018.
P 5, line 125. Thank you for letting me know the timing of a normal season in your response, but I
think you need to add it to the text, maybe after this sentence, “The study spans the January
through March season from 2008 to 2018, however timing…”
Line 129. Survey protocols used in 2008 to 2010 were repeated in 2013 and 2014 to allow
comparisons of the results.
Line 132. In 2017 and 2018, surveys were once again conducted during three two week periods, in
mid-January, mid-February and mi-March, again using the 2008-2010 survey protocols.
13
Line 133. All surveys were restricted to favorable sea conditions (Beaufort <3) in order to ensure
consistency in weather / sightability conditions. Shouldn’t this be <4 or less than or equal to 3? I
understood from your response that surveys were conducted in Beaufort = 3.
Line 305. In a second set of models, the impact of key oceanic parameters (impact on what? On
variation in whale encouter rates?) was explored. Encounter rates for individual whales, mother-
calf groups and adult only groups comprised the response variables, with separate models
constructed for each variable.

Appendix A
Review of Cartwright et al.: “Declining reproductive rates in
Hawaii’s humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, in
response to recent climate
anomalies in the North Pacific” (manuscript ID: RSOS-181463)
Reviewer: Joe Mobley, PhD
This is an important and timely contribution both at a regional
level showing compelling evidence of a potential downturn in
reproductive rates of humpback whales in the Hawaii wintering
region, as well as the global level by associating such changes in
response to broad-level climate change. That being said, there
were a number of small issues, none of them lethal, that if left
uncorrected might detract from the important story the results
describe.
The larger of the small issues was that of variable effort within and
across years; e.g., seemingly random repetitions of transect lines;
post-hoc insertions of additional lines for no apparent useful
purpose. For readers like myself, who are familiar with distance
sampling theory, such details snag one’s attention as red flags.
However, there’s little doubt in my mind that the strong
downward trend they describe is true; my concern is that these
anomalies needlessly draw attention from that point. My specific
comments follow:
p. 4 line 42-43: “Overall, we found very little evidence of any
changes in patterns of habitat use.”
Comment: This is too sweeping a conclusion for the small
modification made in 2018 (see related comments below). I
recommend that any claims of “no change in patterns of habitat
use” be dropped.
p. 5 lines 21-22 – “The study spans the years 2008 to 2018. In
2008 to 2010, all surveys were conducted in the latter portion of
the season (mid-March onwards).”
Comment: A reference to Table 1 would be helpful here given the
complexity of the timing of surveys across years.
p. 5 lines 32-33: “In 2018, additional surveys were added in mid-
channel waters to capture any local relocation.”
Comment: The utility of adding these lines escaped me. They
added so little in the range of effort and involved so few additional
sightings that I feel the manuscript would be better off not
including them at all. Certainly the additional sightings they
yielded were not enough to make any statistically meaningful
comparisons. My recommendation is to drop these data and focus
on the main results.
p. 5 lines 34 &35 “restricting to BF 2 or better”
Comment: As someone who works frequently in the same region
(Auau Channel) I have to question the veracity of this claim. The
presence of any whitecaps at all quickly changes the Beaufort sea
state from 2 to 3 and, in my experience, this happens frequently.
p. 5 lines 54-57: “Each survey line was covered at least once but no
more than twice within each set of surveys and surveys were
continued until either approximately 50 km had been covered, or
the locations >50 groups had been recorded.”
Comment: This detail bothered me most of all. I’m used to
following clear rules in the placement and execution of track lines
and this makes it sound almost whimsical. Whatever the authors
can do to reveal any explicit rules used in replicating lines would
be helpful. Also, they need to clearly address the issue of replicated
sightings and their treatment of these (see below) since replicating
lines would obviously increase the probability of doing so.
p. 6 line 24: g(o) should be g(0), i.e., a zero not the letter o. Also
their reference to Mobley, Bauer & Herman—(submerged vs
surface times) is incorrect; should be Mobley (2001) sanctuary
report.
p. 6 line 31-3: “Fluke photo ID’s (as per [53]) and surface images
documenting body markings, lesions and other scars were
compiled for all sighted animals and used post-hoc to eliminate
any chance of pseudo replication over the course of the day,
between survey vessels or within regions of over-lap at the
beginning or the end of any successive transects.”
Comment: Need more detail about this correction for resights.
What percentage of sightings were resights, and how were they
treated; i.e., were they simply eliminated from the ER estimates or
something else?
p. 7 line 20-21: “As sightings within an estimated 1 km had
originally been recorded, this also reduced any potential edge
effect.”
Comment: What is an “edge effect?”
p. 12 line 10: “Mid-channel surveys (2018 season only) covered a
total distance of 38.4 km”
Comment: This short distance just reinforces my comment for p. 5
lines 32-33 noted above.
p. 12 lines 32-33: “using the onset of climatic anomalies as a
splitting point”
Comment: What specific anomalies are being referred to here?
p. 13 line 14-15: “For encounter rates for individual whales…”
Comment: Does “individual whales” include all whales? Or does it
exclude cows with calves, the comparison group in this case?
Please clarify.
p. 14 lines 51-54: “Surveys conducted in mid channel waters in
2018 when encounter rates in the main study are were
exceptionally low did not provide any evidence of higher than
expected numbers of cow-calf pairs in that adjacent area”
Comment: As noted above, the small numbers of animals seen in
this one-season modification were not sufficient to support a “no-
change” inference.
p. 15 line 42: “SPLISH” should be SPLASH
p. 16 lines 25-28: “In this case, changes were asymmetrical; the
rate of decline fluctuated, and ultimately far exceeded the rate of
increase prior to carrying capacity (K).”
Comment: This sentence implies that carrying capacity (K) has has
been established for the present DPS when such is not the case.
Please modify the sentence to better clarify that point.
p. 17 lines 19-22: In the California Current System, humpback
whales will switch between a predominantly fish based diet and a
predominantly krill based diet…”
Comment: “Will” implies that we’re seeing into the future here?
Maybe change “will” to “are known to.”
Overall, I feel that these are important results that deserve to be
broadly shared. Once these requested changes are addressed, then
I recommend that the revised manuscript be accepted for
publication.

s over the course of gestation and lactation in the breeding areas, so certainly, there are rapid
gs in body condition among these females. Also, studies have shown that it is an increase in the
of adipocyte cells, and not adipogenesis that occurs. All this being said, I think that adiposity
ht be an applicable term in line 40. However, in order to ensure that the text is accessible, I have
nged this term to stored energy reserves and I have reviewed subsequent uses. In places where
inferred meaning is that the whales increase in size, but not to the point of obesity, the more

sponse to this comment
e larger of the small issues of concern was that of variable effort within and across years; e.g.,
mingly random repetitions of transect lines; post-hoc insertions of additional lines for no apparent
ul purpose. For readers like myself, who are familiar with distance sampling theory, such details
one’s attention as red flags. However, there’s little doubt in my mind that the strong downward

ressing the reviewer’s comments from a broader perspective, the point made here is well-taken.
study assemblies details from a range of surveys that document encounter rates within a
iously favored habitat over an extended time-period. Cumulatively, these surveys certainly do not
t the requirements necessary to determine actual abundance estimates. Rather, as advocated by
klow et al 2009, the data set presented here was assembled to provide a comparative indication
hanges and trends in encounter rates within the confines of this study area. As such, this study is
ented here as a first step, offering an up to date indication that notable changes in abundance
key population parameters may be on-going in this region. When the study was originally
saged in 2008, design details were chosen with reference to the work of Strindberg and Buckland.
eir methodology, single transect lines represent independent samples that infer distribution
in a region in proportion to the habitat available. This method specifically takes into account
es such as gradients in abundance in relation to key habitat features such as coastlines or
erwater topography, ultimately providing encounter rates that reflect distribution gradients and
vide a mean encounter rate for the study area. During this study, as changes in encounter rates
ame apparent, the goal at this stage was to keep the methods consistent and provide reliable
ils that may indicate on-going changes and trends in encounter rates in this region. Hopefully, in
oing, this study will serve as a starting place and can help justify more detailed assessments of the
ise nature of any changes in this region. As mentioned, comments added and detailed below will
efully highlight this goal and explain the constraints and limitations of the current study to the
er.
itionally, comments within the manuscript that address habitat use have been clearly amended to
w that these statements only relate to fine scale patterns within the study area. As suggested, the

comments have been limited to a short note referencing the fact that some effort was made in
region was added to the discussion. The table is now located in the supplemental tables and
rly described as an ad-hoc set of observations. However, as these observations may help to
light and direct the need for continuing research, we believe that these details should remain in
manuscript in this limited form at this stage.
by line responses are as follows:
line 42-43: “Overall, we found very little evidence of any changes in patterns of habitat use.”
ewer comment: This is too sweeping a conclusion for the small modification made in 2018 (see
ted comments below). I recommend that any claims of “no change in patterns of habitat use” be
pped.
e suggested change has been made and the comments regarding changes in habitat use has been
ed throughout the text to reflect the fact that this data set is confined to a small study area along
Maui shoreline. This data set only reflects habitat uses within this specific area, as the reviewer
ts out, this dataset does not address the possibility of changes in habitat use within the region. At
time, this issue of changing habitat use remains unresolved and a comment to this effect has been
uded on page 17 line 8.

ment: As someone who works frequently in the same region (Auau Channel) I have to question the
city of this claim. The presence of any whitecaps at all quickly changes the Beaufort sea state from 2
and, in my experience, this happens frequently.
e upper limit of the Beaufort reference has been changed from 2 to 3. One of the components of
design of this study, was that we chose a study area that typically fell within the lee of the West
i mountains. Within this study area, we therefore had sufficient leeway to choose transects and
ey routes on a daily basis that offered the best prevailing weather conditions. As the reviewer
ts out, this is crucial to ensure consistent sightability. If we were on the water and the weather
nged we halted the survey, noted the end point and resumed that transect on a different day
n the weather was sufficiently calm to ensure consistent sightability. However after careful
ew of the precise details of the Beaufort, I would agree that it is more accurate to state that we
ed the surveys if the winds exceeded Beaufort 3.

ously increase the probability of doing so.
is response addresses the survey design and methods comment specifically – repeat sightings is
ressed below.
he reviewer points out, the protocols used here don’t meet the stringent requirements for
ance sampling and accurate abundance estimates. Rather, the data set presented here is a
ulative record of encounter rates in a specific region, potentially indicating changes in relative
ndance. As outlined in the new text, the goals of the three different time periods vary to some
ree. In 2008, when we began assessing habitat use in this region, our original survey design
wed protocols described by Buckland 2001 and Strindberg and Buckland 2004. In 2013-2014, we
ned the study in order to detect seasonal patterns of habitat use. In the final period, rather than
pt new sampling protocols, we aimed to conduct surveys that would be comparable to previous
sets.
goal of 50 groups was set up to provide a sample size that would ensure adequate power in the
ysis, though, as numbers have fallen, we haven’t reached this upper limit since 2013. In the 2013-
4 period of data collection, we set this as an upper limit as we wanted to include data from two
ons. The goal of the study then was to determine habitat use and the sample size was based on a
er analysis. In 2013, we did not envisage the decline in numbers seen.
h regards to replication of specific tracks, in 2013-14 we conducted three replicate surveys, in
y, mid and late season, to look for seasonal trends in distribution. In 2017-18, we wanted to
at the 2013 protocol as far as possible so that the two data sets could be compared. Although the
sect comprises a single route, the legs of the transects within the zig-zag pattern were regarded as
pendent. Strindberg and Buckland 2004 do suggest repeating these legs to maximize coverage
in a specific region and essentially, they state that each is an independent sample that provides
ounter rates relative to the habitat that falls within the study area. With the construction
ribed here, any density gradient in the study area is taken into account and ultimately the data
vide mean encounter rates for the specific habitat included in the study area.
result of this, the current certainly is constrained to providing quantitative details of changes in
tive encounter rates in this region. The study does not lend itself to any estimate of overall
ndance as could be derived from more complex distance sampling protocols. This limitation is now
rly mentioned in the text.

ment: Need more detail about this correction for resights. What percentage of sightings were
ghts, and how were they treated; i.e., were they simply eliminated from the ER estimates or

the estimates here were daily encounter rates, rather than abundance rates, searches were made
for within-day replicates. These were frequently detected in the field and when detected there,
whale(s) were only counted on the first encounter. Additional text has been added to clarify this.

ment: What is an “edge effect?”
s term, as used by Strindberg and Buckland, refers to the heterogeneity in sightings across the
th of a transect – it’s the idea that there could be some fall-off in sightability towards the edge of
strip width. An extra comment has been added to clarify this.

e 4 Line 48 Describe what you mean by ‘carrying capacity’, because this term is hard to define and
es in the literature. Do you mean the population has surpassed ‘K’’? If so, describe what ‘K is for this
. Or do you mean the ecosystem has shifted so fewer whales can be sustained?
issue of carrying capacity is certainly complex, as the reviewer points out and as suggested,
her explanation and a clear definition have been added to the manuscript.
hin the introduction, the comment has been amended to reflect the possibility that the population
have surpassed its carrying capacity. However, in the introduction, our goal was simply to
light to the reader that a range of possible explanations needs to be considered. Therefore, in the
rests of the maintaining the flow of the paper at this point, the detailed discussion of this issue is
ted within the discussion. The section in the discussion where carrying capacity is discussed has
n changed extensively. This section now opens with a clear definition of the definition being used
. The discussion of the status of this population in relation to carrying capacity is validated by
rences to theoretical studies that provide clarification and context. Additionally, through the
usion of more recent, up to date studies reporting health and condition indicators for this DPS, the
lication of a decision matrix that combines condition and abundance estimates provides clear
ction for reaching conclusions on the issues surrounding carrying capacity for this population
ment. With these edits in place, this section now leads to a supported conclusion that the carrying
acity has shifted, and may now have reset to a lower point for this population segment.

did you deal with the correlation among oceanographic events? Or were they considered as

etween the indices and local SST in Hawaii, revealed just a single, moderate negative correlation

ceanographer, the discussion section has been radically simplified in respect to the discussion of

1. Summary
Alongside changing ocean temperatures and ocean chemistry, anthropogenic climate change is now
impacting the fundamental processes that support marine systems. However, where natural climate
aberrations mask or amplify the impacts of anthropogenic climate change, identifying key detrimental
changes is challenging. In these situations, long-term, systematic field studies allow the consequences of
anthropogenically driven climate change to be distinguished from the expected fluctuations in natural
resources. In this study, we describe fluctuations in encounter rates for humpback whales, Megaptera
novaeangliae, between 2008 and 2018. Encounter rates for humpback whales were assessed during transect
surveys of the Au’Au Channel, Maui, Hawaii. Rates initially increased, tracking projected growth rates for this

2. Introduction
As global atmospheric carbon dioxide levels pass the 400-ppm threshold [1] the biological impacts of climate
change on marine systems are becoming increasingly widespread[2]. Within the marine realm, changes in
ocean temperature and ocean chemistry are generally recognized as the primary direct consequences of
climate change [3,4]however mounting evidence indicates that the fundamental processes which support
marine systems are also being impacted [2,5–7]. For some marine organisms and ecosystems, these changes
may signal the onset of a downward spiral from which recovery is unlikely [8–10]. For other marine fauna,
Rachel 12/19/2018 4:39 PM
the eventual outcome of these changes may be harder to predict [11,12] or could be beneficial [13–15]. Formatted: Not Highlight
Accurately predicting possible outcomes is challenging, especially where naturally occurring climate Rachel 12/19/2018 4:39 PM

anomalies and fluctuations may act synergistically, potentially amplifying or masking perturbations
associated with anthropogenically driven climate change (e.g. [16,17]). Additionally, while oceanographic
conditions have been closely monitored in recent years, the required complimentary long-term data sets
documenting marine biological resources are comparatively sparse[2,18]. One possible solution is to mine
past studies and assemble data that can be used to investigate the links between marine resources and
environmental forcing [18]This key information can then be applied to ensure that management strategies
accurately target the most detrimental impacts of climate change.
Within the North Pacific system, the last decade may be characterized as a period of pronounced climate
variability. At high latitudes, mean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) have been rising steadily (estimated rate
0.7°C decade-1; [19] while local increases in SSTs have been even more pronounced: Between 2015 and 2017,
seasonal summer temperature anomalies of +4 to +7°C were reported for the Barents and Chukchi Seas [19].
As sea temperatures rise, arctic sea ice levels are falling and a profoundly different climate regime is
emerging across the Pacific Arctic [7]At lower latitudes, increases in mean SSTs in the North Pacific have been
more moderate (0.12°C decade-1;[20]), however any potential stability has been eclipsed by a trifecta of
other climate anomalies. In the summer of 2014, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), a basin-wide system
that acts at a multi-decadal level [21], flipped from a strong, consistent negative phase to a pronounced
positive phase [22,23]. In its negative phase, the PDO is characterized by cooler water temperatures across
the Central Pacific and strong upwellings in coastal waters along the Eastern North Pacific [24]. During a
positive phase, SSTs rise and coastal upwellings weaken. Coinciding with this transition, an additional oceanic
anomaly, comprised of a massive lens of warm water, began to develop in the NE Pacific. Originally the
anomaly was centered in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Alaska, however during the summer of 2014, it
began to move east, quickly spreading along the shelf of North America and coastal Alaska, and acquiring the
widely used nickname “the blob” [25]. By the winter of 2014, associated SST anomalies of >+3°C were
reported [17,26]. The summer of 2015 then saw rising SSTs in the West-central Pacific, signs associated with
the beginning of a strong El Niño / Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event [27]. The typical hallmarks of these 2-3

year systems also include warming SSTs and reduced coastal upwellings; potentially, these effects further
amplified the on-going anomalies already playing out in Central North Pacific.
To date, a wide range of mass mortality events and other biological disruptions across the North Pacific and
the Gulf of Alaska have been causally connected to these unusual conditions [17,26]The warming of coastal
waters associated with all three of these anomalies led to increases in rainfall and freshwater coastal runoff
[28]and reduced surface winds [25]. As a result, stratification increased, minimizing coastal upwellings.
Nutrient transport into the mixed layer was then suppressed, leading to extremely low productivity, as
evidenced by low chlorophyll levels beginning in the winter of ‘14 [28]. Compounding the inherent challenges
associated with low productivity levels, horizontal advection, whereby cool water species migrate north and
warm water species expand their range, potentially triggered a range of cascading impacts [25]. So far,
casualties associated with these disruptions include a mass die-off of common murres, Uria aalge, along the
northern coastline of the Gulf and widespread mortalities in tufted puffins (Fratercula cirrhata) in the Bering
Sea [29]. A large-scale mortality event for Cassin’s Auklets (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) along the Pacific
Northwest coastline has also been attributed to this combination of unusual conditions [30].
For migratory mysticetes such as the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae, fitness and success is
entirely dependent on the availability of adequate prey resources on high latitude feeding grounds. As capital
breeders, migratory mysticetes exploit high latitude prey resources during summertime feeding seasons,
then depend entirely on stored energy reserves to support seasonal migration and wintertime breeding
activities in low latitude regions [31]. For female mysticetes, the successful completion of each stage of
reproduction is contingent upon the adequate availability of stored energy reserves. Prior to pregnancy, an
increase in stored energy reserves has been detected in several migratory mysticetes (e.g. gray whales,
Rachel 1/4/2019 3:38 PM

20-35% of their stored reserves during this period [34,37].
Potentially reflecting these elevated energetic requirements, multiple studies have demonstrated clear
connections between mysticete reproductive rates, nutritional resources and oceanic conditions. For
example, in gray whales, reproductive rates increased following seasons in which sea–ice conditions
R. Soc. open sci.
extended temporal access to preferred feeding grounds in the Bering Sea, [38,39]. Once climatic conditions
changed and access to feeding regions was limited, reproductive rates declined [38]. Similarly, in North
Atlantic right whales, notable increases in reproductive rates during the 90’s were closely matched to
increases in the availability of their preferred prey, Calanus finmarchicus. These prey increases were driven
by favorable oceanic conditions in the Gulf of Maine, which were in turn related to climatic anomalies in the
near Arctic [40]. When a distinct climatic shift altered oceanic conditions in the Gulf of Maine, reducing the
availability of C. finmarchicus, North Atlantic right whale reproductive rates also went into decline [41,42] .
Additional studies describe both short and long term periodicity in these fluctuations, ranging from one to six
years previous depending on the life cycle of the prey species [43]. Taken cumulatively, these studies
elucidate the mechanisms through which mysticete reproductive rates respond to prey availability and
oceanic conditions.
In this study, we provide details of a decade-long study documenting fluctuations in the reproductive rates of
humpback whales in the waters around Maui, Hawaii. These whales comprise the Hawaii Distinct Population
Segment (DPS) of humpback whales, a new definition that broadly describes the portion of North Pacific
humpback whales that use Hawaiian waters as a breeding ground [44]Current estimates suggest the Hawaii
DPS comprises around 60% of the larger North Pacific population [44,45]Our study was conducted over an
11-year period from 2008 to 2018, in the Au’Au Channel between West Maui and Lanai. This region
comprises primary nursery habitat and is used by approximately 85% of humpback whale mother and calf
pairs in Hawaiian waters over the winter breeding season [46–49]. Data from the first time-period (2008-

Study Site
The study was conducted in shoreline to mid-channel waters, along the eastern portion of the Au’Au
Channel, West Maui (~20°52´N, 156°40´W). The Au’Au channel lies between the islands of Maui and Lanai
and features gently sloping shoreline gradients, maximum water depths of ~150 m and complex mid-channel
topography that includes sea mounts and ridgelines, interspersed between steep-sided sandy basins [50].
The study area (figure 1) was designed to include the range of habitats available in this area, extending from
the Maui shoreline to either the mid– or deepest point of the channel at each minute of latitude, whichever
lay furthest from the Maui shoreline (these locations fell between 8 and 10 km offshore) . Northern and

variations in sightability and sea state across the study area. Lahaina Small Boat Harbor lies within the study
area; this is a key hub for local whale watching and other ocean-tourism related activities. The study area in
total covered 124.5 km-2.

The study spans the years 2008 to 2018, however timing of data collection varied over the course of the

Following the protocols established by Strindberg and Buckland [51], as long as only complete transects are
included, completed transect legs between waypoints comprise independent samples. While more stringent
methods are required for establishing abundance estimates, this survey method provided comparative
encounter rates within the study area, and as identical methods dating back to 2008 were applied, encounter
rates could be compared between different time intervals.
Survey effort varied between years over the course of the study (see Table S3 for full details), reflecting the
different goals of the study during each time period. Within the first survey period (2008-2010), the primary
goal of the study was to establish habitat use patterns within the study area. In order to provide an adequate
sample size to ensure appropriate power during data analysis, multiple surveys of each transect line were
conducted (see Cartwright et al [47]). During 2013-2014 and 2017-2018, the primary goal of this study was to
detect seasonal changes in habitat use. To meet the requirements of this study, surveys were set up to
ensure consistent coverage within the study area during early, mid- and late season over a two year period.
Over the span of the two seasons, the entire set of zig-zag transect lines (86.7 km) was covered within each
of three two-week windows. Cumulatively, this provided three replicates of the entire set of transect lines,
within a two year window. In 2016, the surveys were re-instated with the primary goal being to quantify
temporal changes in sighting rates between years. Essential to this goal was the maintenance of consistent
methods, so that the data could be compared with baseline data compiled previously. Based on distances
covered within each season during the 2103-2104 surveys, a goal of approximately 50 kms coverage along
the original lines was chosen, as this would provide comparable data to that obtained during the 2013
surveys (see table S3). As previously, only completed transect lines could be included. This ensures that
sightings were proportional to the available habitat in the area, as advocated by Strindberg and Burnham
[51], but leads to a small amount of variability in total distance travelled. The two week time windows used
in 2013-2014 were adopted as target time periods. To balance the competing goals of maximizing the sample
size while still replicating the basic survey design established previously, each zig-zag transect was surveyed
at least once. If the goal of covering 50 km had not been met, a single additional line was covered, but no line
was surveyed more than 2 times in any sample period.
Throughout the full extent of the study, two different survey vessels were used throughout the study (a 6 m

Generally, as humpback whales dive they leave a footprint (a vortex of flattened water) that persists at the
surface, so wherever possible, this was used as a marker. Group composition was established following
protocols described in Cartwright et al. 2012 [47]. In brief, calves were identified based on comparative body
size of less than 1/3 of the maternal female’s (mother’s) body length, the mother was recognized by her
close association to the calf. All other whales within 2 body lengths of the mother or other whales in the
group and moving in a coordinated pattern were assumed to be associated and designated as escorts to the
mother and calf group. These are presumed to be male whales, associated in pursuit of potentially seeking
mating opportunities with receptive females [52,53] All other individuals were identified as adults of
rachel 1/5/2019 3:45 PM
unknown gender. Comment [3]: Additional references provided
Groups containing calves spend more time at the surface, so detection probability, g(0), was likely slightly
higher for mother-calf pairs vs. adult animals (based on surface vs. submerged time estimates in Mobley et al
[54], travelling at 9.4 km hr-1, mean g ()0) = 0.313 for adult groups vs. 0.360 for mother-calf groups).

reflect relative, not absolute densities of whales in the region. Still, as effective strip width for humpback
whales on boat based surveys in Californian waters with a set speed of 5 knots has been previously
estimated as 3.2km [55], we assume that sightability within a 1 km strip width within Hawaiian waters would
approach 100%. Fluke photo ID’s (as per [56]) and surface images documenting body markings, lesions and
other scars were compiled for all sighted animals and used post-hoc to eliminate any chance of pseudo
replication over the course of the day, between survey vessels or within regions of over-lap at the beginning
or the end of any successive transects. Any whales that were identified as resights within the same day,
either in the field during data collection or during post-hoc analysis, were recorded only once, at the first
encounter. . Resights between different days were rare (detected in < 2% of sightings) and these were
included in the data set, as the focal estimated rate in this study was not an abundance estimate, rather the

Data analysis
Spatial analysis
A Geographic Information System model (GIS) was constructed using ArcGIS 10.5 (Environmental Systems
Research Institute (ESRI)). A base map was obtained from ESRI
(https://services.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Ocean/World_Ocean_Base/MapServer), and
coastline data came from the Hawaii Data Clearinghouse. Water depth was obtained from the Main Hawaiian
Islands Multibeam Synthesis website and incorporated as a 50 m bathymetric grid
(http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/HMRG/Multibeam/index.php). A 750 m buffer constructed around the survey
line provided coverage of 86% of the study area without overlap between mid-sections of adjacent transects.
As sightings within an estimated 1 km had originally been recorded, this also reduced any potential edge
effect, ensuring that all sightings across the width of the transect strip were captured. Sightings that fell
beyond the buffer were discarded, as were sightings from incomplete transects. Although this did reduce the
sample size slightly, Strindberg and Buckland [51]advocate these steps as a method of maintaining equal
probability coverage across the survey area. For each encounter, water depths were compiled using the
extract values to points function within the spatial analyst toolbox and distance from shore was obtained
using the near function under the proximity tool within the Analysis toolbox.
Encounter rates
Encounter rates were calculated for all surveys, as the number of individual whales encountered (i.e. the
total number of whales in the group, including any calves) and the numbers of groups encountered per km
travelled along the transect lines. Encounter rates were classified by year of sighting and sub-classed by
season (early, mid-, late), and by social composition (mother-calf (MC) vs. adult (A) groups), based on the
presence or absence of a calf in the group.

conditions in the preceding feeding season (i.e. for example; encounter rates for 2008 were associated with
oceanic indices in 2007 feeding season). These advanced indices were then used in the models constructed
(see below).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 24, and R version 3.4.0 [61]). Where standard
parametric and non-parametric inferential tests were used, significance was set at 0.05 and Bonferroni
corrections included where multiple identical tests were conducted. Where models were constructed, model
performance was evaluated based on <U+0394>AICc values and deviance explained, as statistical tests and associated
p-values may be unreliable when used with smaller datasets, such as this [62].

Variations in encounter rates were investigated using series of generalized additive models (GAMs; [63]),
constructed using the “mgcv” package for R [64]. In the first sequence of models temporal trends were
investigated. Separate models were constructed for numbers of individual whales encountered and for
mother-calf groups; encounter rates were used as the response variable while season and year were used as
explanatory variables. Season was included as a factor. Based on the examination of exploratory scatter

GAMs constructed to further explore temporal and seasonal changes in encounter rates indicated that for
encounter rates for all individuals, the best performing models were obtained using year as a smoothed
predictor. Year explained 49.9% of the deviance for encounter rates for individual whales. The smoothed plot

revealed a unimodal non-linear trend, peaking in the winter of 2013. For encounter rates for mother-calf
groups, again year performed best, explaining 64.6% of the deviance, with a similar uni-modal trend over this
period. Notably, season performed better in encounter rates for all individuals vs. mother-calf groups (28.1
vs. 7.5%), inferring that individual encounter rates potentially fluctuated more over the season in comparison
to mother-calf encounter rates. This supports the general trend evident in the data, whereby encounter rates
for adult groups were notably low during late seasons from 2014 onwards.

Modelling results
Results from the GAMs constructed to detect interplay between oceanic indicators and encounter rates
indicated slightly different inferences for all individuals for all individuals including mother-calf pairs vs.
mother-calf groups. Inferences also varied notably between mother-calf and adult only groups.
Notably, in all models, the local mean SST performed poorly, explaining between 0 and 21% of the
variability, and inferring that the encounter rates of any of the specific groups were not influenced by
variation in the local SST. When oceanic indicators were advanced by 1 year, for encounter rates for

inverse, linear relationship (see figure 7).
When oceanic indicators were advanced by two seasons (so 2008 encounter rates were tied to 2006
composite mean summertime values and so forth), for mother-calf groups, the performance of the models
improved considerably: Variability explained by the PDO increased to 66.8%. Likewise the models for the TNI
and ONI indices also improved to 53.2% and 46.2% respectively, however plots were no longer linear,
potentially suggesting a more complex association or possibly an interaction between the indices used.
Unfortunately, the sample size in this study precludes testing these interactions. Encounter rates for all
individual whales reflected the trends described for mother-calf pair. In contrast though, for adult-only
groups, neither the 1 year and 2 year advanced indices performed well, with deviance explaining ranging
from 0 (ONI) to 27% (TNI advanced by 2 years) (see table 5). Potentially, this suggests that trends in
encounter rates for adult only groups are not closely aligned with individual oceanic indices.

5. Discussion
This study describes fine scale patterns of habitat use and changes in encounter rates for humpback whales
in the waters of the Au’Au Channel, West Maui over the last 11 years. This region comprises the favored
breeding area for the newly–designated Hawaiian Distinct Population Segment [44]Over the course of the
study, while fine scale changes in patterns of habitat use within the study area were minimal, we
documented pronounced non-linear fluctuations in encounter rates. Essentially, between 2008 and 2013
encounter rates for individual whales increased, potentially surpassing projected growth estimates for this
population segment (5 to 6.6% per year;[45]). Individual encounter rates peaked in 2013, and then declined
Rachel 12/20/2018 6:34 PM
between 2013 and 2018. However, trends in these declines varied between different social groups. Deleted: E
Encounter rates for adult groups dropped between 2013 and 2014, but then remained relatively consistent
between 2014 and 2018. For mother-calf groups after 2013, encounter rates declined year-by-year through
the end of the study period. Comparing mean encounter rates for two year brackets (2013-2014 vs. 2017-
2018), encounter rates for mother-calf groups fell by 79.4% and looking at changes between individual years,
between 2013 and 2018, rates fell by 92.5% (encounter rates in 2013; 0.40 MC groups km-1, vs. 2018; 0.03
MC groups km-1). These observations stand in stark contrast to recent reports of humpback whale baby
booms documented elsewhere [66].
Is the reproductive rate for the Hawaii DPS in decline?
The changes in encounter rates for mother-calf groups documented here potentially infer that the
reproductive rate for the Hawaii DPS may be in decline. However before reaching this conclusion, several key
issues and questions need to be addressed. A pressing issue is to confirm that the current study was staged
in an area where encounter rates for mother-calf pairs would accurately represent regional trends. The area
where the study was conducted, namely the eastern portion of the Au’Au Channel between the islands of
Maui and Lanai, is currently perceived to be core mother-calf habitat within Hawaiian waters [46–49,67]. The
most recent island-wide aerial surveys, though somewhat outdated, suggest that approximately 85% of
mother-calf groups in the islands are found in the Au’Au Channel [46,54]and females exhibit a preference for
this portion of the Au’Au Channel in the years when they calve [54]. Beyond this focal area, alternate studies
report trends in mother-calf encounter rates that match the findings of this study: For example, a recent
study that included the shorelines of Central and South Maui spanning the years 2014 to 2017, reported that
proportions of mother-calf groups sighted fell from 54% of all group sightings in 2014 to 37% in 2017 [68]. By
comparison, in this study the proportion of mother-calf groups sighted fell from 62% of all groups in 2014 to
41% in 2017. The slight differences likely represent differences in coverage, as Currie et al 2018 [68] included

a higher proportion of deeper, offshore waters in their study area, in comparison to this study. Moreover,
looking across the island chain to the coastal waters along the Kohala coastline of the island of Hawaii, a

and occupancy rates in this area reports declines in the range of 75% for sightings of mother-calf pairs over

Potentially, a localized shift in habitat use could account for these changes. In this study preferred depths for

was based in near shore waters. However, and inIn 2018 season, when encounter rates in the main study are
were exceptionally low , ad-hoc surveys conducted in mid channel waters did not provide any evidence of
higher than expected numbers of mother-calf pairs in this adjacent area (see supplemental table S4).
Likewise, IThe other regional studies referenced ([68], unpublished HMMC study), included more extensive
offshore / deeper waters within their focal study areas, neither study reports any indication of changing
patterns of localized habitat use.

Penguin Banks, a shallow, but remote offshore bank that lies approximately 40 km south of the Island of
Molokai, is recognized as an alternate area that is favored by mother-calf pairs [46]. Unfortunately, reflecting
the remote location and typically rough surface conditions, this region remains un-surveyed in recent years.
Further afield still, within the North-western Hawaiian Island (NWHI) chain, recent acoustic studies have
detected the presence of adult humpback whales [70]. Notably, as mother-calf pairs are acoustically cryptic
[71]they would likely go undetected during acoustic monitoringPrevious researchers have suggested that
protected waters within the NWHI chain were used as breeding grounds during much earlier periods (>300
years ago) when ocean temperatures may have been warmer [72]. Extracted satellite data compiled in this
study indicates that water temperatures within the Au’Au Channel (22.7-25.5oC) currently remain well within
the range used by humpback whales in breeding regions (21-28oC; [73]), . Notwithstanding, further effort to
extend current studies into these more remote areas is certainly warranted.
At this point, while a pronounced habitat shift in mother-calf pairs within Hawaiian waters remains a

assumption that a decline in the reproductive rate of this population segment is ongoing. Feeding grounds

The term carrying capacity is used in many different contexts across the biological literature [76]. In the
context of this study, the term carrying capacity refers to the size of a population when it reaches
equilibrium. At this point, the biotic potential of the population in terms of growth is checked by
environmental resistance and the numbers within the population remain stable [77]. Current studies
demonstrate that, in relation to this definition, carrying capacity is not fixed or static. Rather, carrying
capacity varies both spatially and temporally, as habitat quality or the availability of the key resources
fluctuate over time (e.g. [78–81] Establishing carrying capacity is typically challenging, but as the impacts of
surpassing carrying capacity are generally detrimental, both for the specific population and the habitat that

persisting for longer periods on the feeding grounds prior to migration, and therefore potentially engaged in
searching for food over longer periods [84]and in Hawaii waters, findings from the current study indicate a
reduction in female reproductive rates. All three of these observations comprise declining condition indices,
as described by Eberhardt and Siniff[83]. Based on the decision matrix laid out by [85] this combination of
declining condition indicators alongside declining abundance indicators (numbers of offspring produced or
encounter rates per kilometre), indicate a decline in carrying capacity (i.e. a reduction in size of the
population that can be supported within the current habitat used by the population segment). Causes for
such declines may vary widely. In some instances, changes can be specifically related to the availability of a
single resource (e.g.[80] In this case, given the increased reports of poor condition and malnutrition,

whale prey resources [17,22,28]. Highlighting the mechanistic links that exist between climate anomalies,
physical oceanographic processes and biological resources, these climate anomalies currently provide a
plausible explanation for the recent decline in reproductive rates within the Hawaii DPS documented in this
study.
Understanding the interactions and connectivity between different climate anomalies is certainly complex.

Consequently, we would encourage experts in this field to review the data presented here, as this could Deleted: teleconnections
provide a more nuanced analysis of the connections between fluctuating humpback whale reproductive
rates within local population segments, regional prey availability and recent marine
regime shifts. Future studies that document health indicators, such as body condition, especially in female
humpback whales, will provide valuable insight into the resilience of specific population segments, such as
the Hawaii DPS, as they negotiate the challenges presented as marine systems shift towards a new climate
regime. A better understanding of anthropogenic energetic stressors, such as whale–watching in both
feeding and breeding regions, could elucidate means by which ameliorative management practices could
help minimize maternal stress during this transition.
Humpback whales are widely recognized as a sentinel species [39,60]. Changes in a key life history trait such
as the reproductive rate provide an easily detected signal of other more subtle changes, such as alterations
in prey quality, which in turn may ultimately carry much broader impact. Climatic models have confirmed
that anthropogenic climate change exacerbated the formation of the recent warm water anomaly in the
North Pacific and the associated warming of the Gulf of Alaska [29]. Events like this provide insight into the
functioning and challenges of a warmer ocean and lessons learnt during events such as this may prove to be
exceptionally valuable in the years that lie ahead.
In the meantime, the Hawaii DPS of humpback whales carries considerable ecosystem capital, not only in
terms of ecosystem services [98,99], but also more directly, supporting extensive whale watching and
associated tourism activities in both Alaska and Hawaii. For the purposes of down listing, this species was
divided into separate stocks. NMFS established that the health of one stock should be considered
independently from other groups [44]. Following this line of reasoning, as the current changes described
here meet the trigger requirements laid out in the post delisting monitoring plan [100], we suggest that
increased protection and a review of the status of this stock is clearly justified at this time.

While there was no evidence of any linear trend (Pearson’s CC =0.540, p = 0.087), when pre-2014 SST’s (from
2008 to 2013) are compared to post 2014 SST’s (from 2014 to 2018), the difference between these two
groups was significant (+ 0.6°C; using a two sample t-test; t = -2.952, D.F. = 9, p = 0.016).

Appendix D
Response to reviewers
In response to the comments received, the following changes have been made:
A slight change in the wording of the title has been made. Permission for this
change was requested while the paper was in final review and this change was
agreed to by the editor. The new title is a little less definitive. It better reflects the
content on the study, and allows for the possibility that the direction of changes
seen might change in future years.
The new title reads as follows:
“Fluctuating reproductive rates in Hawaii’s humpback whales, Megaptera
novaeangliae, reflect recent climate anomalies in the North Pacific”
In response to comments from the associate editor:
Comment: I would change this sentence in the abstract to keep all the verbs in
agreement, from “Rates initially increased, tracking projected growth rates for this
population segment, reaching a peak in 2013, and then declining through 2018.”
To “Rates initially increased, tracking projected growth rates for this population
segment, reached a peak in 2013, and then declined through 2018.
The grammatical improvements suggested for the abstract have been made so
that the verbs are in agreement. The new sentence now reads “. Initially rates
increased, tracking projected growth rates for this population segment. Rates
reached a peak in 2013, then declined through 2018.
Additionally, the text “ for humpback whales” in the previous line has been
removed, as it was un-necessary and repetitious. The tense for the final sentence
has also been changed to align with the rest of the abstract.
P5 line 125 – I think you need to add it to the text, maybe after this sentence, “The
study spans the January through March season from 2008 to 2018, however
timing…”
The wording has been changed as suggested, - more specific details on timing have
been added so the sentence now reads “The study spans the wintertime (January
through March) season from 2008 to 2018” . The term wintertime is already in use
elsewhere in the text, so this provides an easy point of reference. The second
segment of the sentence has been edited slightly to maintain the flow of the text
and ensure that the first sentence isn’t too long.
Line 129 – Survey protocols used in 2008 to 2010 were repeated in 2013 and 2014 to
allow comparisons of the results.
Text altered to clarify the meaning as suggested. New text reads “Survey protocols
used in 2008 to 2010 were repeated in 2013 and 2014 to allow comparisons of the
results”.
Line 132 – typo altered
Line 133 – Shouldn’t this be <4 or less than or equal to 3? I understood from your
response that surveys were conducted in Beaufort = 3.
The following statement was included to clarify the constraints placed in survey
conditions. Surveys were conducted in conditions of Beaufort 3 or less – now
stated as Beaufort = 3
Line 305 – In a second set of models, the impact of key oceanic parameters (impact
on what? On variation in whale encounter rates?)
The purpose of the second set of models is now explained. The new text now
reads “In a second set of models, the impact of key oceanic parameters on
variations in encounter rates was explored”. Underlined text was added
Response to reviewer 1 – the typos mentioned in lines 129 and 133 have been
corrected.
Additionally, in reviewing the paper prior to final submission, I noted several places
where small grammatical or minor changes could improve the flow of the text –
these minor changes are listed below:
Line 13 -14 – Abstract – As the study now refers entirely to previous seasons (i.e.
2008 to 2018), I changed the tense and the word order slightly, to reflect this and
keep the tense consistent in the abstract.
Line 69 – change in text so that the word period is not used twice in the same
sentence.
Line 126 –“ over the course of the study” replaced by “between years”
Line 159 –The use of 2017-2018 surveys in the habitat analysis is clarified and
explained on line 282, so here in the method, I have kept to more chronological
overview. I think that this better explains the initial purpose of each the three sets
of surveys.
Line 283 – the following text was added to explain the use of the 2017-2018 survey
data in the habitat analysis. “Survey data from 2017-2018 was also incorporated as
this had been collected following the same protocols”.
Line 562 – the term on-going has been removed
Line 616 – new paragraph break inserted
Line 618 – slight change in word order to improve the flow of the text
Line 625 – Breakdown of a run on sentence.
Line 631 – The original sentence was not well –written, there was a word missing
that made the sentence hard to follow. The new sentence reads as follows:
Supporting this conclusion, the wide range of unusual mortality and mass casualty
events in unrelated fauna reported from across the Gulf of Alaska and connected
marine systems have also been attributed to the reduced productivity and prey
resources currently evident in this region
Line 636 – Heading changed to a question format for consistency throughout the
discussion
Line 654 – small changes in sentence structure to reduce the length of the final
sentence
Line 732 – the order of the final statements has been changed to match the order
provided in the screenshot sent with the decision letter.
Line 744 – full details of permit authorities have been included.
