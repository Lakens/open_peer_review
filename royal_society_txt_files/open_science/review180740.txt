Fan and co-workers have developed a method for the synthesis of cyclic ethers from the
cyclodehydration of 1,n-diols. This reaction was catalyzed by heteropoly acids and conducted
under solvent-free conditions, which is practical and scalable.
The authors have screened different HPAs and the reaction conditions have been optimized. The
substrate scope of this reaction is relatively broad. Although 1f was converted to 3e under the
reaction conditions, which made this method less useful for the synthesis of crown ethers.
Although the HPA catalyzed cyclic ether dehydration is known (Advanced Materials Research
(Durnten-Zurich, Switzerland), 838-841, 2014, 2322-2325), a different HPA Cs2H4P2W18O62 was
used in that study. While the same HPA H3PW12O40 has been used in the dehydration of
methanol to dimethyl ether (ACS Catal. 5, 12, 7186-7193). The authors should have included those
references in the manuscript.
Given that cyclic ethers are important compounds and this method is practical, I still
recommended the present work for publication in Royal Society Open Science after the
manuscript is properly revised as suggested below:
1. The English writing of this manuscript was not acceptable. The authors will need to check the
typo and grammar mistakes.
2. More recent references should be included in the introduction part. For application of crown
ethers, please include this reference Org. Lett. 2018, 20, 3439-3442. For the application of
heteropoly acids as catalyst, please include ACS Catal. 5, 12, 7186-7193 and Advanced Materials
Research (Durnten-Zurich, Switzerland), 838-841, 2014, 2322-2325.
3. More substrates with representative functional groups may be included, such as halides,
amides, esters, nitrile and etc. The readers may also be interested to know whether this conditions
work for the cycloaddition of substrates like 4-bromobutan-1-ol as well.

Heteropoly acids (HPA) are described as efficient catalysts of the dehydrative cyclisation of diols
giving cyclic ethers. The authors screened a set of different catalysts, found the most optimal,
magnified (better to use the term « upscaled ») the reaction, and tested it on a number of different
diols. The reaction will undoubtedly be useful for the chemical community. Therefore, I
recommend it for publication, except the authors address some points in more details. 1. The
authors give the spectral data, but did not establish the purity of the synthesized compounds.
What impurities can be detected in the final products? Gas chromatography would be
instrumental, for example, or at least the NMR spectra should be analysed to clarify this question.
2. It is unclear what is the novelty of the method which was found by the authors. They write: «
reports of cyclodehydration of 1,n-diols to cyclic ethers 1 have been published [22,23]... The
present paper reports the application of HPAs as solid acid catalysts for cyclodehydration of 1, n-
diols to their corresponding cyclic ethers with high yields and high selectivities». Has the
cyclysation been ever tried with the HPA by other authors? What are the advantages over the
other catalysts? Some light is shed on the latter question in the graphical abstract. However, no
information is given for « this work », and the references are odd ([18a-e]). The advantages also

Appendix A
Dear Dr Laura Smith and reviewers:
First we would like to thank the Dr Laura Smith and the
reviewers for the positive and constructive comments and suggestions.
This manuscript was edited for proper English language,
grammar, punctuation, spelling, and overall style by two of the highly
qualified native English speaking editors at NativeEE Company. The
NativeEE Company specializes in editing and proofreading scientific
manuscripts for submission to peer-reviewed journals. The statement
of editing and the file of track changes were uploaded.
Based on your comment and request, we have substantially
revised our manuscript after reading the comments provided by the
reviewers. A document answering every question from the referees
was also summarized and enclosed.
Reviewer 1:
Thank you for your positive and constructive comments and
suggestions.
Fan and co-workers have developed a method for the synthesis of
cyclic ethers from the cyclodehydration of 1,n-diols. This reaction was
catalyzed by heteropoly acids and conducted under solvent-free
conditions, which is practical and scalable.
The authors have screened different HPAs and the reaction conditions
have been optimized. The substrate scope of this reaction is relatively
broad. Although 1f was converted to 3e under the reaction conditions,
which made this method less useful for the synthesis of crown ethers.
Although the HPA catalyzed cyclic ether dehydration is known
(Advanced Materials Research (Durnten-Zurich, Switzerland),
838-841, 2014, 2322-2325), a different HPA Cs2H4P2W18O62 was
used in that study. While the same HPA H3PW12O40 has been used
in the dehydration of methanol to dimethyl ether (ACS Catal. 5, 12,
7186-7193). The authors should have included those references in the
manuscript.
Answer: Thank you for your suggestions. References (Advanced
Materials Research (Durnten-Zurich, Switzerland), 838-841, 2014,
2322-2325; ACS Catal. 5, 12, 7186-7193) has been added in the
revised manuscript (revised manuscript, page 4 line 3, reference 20,
21).
Given that cyclic ethers are important compounds and this method is
practical, I still recommended the present work for publication in
Royal Society Open Science after the manuscript is properly revised as
suggested below:
1. The English writing of this manuscript was not acceptable. The
authors will need to check the typo and grammar mistakes.

Answer: Thank you for your suggestions. We are very interested in
your suggestions. More substrates with representative functional
groups, including halides, amides, esters, nitrile and so on will be done
in our next work.
Reviewer 2:
Thank you for your positive and constructive comments and
suggestions.
Heteropoly acids (HPA) are described as efficient catalysts of the
dehydrative cyclisation of diols giving cyclic ethers. The authors
screened a set of different catalysts, found the most optimal, magnified
(better to use the term « upscaled ») the reaction, and tested it on a
number of different diols. The reaction will undoubtedly be useful for
the chemical community. Therefore, I recommend it for publication,
except the authors address some points in more details.
Answer: Thank you for your positive and constructive comments.
“Magnifying” has been changed to “upscaling” in revised manuscript
(revised manuscript, page 5, line 7; page 7, line 2).
1. The authors give the spectral data, but did not establish the purity of
the synthesized compounds. What impurities can be detected in the
final products? Gas chromatography would be instrumental, for
example, or at least the NMR spectra should be analysed to clarify this
question.
Answer: Thank you for your suggestions. The synthesized compounds
were separated by distillation (revised manuscript, page 5 line 14, 2.4.
The synthetic method of compounds 3a–3j). The purity of the
synthesized compounds was almost more than 99%. The Gas
chromatography spectra of products were given in the revised
supporting information. (revised supporting information, Figs. 19-24)
2. It is unclear what is the novelty of the method which was found by
the authors. They write: « reports of cyclodehydration of 1,n-diols to
cyclic ethers 1 have been published [22,23]... The present paper
reports the application of HPAs as solid acid catalysts for
cyclodehydration of 1, n-diols to their corresponding cyclic ethers with
high yields and high selectivities». Has the cyclysation been ever tried
with the HPA by other authors? What are the advantages over the
other catalysts? Some light is shed on the latter question in the
graphical abstract. However, no information is given for « this work »,
and the references are odd ([18a-e]). The advantages also should be
explained in the text.
Answer: Thank you for your suggestions. Some recent references
were added in revised manuscript (revised manuscript; references 3, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36). The
cyclysation have been tried with the HPA catalysts by others (revised
manuscript, references 34-38). The novelty of the method and
advantages have been explained in revised manuscript (revised
manuscript, page 9 lines 1-10). Catalyst 2a (H3PW12O40) is one of
HPA catalysts and never tried to the cyclodehydration of 1, n-diols
before this work. Catalyst 2a is an inexpensive and simple catalyst.
Cyclodehydration of hexane-1,6-diol gave a higher yield (80%) of
oxepane (80%) than that for other catalyst systems (revised manuscript,
references 34-38). In particular, with 2a as catalyst, the upscaling
experiment with 2a as catalyst generally good yields (664.60 g, 9.23
mol; 92.3% yield) enabled production of THF on the order of 100 g.
This method has prospective applications in the production of THF.
Finally, we appreciate very much for your time in editing our
manuscript and the referees for their valuable suggestions and
comments. I am looking forward to hearing from your final decision
when it is made.
Thank you very much for your attention and consideration.
Sincerely yours
