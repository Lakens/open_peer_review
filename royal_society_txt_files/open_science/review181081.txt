20
21 Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a global health problem, appears in all age groups and affects nearly 15% to 30% people.
22 Baicalin is has been used for the treatment of various allergic diseases including AR. However, the metabolic
23 mechanisms of AR and baicalin against AR were not systematically studied. Here, ovalbumin-sensitized AR rats were
used as model, animal behavior, histological analysis, ELISA method and metabolomics were used to elucidate the
24
mechanism of baicalin for AR. The result indicated that baicalin has a protective effect on allergic rhinitis rats via
25 inhibiting the release of IgE, histamine, IL-1ß, IL-4, IL-6 and TNF-a. In addition, ovalbumin induced AR include
26 arachidonic acid, LTA4, LTB4, a-ketoglutaric acid, PC(20:4/0:0), PC(16:0/0:0), citric acid, fumarate, malate, 3-
27 methylhistidine, histamine and other amino acids were confirmed to be involved in arachidonic acid, histidine
28 metabolism, TCA cycle and amino acid metabolism, and these disorders could be alleviated or reversed by baicalin.

31 2. Introduction
32 Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a type of chronic inflammation in the respiratory tract [1]. It is a very common disease of nasal
33 mucosa, triggered by the interaction of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and ubiquitous environmental proteins in
34 sensitized patients [2]. The main symptoms of AR are sneezing, rhinorrhea, itching and nasal congestion; these symptoms
35 are usually accompanied by other related symptoms such as nasal mucosa swelling [3, 4]. Nowadays, AR appears in all
36 age groups, affect a large part of the global population, is a major public health burden [5]. Epidemiologic data showed
37 that AR affects nearly 15% to 30% people [6, 7].
38 Current studies have predominantly concentrated on cytokines, chemokines such as IL-1ß, TNF-aand IL-4 involved in
39 pathogenesis and process of allergic reactions during AR, but the effective metabolites related to AR still unclear [8, 9]. It
is imperative to explore potential metabolites to systematically indicate the mechanism of AR.
40
Recently, the use of natural products for treating AR has been increasing worldwide; many prior trials have evaluated the
41 effectiveness of herbal medicines for AR [10]. Baicalin, a flavonoid compound isolated from Scutellaria baicalensis
42 Georgi, has been shown to have multiple pharmacological activities including anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory and anti-
43 oxidant activities [2]. Based on its anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory activity, baicalin is widely used to treat various
44 allergic, inflammatory diseases including asthma, atopic dermatitis and AR [11]. However, there is little information
45 about the metabolic mechanism of baicalin on Ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic rhinitis SD rats.
46 In this study, untargeted metabolomics was used to evaluate the metabolic mechanism of allergic rhinitis SD rats, based
47 on this; systematical mechanism of baicalin against OVA-induced AR was explored. This study might provide new
48 insights to understand AR as well as the potential application of baicalin as a drug for AR treatment.
49
50 3. Materials and Methods
51 3.1 Reagents
52 Baicalin was purchased from National Institute for the control of Food and Drug (Beijing, China). HPLC-grade methanol,
53 acetonitrile and formic acid were purchased from Merck (Germany). The ELISA kits for IgE, histamine, IL-4, IL-1ß, IL-6
54 and TNF-a were purchased from Uscn Life Science Inc. (Wuhan, China). OVA, leucine-enkephalin and all the authentic
55 standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

3.2 Animal experiments and sample collection
Male SD rats (200±20 g) were obtained from Liaoning Changsheng Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (Liaoning, China). The
1 animals were maintained under SPF laboratory conditions and received human care according to the guidelines of the
2 Local Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.
3 All SD rats were randomly divided into three groups, with 10 rats in each group: control group, model group and balcalin
4 group. First, the model group and balcalin group were sensitized by OVA by using a standard protocol as previous study
5 [12]. Briefly, the rats were sensitized by OVA via injection on days 1, 5, and 10; from days 15 to 21, the sensitized rats
6 were intranasal challenged by daily droppings with OVA. After the AR models successfully established, the rats of
7 baicalin group were orally administered baicalin for 10 days from days 22 to 31 at dose of 200 mg/kg, which was
8 determined by the reference [2]; while the rats of model group were received saline with the same days. The control
group rats were received saline alone on the same schedule.
9
The numbers of sneezes and nose scratching were counted for 15 minutes after 2 h of the last administration. Then the
10 rats were sacrificed by drawing out all the blood from abdominal aorta to obtain blood samples after isoflurane anesthesia
11 and the nasal mucosa was separated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. The blood samples were
12 centrifuged at 3000×g for 10 min at 4<U+2103> to obtain serum, which was then stored at -80<U+2103> until analysis.
13 3.3 Histological analysis
14 The nasal tissues were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4 µm thickness and stained with hematoxylin and
15 eosin, then analyzed with light microscopy.
16 3.4 Measurement of IgE, histamine, IL-1ß, IL-4, IL-6 and TNF-a level of the serum
17 IgE, histamine, IL-1ß, IL-4, IL-6 and TNF-a level of the serum were determined using ELISA kits according to the
18 manufacturer’s instructions.
3.5 Metabolomics
19
3.5.1 Sample preparation and UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis. The method was established as previously described
20 with minor modification [13]. 200µL Serum was added into 600µL acetonitrile, vortex-mixed for 30s and centrifuged at
21 12,000×g for 5 min to precipitate the proteins. Next, 600µL supernatant was collected and dried with vacuum drying
22 centrifuged at room temperature. Then the dried residue was reconstituted with 100µL of acetonitrile-water (1:1, v/v).
23 After centrifugation at 12,000×g for 5 min, an aliquot of 3µL was injected for UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis.
24 A Waters Acquity UPLC system was used to perform the process. The chromatographic column was HSS T3 column (2.1
25 mm × 100mm, 1.7µm, waters, USA) and the column temperature was maintained at 40 <U+2103>. The mobile phase was:
26 methanol (A) and 0. 1% formic acid (B), gradient elution condition was described as follows: 0 <U+2192> 7 min: 0% <U+2192> 60%A; 7
27 <U+2192> 10 min: 60% <U+2192> 100%A; 10 <U+2192> 14 min: 100%A; 14 <U+2192> 16 min: 100% <U+2192> 0%A; Curve: 6.
28 Mass spectrometry was performed on a Waters Xevo G2 QTOF quadrupole accelerated time of flight mass spectrometer
29 in positive and negative ion mode with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. The desolvation gas was 800 L/hr, the
30 desolvation temperature was 400<U+2103>, the cone gas was 50 L/hr and the temperature of ion source was 110<U+2103>; Capillary
31 voltage, cone voltage, scanning time and collision energy were set as 3.0 kV, 45 V, 1 s and 6 eV, respectively. The
32 spectra were collected every 0.2 s alternately with the interval at 0.02 s, mass rang was from 50 to 1200Da. The m/z
556.2771([M+H]) and 554.2615[M-H] was for LockSprayTM leucine-enkephalin.
33
3.5.2 Data process. The data process was performed as previous. Briefly, the raw MS spectra were analyzed using
34 MarkerLynx version 4.1 (Waters Corp., UK). Then the processed data list was exported and processed by orthogonal
35 partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) using the software package Simca version 14.1 (Umetrics,
36 Sweden).
37 3.6 Statistical analysis
38 All values were expressed as mean±SD. The significance of differences among the means of control, model and baicalin
39 groups was compared through one-way Anova test using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences program (SPSS 20.0,
40 USA). The significance threshold was set at p<0.05 for this test.
41 4. Results and Discussion
42 4.1 Animal behavior study
43 The nasal symptoms of rats were recorded for 15 min. The numbers of nasal sneezes and scratching were significantly
44 increased in model group, while significantly decreased in baicalin group. Scores for groups are shown in Figure 1, the
45 results indicated that the OVA-sensitized rat model was successfully established, and the symptoms can be inhibited by
46 baicalin at dose of 200 mg/kg.
47 4.2 Histological analysis
48 Histological analysis was used to evaluate the pathological changes of nasal mucosa of rats in each group. The nasal
mucosa was arranged neatly and had no abnormality in control group, while a large number of eosinophilic granulocytes
49
infiltrated, and blood stasis was obvious observed in model group, the pathological changes were significantly alleviated
50 by baicalin (Figure 2).
51 4.3 Effects of baicalin on IgE, histamine, IL-1ß, IL-4, IL-6 and TNF-a level in serum
52 To determine the effect of baicalin on AR models, the level of IgE, histamine, IL-1ß, IL-4, IL-6 and TNF-a were
53 measured by ELISA. The level of IgE, histamine, IL-1ß, IL-4, IL-6 and TNF-a in model group were markedly increased
54 than control group; and 200 mg/kg baicalin were significantly decreased the level of IgE, histamine, IL-1ß, IL-4, IL-6 and
55 TNF-a in OVA-sensitized rats. (Figure 3)
56 AR is caused by an IgE-mediated inflammatory reaction, including early- and late-phase allergenic mediators [14].
57 Histamine, as the most iconic indicator of vascular vitality in allergic reactions, is one of the early-phase allergenic
mediators; however, histamine as a detection index still has some limitations, mainly reflected in the short half-life [15,

2 16]. The late-phase allergenic mediators include IL-1ß, IL-4, IL-6, the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-a, which can
3 induce IgE synthesis, play an essential role in AR development [17, 18].
4 4.4 Metabolomics study
Reproducibility of the metabolomics was determined from six replicated analyses of the same quality control sample
5
(QC) interspersed throughout the analysis. And the RSD of the peak area of all metabolites are below 20%, which
6 demonstrated good stability and reproducibility [19]. S-plot analysis was employed to determine the specific variation
7 between control and model groups, while variable importance in the projection (VIP) values (VIP>1) of variables were
8 generated and identified using OPLS-DA analysis [20] among control, model and baicalin groups (Figure 4). According
9 to the above criteria, 35 significantly metabolites related to AR were selected and 32 of these were identified on the basis
10 of retention time and accurate elemental compositions with the available databases such as
11 METLIN(http://metlin.scripps.edu), HMDB(http://www.hmdb.ca), KEGG(http://genome.jp/kegg) (Supplemental Table
12 1). The p-value was set to 0.05 for significantly differential metabolites in this study. Following this, 30 significantly
13 differential metabolites were selected for further study and 21 metabolites were confirmed with available reference
standards by matching their retention time and accurate elemental compositions.
14
As shown in Table 1, the levels of arachidonic acid, palmitic acid acid acid, <U+03B3>-linolenic acid, a- ketoglutaric acid,
15
tetradecanedioic acid, glutamine, PC (20:4/0:0), indoleacrylic acid, betaine, alanine, serine and PC (16:0/0:0) were
16 observed to be significantly decreased in model group (p<0.05); The levels of linoleic acid, hippuric acid, lactic acid,
17 LTB4, citric acid, hydroxyphenyllactic acid, fumarate, malate, 3-methylhistidine, arginine, tyrosine, histamine, N-
18 acetylhistamine, asparagine, valine, LTA4, creatinine were observed to be markedly increased in model group (p<0.05),
19 while administrated with baicalin, the apparent trend of these metabolites is opposite to that of the model group.
20 MetaboAnalyst 4.0 (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca) was used to analysis metabolic pathway, which showed that several
21 pathways such as arachidonic acid metabolism, citrate cycle, histidine metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism and other
22 amino metabolism were disordered when rats in AR status or AR rats administrated with baicalin. (Figure 5)
23 Several altered metabolites are of special interest since they are directly related to allergic diseases. For instance, linoleic
acid (VIP=7.39), which can induces red blood cells and hemoglobin damage via oxidative mechanism, is a critical
24
component of polyunsaturated fatty acids [21], can be converted into <U+03B3>-linolenic acid (VIP=5.73) and arachidonic acid
25 (VIP=12.75). The declined level of<U+03B3>-linolenic acid and elevated levels of linoleic acid and arachidonic acid in model
26 group indicated the linoleic acid metabolism was disordered, while this disorder can be changed by baicalin. Arachidonic
27 acid can generate LTA4 (VIP=3.07) and LTB4 (VIP=2.48) via 5-lipid oxidase pathway, then, LTA4 and LTB4 were
28 increased followed by arachidonic acid in this study which was in accordance with this theory [22]. LTB4, synthesized by
29 LTA4 hydrolase from LTA4 is a leukotriene involved in inflammation, playing an important role in the development of
30 AR [23], these indicated that the arachidonic acid metabolism was also disordered in our study, and with the high VIP,
31 arachidonic acid might be used as specific candidate biomarker for AR. Histamine (VIP=1.78) was detected by ELISA
32 method but also identified and determined by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS, moreover, N-acetylhistamine (VIP=1.61) and 3-
methylhistidine (VIP=5.84) generated from histamine were also identified and determined. To our interesting, histamine
33
was described as “gold standard” for allergic reaction[24], but in this study, the VIP value of histamine was not specific,
34 which may be related to the short half-life of histamine[18]; on the contrary, 3-methylhistidine with high VIP may be able
35 to regard as new indicator for the early-phase allergenic mediators.
36 Furthermore, a large number of amino acids were significantly altered during AR status. Our result suggested that rats
37 sensitized by OVA may consume a lot of energy to fight with AR than normal rats, the abnormal changes such as
38 fumarate, malate and a- ketoglutaric acid belonging to citrate cycle confirm this view. Citric cycle, as the linkage among
39 sugar, lipids and amino acid metabolism, is the most important energy source for body [25]. Besides, other amino acids
40 are substrates for metabolic energy, which could be used for specific protein, peptide and other nitrogenous compounds
41 synthesis [26]. In addition, the abnormal changes of PC (20:4/0:0) and PC (16:0/0:0), as the precursor of LysoPC, which
has been confirmed to be a chemo-attractant for T lymphocytes showed that the OVA-sensitized rats are in inflammation
42
state [27].
43 A similar study about AR treated by baicalin had recently published by another group using guinea pigs. The study
44 focused on the IgE, histamine and inflammatory cytokines, and results suggested that baicalin may be a useful drug in the
45 treatment of AR, was the same as our results. Additionally, the index IL-8 was replaced with IL-4 in this study; a
46 randomized double-blind trial with allergic rhinitis showed that IL-4 is important in regulating IgE-mediated allergy[28,
47 29]; IL-4 could also significantly amplify itching symptoms such as histamine[30], therefore, IL-4 is more closely
48 associated with AR. Besides, the metabolic mechanism of AR and the systematical mechanism of baicalin against OVA-
49 sensitized AR were explored in this study, other allergy mediators which were specific to allergic rhinitis should be
50 detected and identified, the different time periods mechanism of baicalin on allergic rhinitis needs to be further studied.
51
52
53 5. Conclusion
54 Our studies indicated that baicalin has a protective effect on rats with AR by inhibiting the release of inflammatory
55 mediators. Furthermore, metabolomics were applied to study the AR induced by OVA and the mechanism of baicalin on
AR systematically. We concluded baicalin anti-AR not only suppressed the productions of inflammatory mediators, but
56
also regulated arachidonic acid metabolism, citrate cycle, histidine metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism and other amino
57 acid metabolism.

Appendix B
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and the reviewers’ comments concerning our
manuscript entitled “Metabolomics analysis of baicalin on ovalbumin
sensitized allergic rhinitis rats” (ID: RSOS-181081). The comments
are all valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our paper,
as well as the important guiding significance to our researches. We
have studied comments carefully and have made correction which we
hope meet with approval. Revised portion are marked in red in the
paper. The main corrections in the paper and the responds to the
comments are as following:

Associate Editor's comments:
Please ensure that you fully respond to the referee commentary, in
particular their observation that the quality of the writing needs to be
improved. While we sympathise with the complexities and
idiosyncrasy of the English language, you may benefit from the advice
of services such as these:
https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/language-polishing/.
Response: Now the manuscript is fully edited by American Journal
Experts (AJE) and the certify had been upload.
Editor comments:
Thanks for your submission. Please make sure that this manuscript is
fully edited by an expert who is a native speaker of English (a very
difficult language! sorry). We can only publish the paper if the
language is up to the standards of the journal. Best of luck.
Response: Now the manuscript is fully edited by American Journal
Experts (AJE) and the certify had been upload.
Reviewer #1:
1. Acroynms should be better defined in the abstract and introduction.
E.g. IL-4, SD
Response: Sorry, now corrected.
2. S-plot and OPLS-DA analysis were used in this study, the software
package Simca version 14.1 (Umetrics, Sweden) was used to process
OPLS-DA analysis, author should defined which software was used to
process S-plot analysis, Masslynx or Simca version 14.1.
Response: Sorry, Simca version 14.1 was used to process S-plot
analysis, now added.
3. Author had demonstrated “Reproducibility of the metabolomics was
determined from six replicated analyses of the same quality control
sample (QC) interspersed throughout the analysis. And the RSD of the
peak area of all metabolites are below 20%, which demonstrated good
stability and reproducibility” at the part of 4.4 Metabolomics study, the
figure of PCA analysis(including QC data) should be provided in the
supplemental materials.
Response: Now added.
Special thanks to you for your good comments.
Reviewer #2:
First of all, thank you for your affirmation and suggestions.
1. The research part is well-organized, with clear and detailed
step-by-step methods. However, the language quality is not
satisfactory and required to be improved. My remarks/queries to the
authors are as the attached file.
Response: Considering the Reviewer’s suggestion, the manuscript is
fully edited by American Journal Experts (AJE) and the certify had
been upload.
Once again, thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.
Thank you and best regards.
Yours sincerely,
Yubin Xu
