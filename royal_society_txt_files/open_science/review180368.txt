In this work the crystallography of the classical ferroelectric perovskite KNbO3 is revisited.
Results of previous studies are validated, and significantly better accuracy is provided, which is
the main benefit offered to the readers.
The authors need to explain why in Fig. 1, peak splitting is observed in the cubic polymorph.

The manuscript describes a detailed study of the temperature dependent structural phase
transitions of KNbO3 using x-ray diffraction. The phase transitions have been well reported in
the past and the manuscript adds to the current science base by providing detailed lattice
parameter trends as a function of temperature. In this sense I think it is suitable for publication in
RS open science. I only have a couple of minor points that would make the work clearer and
more accessible.
1. I assume the 1. In the summary is indicating that the transitions are first order. It would be nice
to write first instead of 1. so that it is accessible to readers perhaps not familiar with this notation.
Additionally it is not really discussed in the results and discussion that the transitions are first
order which would be nice.
2. In the Rietveld refinements shown in figure 1 it is conventional to show the observed,
calculated and difference. The calculated plot is currently missing from these refinements and
should be added as it enables the reader to see the fit in a more typical way.
3. There are no details provided for the refinements, goodness-of-fit parameters, refined
parameters with errors etc? Will this be made available?

Dear Dr Grande:
Title: Thermal evolution of the crystal structure and phase transitions of KNbO3
Manuscript ID: RSOS-180368
Thank you for submitting the above manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. On behalf of the
Editors and the Royal Society of Chemistry, I am pleased to inform you that your manuscript will
be accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science subject to minor revision in accordance
with the referee suggestions. Please find the reviewers' comments at the end of this email.
The reviewers and handling editors have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, I invite you to respond to the comments and revise your
manuscript.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript within 7 days (i.e. by the 27-Apr-2018). If you do not think
you will be able to meet this date please let me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
4
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.

red to the readers.
authors need to explain why in Fig. 1, peak splitting is observed in the cubic polymorph.
Cu X-ray source is not monochromatic and particularly at high 2 angles each Bragg reflection two
ections are visible due to the two main wavelength of the X-ray source. This appear quite often in the
ature since Cu is the most used XRD source.

itionally it is not really discussed in the results and discussion that the transitions are first order
ch would be nice.
have replaced “1. order” with “first order2 through the entire manuscript.
first order nature of the two transitions observed are argued based on the volume change (Fig. 2)
the observed hysteresis. We do not see other arguments we could use to discuss the order of the
sition. We have revised the manuscript to make this clearer.
In the Rietveld refinements shown in figure 1 it is conventional to show the observed, calculated
difference. The calculated plot is currently missing from these refinements and should be added as
nables the reader to see the fit in a more typical way.
1 is modified to include both the measured and calculated diffraction patterns.
There are no details provided for the refinements, goodness-of-fit parameters, refined
ameters with errors etc? Will this be made available?
parameters from the refinements are now available together with the raw data at
