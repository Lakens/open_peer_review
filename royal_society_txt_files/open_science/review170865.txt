The manuscript entitled “Photophysical studies …… . . . .. .. … quenching and imaging” by
Vasudevan and Prabhune reports an interesting work, but suffers due to lack of proper literature
review and critical discussion. I recommend for a major revision before accepting for publication.
Major concerns:
Literature work has been poorly done. There is no discussion and citation of interaction of
curcumin with other biosurfactant such as rhamnolpids available in literature, it is important
because Sophorolipid resembles very close to rhamnolpids in its structure. Please refer to Journal
of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology, 173, 307-317, 2017.
The UV-visible and fluorescence spectral of curcumin in sophorolipid reported in the manuscript
is also similar to curcumin in other similar micellar nanostrcutures, such as bile salt, discuss this
in results as discussion citing Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces, 110, 296 – 304, 2013 and the
obtained stabilization of curcumin in sophorolipid is similar to earlier report in liposomes system,
see Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 117, 9699 – 9708, 2013. Including this citation and discussing
will enhance the quality and critical aspect of present presentation.
---“The photophysical properties of curcumin are extensively studied in different solvents and
systems like micelles[24–27], polymeric nanoparticles[28], cyclodextrin[29–31] and bovine serum
albumin[32,33].”--- Some other photophysical study of curcumin in liposomes (Journal of
Physical Chemistry B, 117, 9699 – 9708, 2013), microcapsules (Microchimica Acta, 180, 59 – 64,
2013), nanocapsules (RSC Advances, 4, 8317 – 8320, 2014) and polymeric systems (Journal of
Physical Chemistry C, 120 (20), 11210-11224, 2016) are missing from citations.
---“As curcumin is water insoluble and aggregates, it shows an entirely different absorption and
fluorescence peak as compared to the solubilized form.”--- This statement needs reference. In fact,
fluorescence spectrum of curcumin in solution has been reported to be due to excited state
hydrogen transfer, please see all the references given in RSC Advances, 4, 8317 – 8320, 2014. By
large it is accepted that fluorescence of curcumin is due to ESPT, which also the authors correctly
emphasize in discussion about fluorescence lifetime.
Excitation 350 nm actually excites Keto form or n-pi* transition of curcumin rather than more
populated enol from, thus, quantum yield measurement is not accurate in this wavelength. It is
better to carry out at 420/425 nm excitation using another reference material (not quinine
sulphate)
Minor concerns:
Title can be more specific instead of general in nature.
Language should be improved.
Figure caption should be elaborate.
Instead of wt % or g/mL use concentration in moles/liter
Lifetime value of curcumin without Sophorolipid should be given in Table 1. Same for Table 2.
Figure 2 and 4 should be combine as one Figure. Similarly, for Figure 3 and 5.

Comments to authors
In the present manuscript, curcumin-sophorolipid nanostructures have been synthesized for
quorum imaging. The manuscript is well written but requires major changes. The corrections
needed are as follows:
1) Authors are advised to thoroughly re-check the entire manuscript for grammatical errors
and sentence formation. Hence, it is strongly required that the authors should improve the
level of English to the required standard.
2) From the absorption spectra of CUASL, the peak shifting is not clear. I cannot see the 420
nm peak clearly. Provide suitable explanation.
3) The number of particles in TEM images are less and hence the average size cannot be
ascertained clearly. Provide a TEM image in which the size calculation will be based on
atleast 25 particles. Then on that basis plot a histogram for average size distribution.
4) Provide FTIR data for CUASL with appropriate controls for determining the functionality
and interaction.
5) Comment on the mechanism of uptake of CUASL by bacterial cells.
6) “Curcumin was shown to be used as fluorescent biomarker mammalian uptake studies by
using different solvents”. The supporting data is missing.

RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS’ COMMENTS
We thank the reviewers for providing their comments on the manuscript. The comments have
helped us further improve our manuscript. We have addressed the reviewers’ comments below.
Reviewer#1:
The manuscript entitled “Photophysical studies …… . . . .. .. … quenching and imaging” by
Vasudevan and Prabhune reports an interesting work, but suffers due to lack of proper
literature review and critical discussion. I recommend for a major revision before accepting
for publication.
Major concerns:
Literature work has been poorly done. There is no discussion and citation of interaction of
curcumin with other biosurfactant such as rhamnolpids available in literature, it is important
because Sophorolipid resembles very close to rhamnolpids in its structure. Please refer to
Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology, 173, 307-317, 2017.
The CUASL is discussed by comparing the rhamnolipid system as suggested by the reviewer.
The UV-visible and fluorescence spectral of curcumin in sophorolipid reported in the
manuscript is also similar to curcumin in other similar micellar nanostructures, such as bile
salt, discuss this in results as discussion citing Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces, 110,
296 – 304, 2013 and the obtained stabilization of curcumin in sophorolipid is similar to
earlier report in liposomes system, see Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 117, 9699 – 9708,
2013. Including this citation and discussing will enhance the quality and critical aspect of the
present presentation.
The above-mentioned references and appropriate discussion (red font) are included in the result
discussion of the UV-Visible and fluorescence spectroscopy.
---“The photophysical properties of curcumin are extensively studied in different solvents and
systems like micelles[24–27], polymeric nanoparticles[28], cyclodextrin[29–31] and bovine
serum albumin[32,33].”--- Some other photophysical study of curcumin in liposomes (Journal
of Physical Chemistry B, 117, 9699 – 9708, 2013), microcapsules (Microchimica Acta, 180,
59 – 64, 2013), nanocapsules (RSC Advances, 4, 8317 – 8320, 2014) and polymeric systems
(Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 120 (20), 11210-11224, 2016) are missing from citations.
The references are added appropriately and marked in red fonts in the revised manuscript.
---“As curcumin is water-insoluble and aggregates, it shows an entirely different absorption
and fluorescence peak as compared to the solubilized form.”--- This statement needs a
reference. In fact, the fluorescence spectrum of curcumin in solution has been reported to be
due to excited state hydrogen transfer, please see all the references given in RSC Advances, 4,
8317 – 8320, 2014. By large it is accepted that fluorescence of curcumin is due to ESPT, which
also the authors correctly emphasize in a discussion about fluorescence lifetime.
That statement was written based on the experimental results obtained in our previous
manuscripts and current work. As can be seen in the UV-Visible and fluorescence spectra,
curcumin in water shows 24nm peak shift when compared with curcumin in sophorolipid. The
appropriate reference was added to substantiate that statement.
Excitation 350 nm actually excites Keto form or n-pi* transition of curcumin rather than more
populated enol from, thus, quantum yield measurement is not accurate in this wavelength. It is
better to carry out at 420/425 nm excitation using another reference material (not quinine
sulphate)
Authors do agree with the reviewer’s suggestion but there are previous reports where they have
used quinine sulphate to understand the curcumin’s interaction with different solvents. The
current manuscript used the reference, Khopde et al. 2000 Effect of solvent on the excited-state
photophysical properties of curcumin. Photochem. Photobiol. 72, 625–631 to calculate the
quantum yield .
Minor concerns:
The title can be more specific instead of general in nature.
The authors feel the title is appropriate, as it broadly covers the concepts that are present in the
manuscript.
Language should be improved.
The authors have thoroughly checked the manuscript for grammatical errors and reframed
sentences for better clarity.
Figure caption should be elaborate.
Figure captions are elaborated as per the suggestions.
Instead of wt % or g/mL use concentration in moles/liter
This unit was taken to be in consistent with our previous report on the gelation of silk fibroin
using sophorolipid. (Parul et al. 2017, Biomacromolecules).
Lifetime value of curcumin without Sophorolipid should be given in Table 1. Same for Table
2.
In table 1, the lifetime values for curcumin in water is added. The quantum yield and kinetic
parameters were not calculated as the absorbance was not observed in curcumin- water.
Figure 2 and 4 should be combined as one Figure. Similarly, for Figure 3 and 5.
Figure 2 and 4 are combined, but the authors feel figure 3 and figure 5 explains different
concepts. Hence they are not combined.
Reviewer#2 :
In the present manuscript, curcumin-sophorolipid nanostructures have been synthesized for
quorum imaging. The manuscript is well written but requires major changes. The corrections
needed are as follows:
1) Authors are advised to thoroughly re-check the entire manuscript for grammatical errors and
sentence formation. Hence, it is strongly required that the authors should improve the level of
English to the required standard.
The manuscript was thoroughly checked for grammatical mistakes and sentences have been
reframed.
2) From the absorption spectra of CUASL, the peak shifting is not clear. I cannot see the 420nm
peak clearly. Provide suitable explanation.
Curcumin is insoluble in water and form aggregates. Hence the absorption spectra for curcumin
in water cannot be seen clearly. A similar trend was seen in our previous publication (Darne et
al. 2017. RSC Adv.)
3) The number of particles in TEM images is less and hence the average size cannot be
ascertained clearly. Provide a TEM image in which the size calculation will be based on at least
25 particles. Then on that basis plot a histogram for average size distribution.
For obtaining TEM image, the solution is diluted 100 times and since the CUASL system is
dynamic, it is quite difficult to capture an image with minimum 25 particles.
4) Provide FTIR data for CUASL with appropriate controls for determining the functionality
and interaction.
We did do FTIR but since the dominance of water was more, the spectrum peaks were not
clear. Also, the curcumin is encapsulated in sophorolipid and there is hydrophobic interaction
as shown in our previous manuscript (Pradeep et al. 2016, RSC Adv.). In order to understand
the interactions in detail, we have done photophysical studies which are more fitting than the
conventional methods with respect to curcumin since it exhibits strong fluorescence upon
solubilization.
5) Comment on the mechanism of uptake of CUASL by bacterial cells.
The probable mechanism of uptake is discussed in the confocal microscopy section.
6) “Curcumin was shown to be used as fluorescent biomarker mammalian uptake studies by
using different solvents”. The supporting data is missing.
The appropriate references to this statement are added.
