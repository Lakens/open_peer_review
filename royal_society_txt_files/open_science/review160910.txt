Comments to ”Leaving safety to visit a feeding site: is it optimal to hesitate while exposed?”
This is a stochastic dynamic programming model about an interesting topic: how should an
animal trade off predation risk versus starvation risk. In classic OFT risk-sensitive foraging deals
exclusively with the risk of not finding a sufficient amount of food or energy. This model is a
more modern and appropriate version this topic; here predation risk and starvation risk are
incorporated in the same optimisation, hence this could be called “true risk-sensitive foraging” or
something such. If I had written this manuscript, I would have stressed this more than the
hesitation part as this could be the most important contribution of this model.
My next point may be a bit philosophical, but are the results really showing hesitation? To me
hesitation is failure or delay in making a decision. In this model turning around or stopping half-
way to the food source is the optimal decision. For example, if a forager that approaches a food
source would stop in order to scan for predators at some distance from the food this is a correct
optimal decision, not hesitation. Maybe stopping, turning back or dawdling can be called
hesitation because it looks that way, but in this type of model a behaviour is always optimal. If
Turning or stopping occurs when a predator appears this must be truly optimal.
Even though I think that this model is important and that the problem is an interesting one, this
manuscript feels like a project rather than a focussed, finalized manuscript. Why are these
parameters chosen? Are they realistic in relation to each other? The lack of realistic
parametrisation makes the results hard to evaluate. Will the three policies ever occur in nature? A
decreasing or intermediate policy sounds plausible, but under what conditions would a blue tit
use an increasing policy? It would be very helpful if you could exemplify your choice of
parameters in words, for example “fat bird in low predation/high food abundance habitat” and
plot this as a function of distance.
Also, it is a question in a model such as this how clear the differences are between the various
policies. A small green isolated square such as the one at the lower left side of figure 2d suggests
that the differences in optimality between the various behaviours is very small, maybe on the
scale of the last decimal in a double-precision float? Figure 2b looks more like if differences are
clear here.
If you choose to focus on the three policies you should explain more clearly what they mean. Are
they applicable to real birds? When would we expect them to occur? What is the main reason for
their differences?
A small detail: figure 1 is not be the best illustration for this model. This may not be that
important but I cannot refrain from remarking on this. The food source side of it is OK, a bird
such as a blue tit going to a bird feeder. This is a concentrated source of food at a known distance.
The choice of predator is funny, looks like a peregrine hunting blue tits. Neither peregrines (nor
hobbies) would hunt in arboreal habitats, a sparrowhawk would be more appropriate. Also, the
“safe refuge” side of the illustration feels more like a fox-rabbit system than a passerine bird-
airborne predator system. A bird such as a blue tit does not have a safe refuge, it will not enter a
tree hole or nest box. If attacked by a sparrowhawk it will try to escape by evasive manoeuvres.
The safest habitat for a blue tit will be dense foliage or such. The safety here consists of a small
probability of being spotted. Once spotted, this habitat is no longer safe. It may be safe for an
immobile bird perching there, but it is not a completely safe refuge. A completely safe refuge is
more appropriate for a rabbit or vole that can escape into its underground burrow when
attacked.
Detailed comments:
Line 74: “some consideration” is an understatement here as it is a main topic of most of these
models. These dynamic programming models are summarized in Brodin 2006…
Line 130: What is a policy? If a threshold it is increasing or decreasing over the whole distance to
the food I can see this as something general, a policy, but do you also call optimal behaviour for a
single time step “policy”? In that case, wouldn’t optimal behaviour be better to separate these
3
two concepts?
Line 135: Did you test-run predation in the forward iteration? A comparison of the proportion
predated with the value of V in the backward iteration would be a good test that the algorithm is
not leaking probabilities…
Line 157-158: Couldn’t it stop in one period and turn around in the next?
Line 193-202. This sounds very reasonable. It is hard to evaluate, however, which parts of figure 2
that are important. Where in this figure would individuals occur in the forward iteration? Is it
possible, for example, that an animal that should move homewards should have stayed there and
never have moved away from the refuge?
Line 220: Compared to the maximum amount of energy reserves it occurs to be a small jump…
Line 301: What do you mean here, different values of D?
Line334: Food supple? I assume you mean supply.
Line 380: This is true!
Page 18-19: Could you explain the notation on the summation marks clearer? I read it as
summation of K of K over K. From what? Zero to K?
Line 645: What did the sensitivity analyses tell you? Is the effect of variable values important
when the parameters are arbitrary?
Figure 4 was very hard to read, some error with line numbers here.
The equations look sound, maybe you can use the same equation for intermediate locations, the
food source and the refuge by defining V as zero for non-possible behaviours?

This manuscript reports the results of a modelling study of the optimal behaviour of animals
travelling to and from a feeding site. Whilst patch use and central-place foraging are well studied,
optimal behaviour under the risk of predation whilst travelling has been overlooked The author
uses an appropriate methodology, state-dependent dynamic programming, to address this gap. I
found the question interesting and the manuscript very well written. I have identified some
potential issues with the particulars of the approach, and feel that presentation of predictions
could be clearer, which would increase the value of this new theory.

The author makes a laudable effort to make the manuscript accessible by an extensive verbal
description of the model that leaves out mathematical details. However, this might have gone a
little far. Some readers would like to clearly see how sigma affects risk, and how energy reserves
change, because the current wording does not capture this unambiguously. One consequence of
omitting details is that the two kappas and two gammas are undefined, despite appearing in the
legend of Figure 2.
The model makes some interesting predictions, but they are a little obscured by the stochastic
approach to parameter exploration. The author chose to run thousands of analyses with
randomly selected parameter values. I'm not completely convinced of the value of this, as
opposed to a systematic exploration using a grid of values. One of the benefits of this would be to
ease the display of the interactions between parameter values: Figure 3 shows their individual
effects, but it is likely that their relative values is what matters. For example, it is likely that the
ratio of gamma to kappa (energy gain to energy use) determines behaviour, not their absolute
values.
One consequence of the current presentation is that the reader does not know whether the policy
type and animal fatness are confounded. Figure 2 suggests that increasing policies occur when
more fat must be stored. Is this actually always the case? It would be useful to make clear
predictions about when we expect animals to be fatter, and when we expect then to have longer
foraging bouts, for example.
As the author points out, the policies actually lie on a continuum (between decreasing and
increasing), so I wasn't sure of the value of categorising their behaviour (Table 1), especially since
the policy cannot be directly observed. It would be preferable to plot the relationship between
parameters (which we may manipulate) and behaviour (which we can observe).
One potentially important extra parameter is the relative predation risk at the feeding site
compared to the intermediate points; we might see more dawdling if foraging is riskier than
travelling, which might happen if predators make sensible decisions.
Most importantly, I am concerned that one of the main conclusions of the manuscript follows
from an unrealistic assumption. The author discusses how under some policies the animal should
not return always to the refuge, but rest at an intermediate point. This occurs because there is no
benefit to activities other than foraging, so the animal just waits until reserves drop to the
threshold. This assumption makes sense under some conditions (e.g. survival over a long period
in winter when time steps are long, such as hours), but in most situations animals have other
things to do than eating, such as signalling territory ownership, social bonding behaviour,
sleeping, etc. In such a case, the animal should return to the refuge to increase its fitness. I found
myself wondering whether the predictions would be the same if the animal received a fitness
payoff when not foraging, perhaps when also in the refuge, and the policy maximises the sum of
these fitness payoffs before death, rather than just maximising survival. Most obviously, we
would expect animals to avoid dawdling, because it wastes (potentially useful) time, so we might
not get the prediction shown in Figure 4.

Figure 3d seems unnecessary: it is not very different to Figure 3c and it is little discussed, and in
any case might just be a grid effect.

This is a stochastic dynamic programming model about an interesting topic: how should an

exclusively with the risk of not finding a sufficient amount of food or energy. This model is a more
modern and appropriate version this topic; here predation risk and starvation risk are

something such. If I had written this manuscript, I would have stressed this more than the
hesitation part as this could be the most important contribution of this model.
Wow – thank you for the kind compliment of suggesting this could be ‘true risk-sensitive
foraging’ J! However, I’m wary of trying to sell this as a more modern version of OFT as I don’t
feel this manuscript goes far enough to justify that. My intentions with this manuscript are
genuinely to try and explore/advertise the observation that this pausing behaviour can occur, so I
kindly beg to differ with the reviewer here, and keep the focus I originally gave.
My next point may be a bit philosophical, but are the results really showing hesitation? To me
hesitation is failure or delay in making a decision. In this model turning around or stopping half-
way to the food source is the optimal decision. For example, if a forager that approaches a food
source would stop in order to scan for predators at some distance from the food this is a correct
optimal decision, not hesitation. Maybe stopping, turning back or dawdling can be called
hesitation because it looks that way, but in this type of model a behaviour is always optimal. If
Turning or stopping occurs when a predator appears this must be truly optimal.
This is a useful point, but I am quite happy to use the word hesitation here to mean the
momentary stopping behaviour seen here: it’s only used in the title (where I think it is appropriate
to use a word to describe stopping for a while in a place that doesn’t seem right), and in the
context of ‘hesitancy’ as reported in fish experiments, where the behaviour seen is extremely
similar to what is seen in the fish.
Even though I think that this model is important and that the problem is an interesting one, this
manuscript feels like a project rather than a focussed, finalized manuscript. Why are these
parameters chosen? Are they realistic in relation to each other? The lack of realistic
parametrisation makes the results hard to evaluate. Will the three policies ever occur in nature?
A decreasing or intermediate policy sounds plausible, but under what conditions would a blue tit
use an increasing policy? It would be very helpful if you could exemplify your choice of
parameters in words, for example “fat bird in low predation/high food abundance habitat” and
plot this as a function of distance.
The model is unashamedly unattached to a specific system, but rather was conceived to explore
the behaviours that individuals make when they are travelling between points of interest in an
environment that isn’t particularly dangerous (putting my cards on the table, this was originally
conceived for shoaling fish moving slowly from a refuge to a foraging site in bursts of
movement). I genuinely think the interesting thing here is the fact that you get hesitation with
bursts of behaviour, and that you get individuals failing to return to safety. I am very reluctant to
label parameter sets for specific species here because I am not convinced that what I present in
the current model is fine-scale enough for any particular system to make a prediction
meaningful. Rather, there I think the important result here is that there is a qualitative prediction
that a specific repeatable behaviour (both the hesitation and the stop-start approach) might be
observable and explainable. I am hoping to produce a number of models that are aimed much
more specifically at known systems, but what I give here is purely a prospective attempt to
justify some more precise work.
Also, it is a question in a model such as this how clear the differences are between the various
policies. A small green isolated square such as the one at the lower left side of figure 2d
suggests that the differences in optimality between the various behaviours is very small, maybe
on the scale of the last decimal in a double-precision float? Figure 2b looks more like if
differences are clear here.
Figure 2d was included as an indicator that some policies observed threw out a little bit of ‘kink’
similar to what was given in the figure – a few cases make this additional lump a bit bigger, but it
is very unlikely that the foraging animal is ever going to spend very much time with its state
variables within this region. As reviewer #2 rightly suggests (very last comment in this
document), this region is most likely a computational artefact
If you choose to focus on the three policies you should explain more clearly what they mean. Are
they applicable to real birds? When would we expect them to occur? What is the main reason for
their differences?
Please see my earlier response: I don’t think this model is parameterisable as it stands. From my
perspective, the policies described fell out of the model as being three very distinct forms, so it
makes sense to describe them in some detail. However, it is the behaviours that result from
these policies that is what we are going to observe when we watch animals emerging from
shelter, and so the focus of the discussion shifts towards that rather than the policy forms
themselves.
A small detail: figure 1 is not be the best illustration for this model. This may not be that
important but I cannot refrain from remarking on this. The food source side of it is OK, a bird
such as a blue tit going to a bird feeder. This is a concentrated source of food at a known
distance. The choice of predator is funny, looks like a peregrine hunting blue tits. Neither
peregrines (nor hobbies) would hunt in arboreal habitats, a sparrowhawk would be more
appropriate. Also, the “safe refuge” side of the illustration feels more like a fox-rabbit system
than a passerine bird-airborne predator system. A bird such as a blue tit does not have a safe
refuge, it will not enter a tree hole or nest box. If attacked by a sparrowhawk it will try to escape
by evasive manoeuvres. The safest habitat for a blue tit will be dense foliage or such. The safety
here consists of a small probability of being spotted. Once spotted, this habitat is no longer safe.
It may be safe for an immobile bird perching there, but it is not a completely safe refuge. A
completely safe refuge is more appropriate for a rabbit or vole that can escape into its
underground burrow when attacked.
In retrospect, I can see why figure 1 may be confusing! It was added in response to a suggestion
from a reviewer on an earlier version, but I think it makes more sense to remove it here as it
looks like it may simply end up confusing the intended empirical audience, and its inclusion is
not essential. Removing it keeps the manuscript focussed as a theoretical investigation (and
there are now only a few throwaway suggestions in the abstract and suggestion tying this to
birds in particular). Thanks for the honest opinion!
Detailed comments:
Line 74: “some consideration” is an understatement here as it is a main topic of most of these
models. These dynamic programming models are summarized in Brodin 2006…
I don’t agree with you here, but I suspect this might be through a bit of miswording on my part.
Yes, all of these dynamic programming models definitely consider the trade-off between
starvation and predation (and I have added a reference to Brodin 2007 here, which I think is the
review paper you are referring to), but what I mean to say here is that there has been little focus
in these models on explicitly moving between a safe site and an exposed site, rather than
showing a behavioural change where it is implicitly assumed that they are safe or exposed.
Line 130: What is a policy? If a threshold it is increasing or decreasing over the whole distance to
the food I can see this as something general, a policy, but do you also call optimal behaviour for
a single time step “policy”? In that case, wouldn’t optimal behaviour be better to separate these
two concepts?
A policy here is the full set of immediate optimal decisions an individual makes at a moment in
time dependent upon its energy reserves, location, and current predator experience. I’m fairly
certain I have described this in the correct manner.
Line 135: Did you test-run predation in the forward iteration? A comparison of the proportion
predated with the value of V in the backward iteration would be a good test that the algorithm is
not leaking probabilities…
I hadn’t thought of doing this – it’s an interesting idea. I’ve run out of time to rewrite the code to
implement this, but have given the predator-free code I ran some close scrutiny to make sure
that I haven’t made any silly mistakes. I’m not fully certain that the comparison suggested would
be useful though: as the Houston & McNamara models ‘small bird in winter’ models suggest,
changing predation risks leads to an observed change in the proportion of a population that
starves, and vice versa, and so a direct comparison of the predation risk experienced and the
actual forward-run population predation probability may not be the same thing.
Line 157-158: Couldn’t it stop in one period and turn around in the next?
Yes, but that has been accounted for in the rest of the paragraph (so I say that they are
‘considered to be moving either homewards or outwards’, and then define all possible
sequences of actions such that a pausing behaviour will still count as homewards or outwards).
So, no need to change anything here.
Line 193-202. This sounds very reasonable. It is hard to evaluate, however, which parts of figure
2 that are important. Where in this figure would individuals occur in the forward iteration? Is it
possible, for example, that an animal that should move homewards should have stayed there
and never have moved away from the refuge?
I have added a sentence at the end of this first paragraph of the results that notes that
individuals following an optimal policy tend to stay in the region of state space close to the
threshold between the two behavioural options.
Line 220: Compared to the maximum amount of energy reserves it occurs to be a small jump…
A fair point, but it is a large jump in comparison to the energy reserves the individual should have
when it is in the refuge. I have compromised by just using ‘jump’.
Line 301: What do you mean here, different values of D?
Yes – thankyou for pointing this ambiguity out. I have altered the text to make this more explicit.
Line334: Food supple? I assume you mean supply.
Oops! Thankyou - changed.
Line 380: This is true!
Agreed. My intention for producing this paper is to demonstrate that the patterns seen are
possible, and I hope that it will be a useful starting point for some more realistic theoretical work.
Page 18-19: Could you explain the notation on the summation marks clearer? I read it as
summation of K of K over K. From what? Zero to K?
I have altered my notation in appendix 1 to satisfy this request.
Line 645: What did the sensitivity analyses tell you? Is the effect of variable values important
when the parameters are arbitrary?
There would potentially be a lot to pick apart in the sensitivity analyses, as was originally flagged
in the introductory page of the supplementary information (unchanged in the current version).
Given that my focus of this manuscript is on the policy forms generated and their broader
generation of the intermediate waiting behaviour, I felt it was appropriate to present these
analyses as extra data for readers to explore if they were interested in the potential effects of the
parameters, rather than as a body of descriptions that would be monotonous and of little value
to the paper. To make this more explicit, I have now also flagged this in the last sentence of the
methods section.
Figure 4 was very hard to read, some error with line numbers here.
I think the problem here is the automatic line numbering and other information added by the
journal management system, rather than anything I have done (as I’ve formatted the image file to
hit the journal criteria)! The axes on the left that are obscured by the line numbers in the version
I’ve just downloaded should read “distance, d” and “energy, x”
The equations look sound, maybe you can use the same equation for intermediate locations, the
food source and the refuge by defining V as zero for non-possible behaviours?
I appreciate the suggestion, and considered this at some length when originally putting the
manuscript together. I decided to go for the longer ‘separate equation’ form here for clarity, and
believe that trying to compound these down to a single equation containing site-dependent
information would have made things more difficult to pick apart.

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript reports the results of a modelling study of the optimal behaviour of animals
travelling to and from a feeding site. Whilst patch use and central-place foraging are well
studied, optimal behaviour under the risk of predation whilst travelling has been overlooked The
author uses an appropriate methodology, state-dependent dynamic programming, to address
this gap. I found the question interesting and the manuscript very well written. I have identified
some potential issues with the particulars of the approach, and feel that presentation of
predictions could be clearer, which would increase the value of this new theory.
Many thanks.
The author makes a laudable effort to make the manuscript accessible by an extensive verbal
description of the model that leaves out mathematical details. However, this might have gone a
little far. Some readers would like to clearly see how sigma affects risk, and how energy reserves
change, because the current wording does not capture this unambiguously. One consequence
of omitting details is that the two kappas and two gammas are undefined, despite appearing in
the legend of Figure 2.
Thankyou for pointing this out! The different levels of gamma and kappa were defined
appropriately in the appendix, but I’d originally taken the decision of stating that there were
mean values of these terms in the main text, which I now realise is definitely ambiguous. The
third paragraph of the model outline now makes this more explicit. I have also added a sentence
at the end of the first paragraph of this section that makes the use of sigma more obvious.
The model makes some interesting predictions, but they are a little obscured by the stochastic
approach to parameter exploration. The author chose to run thousands of analyses with
randomly selected parameter values. I'm not completely convinced of the value of this, as
opposed to a systematic exploration using a grid of values. One of the benefits of this would be
to ease the display of the interactions between parameter values: Figure 3 shows their individual
effects, but it is likely that their relative values is what matters. For example, it is likely that the
ratio of gamma to kappa (energy gain to energy use) determines behaviour, not their absolute
values.
I explored a number of ways of presenting and explaining the model predictions for the
manuscript, and eventually decided on the technique used simply because it was the most
intuitive: there was sufficient complexity generated by the different parameters that it proved
meaningless to systematically explore parameter space (annoyingly so – it would have been
genuinely nice to have been able to give a more systematic discussion of parameter effects).
One consequence of the current presentation is that the reader does not know whether the
policy type and animal fatness are confounded. Figure 2 suggests that increasing policies occur
when more fat must be stored. Is this actually always the case? It would be useful to make clear
predictions about when we expect animals to be fatter, and when we expect then to have longer
foraging bouts, for example.
It would be nice to make these predictions, but, as noted in the previous response, there wasn’t
a simple way to make some nice qualitative predictions here. If I could have done this with
certainty in the predictions, then I would have!
As the author points out, the policies actually lie on a continuum (between decreasing and
increasing), so I wasn't sure of the value of categorising their behaviour (Table 1), especially
since the policy cannot be directly observed. It would be preferable to plot the relationship
between parameters (which we may manipulate) and behaviour (which we can observe).
I agree that the policy forms lie in a continuum, but nonetheless stand by the attempt I have
made to classify them, as I think it demonstrates that policy can take differing forms but produce
similar results. As I mentioned in my response to reviewer #1, the sensitivity analysis provided
gives a thorough exploration of the effects of parameters on behaviour, but doesn’t really add to
the message I am trying to make with this manuscript, concerning the prediction that pausing
and stop/start behaviour might be seen if observed. I have now made it more apparent that
these sensitivity analyses are available for the reader in the supplementary information.
One potentially important extra parameter is the relative predation risk at the feeding site
compared to the intermediate points; we might see more dawdling if foraging is riskier than
travelling, which might happen if predators make sensible decisions.
Good point. I have added some brief discussion about this in the methods section.
Most importantly, I am concerned that one of the main conclusions of the manuscript follows
from an unrealistic assumption. The author discusses how under some policies the animal
should not return always to the refuge, but rest at an intermediate point. This occurs because
there is no benefit to activities other than foraging, so the animal just waits until reserves drop to
the threshold. This assumption makes sense under some conditions (e.g. survival over a long
period in winter when time steps are long, such as hours), but in most situations animals have
other things to do than eating, such as signalling territory ownership, social bonding behaviour,
sleeping, etc. In such a case, the animal should return to the refuge to increase its fitness. I
found myself wondering whether the predictions would be the same if the animal received a
fitness payoff when not foraging, perhaps when also in the refuge, and the policy maximises the
sum of these fitness payoffs before death, rather than just maximising survival. Most obviously,
we would expect animals to avoid dawdling, because it wastes (potentially useful) time, so we
might not get the prediction shown in Figure 4.
This is a fair point, and will be nice to explore in some less basic models. The model presented is
definitely aimed at an exploration of a short-term behaviour (decisions when moving between
shelter and a risky close foraging site, in much the way classic optimal foraging theory models
work), rather than taking a longer-term life history-style approach, and I would argue that the
model is an entirely justifiable toy system. I make this fairly explicit in the closing sentences of
the introduction, and I have adjusted the opening sentence of the discussion to try and make
this assumption clearer.
Minor Comments
15: Delete "occasionally".
Done.
24: "return a partial distance" was unclear on first reading.
I now say “stop its travel at a point before it reaches the refuge”.
53-63: May belong at the end of the Introduction; lines 72:76 perhaps belongs earlier.
I follow your logic here, and am tempted to make this change, but, on balance, think the current
order is more appropriate to the audience: the final paragraph of the current introduction is more
focussed on technique and lays out the broader goals being developed, which will satisfy a
number of my more critical colleagues about how a paper should be structured.
76: Make it clear that the feeding site is as dangerous as travelling.
Added “, where the danger is as great as being at the foraging site”.
208: "extreme example", not "extreme policy".
Good spot! Done.
229: Are "intermediate" all non-monotonic and v.v.? It is not clear.
The intermediate forms are all non-monotonic – I have clarified this in the second paragraph of
the results. I am sorry – I cannot work out what “v.v.” means, and cannot respond to this point.
234: "In all cases" suggests that this is true comparing across parameter values. Perhaps "all
else being equal"?
A fair point - changed.
262: Delete "presumably"; this is clearly the cause.
A fair point. Done.
267-270: This is a counter-intuitive prediction; explain why it occurs.
I think this a case of ambiguous wording. I have changed it to “Movement towards the foraging
site tended to be punctuated by a series of stops and starts, giving a slow mean outward speed
(table 1) resulting from a large amount of their time spent static in the exposed region between
refuge and foraging site (table 1)”.
334: "supply"
Done.
582: "patch" is undefined. Does it mean the whole world of the animal, or one spatial unit?
I’ve used it elsewhere in the manuscript to refer solely to the foraging site, and feel that that use
is more appropriate, so I have replaced ‘patch’ here with environment, which is much more
correct.
Figure 3d seems unnecessary: it is not very different to Figure 3c and it is little discussed, and in
any case might just be a grid effect.
Agreed: original figure 2d has been removed (I think the reviewer is referring to the original figure
2d rather than 3d here) – see my response to reviewer #1. On consideration, this region is most
likely a grid effect: there is a lot of smoothing within the model, but grid effects are still likely to
crop up at the extremes. It’s unlikely that an animal will ever spend much time in this region of
the policy space, and it therefore seems appropriate to reduce the emphasis I give to this
artefact.
