Review of: Does detection range matter for inferring social networks in a benthic shark using
acoustic telemetry?
Although the number of studies considering social associations/interactions between marine fish
is increasing, still very little remains known about the ability of different approaches for
accurately inferring interactions. In this way, this paper comes as an extremely useful addition to
the literature for shedding some light on how these different approaches compare to one another.
The insights drawn from this will be useful for any future studies of marine fish considering the
meaning of the inferred interactions between individuals. The paper is well written, and
highlights current gaps in knowledge and discusses the primary drawbacks of various
approaches. I hope that the authors find my comments below useful.
Main comments
The small sample size of the study would benefit from some more consideration/discussion. The
sample size of those recorded is 15 individuals one year, 18 individuals the next. So, one question
that stands out is how many individuals are missing in the proposed social networks? The study
relies on assuming that the proximity loggers give some measure of social network position, so
are the authors confident that enough individuals are tracked to allow meaningful inference of
actual social positions? Also, some mention of how missing data affect the results or
benefit/disadvantage particular detection ranges would be a useful addition.
From looking at figure 2, it appears that the lack of correlation of association matrices built from
VR2W in 2012 are due to underestimating association scores (i.e. more dark overall). But, its not
clear why the detection system with the largest range would have the fewest association
detections? Some discussion of this, and how the detection systems’ ranges in general may affect
the raw association scores (rather than the correlation between networks) would be useful.
The examination of the correlation in network metrics is a particularly useful idea. But, it would
be useful to also consider some other widely used metrics along with weighted degree. The use of
indirect network metrics is probably prohibited due to sample size, but some other simple
metrics, such as average edge weight to associates, would be interesting to see!
The conclusions drawn state that meaningful associations are likely recorded within a 4-60m
detection range. Just because these two measures appear to line up, I’m not sure we can definitely
conclude that this range is then meaningful. But, some more discussion of what is ‘meaningful’ is
needed. In this sense, what would be very beneficial is some simulation work whereby the data is
used to parameterise imputed social associations (so that we know these for definite). Then, we
could examine how these imputed associations are re-created using the different detection
methods. Although such simulation work is probably outside the scope of this paper, it would be
useful to add some discussion of this to the paper to show current limitations and encourage
future work. In general though, discussion of the use of different tracking approaches and tags is
impressive and useful, and the authors have done well to logically compare across different
species. As approaches in birds have been developed which allow not just the tracking of
individuals, but also automated experimental interaction with them (should as which feeders
they can access), I was additionally left wondering whether any thing like this would be possible
with the marine systems?
Comments on writing
Line 38: I think this final sentence of the abstract needs to be reworded to be more specific/clear
or could be removed
3
Line 61: As this follows on from the previous sentence, it reads as though the ‘gambit of the
group’ approach is based on defining associations between dyads as they come into a pre-defined
distance. But, the gambit of the group approach actually refers to assigning associations to all
animals based in the same group. So, these two sentences need rewording to make this clear
Line 177: It would be helpful to provide an estimated distance of the average distance between
sharks in the same mating aggregation
Line 301 & Line 306. The results shown in table one don’t actually show that any ‘association
matrices were significantly different’ to one another. To show that ‘association matrices were
significantly different’ we would need a negative correlation and a p value <0.05. So, this needs to
be reworded to “association matrices were not significantly similar”
Minor changes
Line 58: Change “usually” to “often”
Line 86: One of the citations for passive tags (14) didn’t use passive devices.
Line 104-109: This sentence would benefit from breaking into two shorter ones
Line188: Change “length” to “lengths”
Line 189: Is it fair to say that any shark resting within 10m is classed as socialising?
Line 212: This sentence needs rewording for clarity
Line 377: Change ‘art’ to ‘part’
Line 431: Change “precision of our social network” to “precision of our inference of the social
network”
Line 452: Along with (14), it would be beneficial to cite a study on much smaller birds (great tits
in the Netherlands) using the same approach (Lysanne Snijders et al. 2014 Animal Behaviour)
Line 468: Change “should considered” to “should be considered”
Again, I was very pleased with the quality of the manuscript, and hope that the authors find
these suggestions helpful.

In this manuscript Mourier et al. construct social networks of Port Jackson sharks using a number
of different methods and compare the similarity of these networks and the network positions of
the individuals within them. They report that networks constructed using proximity loggers and
miniSUR receivers (with small detection ranges) are similar to each other, but different from
networks constructed using acoustic receivers with a large range. I enjoyed reading the paper,
and it is an interesting and informative comparison of these methods. I have a few small
suggestions for the improvement of the manuscript.
My one concern with the analysis is with the results focussed on the consistency of weighted
degree. For these analyses I find it hard to reconcile the plots in Figure 3 with the results
presented in Table 1. To provide two opposite examples, for the 2012 results it is hard see any
consistency between Prox(All) and SUR-10m in the figure and yet it is highly significant. In
contrast, the SUR-10m vs VR2W(Orion) consistency seems much higher in the plot, but is much
lower in the Table and not statistically significant. It is hard to work out why this might be the
case without being able to see the data, and with the limited detail provided about the
randomisation methods, however I would appreciate it if the authors could look into these
apparently contradictory results and offer some explanation as to why they might occur.
Otherwise I have the following smaller comments and suggested changes:
Introduction in general: It felt to me like the introduction was a bit long and at times a bit
repetitive. I think the paper would benefit from some careful editing to make this section sharper
and more to the point – in some ways the story being introduced is quite simple so it doesn’t
need to be a long intro. Would just keeping each paragraph focused on a particular aspect.
-Social networks are valuable for X,Y,Z
-Haven’t been measured much in the sea because it is difficult because…
-Various methods available but some not necessarily ideal because of wide detection ranges
-How similar might networks constructed using these methods be and why is it important if they
are different
-Introduce study system and questions/hypotheses explicitly
L59: Would suggest often rather than usually
L60: I think the “gambit of the group” assumption is related more to assuming that two
individuals associated within a group are interacting/associating in a meaningful manner. I think
the point being made here is a more general point about what defines as interaction (i.e. how
close do you have to be to be considered interacting or associating) rather than gambit of the
group by its original definition. Therefore, the wording needs tweaking slightly accordingly. The
Farine et al. 2015. Annimal Behaviour citation used elsewhere by the authors would be useful
here, as would the reply to it (Carter et al. 2015 – which I provide details for below)
L73: Suggest deleting “for example”
L108-L09: Having the bit after the semi-colon in the brackets here reads awkwardly and I would
suggest finding a different way to phrase this
5
L111: Emphasise again here that the question is critical here as to whether different methods of
network construction are appropriate. Good citation:
Carter et al. 2015. Animal Behaviour. Research Questions should drive edge definitions in social
network studies
L168-174: It feels like this belongs more in the introduction than the methods
L174-177: This needs to go closer to L167 above where this variability is first mentioned
L212-215: It took me a while to work out what was meant here so I would suggest rewording and
explaining more explicitly to make it clear what is going on hear and why. Reference to figure 1
may help. E.g. something along the lines of. “The proximity logger data was used to collect
association data for all individuals that co-occurred within its range at the same interval. Because
the tagged individual would be included in all association events detected it was excluded from
the network”
L249: The 10 minute bin needs to be better explained. Are the 10 minute bins pre-defined
arbitrarily (and if so how are the start and end of these bins determined)? Is there some kind of
temporal rule where gaps of 10 minutes result in a new group being defined? Etc
L268/L269: More detail should be provided on how the datastream randomisations were
constructed (so that methods are reapeatable). I assume the default algorithm was used within
asnipe, but a description of the swapping process would be nice and useful here
L271: SD and CV need to be written in full initially (before abbreivations are used). Also
(assuming CV is coefficient of variation) is there any reason why CV and SD were both used
given that coefficient of variation is directly related to the standard deviation? If one is used then
I would suggest CV is better.
L279: Was just the one proximity logger with full data used then? Or all of them that had at least
some data on? This isn’t immediately clear
L293-L307: MANTEL TESTS - Throughout the results section the output of mantel tests is
described as different/not different. Given that Mantel tests are matrix correlation tests the
language used to describe these results needs to be changed. E.g. There was a strong positive
correlation between network X and network Y, there was no significant correlation between
network X and network Y etc.
L293-L307: I think the comparison between “All Proximity” and “Restricted Proximity” shouldn’t
be made as the latter is just the subset of the “All” data make these datasets highly dependent.
Perhaps more informative (and interesting to discuss) would be comparison “Restricted
Proximity” versus “Other proximity”. It would help with some of the discussion as to whether
interactions are the same or different away from the reef.
L308: It would be nice to see the results shown in this nice figure discussed in greater depth and
be better incorporated with the results from the mantel tests
L320-L321: The sentence starting “Consistency in rank…” is unclear and should be rephrased
L327: Delete “Interestingly”
Discussion: Again, I felt this was a bit long and lacked a clear structure so that the article would
benefit from some careful editing of the discussion to make sure it stayed focus (and each
paragraph stayed focussed on a particular aspect of the study being discussed)
6
L345: Similar to the critique in the results (and should be checked for throughout). I feel this
should read “not correlated with” rather than “different” to more accurately reflect what the test
is telling you.
L368: Suggest breaking the sentence after the reference, and starting “Therefore, …”
L368-369: I’m not convinced this rules out fission-fusion dynamics happening per se (i.e. breaking
apart and reforming of groups), just suggesting that there are not preferred social associations
within this fission-fusion system
L378-L380: move reference to the end of this sentence to suit numbered reference system
L389: The claim that a lower number of receivers is required is not really explained and is not
clear to me. Surely the number of receivers largely effects the geographic range over which you
can study social interactions and therefore as comprehensive as possible (within budget
restrictions) is best?
L394-L400: My immediate response here was to expect a discussion of Encounternet type
approaches with receiver arrays. I know it comes later, but I think it should at least be mentioned
here. Also, a useful citation that uses Encounternet (either for here or later on):
Snijders et al. 2014. Animal behaviour. Social networking in territorial great tit: slow explorers
have the least central network positions
L405-L413: I think there could be more focus on mobility (rather than benthic species) here as this
is the more general thing that changes and is most important. A benthic nature is to some extent
just a proxy for low mobility
L422-L424: I think the extent to which this is true could easily be calculated? Are the weights in
the VR2W(Orion) network similar to the weights in the VR2W(All) network?
L436: It needs to be acknowledged immediately here that while they don’t provide spatial
information, they could be combined with other tags that do
L444: change part before the comma to “stations in proximity [6]”
L465-L469: I think there should be acknowledgement here (and elsewhere) that similar problems
do exist in the terrestrial environment (particular for certain highly mobile or hard to detect
species). This would aid the generality of the paper
L474 (and useful elsewhere): The citation below supports many of your key arguments (about
approach to network construction being question driven) and I feel deserves to be cited
Carter et al. 2015. Animal Behaviour. Research Questions should drive edge definitions in social
network studies
Figure 2: Really like this figure, but wonder whether it would be clearer with just the top triangle
as it is an undirected network (i.e. the bottom triangle is just a mirror image of the top triangle).
Also the diagonal should be coloured differently to show that it is not included (rather than being
0) – although this may be less of an issue if the plot is changed as suggested
I hope my comments are useful in improving the manuscript,
Matthew Silk

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
I have now received two very thoughtful and constructive reviews of your manuscript and read
it myself. Both reviewers and I enjoyed reading your manuscript and found it interesting and
timely. However, both reviewers have some converging concerns with the manuscript, and I find
myself in agreement with them, though these could be easily addressed. Briefly, though the small
sample size is understandable, the authors do not sufficiently address this issue in their
manuscript. I would recommend starting with reading Silk et al.’s 2015 Animal Behaviour paper
“The consequences of unidentifiable individuals for the analysis of an animal social network”. In
addition, the authors do not sufficiently address the issue of what is a biologically “meaningful”
association, and the reviewers recommend spending some time discussing this. There is also a
misunderstanding (or a misrepresentation) of the Gambit-of-the-Group and Mantel test results
that needs to be addressed. Reviewer 2 helpfully recommends a structure for streamlining the
Introduction, and I agree that the manuscript’s clarity would be improved if such a structure
were adopted. Similar streamlining could be adopted in the Discussion, which is currently
slightly repetitive, and reiterates in more detail much of the Introduction.
Some minor comments:
LL112-113: please explain to the reader why this is a problem for benthic animals, particularly
since most terrestrial animals are restricted to “benthic” habitats. I would have thought animals
that are not restricted to such dimensions would have more problems with inferring a
biologically meaningful association.
L129: What is meant by “similar social networks”, and at what level? At the individual level i.e.
in terms of edge weights? Or the network level e.g. in terms of density?
LL166-169: Repeats earlier information provided in the Introduction. Consider rephrasing.
L186, L202, L250, L282, L318, L320: space required between digit and unit e.g. 10m -> 10 m
LL195-196: during decoding -> during the decoding. Also, this may need to be explained for the
reader in a little more detail.
L257: determining consistency -> determining the consistency
L134, L217, L343, etc: This wasn’t a true experiment: nothing was manipulated, there was no
‘control’ and ‘treatment’. This is an observational study, which is completely warranted. Avoid
using the term “experiment(al)” throughout the manuscript, and instead use the term “study”.
L359: sharks -> shark
L360: Card tagged -> Card-tagged
Para starting L343: This paragraph is over 2 pp long. Please break it up.
L467: should considered -> should be considered
L487: animal -> animals
L516: remove “also”

group by its original definition. Therefore, the wording needs tweaking slightly accordingly. The
Farine et al. 2015. Annimal Behaviour citation used elsewhere by the authors would be useful
here, as would the reply to it (Carter et al. 2015 – which I provide details for below)
L73: Suggest deleting “for example”
L108-L09: Having the bit after the semi-colon in the brackets here reads awkwardly and I would
suggest finding a different way to phrase this
L111: Emphasise again here that the question is critical here as to whether different methods of
network construction are appropriate. Good citation:
Carter et al. 2015. Animal Behaviour. Research Questions should drive edge definitions in social
network studies
L168-174: It feels like this belongs more in the introduction than the methods
L174-177: This needs to go closer to L167 above where this variability is first mentioned
L212-215: It took me a while to work out what was meant here so I would suggest rewording and
explaining more explicitly to make it clear what is going on hear and why. Reference to figure 1
may help. E.g. something along the lines of. “The proximity logger data was used to collect
association data for all individuals that co-occurred within its range at the same interval. Because
the tagged individual would be included in all association events detected it was excluded from
the network”
L249: The 10 minute bin needs to be better explained. Are the 10 minute bins pre-defined
arbitrarily (and if so how are the start and end of these bins determined)? Is there some kind of
temporal rule where gaps of 10 minutes result in a new group being defined? Etc
L268/L269: More detail should be provided on how the datastream randomisations were
constructed (so that methods are reapeatable). I assume the default algorithm was used within
asnipe, but a description of the swapping process would be nice and useful here
13
L271: SD and CV need to be written in full initially (before abbreivations are used). Also
(assuming CV is coefficient of variation) is there any reason why CV and SD were both used
given that coefficient of variation is directly related to the standard deviation? If one is used then
I would suggest CV is better.
L279: Was just the one proximity logger with full data used then? Or all of them that had at least
some data on? This isn’t immediately clear
L293-L307: MANTEL TESTS - Throughout the results section the output of mantel tests is
described as different/not different. Given that Mantel tests are matrix correlation tests the
language used to describe these results needs to be changed. E.g. There was a strong positive
correlation between network X and network Y, there was no significant correlation between
network X and network Y etc.
L293-L307: I think the comparison between “All Proximity” and “Restricted Proximity” shouldn’t
be made as the latter is just the subset of the “All” data make these datasets highly dependent.
Perhaps more informative (and interesting to discuss) would be comparison “Restricted
Proximity” versus “Other proximity”. It would help with some of the discussion as to whether
interactions are the same or different away from the reef.
L308: It would be nice to see the results shown in this nice figure discussed in greater depth and
be better incorporated with the results from the mantel tests
L320-L321: The sentence starting “Consistency in rank…” is unclear and should be rephrased
L327: Delete “Interestingly”
Discussion: Again, I felt this was a bit long and lacked a clear structure so that the article would
benefit from some careful editing of the discussion to make sure it stayed focus (and each
paragraph stayed focussed on a particular aspect of the study being discussed)
L345: Similar to the critique in the results (and should be checked for throughout). I feel this
should read “not correlated with” rather than “different” to more accurately reflect what the test
is telling you.
L368: Suggest breaking the sentence after the reference, and starting “Therefore, …”
L368-369: I’m not convinced this rules out fission-fusion dynamics happening per se (i.e. breaking
apart and reforming of groups), just suggesting that there are not preferred social associations
within this fission-fusion system
L378-L380: move reference to the end of this sentence to suit numbered reference system
L389: The claim that a lower number of receivers is required is not really explained and is not
clear to me. Surely the number of receivers largely effects the geographic range over which you
can study social interactions and therefore as comprehensive as possible (within budget
restrictions) is best?
L394-L400: My immediate response here was to expect a discussion of Encounternet type
approaches with receiver arrays. I know it comes later, but I think it should at least be mentioned
here. Also, a useful citation that uses Encounternet (either for here or later on):
Snijders et al. 2014. Animal behaviour. Social networking in territorial great tit: slow explorers
have the least central network positions
14
L405-L413: I think there could be more focus on mobility (rather than benthic species) here as this
is the more general thing that changes and is most important. A benthic nature is to some extent
just a proxy for low mobility
L422-L424: I think the extent to which this is true could easily be calculated? Are the weights in
the VR2W(Orion) network similar to the weights in the VR2W(All) network?
L435
L436: It needs to be acknowledged immediately here that while they don’t provide spatial
information, they could be combined with other tags that do
L444: change part before the comma to “stations in proximity [6]”
L465-L469: I think there should be acknowledgement here (and elsewhere) that similar problems
do exist in the terrestrial environment (particular for certain highly mobile or hard to detect
species). This would aid the generality of the paper
L474 (and useful elsewhere): The citation below supports many of your key arguments (about
approach to network construction being question driven) and I feel deserves to be cited
Carter et al. 2015. Animal Behaviour. Research Questions should drive edge definitions in social
network studies
Figure 2: Really like this figure, but wonder whether it would be clearer with just the top triangle
as it is an undirected network (i.e. the bottom triangle is just a mirror image of the top triangle).
Also the diagonal should be coloured differently to show that it is not included (rather than being
0) – although this may be less of an issue if the plot is changed as suggested
I hope my comments are useful in improving the manuscript,

Appendix A
We would like to acknowledge both editor and reviewers for their constructive and helpful comments which
assisted us in improving our manuscript. We hope our revisions were made in accordance with your
requests. You will find below response to all questions, suggestions and comments. Please also note that
the Introduction has been reworded and restructured so many comments are now not in line with this new
version.
Associate Editor Comments to Author:
I have now received two very thoughtful and constructive reviews of your manuscript and read it myself.
Both reviewers and I enjoyed reading your manuscript and found it interesting and timely. However, both
reviewers have some converging concerns with the manuscript, and I find myself in agreement with them,
though these could be easily addressed. Briefly, though the small sample size is understandable, the
authors do not sufficiently address this issue in their manuscript. I would recommend starting with reading
Silk et al.’s 2015 Animal Behaviour paper “The consequences of unidentifiable individuals for the analysis
of an animal social network”. In addition, the authors do not sufficiently address the issue of what is a
biologically “meaningful” association, and the reviewers recommend spending some time discussing this.
There is also a misunderstanding (or a misrepresentation) of the Gambit-of-the-Group and Mantel test
results that needs to be addressed. Reviewer 2 helpfully recommends a structure for streamlining the
Introduction, and I agree that the manuscript’s clarity would be improved if such a structure were adopted.
Similar streamlining could be adopted in the Discussion, which is currently slightly repetitive, and reiterates
n more detail much of the Introduction.
We appreciate these constructive comments and addressed all of them in our revised version of the MS.
Some minor comments:
LL112-113: please explain to the reader why this is a problem for benthic animals, particularly since most
terrestrial animals are restricted to “benthic” habitats. I would have thought animals that are not restricted to
such dimensions would have more problems with inferring a biologically meaningful association.
We used benthic animals for “marine” species not terrestrial animals. We therefore added “marine benthic
animals” to avoid confusions. The end of the sentence explains why it is difficult to infer biologically
meaningful associations as these animals “spend part of their time resting on the bottom” and therefore are
ess likely to often move between locations over large scale, therefore implying that the scale at which
nteractions are recorded needs to be measured over smaller ranges.
L129: What is meant by “similar social networks”, and at what level? At the individual level i.e. in terms of
edge weights? Or the network level e.g. in terms of density?
We added: “returned similar edge weight and individual positions in social networks” in order to better
explain what we were looking at.
LL166-169: Repeats earlier information provided in the Introduction. Consider rephrasing.
We modified this paragraph.
L186, L202, L250, L282, L318, L320: space required between digit and unit e.g. 10m -> 10 m
We made changes accordingly.
LL195-196: during decoding -> during the decoding. Also, this may need to be explained for the reader in a
ittle more detail.
We changed to: “Note that miniSUR receivers can record and decode Vemco tags after sending the raw
data to manufacturers.”
L257: determining consistency -> determining the consistency
Changes were made.
L134, L217, L343, etc: This wasn’t a true experiment: nothing was manipulated, there was no ‘control’ and
treatment’. This is an observational study, which is completely warranted. Avoid using the term
“experiment(al)” throughout the manuscript, and instead use the term “study”.
We changed “experiment/al” throughout the MS to “study” as suggested.
L359: sharks -> shark
Change was made
L360: Card tagged -> Card-tagged
Change was made
Para starting L343: This paragraph is over 2 pp long. Please break it up.
The paragraph has been broken into 3 shorter ones
L467: should considered -> should be considered
Change was made
L487: animal -> animals
Change was made
L516: remove “also”
Change was made

Review of: Does detection range matter for inferring social networks in a benthic shark using acoustic
telemetry?
Although the number of studies considering social associations/interactions between marine fish is
ncreasing, still very little remains known about the ability of different approaches for accurately inferring
nteractions. In this way, this paper comes as an extremely useful addition to the literature for shedding
some light on how these different approaches compare to one another. The insights drawn from this will be
useful for any future studies of marine fish considering the meaning of the inferred interactions between
ndividuals. The paper is well written, and highlights current gaps in knowledge and discusses the primary
drawbacks of various approaches. I hope that the authors find my comments below useful.
Main comments
The small sample size of the study would benefit from some more consideration/discussion. The sample
size of those recorded is 15 individuals one year, 18 individuals the next. So, one question that stands out
s how many individuals are missing in the proposed social networks? The study relies on assuming that
the proximity loggers give some measure of social network position, so are the authors confident that
enough individuals are tracked to allow meaningful inference of actual social positions? Also, some
mention of how missing data affect the results or benefit/disadvantage particular detection ranges would be
a useful addition.
Indeed, we study a sample of the aggregation and our study does not aim to quantify real social position
but rather to infer potential differences of the methods in measuring relative social positions. In other words,
we do not claim for showing a real social network but rather to infer relationships between a sample of
ndividuals and compare associations between these samples and the different telemetry techniques used
n the study. Previous research has also demonstrated that the network metrics used in this study are
correlated between partial and full social networks (Silk et al. 2015). Furthermore, our previous research
has shown high site fidelity and philopatry between years (Bass et al. 2017), suggesting that even a partial
network should be comparable between years in our study population.
From looking at figure 2, it appears that the lack of correlation of association matrices built from VR2W in
2012 are due to underestimating association scores (i.e. more dark overall). But, its not clear why the
detection system with the largest range would have the fewest association detections? Some discussion of
this, and how the detection systems’ ranges in general may affect the raw association scores (rather than
the correlation between networks) would be useful.
Association indices represent frequencies of associations, a measure of relative association compared with
being alone. Within the wider detection range of VR2Ws, some solitary but immobile sharks can be
measured as associated and as they spend a lot of time in the array their association strength is relatively
higher than other stronger dyad for which associations are shorter. Another factor influencing this pattern is
the location of miniSURs; if they are located in small scale aggregation hotspots, they are more likely to get
higher association indices than if they are located outside these aggregations but also than VR2W
receivers with higher detection range.
To better explain these trends we added this paragraph which better details figure 2: “In 2012, association
matrices built from VR2Ws appear to underestimate association scores relative to those of miniSURs and
proximity loggers (as shown by cells in figure 2 which are overall darker for VR2Ws). This may be due to
the position of miniSURs in 2012 which were installed right on areas of subgroups of tagged sharks while
within a wider detection range. In this case, the VR2W receiver may record both solitary and associated
ndividuals as being part of a group, thereby weakening the relative strength of association. On the contrary
n 2013, association matrices built from VR2Ws seem to overestimate association scores relative to those
of miniSURs (as shown by cells in figure 2 which are overall lighter for VR2Ws). In this case, miniSURs
might be placed outside the range of subgroups of tagged sharks, therefore underestimating the strength of
associations because of relatively fewer detections compared to VR2W receivers”.
The examination of the correlation in network metrics is a particularly useful idea. But, it would be useful to
also consider some other widely used metrics along with weighted degree. The use of indirect network
metrics is probably prohibited due to sample size, but some other simple metrics, such as average edge
weight to associates, would be interesting to see!
We agree with reviewer 1 that we could have used different metrics, however, we made the choice to
select only one representative centrality metric in order to highlight the differences but keeping the
comparison simple. In our opinion, the MS is already technical and adding further metrics will make it
confusing to readers.
The conclusions drawn state that meaningful associations are likely recorded within a 4-60m detection
range. Just because these two measures appear to line up, I’m not sure we can definitely conclude that this
range is then meaningful. But, some more discussion of what is ‘meaningful’ is needed. In this sense, what
would be very beneficial is some simulation work whereby the data is used to parameterise imputed social
associations (so that we know these for definite). Then, we could examine how these imputed associations
are re-created using the different detection methods. Although such simulation work is probably outside the
scope of this paper, it would be useful to add some discussion of this to the paper to show current
imitations and encourage future work. In general though, discussion of the use of different tracking
approaches and tags is impressive and useful, and the authors have done well to logically compare across
different species. As approaches in birds have been developed which allow not just the tracking of
ndividuals, but also automated experimental interaction with them (should as which feeders they can
access), I was additionally left wondering whether any thing like this would be possible with the marine
systems?
We agree that simulation work could be interesting but we also think that it is out of scope for this particular
study. However, we decided to add more discussion on this topic in our MS as suggested. We added
“Future work employing simulations re-creating data using different detection methods for several species
of varying mobility should help in better determining the influence of detection range for inferring real social
associations.”(line 433-435). Additional comparison with terrestrial work, especially birds, have been
ncluded to suggest further useful development in the field of marine science.
Comments on writing
Line 38: I think this final sentence of the abstract needs to be reworded to be more specific/clear or could
be removed
We reworded this sentence by also merging the idea with the previous sentence. It now reads: “We also
advocate for combining multiple receiver types depending on the ecological question being asked and the
development of multi-sensor tags or testing of new automated proximity loggers, such as the Encounternet
system, to improve the precision and accuracy of social and predator-prey interaction studies.”
Line 61: As this follows on from the previous sentence, it reads as though the ‘gambit of the group’
approach is based on defining associations between dyads as they come into a pre-defined distance. But,
the gambit of the group approach actually refers to assigning associations to all animals based in the same
group. So, these two sentences need rewording to make this clear
We reworded these sentences to avoid confusions about the definition of the Gambit of the group. It now
reads: “Animal social networks are often constructed from proximity data on the spatiotemporal co-
occurrence of identifiable subjects as a proxy for interaction networks [5,31] but the validity of this
assumption has rarely been tested despite the importance of defining edges in social networks [29,30].
Despite the appealing use of acoustic receivers to automatically build social networks in aquatic animals,
such method might not be effective because of broad detection ranges. It is therefore critical to understand
how comparable networks are when constructed using these methods and how or if the network properties
are affected according to variations in detection ranges.”
Line 177: It would be helpful to provide an estimated distance of the average distance between sharks in
the same mating aggregation
We added at the end of the sentence: “; Port-Jackson sharks often form tight groups of several individuals
which can even sit on top of each other (figure 1a).”
Line 301 & Line 306. The results shown in table one don’t actually show that any ‘association matrices
were significantly different’ to one another. To show that ‘association matrices were significantly different’
we would need a negative correlation and a p value <0.05. So, this needs to be reworded to “association
matrices were not significantly similar”
We reworded accordingly.
Minor changes
Line 58: Change “usually” to “often”
We changed it accordingly.
Line 86: One of the citations for passive tags (14) didn’t use passive devices.
We removed the citation.
Line 104-109: This sentence would benefit from breaking into two shorter ones
We reorganized this sentence and broke it in: “Arrays of terrestrial RFID receivers to track electronically
tagged birds are ideal to document their social network inferred from the arrival and departure of individuals
from the small detection range of feeders [26]. In contrast, VR2W acoustic receivers often have large and
variable detection ranges (up to 800 m radius around the device [27;28]) which can return in sharks being
detected simultaneously despite1,600 m apart.”
Line188: Change “length” to “lengths”
Change was made
Line 189: Is it fair to say that any shark resting within 10m is classed as socialising?
We changed “socialising” to “grouping” as we acknowledge the fact that being grouped in a restricted area
does not necessarily imply socializing.
Line 212: This sentence needs rewording for clarity
This sentence has been changed to meet also the suggestions of Reviewer 2: “The proximity logger data
was used to collect association data for all individuals that co-occurred within its range at the same interval
(figure 1). Because the individual upon which the proximity logger was mounted would be included in all
association events detected it was excluded from the network.”
Line 377: Change ‘art’ to ‘part’
Change was made
Line 431: Change “precision of our social network” to “precision of our inference of the social network”
Change was made
Line 452: Along with (14), it would be beneficial to cite a study on much smaller birds (great tits in the
Netherlands) using the same approach (Lysanne Snijders et al. 2014 Animal Behaviour)
We added the suggested reference.
Line 468: Change “should considered” to “should be considered”
Change was made
Again, I was very pleased with the quality of the manuscript, and hope that the authors find these
suggestions helpful.
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
In this manuscript Mourier et al. construct social networks of Port Jackson sharks using a number of
different methods and compare the similarity of these networks and the network positions of the individuals
within them. They report that networks constructed using proximity loggers and miniSUR receivers (with
small detection ranges) are similar to each other, but different from networks constructed using acoustic
receivers with a large range. I enjoyed reading the paper, and it is an interesting and informative
comparison of these methods. I have a few small suggestions for the improvement of the manuscript.
My one concern with the analysis is with the results focussed on the consistency of weighted degree. For
these analyses I find it hard to reconcile the plots in Figure 3 with the results presented in Table 1. To
provide two opposite examples, for the 2012 results it is hard see any consistency between Prox(All) and
SUR-10m in the figure and yet it is highly significant. In contrast, the SUR-10m vs VR2W(Orion)
consistency seems much higher in the plot, but is much lower in the Table and not statistically significant. It
s hard to work out why this might be the case without being able to see the data, and with the limited detail
provided about the randomisation methods, however I would appreciate it if the authors could look into
these apparently contradictory results and offer some explanation as to why they might occur.
We acknowledge reviewer 2 for spotting this inconsistency. Going back to our script we identified the error
which was due to the graph production where the input data were incorrect. We have corrected the data in
the graph which now illustrate the results shown in Table 1.
Otherwise I have the following smaller comments and suggested changes:
Introduction in general: It felt to me like the introduction was a bit long and at times a bit repetitive. I think
the paper would benefit from some careful editing to make this section sharper and more to the point – in
some ways the story being introduced is quite simple so it doesn’t need to be a long intro. Would just
keeping each paragraph focused on a particular aspect.
-Social networks are valuable for X,Y,Z
-Haven’t been measured much in the sea because it is difficult because…
-Various methods available but some not necessarily ideal because of wide detection ranges
-How similar might networks constructed using these methods be and why is it important if they are
different
-Introduce study system and questions/hypotheses explicitly
We substantially reworded the introduction following suggestions with the aim to make the story more
simple, shorter and clearer.
L59: Would suggest often rather than usually
Changes made
L60: I think the “gambit of the group” assumption is related more to assuming that two individuals
associated within a group are interacting/associating in a meaningful manner. I think the point being made
here is a more general point about what defines as interaction (i.e. how close do you have to be to be
considered interacting or associating) rather than gambit of the group by its original definition. Therefore,
the wording needs tweaking slightly accordingly. The Farine et al. 2015. Annimal Behaviour citation used
elsewhere by the authors would be useful here, as would the reply to it (Carter et al. 2015 – which I provide
details for below)
We rewrote the sentence as follows, in order to better introduce the idea we focus on: “Animal social networks are
often constructed from proximity data on the spatiotemporal co-occurrence of identifiable subjects as a proxy for
nteraction networks [5,31], but the validity of this assumption has rarely been tested despite the importance of
defining edges in social networks [29,30].”
L73: Suggest deleting “for example”
Changes made
L108-L09: Having the bit after the semi-colon in the brackets here reads awkwardly and I would suggest
finding a different way to phrase this
We removed this part (i.e. “: variable detection range can apply to other acoustic receivers depending on
environmental conditions”) which is not necessary to avoid confusions and make the text being lighter.
L111: Emphasise again here that the question is critical here as to whether different methods of network
construction are appropriate. Good citation:
Carter et al. 2015. Animal Behaviour. Research Questions should drive edge definitions in social network
studies
We reworded the entire sentence as follow: “As research questions should drive edge definition in social
networks [29,30], it is important to consider whether different scale-dependent methods of network construction
are appropriate to estimate realistic social encounters, especially in large marine benthic animals, which spend most
of the day resting on the bottom.”
L168-174: It feels like this belongs more in the introduction than the methods
We moved this to the introduction.
L174-177: This needs to go closer to L167 above where this variability is first mentioned
We moved up this sentence as suggested.
L212-215: It took me a while to work out what was meant here so I would suggest rewording and explaining
more explicitly to make it clear what is going on hear and why. Reference to figure 1 may help. E.g.
something along the lines of. “The proximity logger data was used to collect association data for all
ndividuals that co-occurred within its range at the same interval. Because the tagged individual would be
ncluded in all association events detected it was excluded from the network”
We modified this paragraph as suggested. It now reads: “The proximity logger data was used to collect
association data for all individuals that co-occurred within its range at the same interval (figure 1). Because
the individual upon which the proximity logger was mounted would be included in all association events
detected it was excluded from the network. Note that Sonotronics proximity loggers can record and decode
Vemco tags after adjustment during decoding process.”
L249: The 10 minute bin needs to be better explained. Are the 10 minute bins pre-defined arbitrarily (and if
so how are the start and end of these bins determined)? Is there some kind of temporal rule where gaps of
10 minutes result in a new group being defined? Etc
We added “within an arbitrary pre-defined 10-min bin (e.g. 0:00-0:09, 0:10-0:19, etc).” to clarify it.
L268/L269: More detail should be provided on how the datastream randomisations were constructed (so
that methods are reapeatable). I assume the default algorithm was used within asnipe, but a description of
the swapping process would be nice and useful here
We added more details as follow: “Randomization procedures were conducted following a data-stream
randomization procedure in asnipe R package [34] using the default algorithm using one swap and 10,000
permutations.”
L271: SD and CV need to be written in full initially (before abbreivations are used). Also (assuming CV is
coefficient of variation) is there any reason why CV and SD were both used given that coefficient of
variation is directly related to the standard deviation? If one is used then I would suggest CV is better.
We removed the use of SD and kept only CV results as suggested.
L279: Was just the one proximity logger with full data used then? Or all of them that had at least some data
on? This isn’t immediately clear
We added “the retained proximity logger” in order to be clearer. The previous sentence also clearly say that
among the three loggers retrieved only the data from one were useable.
L293-L307: MANTEL TESTS - Throughout the results section the output of mantel tests is described as
different/not different. Given that Mantel tests are matrix correlation tests the language used to describe
these results needs to be changed. E.g. There was a strong positive correlation between network X and
network Y, there was no significant correlation between network X and network Y etc.
We agree with this suggestion. We therefore changed “different/not different” to “correlated/not correlated”
throughout the text to describe Mantel test results as suggested.
L293-L307: I think the comparison between “All Proximity” and “Restricted Proximity” shouldn’t be made as
the latter is just the subset of the “All” data make these datasets highly dependent. Perhaps more
nformative (and interesting to discuss) would be comparison “Restricted Proximity” versus “Other
proximity”. It would help with some of the discussion as to whether interactions are the same or different
away from the reef.
We agree that the comparison of “All Proximity” and “Restricted Proximity” is not interesting as the data are
ndeed dependent. However, we kept these results as a control of the difference of the data (i.e. how
different are the data vs sub-data). The comparisons with other proximity receivers are also provided so we
do not think it is useful to change this paragraph.
L308: It would be nice to see the results shown in this nice figure discussed in greater depth and be better
ncorporated with the results from the mantel tests
We added more details on figure 2 in line 305-315.
L320-L321: The sentence starting “Consistency in rank…” is unclear and should be rephrased
We rephrased it as follow: “Observed sum of variances (SVO) of individual weighted degree between
proximity logger and miniSUR receiver (10 m range) were statistically smaller than the randomized sum of
variances (SVR) indicating repeatability in individual social position across methods”.
L327: Delete “Interestingly”
This was deleted
Discussion: Again, I felt this was a bit long and lacked a clear structure so that the article would benefit
from some careful editing of the discussion to make sure it stayed focus (and each paragraph stayed
focussed on a particular aspect of the study being discussed)
We worked on the discussion to make it clearer as suggested.
L345: Similar to the critique in the results (and should be checked for throughout). I feel this should read
“not correlated with” rather than “different” to more accurately reflect what the test is telling you.
We changed “different” by “not correlated” in the entire discussion as suggested.
L368: Suggest breaking the sentence after the reference, and starting “Therefore, …”

L368-369: I’m not convinced this rules out fission-fusion dynamics happening per se (i.e. breaking apart
and reforming of groups), just suggesting that there are not preferred social associations within this fission-
fusion system
Yes indeed, it is the point we made here. The cited paper did not test for preferred association and only
suggests without any test that fission-fusion does occur.
L378-L380: move reference to the end of this sentence to suit numbered reference system
We moved reference to the end of the sentence.
L389: The claim that a lower number of receivers is required is not really explained and is not clear to me.
Surely the number of receivers largely effects the geographic range over which you can study social
nteractions and therefore as comprehensive as possible (within budget restrictions) is best?
The idea behind this claim is that an animal which moves over larger scales requires a larger receiver
coverage compared to a benthic animal which has a reduced range, in order to capture repeated
encounters used to construct a reliable network. In order to make it clearer we added: “likely requires a
relatively lower number of receivers and smaller detection range than species such as reef sharks that
follow and form mobile social groups over larger spatial scales.”
L394-L400: My immediate response here was to expect a discussion of Encounternet type approaches with
receiver arrays. I know it comes later, but I think it should at least be mentioned here. Also, a useful citation
that uses Encounternet (either for here or later on):
Snijders et al. 2014. Animal behaviour. Social networking in territorial great tit: slow explorers have the
east central network positions
We added this sentence and the suggested reference to introduce the Encounternet system: “New
technologies such as Encounternet, which is an automated telemetry system combining animal radio tags
and wireless stations can improve the creation of social networks [40,41], although this technology has
rarely been tested underwater [42].”
L405-L413: I think there could be more focus on mobility (rather than benthic species) here as this is the
more general thing that changes and is most important. A benthic nature is to some extent just a proxy for
ow mobility
We added the following sentence: “The degree of mobility likely influences the rate of false positive as low
mobility will increase detection probability and as a result increase assigned associations.”
L422-L424: I think the extent to which this is true could easily be calculated? Are the weights in the
VR2W(Orion) network similar to the weights in the VR2W(All) network?
We added “(i.e. 99% of detections occurred at Orion Beach)” to provide more evidence of support of this
hypothesis.
L435: “the device” <U+F0E0> “devices”
Changes made
L436: It needs to be acknowledged immediately here that while they don’t provide spatial information, they
could be combined with other tags that do
We added it as follow: “Moreover, they don’t provide any spatial information on recorded interactions,
although they can be combined with other tags that do, and return a network of encounters centred around
one individual.”
L440: “recovery” <U+F0E0> “to be recovered”
Changes made
L444: change part before the comma to “stations in proximity [6]”
We made changes accordingly.
L452: network <U+F0E0> networks
Changes made
L465-L469: I think there should be acknowledgement here (and elsewhere) that similar problems do exist
n the terrestrial environment (particular for certain highly mobile or hard to detect species). This would aid
the generality of the paper
We added the following sentence: “These issues are also applicable to terrestrial studies as similar
problems are found for certain highly mobile or rarely detectable species.”
L474 (and useful elsewhere): The citation below supports many of your key arguments (about approach to
network construction being question driven) and I feel deserves to be cited
Carter et al. 2015. Animal Behaviour. Research Questions should drive edge definitions in social network
studies
Reference was added.
Figure 2: Really like this figure, but wonder whether it would be clearer with just the top triangle as it is an
undirected network (i.e. the bottom triangle is just a mirror image of the top triangle). Also the diagonal
should be coloured differently to show that it is not included (rather than being 0) – although this may be
ess of an issue if the plot is changed as suggested
Thanks for the suggestion, we accordingly modified the figure to make it clearer by removing the bottom
triangle and coloured the diagonal in grey.
I hope my comments are useful in improving the manuscript,
