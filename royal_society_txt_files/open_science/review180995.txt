Major comments:
lns. 111-113: This is a good addition that addresses previous reviewers’ comments well. It may be
worth adding a little bit more somewhere why looking at the C.V. as you do here is the
appropriate measure of stability. We expect variance to increase to increase with mean, so it
wouldn’t be terribly surprising to see the basic result of Fig. 6. However, you do show in other
figures that variance can change independent of the mean (which is the equilibrium biomass),
highlighting the importance of trophic dynamics on variability. It is this latter point which I think
makes this manuscript a worthwhile read.
ln. 115: I think you need to invest a little more effort explaining local linearization here. Even
though it is a standard technique, it still is a bit esoteric for a broad-readership journal. The fact
that stability assessed through local linearization is technically only valid very close to
equilibrium justifies your inclusion of numerical simulations.
3
lns. 195-198: You also need to give a little more detail here on the numerical integration. First, you
state that the last 1000 time steps of each simulation were used for further analyses, but out of
what total length was this? Second, numerical simulation of stochastic differential equations is
non-trivial. It is unclear if your description here is really a technically accurate representation of
Eq. (0.1). I don’t see that the details will really matter to your core results, but you need to justify
why you did what you did.
lns. 332-343: I think you can do more with this section. As it stands, you are summarizing well
known results on enrichment and saying nothing much else. Can you maybe alter the predictions
with what you’ve seen? For example, you say nutrient loading is destabilizing, but you can add
that your results suggest that the destabilization will manifest differently at different trophic
levels.
ln. 351: What Type-II gives you is a high propensity for oscillatory behavior. Do you see this at all
in your results, and does this account for deviations from your Type-I results?
Minor comments:
lns. 59-60: Are the refs. formatted correctly?
lns. 383-386: I don’t know that you need this…you are repeating what you’ve said elsewhere in
multiple places.

looking at the C.V. as you do here is the appropriate measure of stability. We
expect variance to increase to increase with mean, so it wouldn’t be terribly
surprising to see the basic result of Fig. 6. However, you do show in other
figures that variance can change independent of the mean (which is the
equilibrium biomass), highlighting the importance of trophic dynamics on
variability. It is this latter point which I think makes this manuscript a
worthwhile read.
Response: Done. We discuss why invariability is an appropriate measure of
stability in lines 151-153. Specifically, it is simple to interpret,
straightforward to derive analytically and numerically, and can be readily
applied to empirical data. We emphasize the importance of trophic dynamics
on invariability in the Introduction (lines 98-99 and 101) and Discussion (lines
353-360).
ln. 115: I think you need to invest a little more effort explaining local
linearization here. Even though it is a standard technique, it still is a bit
esoteric for a broad-readership journal. The fact that stability assessed
through local linearization is technically only valid very close to equilibrium
justifies your inclusion of numerical simulations.
Response: Thank for this suggestion. We clarify the local linearization of the
analytical calculation of invariability in lines 154-155. We explain that the
numerical method relaxes this assumption and allows the system to deviate
from the region close to equilibrium (lines 156-159).
lns. 195-198: You also need to give a little more detail here on the numerical
integration. First, you state that the last 1000 time steps of each simulation
were used for further analyses, but out of what total length was this? Second,
numerical simulation of stochastic differential equations is non-trivial. It is
unclear if your description here is really a technically accurate representation
of Eq. (0.1). I don’t see that the details will really matter to your core results,
but you need to justify why you did what you did.
Response: We now more explicitly outline the numerical integration (lines
203 to 209). Specifically, we integrate each system of equations in (0.1) using
a first-order Euler approximation with step size <U+F044>t . The initial conditions of
each simulation were set at the equilibrium values of each species in the
absence of stochasticity, and the parameter values were held constant across
food chains. We ran each simulation for a time horizon of T time steps (in
our case T <U+F03D> 1500 ), and check that no species went extinct during the
simulation. We calculate invariability for each species and total biomass from
the final 1000 time steps of each simulation. Table 1 includes all parameter
values used in the model. Footnote 2 directs the reader to the source code for
the analytical and numerical solutions, found in the supplemental material and
online.
lns. 332-343: I think you can do more with this section. As it stands, you are
summarizing well known results on enrichment and saying nothing much else.
Can you maybe alter the predictions with what you’ve seen? For example, you
say nutrient loading is destabilizing, but you can add that your results suggest
that the destabilization will manifest differently at different trophic levels.
Response: Done. We discuss that not only is nutrient loading destabilizing,
but that this destabilization can manifest itself differently depending on the
trophic level and structure of the food chain (lines 350-360). We explain that
nutrient additions initially enter the system via the basal resource, the effects
of which filter up the food chain based on the trophic dynamics at play in each
trophic level. Depending on the trophic level and length of the food chain, the
means and temporal standard deviations in biomass can change in different
ways in response to nutrient loading.
ln. 351: What Type-II gives you is a high propensity for oscillatory behavior.
Do you see this at all in your results, and does this account for deviations from
your Type-I results?
Response: Indeed, we do see oscillatory behavior in our Type-II simulations.
As in our Type-I case we restrict our analysis to scenarios in which all species
persist. We find that oscillations destabilize the system, with species more at-
risk for extinction due to environmental stochasticity during periods of low
population biomass. We note this in lines 366-367 and 369-370 in the main
text.
Minor comments:
lns. 59-60: Are the refs. formatted correctly?
Response: The references are formatted in EndNote using the RSOS
recommended Vancouver style.
lns. 383-386: I don’t know that you need this…you are repeating what you’ve

Response: Done. We have removed this section from the manuscript.
