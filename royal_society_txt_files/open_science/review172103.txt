Review of Brooks et al. Royal Society Open Science
The manuscript is very well-written and asks a straight forward question with a clearly laid out
rationale. The study builds on an exciting new area of research being developed by Brooks and
colleagues. I do have some concerns about the effectiveness of the manipulations in both studies,
which I will try to outline below.
Major
Perhaps I have misunderstood something here but the low-level hypothesis appears to invoke an
aspect ratio based prediction, which doesn’t seem to accord with the typical use of the term ‘low-
level’. That is, on page 5 in the description of the two predictions, the authors state that a strictly
low-level retinotopic adaptation prediction will mean a thin adaptor oriented 90 degrees relative
to the test will cause the test to appear taller. I agree. BUT, I was less clear on why the prediction
then becomes that a taller stimulus will need to add weight to appear normal. From an aspect
ratio perspective I think I can appreciate that argument, but is an aspect ratio explanation what
the authors are seeking to present in this ‘low-level’ account? If so then this should be more
clearly laid out. Wouldn’t a simple spatial frequency based account simply and solely predict
that, a thin adaptor oriented 90 degrees to the test would cause the test to appear taller? I just
don’t see exactly which literature the ‘and because they are taller they would need to add weight
to appear normal’ statement comes from.
Obviously given the pattern of results, the above query does not compromise the findings which
favour the high-level explanation. BUT, as the viable alternative prediction, the nature of the low-
level alternative could be clarified.
Manipulation validity in Experiment 1. Was a forehead and chinrest or some similar restraint
used to control the head angle of the participants in the study? If not, then the unconstrained
head movements that almost certainly would have been made by the observers during the study
would seem to compromise the main experimental manipulation (body orientation) in
Experiment 1 and thus its conclusions.
I have a similar concern over the size manipulation in Experiment 2. I don’t understand why a
fixed size change wasn’t used. Unlike Experiment 1 where the orientation change of the stimulus
was fixed, the size change is random, meaning that (if I understand it correctly), on an unknown
number of trials, there was little or no physical difference in adapt and test stimulus size. For this
reason, the transfer across size cannot be meaningfully compared with the transfer across
orientation. In my view this experiment cannot effectively test the consequence of a size
difference between adaptor and test, as it sets out to do, given that the two corresponded in size
on an unknown number of trials. The size change between the two needs to be blocked with a
difference of at least 25%, as is typical in face adaptation research and in many global shape
adaptation experiments.

Summary:
A clearly written study which applies a clever design previously used to study face aftereffects, to
disentangle retinally-localised from object-centred aftereffects by presenting tests on some trials
at orthogonal orientations to the adapting stimuli. Since the dimension of adaptation is an affine
stretch/squash, adaptation in the retinal vs object-centred coordinates now predict opposite
directions of aftereffect. Results show that an aftereffect in the same direction is found for both
relative orientations of test stimuli, and that this persists when tests are of a different size than
adaptors. The paper presents convincing evidence for its title claim, that there is a large high-level
component to body-shape adaptation.
Major points:
The only sustantial comment I have is that the yes-no psychophysical task doesn’t rule out a
decision-level effect. All we know is that after seeing “wide” adaptors, observers tend to report
the relatively-thin normal tests as “thin”. It’s unclear whether this indicates a change in visual
experience, or merely a change in response patterns, e.g. caused by the adaptator-to-test
*difference* making one response more salient than the other during adaptation trials. To put it
another way, although these experiments place a “lower bound” on how early in visual
processing this aftereffect might be attributed, it doesn’t persuasively put any upper bound on
whether this is a “high level visual” aftereffect, or a cognitive effect wherein the adaptors
manipulate the anchor point people use when making judgements. Both of these possibilities are
psychologically interesting, and relevant to real-life body image questions. I would like to see this
possibilty discussed in the paper, perhaps with reference to some of the several papers which
have recently made this point regarding other aftereffects, e.g.:
Morgan M. J. (2014). A bias-free measure of retinotopic tilt adaptation. J. Vis. 14, 1–9.
Storrs, K. R. (2015). Are high-level aftereffects perceptual?. Frontiers in psychology, 6, 157.
4
Yarrow K., Jahn N., Durant S., Arnold D. H. (2011). Shifts of criteria or neural timing? The
assumptions underlying timing perception studies. Conscious. Cogn. 20, 1518–1531.
One niggling conceptual point: The introductory framing refers to the problems of innacurate self
body image. However the stimuli and task measure adaptation to *image* stretchings, and the
participant is asked a question framed in terms of image stretching (Does this image appear
“larger or smaller than a normal unmanipulated image would”? — p7 line 33). This doesn’t seem
to me a fatal flaw, as the stretched and squashed stimuli in Figure 1 do indeed appear to depict
“skinnier” and “fatter” people — but they also appear unnatural at the extremes, and the cues an
observer uses to judge whether the image has been stretched or squashed could in principle be
completely independent of those one usually uses to judge body weight. This might be the case
e.g. if the models used to create the stimuli varied widely in weight, in which case overall
“wideness” of the images would not be a useful cue to use when answering the question “has this
image been stretched or squashed?” It would be good to at least note the range of body shapes in
the stimuli, and/or provide as a supplementary figure all 8 unaltered identities.
Minor points:
* page 5, line 40: should read “…to reach a normal appearance…”
* page 7, line 5: should read “…-45 and +45 deg…” (for consistency with previous line)
* page 7, line 44: should read “Beginning with a +/-50% step size…” or “Beginning with +/-50%
steps…”

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
I reiterate that the paper represents an interesting issue in the field and acknowledge that the
authors are experienced experts in the methods used. I am a fan of their work. In addition I agree
that the manuscript has been improved in this revision. However, the authors have not, in my
view, made a genuine attempt at discussing the limitations of the design choices when it comes to
the manipulations employed.
Again, I note that without the use of a head restraint there can be no real certainty that the
orientation change between adaptor and test was faithfully maintained throughout the
experiment. Instruction to a participant is not an effective manipulation check. The presence of
tuning argues that it was an effective manipulation and that’s great. All I am asking the authors
to do, given they are reporting the specific degree of transfer for future studies to
reference/compare to, is to provide an acknowledgement that the precise tuning estimate
reported in their study may be an over or under estimate of the real transfer across orientation,
due to not restraining the head angle of the participants in the study. This is a limitation of the
design and should be acknowledged.
I still see the size manipulation as having the same problem. The authors suggest 25% is arbitrary,
and it is. However, the reason the variable size difference manipulation is not an effective one is
because tilt (and I assume but admit I do not know, spatial frequency) after-effects are tightly
tuned for spatial correspondence between the adaptor and test. Therefore, if one blocks the size
change between the two then the desired lack of spatial correspondence (i.e. reduction of low
level after-effects to the primary result) can be assumed- barring eye movements which obviously
happen but are discouraged by the central fixation cross and instruction to gaze upon it. BUT If
one does not block the size change then on a number of trials there is often near (within a
receptive field size) or perfect correspondence between adaptor and test. The compromises the
effectiveness of the size manipulation and therefore the reduction of the contribution of low level
10
after-effects to the primary result. How can it not? The only way it would not compromise the
design is if the adaptation effects decayed at the rate of the presentation sequence, meaning that
those trials in which correspondence was present did not have any influence on other trials
where correspondence was not present. I am not aware of any evidence that after-effects decay at
such a rate. So again, I would ask the authors to present a discussion of this issue and
acknowledge it as a limitation of their design.

and it is. However, the reason the variable size difference manipulation is not an effective one is
because tilt (and I assume but admit I do not know, spatial frequency) after-effects are tightly
tuned for spatial correspondence between the adaptor and test. Therefore, if one blocks the size
change between the two then the desired lack of spatial correspondence (i.e. reduction of low
level after-effects to the primary result) can be assumed- barring eye movements which obviously
happen but are discouraged by the central fixation cross and instruction to gaze upon it. BUT If
one does not block the size change then on a number of trials there is often near (within a
receptive field size) or perfect correspondence between adaptor and test. The compromises the
effectiveness of the size manipulation and therefore the reduction of the contribution of low level
after-effects to the primary result. How can it not? The only way it would not compromise the
design is if the adaptation effects decayed at the rate of the presentation sequence, meaning that
those trials in which correspondence was present did not have any influence on other trials
where correspondence was not present. I am not aware of any evidence that after-effects decay at
such a rate. So again, I would ask the authors to present a discussion of this issue and
acknowledge it as a limitation of their design.

Reviewer #1
1. Reviewer's comment:
Perhaps I have misunderstood something here but the low-level hypothesis appears to invoke an
aspect ratio based prediction, which doesn't seem to accord with the typical use of the term 'low-
level'. That is, on page 5 in the description of the two predictions, the authors state that a strictly
low-level retinotopic adaptation prediction will mean a thin adaptor oriented 90 degrees relative to
the test will cause the test to appear taller. I agree. BUT, I was less clear on why the prediction then
becomes that a taller stimulus will need to add weight to appear normal. From an aspect ratio
perspective I think I can appreciate that argument, but is an aspect ratio explanation what the
authors are seeking to present in this 'low-level' account? If so then this should be more clearly laid
out. Wouldn't a simple spatial frequency based account simply and solely predict that, a thin adaptor
oriented 90 degrees to the test would cause the test to appear taller?
Authors' Reply
Apologies for the lack of clarity. Although the principal low-level aftereffect that we refer to is that of
spatial frequency (see references 14-15), we assume that in general, judgements of body width are
made relative to height of the stimulus (i.e. an aspect ratio judgement). Hence, the SF aftereffect
and resulting perceptual bias should display low-level properties (such as being tied to a retinotopic
frame of reference), even though the judgement may occur, in principle, on the basis of information
at any level of the visual system (as in any perceptual task).
We believe that the assumption that judgements of body width are made relative to height of the
stimulus is sound, based on everyday observation. If judgements of body width were not made
relative to height, people would appear to get fatter as they approach an observer & skinnier as they
move away. Although we know of no literature that has explicitly tested this, we also believe that
this is also a central assumption of previous studies that have used photographic body stimuli that
are smaller than actual size.
Action
To clarify, we have added the following text: "This will make it appear taller, and hence, under the
assumption that body width judgements are made relative to the height of the individual, an
increase in width would be required to reach a normal appearance, leading to an increased PSN."
2. Reviewer's comment:
Was a forehead and chinrest or some similar restraint used to control the head angle of the
participants in the study? If not, then the unconstrained head movements that almost certainly
would have been made by the observers during the study would seem to compromise the main
experimental manipulation (body orientation) in Experiment 1 and thus its conclusions.
Authors' Reply
All participants were instructed to maintain their heads in an upright position throughout. Note that
if the effect were low-level, a head tilt of >22.5deg in the direction of each stimulus would have been
required on each trial to produce the pattern of results shown by our participants. The experimenter
did not observe significant head tilt by any participant.
Action
The following text has been added to page 7.
"Participants were instructed to maintain their heads in an upright position throughout."
3. Reviewer's comment:
I have a similar concern over the size manipulation in Experiment 2. I don't understand why a fixed
size change wasn't used. Unlike Experiment 1 where the orientation change of the stimulus was
fixed, the size change is random, meaning that (if I understand it correctly), on an unknown number
of trials, there was little or no physical difference in adapt and test stimulus size. For this reason, the
transfer across size cannot be meaningfully compared with the transfer across orientation. In my
view this experiment cannot effectively test the consequence of a size difference between adaptor
and test, as it sets out to do, given that the two corresponded in size on an unknown number of
trials. The size change between the two needs to be blocked with a difference of at least 25%, as is
typical in face adaptation research and in many global shape adaptation experiments.
Authors' Reply
Apologies for the misunderstanding. To be clear, we do not attempt to compare the transfer across
size with the transfer across orientation. Instead, we attempt to reduce the contribution of low-level
aftereffects by changing the size of the test stimulus relative to the (fixed) size of the adaptation
stimulus. Our results suggest that this was successful.
Although it is true that on approximately half of the trials the difference would have been smaller
than the 25% value that the reviewer notes, on the other half it would have been larger. (It should
be noted that the use of a 25% difference in size is arbitrary.)
The reviewer gives no reason why this method cannot effectively test the consequence of a size
difference between adaptor and test. Although it is true that many face researchers use blocked size
differences, logically speaking, we believe that the present method remains valid.
Action
To clarify, we have added the following text in the section entitled "Experiment 2":
"Specifically, we attempt to reduce the contribution of low-level aftereffects by changing the size of
the test stimulus relative to the (fixed) size of the adaptation stimulus."

The legends for Figures 2 & 3 could be expanded in detail to make them more standalone.
Authors' Reply
Agreed.
Action
A description of the results has been added for each, as follows:
"Figure 2. Data for Experiment 1. a) PSN change following adaptation to expanded stimuli.
Subsequently seen stimuli appear thinner, resulting in a wider stimulus being perceived as normal,
and a positive PSN for both relative orientation conditions. b) PSN change following adaptation to
contracted stimuli. Subsequently seen stimuli appear wider, resulting in a thinner stimulus being
perceived as normal, and a negative PSN for both relative orientation conditions. In both a) and b),
effects are larger when test patterns have the same orientation as the adaptor, compared to when
orientations differ. Error bars represent +/-1SEM."
Figure 3. Data for Experiment 2. a) PSN change following adaptation to expanded stimuli.
Subsequently seen stimuli appear thinner, resulting in a wider stimulus being perceived as normal,
and a positive PSN for both relative orientation conditions. b) PSN change following adaptation to
contracted stimuli. Subsequently seen stimuli appear wider, resulting in a thinner stimulus being
perceived as normal, and a negative PSN for both relative orientation conditions. In both a) and b),
although effects appear to be marginally larger when test patterns have the same orientation as the
adaptor, compared to when orientations differ, these differences are not statistically significant.
Error bars represent +/-1SEM.
Reviewer #2
1. Reviewer's comment:
…To put it another way, although these experiments place a "lower bound" on how early in visual
processing this aftereffect might be attributed, it doesn't persuasively put any upper bound on
whether this is a "high level visual" aftereffect, or a cognitive effect wherein the adaptors
manipulate the anchor point people use when making judgements. Both of these possibilities are
psychologically interesting, and relevant to real-life body image questions. I would like to see this
possibilty discussed in the paper, perhaps with reference to some of the several papers which have
recently made this point regarding other aftereffects…
Authors' Reply
Although, in the interests of brevity, we had omitted a discussion of this distinction, we are happy to
add this text at the reviewer's suggestion.
Action
The following text has been added.
"While low-level sources of body size and shape aftereffects can be effectively ruled out, the exact
nature and locus of the effect has yet to be firmly established. Although observers who experience
demonstrations of these effects subjectively report actually "seeing" a distortion of body shape, it
remains possible that a substantial proportion of the effects measured here and in other reports of
body size and shape aftereffects (13, 16-24, 35) involve changes at the decision/criterion level,
rather than a perceptual bias per se (36). While both of these effects have relevance to real-world
issues of body size and shape misperception, future experimental research may be informative in
teasing them apart for the purpose of forming an improved understanding of normal and disordered
processes of body perception."
2. Reviewer's comment:
One niggling conceptual point: The introductory framing refers to the problems of innacurate self
body image. However the stimuli and task measure adaptation to *image* stretchings, and the
participant is asked a question framed in terms of image stretching (Does this image appear "larger
or smaller than a normal unmanipulated image would"? - p7 line 33). This doesn't seem to me a fatal
flaw, as the stretched and squashed stimuli in Figure 1 do indeed appear to depict "skinnier" and
"fatter" people - but they also appear unnatural at the extremes, and the cues an observer uses to
judge whether the image has been stretched or squashed could in principle be completely
independent of those one usually uses to judge body weight. This might be the case e.g. if the
models used to create the stimuli varied widely in weight, in which case overall "wideness" of the
images would not be a useful cue to use when answering the question "has this image been
stretched or squashed?" It would be good to at least note the range of body shapes in the stimuli,
and/or provide as a supplementary figure all 8 unaltered identities.
Authors' Reply
The identities used were indeed carefully selected to be relatively homogeneous in terms of their
objective measurements (BMI), to control body shape. We now provide additional information on
these individuals in the methods section. We have also provided a supplementary figure depicting all
10 identities, as requested.
Action
The following text has been added:
"Photographic subjects were between the ages of 18 and 27 (M = 21.2, SD = 3.6), with body mass
indices in the normal range (21.4 to 22.4 kg/m2, M = 21.65, SD = 0.21) to ensure consistency of
form."
The legend to the supplementary figure reads as follows:
"Supplementary figure. Decapitated, but otherwise unaltered images of all 10 identities. All body
mass indices were in the normal range (21.4 to 22.4 kg/m2, M = 21.65, SD = 0.21) to ensure
consistency of form."

Reviewer’s comments
I reiterate that the paper represents an interesting issue in the field and acknowledge that the authors
are experienced experts in the methods used. I am a fan of their work. In addition I agree that the
manuscript has been improved in this revision. However, the authors have not, in my view, made a
genuine attempt at discussing the limitations of the design choices when it comes to the
manipulations employed.
Again, I note that without the use of a head restraint there can be no real certainty that the
orientation change between adaptor and test was faithfully maintained throughout the experiment.
Instruction to a participant is not an effective manipulation check. The presence of tuning argues that
it was an effective manipulation and that’s great. All I am asking the authors to do, given they are
reporting the specific degree of transfer for future studies to reference/compare to, is to provide an
acknowledgement that the precise tuning estimate reported in their study may be an over or under
estimate of the real transfer across orientation, due to not restraining the head angle of the
participants in the study. This is a limitation of the design and should be acknowledged.
I still see the size manipulation as having the same problem. The authors suggest 25% is arbitrary,
and it is. However, the reason the variable size difference manipulation is not an effective one is
because tilt (and I assume but admit I do not know, spatial frequency) after-effects are tightly tuned
for spatial correspondence between the adaptor and test. Therefore, if one blocks the size change
between the two then the desired lack of spatial correspondence (i.e. reduction of low level after-
effects to the primary result) can be assumed- barring eye movements which obviously happen but
are discouraged by the central fixation cross and instruction to gaze upon it. BUT If one does not block
the size change then on a number of trials there is often near (within a receptive field size) or perfect
correspondence between adaptor and test. The compromises the effectiveness of the size
manipulation and therefore the reduction of the contribution of low level after-effects to the primary
result. How can it not? The only way it would not compromise the design is if the adaptation effects
decayed at the rate of the presentation sequence, meaning that those trials in which correspondence
was present did not have any influence on other trials where correspondence was not present. I am
not aware of any evidence that after-effects decay at such a rate. So again, I would ask the authors to
present a discussion of this issue and acknowledge it as a limitation of their design.
Authors’ Reply
We now discuss the specifics of these design limitations, and their impact on the measurements of the
specific degree of transfer in the discussion (pg. 12) with the new text as follows:
“Our study showed a transfer of adaptation across orientation of 58% and 80% in experiments 1 and
2 respectively. However, two caveats should be mentioned with respect to the accuracy of these
values. Firstly, while the technique of randomly varying the size of the test stimuli was successful in
reducing low-level contributions, this differs subtly from the technique used more commonly in face
adaptation. Instead, a set difference in size between adaptation and test stimulus (often 25% or
larger) is more usually employed and assumed to be sufficient to minimize the engagement of
common low-level mechanisms by adaptor and test (although the magnitude of the size change
necessary has not been empirically verified). For half of the trials in experiment 2 the size difference
would have been larger than this value, up to 50%, but for the other half, the size difference would
have been smaller, and in a very small number of trials, negligible. On these trials, low-level
contributions are expected to be as large as in experiment 1. As such, it may be possible to reduce
low-level contributions even further by ensuring that the sizes of adaptation and test stimuli are never
similar. Secondly, although participants were instructed to keep their heads upright during viewing,
and while the experimenter did not observe any head movements by participants, it remains possible
that subtle head orientation shifts may have occurred. Such movements would be more likely to occur
in the direction of the orientation of the stimuli, which would slightly increase the influence of the low-
level effects in the “different” orientation condition and hence inflate the observed extent of
orientation transfer in both experiments.”
