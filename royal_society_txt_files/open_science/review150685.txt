Kunert and colleagues argue that interference between music and language processing is due to
shared syntactic integration resources and not general attention load. They provide convincing
evidence for their point of view in two behavioural experiments, with newly developed and
piloted stimulus material that builds on key modulations. Syntactic garden-paths in language
(but not arithmetic or semantic garden-paths) significantly change the experience of “closure” of
concurrently presented musical pieces, lending evidence for the syntactic (rather than purely
attention-related) nature of shared music-language resources. Overall, the manuscript is well
written, the methods are original and sound, the different facets of data analysis clearly
explained. It is of special note that the authors are one of the first to present influences of
language syntax on music-syntactic processing, while avoiding syntactic violations. There are,
however, a couple of points that should be addressed in a revision.
Major points:
[1] The manuscript is extremely long (59 pages of manuscript). While – after having read the
manuscript – I consider the depth of detail and resulting clarity of the experimental methods
somewhat acceptable, the General Discussion gives room to be shortened. Specifically, I do not
see where the discussion on ERP components (ERAN, ELAN, etc.) is leading on page 40.
Essentially, these studies are well in line with the present results and any discussion on the
music-specificity of these ERP-components is misleading, unfortunately incomplete and beyond
the scope of the present behavioural study. Rather, if the authors wish to mention possible
confounds in these works, this could happen in the context of Rogalsky et al. (2011) – but note
that this study has substantial methodological limitations.
[2] The links to dynamic attending theory (DAT) and its implications could be clearer. As the
authors state, DAT is typically based on rhythm, claiming that listeners’ attention entrains to
regular strong beats. I also see that entrainment to harmony is in principal possible, because
harmonically stable events typically coincide with strong beats – so both are intimately linked.
Consequently, the question is not only whether a study uses harmonic manipulations in final or
middle positions of a sequence (as discussed on page 6), but whether it uses harmonic
manipulations on strong or weak beats. The present study employed harmonic manipulations on
strong beats (and asked for closure judgments on weak beats) if one assumes that the sequences
(at least the one in Figure 1) were perceived as 4/4 meter, driven by the harmonically strong
tonics in the first, fifth and ninth position of the sequence. [As an aside, this could be an essential
difference between the present study and Perruchet & Poulin’s (2012) manipulations that did not
occur on strong beats.]
Now, my question is: Why do the authors assume that no entrainment takes place in the
linguistic stimuli, given that they were presented simultaneously with the chords that have the
clear potential to entrain (“first scenario” on page 8)? Does it actually matter to which stimulus
train the participants entrain if they are presented simultaneously, i.e. during the same
attentional cycle? The simultaneous presentation makes the discussion on linguistic influence on
music or vice versa somewhat tricky (and perhaps unnecessary). Assuming that participants
entrain to the musical stimulus, and that the presentation of an unexpected (modulating) chord at
the attention peak in the 9th position is “thought to remove the benefit received from attention
being focused” on this point (page 6), it would essentially be music that leads to a break-down in
both concurrent tasks.
3
Minor points:
[1] The authors use “coördination” throughout the text. Is there any reason why they don’t use
“coordination” as in the original publications by Hoeks et al. (2002, 2006)?
[2] What do the authors mean by “hold music constant” on page 41 of the discussion?
[3] The authors argue that the results cannot be explained by working memory, given that a
covariate of digit-span data does not have an effect on the results. On the other hand, the data
clearly show that the memory trace for the first key decays more quickly during challenging
syntactic tasks. One solution might be to assume a “syntactic working memory” as has been done
in the language domain. The publications by Fiebach et al., 2005, HBM; Meyer et al., 2012,
NeuroImage; Makuuchi et al., 2011, PNAS might be worthwhile to check.

Kunert et al. present two experiments investigating the shared syntactic integration resource
hypothesis of A. Patel. In contrast to most previous studies, they investigated the influence of a
language material (or an arithmetic material) on the perception of musical structures. For the
language material, the authors manipulated syntactic structures and semantic relations. For the
arithmetic material, they manipulated the difficulty of the task. Participants’ main task was
related to musical structures (i.e., judging musical closure after a return to the main key or not).
The authors report a changed pattern for the musical closure data for the manipulated syntax
structures, but not for the semantic structures or the arithmetic task. The authors interpret their
findings in support of Patel’s hypothesis and reject a set of alternative hypotheses.
While the present research integrates in a currently expanding research domain and addresses a
timely research question, I have various concerns with the present manuscript, in particular with
the presentation of the theoretical frameworks (and the associated interpretations and
implications), the presentation of previously published data, the created dependent variable
based on the music task, the design of the semantic task control questions, the interpretation of
the closure data and the reported analyses.

Introduction and discussion refer to Jones’ dynamic attending theory and some related research,
but its presentation includes a set of incorrect statements or misleading statements. For example,
the main interpretation and prediction of the dynamic attending theory is not attentional capture
by an unexpected event, but rather the reverse – a benefit for the expected event with more
available attentional resources. This is a crucial difference. The Tillman/Escoffier study included
a baseline condition showing that it is *not* slowing down visual processing (as stated page 6
here), but rather speeding up visual processing with the expected event (tonic). Note also that the
dynamic attending theory was originally not developed for rhythmic influences on event
duration estimation, but comes from music cognition (on pitch and time dimensions). It is further
incorrect to state that it only applies to the final chord/tone of a sequence; it rather describes a
dynamic shape of the entire melody. In addition, the benefit for the tonic has also been reported
for other positions than the final one (see Tillman & Marmel, 2013; Patel et al., 1998, for example).
Finally, the presentation page 7 is completely ignoring that S. Koelsch has conducted ERP studies
with tasks on both dimensions.
The present study is based on the hypothesis (page 8) that the different manipulations and
control conditions are equally difficult to process. However, this is not guaranteed here. In a
related vein, it is problematic that the comprehension prompts in the semantics part do not target
the semantic ambiguity of the sentence; the authors thus have no control whether participants
processed the ambiguity. And this is even more problematic as there was no effect, page 32.
Similarly, it is also surprising that the arithmetic condition did not include filler items.
The study investigates the effect of various visual conditions on the judgments of musical closure.
However, instead of analyzing the ratings on the subjective scale, the authors report a surprising,
unusual re-coding of the data (i.e., a subject-specific median-split analysis; “proportion of trials
which indicated high closure”). In addition to the arbitrary sounding of this coding, it is not clear
whether it is calculated across all items, why low closure items are excluded, whether this could
hide effects or show other patterns. The data themselves are not reassuring for this coding
technique. In particular, one would have expected lower exposure ratings for sequences ending
on the second key as these are missing the return to the first (main) key (as would be expected for
Western tonal music). This further highlights the need of an additional control condition
collecting closure ratings for music presented without additional visual tasks (missing here).
Indeed, the authors’ interpretation (see page 24 and elsewhere) would require the observation of
lowest closure ratings for the second-key endings. Furthermore, the ratings were given at the end
of the sequence; so far from the manipulated critical item – It seems important to also use an
additional task (with response times related to the critical item).
The authors need to take into account the debate on sensory and cognitive expectations (e.g.,
Leman, 2000; Collins et al., 2014; Bigand et al., 2003; Koelsch et al., 2007) to temper the
interpretation in terms of musical syntax. Indeed, the introduced “critical chord” is not only a
chord of the second key, but also a chord introducing new, previously unheard tones and thus
might be creating a sensory violation. The material needs to be checked with a model, such as the
one proposed by M. Leman, or all interpretations adjusted accordingly.
Experiment 1
Results
Page 21: The data starting line 40 should be presented in link with the interaction with language,
as it was modulating the effects.
Page 22: The crucial three-way interaction was only marginally significant p=.068.
Page 24: The additional analysis with digit span as a co-variate is not convincing as it might not
be sensitive enough (as also suggested by the null effects of this analysis).
Method/Material
Page 15 indicates 40 critical items, while the other conditions have 60 critical items, thus not
“ensuring an equal number”. It seems also problematic that the arithmetic condition did not
contain filler items (in contrast to the other conditions).
Did the authors observe order effects in the two experiments?
Please clarify the description of counterbalancing of item versions (page 17) and explain why.
5
Experiment 2:
The pre-test 2 should also analyze the 10th word, which might reveal an effect.
Page 30 top: Are numbers mixed up here? 88ms vs. 20ms and 78ms vs. 40ms do not seem equally
salient (should it be 88 vs. 78 and 20 vs. 40?).
The combined analysis (page 35) should be dropped as manipulations and difficulty levels are
not comparable.
Page 37: How were the F2-analyses conducted? As there were two different types, this needs to
be presented more clearly.
Discussion.
Regarding Slevc et al. (2009), the interpretation (as well as the introduction section) needs to take
into account that this study did not observe the classical advantage of in-key chords over out-of-
key chords (response times were slower for the in-key chords; see Table 1 and page 378 in Slevc
et al., 2009).
The authors should acknowledge that the advantage of the studies cited page 40 is that their
measured response was time-locked on the relevant item – not collected at the end, as here.
Further comments:
Footnote 3 is a vague statement. It would be necessary to analyze their material for that feature.
Footnote 5 is not clear. What is the three-way interaction referring to here? And where can
1932ms be found? What are sub-processes of harmonic processing?
Footnote 5: The sound material should be made available as supplementary material of the
journal.
Footnote 7: This would require testing of sequences without modulations and reporting the
closure ratings (the authors might find the answer in their filler trials?).
The supplementary materials are missing.
Page 6: “in separate theoretical frameworks” – Please clarify.
Page 8: the statement on visual language task is too strong here; internal subvocal reading might
lead to similar effects and cannot be excluded.
Page 8: “integrate chords” into?
Page 9: Note that reference 22 did not include modulations.
Why coördinations? Check spelling throughout the ms.

This article tests the hypothesis that processing of music and language make a demand on a
shared pool of resources for syntactic processes. Participants read sentences with a temporary
syntactic ambiguity, namely S vs. NP conjunction (Expt 1) or subject- vs. object relative clause
sentences (Expt 2) while listening to musical stimuli. Control conditions presented the melodies
along with arithmetic problems (Expt 1) or with semantic garden path sentences (Expt 2). The
novel aspect of this study is that it looks for effects of the secondary task on a music task, namely
judgments of closure. Experiment 1 showed that in the ambiguous S conjunction, people were
less likely to give a high closure rating as compared to the NP conjunction condition (apparently,
it is tacitly assumed that the NP conjunction is the preferred analysis). The disambiguated S-
conjunction condition was in between and did not differ from the other two conditions. Similarly,
in the object relative clause condition there were fewer high closure ratings as compared to the
subject-relative condition. An analysis that collapsed both experiments indicated that the effect
on musical judgment is restricted to endings in the first key (each melody had a part in one key
and then a part in a second key). This suggests that the process that is tapped into here is related
to keeping a key in working memory. No effects were found of the math or semantic garden path
control condition suggesting that a demand is made on specialized, syntactic resources.
This is an interesting study that contributes to a strand of research in the literature that uses dual-
task paradigms to anwer the question of whether there is overlap in resources or mechanisms in
music and language (and other domains). I had the feeling that there were quite a number of
issues with Experiment 1, many of which are repaired in Experiment 2 which is overall much
better controlled. However, since Experiment 1 is not fully convincing, neither is the global
analysis that collapses both experiment (which is difficult to justify anyway given that the
experiments differ in many ways). At the level of theory, the authors are not really clear about
what they mean with syntactic “resources”. What is the place of these resources in theories of
language comprehension and of music perception? How compelling, given the work in
psycholinguistics on this issue, is the notion of resources that are specific to the processing of
syntax?
Specific comments:
1. Design of Experiment 1. This design is not fully symmetrical. There is a temporary ambiguous
and unambiguous S-conjunction and a temporary ambiguous NP-conjunction. The latter
condition is labeled as “non-garden path,” presumably because it is tacitly assumed that the NP-
conjunction is the preferred interpretation. However, it is never tested whether this is indeed the
preferred interpretation for these participants and items and neither is it tested whether this
STAYS the preferred interpretation during the course of the experiment (after all, the frequency
of S-conjunctions during the session is much higher than normal, possibly leading to a shift).
Why was there no unambiguous NP conjunction in the design (e.g., “zowel de man als de
vrouw….”)? Why were there no pretests on the garden-path effects of the stimuli? Why was
position of the item during the session not included as a variable?
2. Related to the previous point: in my experience disambiguation of an S-conjunction using a
comma is not very effective; readers often seem to miss the comma, rendering the sentence
effectively ambiguous.
7
3. Math condition. The math secondary task exerted no effect on the closure judgments. But how
do we know this is really because the closure judgments draw on a specialized pool of resources?
Can’t it be the case that the difference between the hard and easy math task was simply too small
to have an effect on a more global pool of resources?
4. Dependent variable. On the one hand, it is really interesting that the authors find information
in a set of ratings that suffer from a ceiling effect. On the other hand, to do it like this is clearly a
post-hoc decision and it is conceivable that this dv has limited sensitivity to detect subtle effects.
This is problematic, given that the claim for specialized resources depends crucially on some
conditions not showing an effect (namely the math task and the semantic garden path condition).
5. Analyses. By-item analyses are only reported in the analysis that collapses both experiments.
Why not for all analyses? I also miss analyses that test for effect by positition in the session and
analyses that include musical expertise as a variable.
6. Accuracy of object-relative clause comprehension. The prompts after OR sentences were
answered correctly in only 37% of the trials. In other words, in 63% of the trials, participants
misinterpreted them as a SR sentence. This seems problematic – it looks as if the participants
abandoned a full analysis of the sentences on many of the trials, possibly in order to attend the
melodies better (after all, the primary task concerns the melodies). This aspect of the data is not
discussed.
7. Influences of music on semantic processing and vice versa. Page 41 points out that earlier
research found that harmony violations increased syntactic effects more strongly than semantic
effects in past research (Perruchet & Poulin-Charronet, 2013). Given the weaker semantic effect
there, it is perhaps not surprising that the current study, testing the reverse direction, also found
no semantic effect – it is simply more difficult to detect a semantic garden path effect than a
syntactic garden path effect. Further though, if the authors wish to make a strong claim about
assymetric influences between semantic processing and harmony processing they would need to
show that they can replicate P & P’s effect using their semantic garden path sentences.
8. Writing. The paper is generally well-written, but there is an excessive number of footnotes,
some of which might better be integrated with the text.

Three researchers with relevant expertise have reviewed your manuscript. All three reviewers
had concerns about the manuscript in its current form, with two reviewers recommending major
revision and one reviewer recommending rejection. In my view, the reviewers' concerns could be
addressed in a revision of the manuscript. Issues that stand out as particularly important are the
relevance and characterisation of dynamic attending theory, the necessity of reporting
experiment 1, and the sensitivity of the dependent measure in experiment 2. Addressing these
issues, alongside other concerns raised by the reviewers, would strengthen the manuscript.

Kunert and colleagues argue that interference between music and language processing is due to
shared syntactic integration resources and not general attention load. They provide convincing
evidence for their point of view in two behavioural experiments, with newly developed and
piloted stimulus material that builds on key modulations. Syntactic garden-paths in language
(but not arithmetic or semantic garden-paths) significantly change the experience of “closure” of
concurrently presented musical pieces, lending evidence for the syntactic (rather than purely
attention-related) nature of shared music-language resources. Overall, the manuscript is well
written, the methods are original and sound, the different facets of data analysis clearly
explained. It is of special note that the authors are one of the first to present influences of
language syntax on music-syntactic processing, while avoiding syntactic violations. There are,
however, a couple of points that should be addressed in a revision.
Major points:
[1] The manuscript is extremely long (59 pages of manuscript). While – after having read the
manuscript – I consider the depth of detail and resulting clarity of the experimental methods
somewhat acceptable, the General Discussion gives room to be shortened. Specifically, I do not
see where the discussion on ERP components (ERAN, ELAN, etc.) is leading on page 40.
Essentially, these studies are well in line with the present results and any discussion on the
music-specificity of these ERP-components is misleading, unfortunately incomplete and beyond
the scope of the present behavioural study. Rather, if the authors wish to mention possible
confounds in these works, this could happen in the context of Rogalsky et al. (2011) – but note
that this study has substantial methodological limitations.
[2] The links to dynamic attending theory (DAT) and its implications could be clearer. As the
authors state, DAT is typically based on rhythm, claiming that listeners’ attention entrains to
regular strong beats. I also see that entrainment to harmony is in principal possible, because
harmonically stable events typically coincide with strong beats – so both are intimately linked.
Consequently, the question is not only whether a study uses harmonic manipulations in final or
middle positions of a sequence (as discussed on page 6), but whether it uses harmonic
manipulations on strong or weak beats. The present study employed harmonic manipulations on
strong beats (and asked for closure judgments on weak beats) if one assumes that the sequences
(at least the one in Figure 1) were perceived as 4/4 meter, driven by the harmonically strong
tonics in the first, fifth and ninth position of the sequence. [As an aside, this could be an essential
difference between the present study and Perruchet & Poulin’s (2012) manipulations that did not
occur on strong beats.]
Now, my question is: Why do the authors assume that no entrainment takes place in the
linguistic stimuli, given that they were presented simultaneously with the chords that have the
clear potential to entrain (“first scenario” on page 8)? Does it actually matter to which stimulus
train the participants entrain if they are presented simultaneously, i.e. during the same
attentional cycle? The simultaneous presentation makes the discussion on linguistic influence on
music or vice versa somewhat tricky (and perhaps unnecessary). Assuming that participants
9
entrain to the musical stimulus, and that the presentation of an unexpected (modulating) chord at
the attention peak in the 9th position is “thought to remove the benefit received from attention
being focused” on this point (page 6), it would essentially be music that leads to a break-down in
both concurrent tasks.
Minor points:
[1] The authors use “coördination” throughout the text. Is there any reason why they don’t use
“coordination” as in the original publications by Hoeks et al. (2002, 2006)?
[2] What do the authors mean by “hold music constant” on page 41 of the discussion?
[3] The authors argue that the results cannot be explained by working memory, given that a
covariate of digit-span data does not have an effect on the results. On the other hand, the data
clearly show that the memory trace for the first key decays more quickly during challenging
syntactic tasks. One solution might be to assume a “syntactic working memory” as has been done
in the language domain. The publications by Fiebach et al., 2005, HBM; Meyer et al., 2012,
NeuroImage; Makuuchi et al., 2011, PNAS might be worthwhile to check.

Comments to the Author(s)
Kunert et al. present two experiments investigating the shared syntactic integration resource
hypothesis of A. Patel. In contrast to most previous studies, they investigated the influence of a
language material (or an arithmetic material) on the perception of musical structures. For the
language material, the authors manipulated syntactic structures and semantic relations. For the
arithmetic material, they manipulated the difficulty of the task. Participants’ main task was
related to musical structures (i.e., judging musical closure after a return to the main key or not).
The authors report a changed pattern for the musical closure data for the manipulated syntax
structures, but not for the semantic structures or the arithmetic task. The authors interpret their
findings in support of Patel’s hypothesis and reject a set of alternative hypotheses.
While the present research integrates in a currently expanding research domain and addresses a
timely research question, I have various concerns with the present manuscript, in particular with
the presentation of the theoretical frameworks (and the associated interpretations and
implications), the presentation of previously published data, the created dependent variable
based on the music task, the design of the semantic task control questions, the interpretation of
the closure data and the reported analyses.
Introduction and discussion refer to Jones’ dynamic attending theory and some related research,
but its presentation includes a set of incorrect statements or misleading statements. For example,
the main interpretation and prediction of the dynamic attending theory is not attentional capture
by an unexpected event, but rather the reverse – a benefit for the expected event with more
available attentional resources. This is a crucial difference. The Tillman/Escoffier study included
a baseline condition showing that it is *not* slowing down visual processing (as stated page 6
here), but rather speeding up visual processing with the expected event (tonic). Note also that the
dynamic attending theory was originally not developed for rhythmic influences on event
duration estimation, but comes from music cognition (on pitch and time dimensions). It is further
incorrect to state that it only applies to the final chord/tone of a sequence; it rather describes a
dynamic shape of the entire melody. In addition, the benefit for the tonic has also been reported
for other positions than the final one (see Tillman & Marmel, 2013; Patel et al., 1998, for example).
Finally, the presentation page 7 is completely ignoring that S. Koelsch has conducted ERP studies
with tasks on both dimensions.
The present study is based on the hypothesis (page 8) that the different manipulations and
control conditions are equally difficult to process. However, this is not guaranteed here. In a
related vein, it is problematic that the comprehension prompts in the semantics part do not target
the semantic ambiguity of the sentence; the authors thus have no control whether participants
10
processed the ambiguity. And this is even more problematic as there was no effect, page 32.
Similarly, it is also surprising that the arithmetic condition did not include filler items.
The study investigates the effect of various visual conditions on the judgments of musical closure.
However, instead of analyzing the ratings on the subjective scale, the authors report a surprising,
unusual re-coding of the data (i.e., a subject-specific median-split analysis; “proportion of trials
which indicated high closure”). In addition to the arbitrary sounding of this coding, it is not clear
whether it is calculated across all items, why low closure items are excluded, whether this could
hide effects or show other patterns. The data themselves are not reassuring for this coding
technique. In particular, one would have expected lower exposure ratings for sequences ending
on the second key as these are missing the return to the first (main) key (as would be expected for
Western tonal music). This further highlights the need of an additional control condition
collecting closure ratings for music presented without additional visual tasks (missing here).
Indeed, the authors’ interpretation (see page 24 and elsewhere) would require the observation of
lowest closure ratings for the second-key endings. Furthermore, the ratings were given at the end
of the sequence; so far from the manipulated critical item – It seems important to also use an
additional task (with response times related to the critical item).
The authors need to take into account the debate on sensory and cognitive expectations (e.g.,
Leman, 2000; Collins et al., 2014; Bigand et al., 2003; Koelsch et al., 2007) to temper the
interpretation in terms of musical syntax. Indeed, the introduced “critical chord” is not only a
chord of the second key, but also a chord introducing new, previously unheard tones and thus
might be creating a sensory violation. The material needs to be checked with a model, such as the
one proposed by M. Leman, or all interpretations adjusted accordingly.
Experiment 1
Results
Page 21: The data starting line 40 should be presented in link with the interaction with language,
as it was modulating the effects.
Page 22: The crucial three-way interaction was only marginally significant p=.068.
Page 24: The additional analysis with digit span as a co-variate is not convincing as it might not
be sensitive enough (as also suggested by the null effects of this analysis).
Method/Material
Page 15 indicates 40 critical items, while the other conditions have 60 critical items, thus not
“ensuring an equal number”. It seems also problematic that the arithmetic condition did not
contain filler items (in contrast to the other conditions).
Did the authors observe order effects in the two experiments?
Please clarify the description of counterbalancing of item versions (page 17) and explain why.
Experiment 2:
The pre-test 2 should also analyze the 10th word, which might reveal an effect.
Page 30 top: Are numbers mixed up here? 88ms vs. 20ms and 78ms vs. 40ms do not seem equally
salient (should it be 88 vs. 78 and 20 vs. 40?).
The combined analysis (page 35) should be dropped as manipulations and difficulty levels are
not comparable.
Page 37: How were the F2-analyses conducted? As there were two different types, this needs to
be presented more clearly.
Discussion.
Regarding Slevc et al. (2009), the interpretation (as well as the introduction section) needs to take
into account that this study did not observe the classical advantage of in-key chords over out-of-
key chords (response times were slower for the in-key chords; see Table 1 and page 378 in Slevc
et al., 2009).
The authors should acknowledge that the advantage of the studies cited page 40 is that their
measured response was time-locked on the relevant item – not collected at the end, as here.

This article tests the hypothesis that processing of music and language make a demand on a
shared pool of resources for syntactic processes. Participants read sentences with a temporary
syntactic ambiguity, namely S vs. NP conjunction (Expt 1) or subject- vs. object relative clause
sentences (Expt 2) while listening to musical stimuli. Control conditions presented the melodies
along with arithmetic problems (Expt 1) or with semantic garden path sentences (Expt 2). The
novel aspect of this study is that it looks for effects of the secondary task on a music task, namely
judgments of closure. Experiment 1 showed that in the ambiguous S conjunction, people were
less likely to give a high closure rating as compared to the NP conjunction condition (apparently,
it is tacitly assumed that the NP conjunction is the preferred analysis). The disambiguated S-
conjunction condition was in between and did not differ from the other two conditions. Similarly,
in the object relative clause condition there were fewer high closure ratings as compared to the
subject-relative condition. An analysis that collapsed both experiments indicated that the effect
on musical judgment is restricted to endings in the first key (each melody had a part in one key
and then a part in a second key). This suggests that the process that is tapped into here is related
to keeping a key in working memory. No effects were found of the math or semantic garden path
control condition suggesting that a demand is made on specialized, syntactic resources.
This is an interesting study that contributes to a strand of research in the literature that uses dual-
task paradigms to anwer the question of whether there is overlap in resources or mechanisms in
music and language (and other domains). I had the feeling that there were quite a number of
issues with Experiment 1, many of which are repaired in Experiment 2 which is overall much
better controlled. However, since Experiment 1 is not fully convincing, neither is the global
analysis that collapses both experiment (which is difficult to justify anyway given that the
experiments differ in many ways). At the level of theory, the authors are not really clear about
what they mean with syntactic “resources”. What is the place of these resources in theories of
language comprehension and of music perception? How compelling, given the work in
psycholinguistics on this issue, is the notion of resources that are specific to the processing of
syntax?
Specific comments:
1. Design of Experiment 1. This design is not fully symmetrical. There is a temporary ambiguous
and unambiguous S-conjunction and a temporary ambiguous NP-conjunction. The latter
12
condition is labeled as “non-garden path,” presumably because it is tacitly assumed that the NP-
conjunction is the preferred interpretation. However, it is never tested whether this is indeed the
preferred interpretation for these participants and items and neither is it tested whether this
STAYS the preferred interpretation during the course of the experiment (after all, the frequency
of S-conjunctions during the session is much higher than normal, possibly leading to a shift).
Why was there no unambiguous NP conjunction in the design (e.g., “zowel de man als de
vrouw….”)? Why were there no pretests on the garden-path effects of the stimuli? Why was
position of the item during the session not included as a variable?
2. Related to the previous point: in my experience disambiguation of an S-conjunction using a
comma is not very effective; readers often seem to miss the comma, rendering the sentence
effectively ambiguous.
3. Math condition. The math secondary task exerted no effect on the closure judgments. But how
do we know this is really because the closure judgments draw on a specialized pool of resources?
Can’t it be the case that the difference between the hard and easy math task was simply too small
to have an effect on a more global pool of resources?
4. Dependent variable. On the one hand, it is really interesting that the authors find information
in a set of ratings that suffer from a ceiling effect. On the other hand, to do it like this is clearly a
post-hoc decision and it is conceivable that this dv has limited sensitivity to detect subtle effects.
This is problematic, given that the claim for specialized resources depends crucially on some
conditions not showing an effect (namely the math task and the semantic garden path condition).
5. Analyses. By-item analyses are only reported in the analysis that collapses both experiments.
Why not for all analyses? I also miss analyses that test for effect by positition in the session and
analyses that include musical expertise as a variable.
6. Accuracy of object-relative clause comprehension. The prompts after OR sentences were
answered correctly in only 37% of the trials. In other words, in 63% of the trials, participants
misinterpreted them as a SR sentence. This seems problematic – it looks as if the participants
abandoned a full analysis of the sentences on many of the trials, possibly in order to attend the
melodies better (after all, the primary task concerns the melodies). This aspect of the data is not
discussed.
7. Influences of music on semantic processing and vice versa. Page 41 points out that earlier
research found that harmony violations increased syntactic effects more strongly than semantic
effects in past research (Perruchet & Poulin-Charronet, 2013). Given the weaker semantic effect
there, it is perhaps not surprising that the current study, testing the reverse direction, also found
no semantic effect – it is simply more difficult to detect a semantic garden path effect than a
syntactic garden path effect. Further though, if the authors wish to make a strong claim about
assymetric influences between semantic processing and harmony processing they would need to
show that they can replicate P & P’s effect using their semantic garden path sentences.
8. Writing. The paper is generally well-written, but there is an excessive number of footnotes,
some of which might better be integrated with the text.

The revised manuscript integrated some of the comments and suggestions, but ignored others. In
addition, some of the authors’ responses further highlight the major shortcomings of this study.
Please find here below my main concerns, which restrict considerably the proposed
interpretation and leaves the reader with numerous questions. The study opens an interesting
research line, but the shortcomings of the presented experiments rather call for considering them
as pilot testing and as a starting point to run experiments with well-controlled materials and
more standard data analyses.
First, it is problematic to use ratings of trial difficulty as the basis for the material construction.
Subjective (conscious) ratings of difficulty might well be different from processing difficulty. This
criticism of the material construction and validation becomes even more important as the authors
do not observe the expected language effects.
Second, a similar concern applies for the music material. The authors did not pretest their
material to investigate whether listeners perceive the musical structure manipulation as intended,
when presented without language material. This becomes even more important as the results do
not fit with the predictions for musical structure processing in either language condition. It is
thus not clear whether the influence of language is really on musical structure processing.
Third, the authors reject the relevance to take into account the debate on sensory and cognitive
expectations (see cover letter, page 7). However, the criticism of potential sensory violations
applies also when material is presented in different modalities and when presented in all critical
trials. Indeed, the use of strong harmonic changes contains sensory violations AND musical
structure/syntax violations. Consequently, it is impossible to make claims about specific
interactions between the processing of musical structures and of linguistic structures when these
interactions could also be caused by the sensory violations.
Fourth, the justification for the combined analyses is not convincing – in particular as the
difficulty effect changes from experiment 1 to experiment 2 from 0.53 to 0.35 (cover letter, page 9).
Experiment 1 is also problematic for the unexpected absence of processing difference between
unambiguous and ambiguous S-coordination sentences. Note that the manuscript still refers to
this first experiment as Experiment 1 and not as “exploratory study” as indicated in the cover
letter.
Results:
The cover letter indicates that “a data analysis strategy based on mean raw ratings shows the
same pattern of effects” as does the surprising, unusual re-coding of the data. These results
should also be shared with the reader, and should be presented rather than those based on the
unusual re-coding strategy.
Regarding the analysis with digit span as a covariate, readers might wonder about the variability
of this coarse measure and whether this might explain the null effects of this analysis.
15
The order effect analyses (page 8) should be performed separately for each experiment.

Comments to the Author:
The three original reviewers were invited to comment on the revised manuscript. Only two
reviewers were able to return reports by the due date. These reviewers made different
recommendations, with Reviewer 1 recommending that the manuscript be accepted for
publication following minor revision, while Reviewer 2 recommended that the manuscript be
rejected. This reviewer gives detailed reasons for this recommendation. After reading these
reasons, I believe that the reviewer’s concerns could be addressed in a further careful revision of
the manuscript. Most of the issues could be addressed by providing more detail in the paper.
However, one comment calls for additional data collection. Specifically, the reviewer notes that
the musical materials (without language materials) were not pretested to investigate whether
listeners perceive the musical structure manipulation as intended. This could be checked with a
small sample of participants, and the results reported in the manuscript.
In addition to the reviewers’ comments, I have some comments (mostly minor stylistic
suggestions):
p. 2, line 32: “to hold a harmonic key online”
It is not clear what the key is held in. Working memory?
p. 6, line 15: “was sung in an expected (tonic) rather than a less expected (subdominant) final
chord.”
Sung “in the context of” or “accompanied by”?
p. 6, line 19: “attentional accents”
Is this the term used by the authors? I have not come across the term before.
p. 7, line 21: “is held online”
Again, where is it held?
p. 10: Is bar line placement arbitrary in Fig 1? Does it indicate the position of an “attentional
accent”?
p. 15, line 10: “Each music item was shown”
“Presented” would be better than “shown” given the auditory modality.
p. 17, line 6: “our data displayed a ceiling effect likely because all critical sequences ended on an
authentic cadence”
The reviewers took issue with the solution (the subject-specific median-split analysis) taken to
handle this. Were other forms of data transformation considered to deal with the skew?
p. 19, Fig 3A: “cosure” > “closure” on vertical axis.
p. 21, line 27: “higher working memory resources” > “higher demands on working memory
resources”
p. 35, line 44: “straight forward” > “straightforward”

As I have indicated in an earlier review, the study integrates in an interesting, growing research
domain and the addressed question could make an important contribution by testing different
manipulations as well as different directionality between music and language interactions.
However, as the presented experiments have strong shortcomings and raise numerous concerns,
I cannot recommend this study for publication. The authors can use this study as a good starting
point to improve their approach and implementation to further develop this research line.
19
The revised manuscript now includes a post-test for the musical material, presented without
linguistic task. The results confirm high closure ratings for cadence endings and low closure
ratings for no-cadence endings. However, the results did not show significant differences
between first-key and second-key endings, even though – as pointed out by the authors – the
means suggested the difference in the same direction as for the main experiment. This led the
authors to conclude to “virtually identical closure ratings” (a statement, which seems too strong
and would need to be tempered). However, the first-key and second-key endings were the two
crucial conditions of the main experiment, and the comparisons were interpreted as processing of
harmonic structures and musical syntax. Music theory (with its foundations of musical syntax)
would predict the reverse pattern: stronger closure for first-key endings (respecting tonal unity)
than second-key endings (violating this syntactic rule). The finding thus suggests that
participants might use other features for their judgments than musical syntax, such as for
example, that acoustically the last two chords of the second-key ending fit more strongly with the
tones of the preceding bar than is the case for the first-key ending.
This brings us again to the point that the ninth chord (the first chord in the second key following
the pivot chord) introduces tones that had not been presented before. Consequently, this chord is
not only belonging to a new tonal entity (key), but is also introducing an acoustic violation (in
comparison to other preceding information that is stored in short-term memory or sensory
memory). We thus cannot disentangle whether it is musical syntax processing or sensory feature
processing, and Occam’s razor rather calls for the more parsimonious interpretation (not
requiring tonal knowledge etc.). The authors write in their coverletter “A modulation from one
key to another leads to sensory violations in the auditory domain. Given that harmonic
modulations are part of the standard repertoire of Western tonal music, this strikes us as rather
unlikely”. However, this statement ignores previous debates in music cognition domain: In
Western tonal music, tonal and sensory features/structures are often correlated, and
experimental approaches are required to control for sensory features to allow for conclusions
about tonal structure processing or tonal knowledge (see, for example, the work by R. Parncutt,
M. Leman, J. Bharucha or E. Bigand).
Related to this point, the authors write in their coverletter that the influence of the sensory
violation “does not occur when an arithmetic or semantic challenge is presented in the visual
domain. We are unaware of a convincing theoretical framework which would support such a
claim”. However, the data pattern might be created by the fact that the three manipulations,
materials and tasks differ in their level of difficulty and required processing capacity (as also
suggested by the findings (“the difficulty effect was greater in the language task than in the
arithmetic task”, page 19; see also page 28). This might thus lead to interactive patterns or not.
In addition, here it is relevant to underline that the authors observe an interaction only when they
combine Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 for the linguistic manipulations (even though different
linguistic manipulations were used). No such combined analysis has been proposed for data on
arithmetic or semantic structures (and no data are available to do so). Indeed, the interaction was
only significant for the combined analyses (the stars added to Figures 3 and 4 indicating
significance for only one of the two contrasts are thus not justified based on statistics of each
experiment). (Note that the justification of this combined analysis (see cover letter) is not
convincing, the factor experiment or related interactions might not be significant because of
missing power.)
Regarding the recoding of the data, I have to admit that I do not understand why the authors
refer to a ceiling effect that calls for the unusual recoding of the data. Maximum proportion of
closure reached is at .8 only.
If the authors insist on using their unusual median scoring, they need to provide the information
about how many items/data points have been removed because they were on the median.
Methods: The authors did not observe the expected effect for the unambiguous S-coordination
sentences, thus they “concentrate” on the other contrast and push these data into the
supplementary materials. First, this is misleading for the readers as all sentence types were
20
presented in the same experimental session. Second, it is not clear why these sentences were
included into the experiment since the “pre-test” had revealed this finding.
For the arithmetic stimuli, easy and hard operations were selected (page 12), but filler items
included intermediate operations AND easy operations, thus increasing the number of ‘easy
items’, but not ‘hard items’.
For comparability between materials, it seems also problematic to have 120 trials for the “musico-
linguistic part” of the experiment, but 80 trials only for the “musico-arithmic part”.
Page 15, lines 3-17: what does “condition” refer to (B, C…)? Is this the music material type? But
this seems to contradict the information about the pairing “with the same music stimulus” (line
12). Please clarify.
Page 22: Labeling Experiment 2 as “confirmatory” is misleading as different manipulations are
used here.
Page 27: The analysis cannot be the same as in experiment 1 as the conditions are different.
Page 28: As the comprehension prompts, “often did not target the semantic ambiguity of the
sentences”, how can the authors be sure that semantic ambiguity was processed by the
participants?
Another problematic point of the results (page 29) is the observation that the interaction
Manipulation x Difficulty did not include the factor Key, which would be necessary for the
advanced interpretation.
Introduction:
Page 5, line 17: “an unexpected instrument” might also tax fewer attentional resources, so this
argumentation does not hold.
Page 6, line 22: why should facilitated processing lead to an increased priming effect?
The ANOVAs of order effects should be included in the manuscript.
Discussion:
page 36: The authors should further analyze the differences between the studies – for example,
Steinbeis and Koelsch used tasks on music and language materials (like the authors here do too)
while Koelsch 2005 only used a language task.

only significant for the combined analyses (the stars added to Figures 3 and 4 indicating
significance for only one of the two contrasts are thus not justified based on statistics of each
experiment). (Note that the justification of this combined analysis (see cover letter) is not
convincing, the factor experiment or related interactions might not be significant because of
missing power.)
Regarding the recoding of the data, I have to admit that I do not understand why the authors
refer to a ceiling effect that calls for the unusual recoding of the data. Maximum proportion of
closure reached is at .8 only.
If the authors insist on using their unusual median scoring, they need to provide the information
about how many items/data points have been removed because they were on the median.
Methods: The authors did not observe the expected effect for the unambiguous S-coordination
sentences, thus they “concentrate” on the other contrast and push these data into the
supplementary materials. First, this is misleading for the readers as all sentence types were
presented in the same experimental session. Second, it is not clear why these sentences were
included into the experiment since the “pre-test” had revealed this finding.
For the arithmetic stimuli, easy and hard operations were selected (page 12), but filler items
included intermediate operations AND easy operations, thus increasing the number of ‘easy
items’, but not ‘hard items’.
For comparability between materials, it seems also problematic to have 120 trials for the “musico-
linguistic part” of the experiment, but 80 trials only for the “musico-arithmic part”.
Page 15, lines 3-17: what does “condition” refer to (B, C…)? Is this the music material type? But
this seems to contradict the information about the pairing “with the same music stimulus” (line
12). Please clarify.
Page 22: Labeling Experiment 2 as “confirmatory” is misleading as different manipulations are
used here.
Page 27: The analysis cannot be the same as in experiment 1 as the conditions are different.
23
Page 28: As the comprehension prompts, “often did not target the semantic ambiguity of the
sentences”, how can the authors be sure that semantic ambiguity was processed by the
participants?
Another problematic point of the results (page 29) is the observation that the interaction
Manipulation x Difficulty did not include the factor Key, which would be necessary for the
advanced interpretation.
Introduction:
Page 5, line 17: “an unexpected instrument” might also tax fewer attentional resources, so this
argumentation does not hold.
Page 6, line 22: why should facilitated processing lead to an increased priming effect?
The ANOVAs of order effects should be included in the manuscript.
Discussion:
page 36: The authors should further analyze the differences between the studies – for example,
Steinbeis and Koelsch used tasks on music and language materials (like the authors here do too)
while Koelsch 2005 only used a language task.

Keywords: music cognition, syntactic processing, semantic processing, harmony perception,
closure ratings, dynamic attending theory
Abstract: Many studies have revealed shared music-language processing resources by finding an
influence of music harmony manipulations on concurrent language processing. However, the
nature of the shared resources has remained ambiguous. They have been argued to be syntax
specific and thus due to shared syntactic integration resources. An alternative view regards them
as related to general attention and, thus, not specific to syntax. The present experiments
evaluated these accounts by investigating the influence of language on music. Participants were
asked to provide closure judgements on harmonic sequences in order to assess the
appropriateness of sequence endings. At the same time participants read syntactic garden-path
sentences. Closure judgements revealed a change in harmonic processing as the result of reading
a syntactically challenging word. We found no influence of an arithmetic control manipulation
(experiment 1) or semantic garden-path sentences (experiment 2). Our results provide
behavioural evidence for a specific influence of linguistic syntax processing on musical harmony
judgements. A closer look reveals that the shared resources appear to be needed to hold a
24
harmonic key online for the integration of chords. Overall, our results support the syntax
specificity of shared music-language processing resources.

Nijmegen, 22 June 2015
Dear Dr Aime,
We are submitting a revised version of our article (RSOS-150042) entitled
“Language influences music harmony perception – effects of shared syntactic
integration resources beyond attention”.
We have changed the manuscript inspired by the constructive suggestions of the
reviewers, see yellow highlights in the manuscript. Moreover, the new version is
20% shorter than before, cutting especially paragraphs on Dynamic Attending
Theory, ERP-related effects, and the difference between musical influences on
language and linguistic influences on music.
Thus, we have addressed all comments mentioned by the reviewers, and we feel the
manuscript’s quality has improved by taking the reviewers’ comments into account.
In the reply to the reviewers we describe how each point raised by them was handled.
We thank you for considering our manuscript, and we hope you find it suitable for
publication in RSOS.
Sincerely,
Richard Kunert (corresponding author)

Comments by the Editor
1. The relevance and characterization of dynamic attending theory
We have greatly reduced the space devoted to dynamic attending theory (see pages
5/6) and adjusted the characterization of this theory in line with comments by the
second reviewer. We now present it as one of two general attention-related theories
which make similar predictions for our data: no difference between syntactic and
non-syntactic manipulations. In contrast to this attention-related prediction we find
differences between syntactic and arithmetic or semantic manipulations.
2. The necessity of reporting experiment 1
We have simplified the reporting of experiment 1. Moreover, we now characterize
this experiment as providing a data-set with which we developed the data-analysis
strategy we used (based on a median-split analysis of harmonic ratings). In this
respect, the analysis of experiment 1 is somewhat exploratory and presented in this
way in the manuscript (see page 22). Experiment 2, on the other hand, was purely
confirmatory, using the same analysis strategy. Thus, experiment 1 is necessary as a
motivation for our analysis strategy which otherwise might appear like an ad hoc
decision in the context of experiment 2.
3. The sensitivity of the dependent measure in experiment 2
We used the same dependent measures in experiments 1 and 2. On page 33 we
speculate why the syntax effect might be slightly weaker in experiment 2 compared
to experiment 1.
Comments by reviewer # 1
Major 1. The manuscript is extremely long (59 pages of manuscript). While –
after having read the manuscript – I consider the depth of detail and
resulting clarity of the experimental methods somewhat acceptable, the
General Discussion gives room to be shortened. Specifically, I do not see
where the discussion on ERP components (ERAN, ELAN, etc.) is leading on
page 40. Essentially, these studies are well in line with the present results
and any discussion on the music-specificity of these ERP-components is
misleading, unfortunately incomplete and beyond the scope of the present
behavioural study. Rather, if the authors wish to mention possible confounds
in these works, this could happen in the context of Rogalsky et al. (2011) –
but note that this study has substantial methodological limitations.
We agree and have decided to shorten the manuscript by 20% (the body of the text
was cut from 11,441 words to 9,041 words). Moreover, the discussion of ERP
studies (see pages 34 - 35) was shortened and simplified. Specifically, we no longer
discuss ERAN versus ELAN differences.
Major 2. [2] The links to dynamic attending theory (DAT) and its
implications could be clearer. As the authors state, DAT is typically based on
rhythm, claiming that listeners’ attention entrains to regular strong beats. I
also see that entrainment to harmony is in principal possible, because
harmonically stable events typically coincide with strong beats – so both are
intimately linked. Consequently, the question is not only whether a study uses
harmonic manipulations in final or middle positions of a sequence (as
discussed on page 6), but whether it uses harmonic manipulations on strong
or weak beats. The present study employed harmonic manipulations on
strong beats (and asked for closure judgments on weak beats) if one assumes
that the sequences (at least the one in Figure 1) were perceived as 4/4 meter,
driven by the harmonically strong tonics in the first, fifth and ninth position
of the sequence. [As an aside, this could be an essential difference between
the present study and Perruchet & Poulin’s (2012) manipulations that did not
occur on strong beats.]
Now, my question is: Why do the authors assume that no entrainment takes
place in the linguistic stimuli, given that they were presented simultaneously
with the chords that have the clear potential to entrain (“first scenario” on
page 8)? Does it actually matter to which stimulus train the participants
entrain if they are presented simultaneously, i.e. during the same attentional
cycle? The simultaneous presentation makes the discussion on linguistic
influence on music or vice versa somewhat tricky (and perhaps unnecessary).
We agree that the discussion of linguistic influences on music and vice versa was
unnecessary and we no longer mention it. We have greatly simplified the
presentation of DAT as well as the key prediction we derive from it (see pages 5 - 6).
We now focus on the fact that attentional accounts - we present attentional load
theory alongside DAT, see page 5 - predict no difference between syntactic and
control manipulations.
Assuming that participants entrain to the musical stimulus, and that the
presentation of an unexpected (modulating) chord at the attention peak in the
9th position is “thought to remove the benefit received from attention being
focused” on this point (page 6), it would essentially be music that leads to a
break-down in both concurrent tasks.
In critical trials, people hear the same kind of chord sequences up until the last two
chords. Therefore, any attentional effect to do with the pivot (modulating) ninth
chord should be equal across critical trials. In other words, linguistic influences on
music cannot be explained by the attentional consequences of introducing a second
key because this harmonic change happened in all critical trials, whether a garden-
path trial or not.
Minor 1. The authors use “coördination” throughout the text. Is there any
reason why they don’t use “coordination” as in the original publications by
Hoeks et al. (2002, 2006)?
We adjusted the spelling.
Minor 2. What do the authors mean by “hold music constant” on page 41 of
the discussion?
We no longer make claims about the ‘constancy’ of music in order to avoid
confusion.
Minor 3. The authors argue that the results cannot be explained by working
memory, given that a covariate of digit-span data does not have an effect on
the results. On the other hand, the data clearly show that the memory trace
for the first key decays more quickly during challenging syntactic tasks. One
solution might be to assume a “syntactic working memory” as has been done
in the language domain. The publications by Fiebach et al., 2005, HBM;
Meyer et al., 2012, NeuroImage; Makuuchi et al., 2011, PNAS might be
worthwhile to check.
We would like to thank the reviewer for suggesting these publications. They have
now been included in the manuscript. In section 5.3. we speculate on the role that
shared musico-linguistic resources might play in the music network (see pages 35 -
36). We include a possible role for syntactic working memory.
Comments by reviewer # 2
Introduction and discussion refer to Jones’ dynamic attending theory and
some related research, but its presentation includes a set of incorrect
statements or misleading statements. For example, the main interpretation
and prediction of the dynamic attending theory is not attentional capture by
an unexpected event, but rather the reverse – a benefit for the expected event
with more available attentional resources. This is a crucial difference. The
Tillman/Escoffier study included a baseline condition showing that it is *not*
slowing down visual processing (as stated page 6 here), but rather speeding
up visual processing with the expected event (tonic). Note also that the
dynamic attending theory was originally not developed for rhythmic
influences on event duration estimation, but comes from music cognition (on
pitch and time dimensions). It is further incorrect to state that it only applies
to the final chord/tone of a sequence; it rather describes a dynamic shape of
the entire melody. In addition, the benefit for the tonic has also been reported
for other positions than the final one (see Tillman & Marmel, 2013; Patel et
al., 1998, for example). Finally, the presentation page 7 is completely
ignoring that S. Koelsch has conducted ERP studies with tasks on both
dimensions.
We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing this out to us. We adjusted our
characterization of this theory using the example of Poulin-Charronnat et al.’s (2005)
lexical decision task (see pages 5 - 6). Otherwise, we shortened the manuscript and
we no longer describe the historical background of DAT. We further no longer make
claims about to which positions in a musical piece this account does or does not
apply. We do mention Koelsch’s ERP work on page 35.
The present study is based on the hypothesis (page 8) that the different
manipulations and control conditions are equally difficult to process.
However, this is not guaranteed here.
We conducted pre-tests in order to check whether the different manipulations and
control conditions are equally difficult to process. After every trial pre-test
participants were asked to rate the trial difficulty on a Likert scale (1 = very easy, 7 =
very difficult). Specifically, the pre-test to experiment 1 revealed that the critical
arithmetic task trials were perceived as more difficult overall [task main effect, F(1,23)
= 14.48, p = .001, p<U+03B7>2 = .386] and that the difference between the easy and hard
arithmetic trials was greater than that between garden-path and non-garden-path
language trials [interaction task × difficulty, F(1,23) = 5.47, p = .028, p<U+03B7>2 = .192], see
the supplementary material pages 1 - 2 for more details. As described on page 36 of
the main manuscript, attentional load theory would predict a stronger influence of
arithmetic trials on music compared to language trials, based on this pattern of trial
difficulty levels. The second pre-test to experiment 2 showed that critical syntax
trials were generally perceived as more difficult than critical semantics trials
[manipulation main effect, F(1,23) = 20.39, p < .001, p<U+03B7>2 = .470]. The difference
between garden-path and non-garden-path trials was equivalent for trials of both
kinds of manipulations [interaction task × difficulty, F(1,23) < 1], see supplementary
material pages 5 - 7 for details. This absent interaction indicates that the syntactic
and semantic manipulations are equally salient. Taken together, the results from
these pretests establish that control trials were either more difficult or equally
difficult to process compared to critical trials. Either way, if trial difficulty was a
factor in music-language influences, then both kinds of manipulations should show
an effect.
In a related vein, it is problematic that the comprehension prompts in the
semantics part do not target the semantic ambiguity of the sentence; the
authors thus have no control whether participants processed the ambiguity.
And this is even more problematic as there was no effect, page 32.
As mentioned in the manuscript on page 26, the second pre-test of experiment 2
revealed that participants’ reading slows down when encountering the semantically
disambiguating word. Furthermore, semantic garden-path trials were judged as more
difficult than non-garden-path trials, see supplementary material pages 5 - 7.
Crucially, these results were obtained in a pre-test with the same comprehension
prompts as in the main experiment. This shows that people do process the semantic
ambiguity even when they are not forced to do so by a comprehension prompt which
is presented after the sentence.
Similarly, it is also surprising that the arithmetic condition did not include
filler items.
This is a misunderstanding. All experiments, including the arithmetic task, had 50%
filler trials (see page 15). We now point this out more clearly in the manuscript.
The study investigates the effect of various visual conditions on the judgments
of musical closure. However, instead of analyzing the ratings on the
subjective scale, the authors report a surprising, unusual re-coding of the
data (i.e., a subject-specific median-split analysis; “proportion of trials
which indicated high closure”). In addition to the arbitrary sounding of this
coding, it is not clear whether it is calculated across all items, why low
closure items are excluded, whether this could hide effects or show other
patterns.
As mentioned on page 17 and page 22, the fact that closure ratings were negatively
skewed was unexpected. The re-coding of the data was an exploratory step inspired
by experiment 1, which made it possible to run experiment 2 as a purely
confirmatory study. The median-split analysis is based on a median derived from all
critical trials of a participant and otherwise applies to all trials. Low closure ratings
were not excluded but instead simply re-coded as 0, as opposed to high-closure
ratings which were re-coded as 1.
Please note that we have shared our raw data with optional re-coding and make
matlab code available for reproducing all figures from the raw data. In our
experience, a data analysis strategy based on mean raw ratings shows the same
pattern of effects, but is statistically less sensitive.
The data themselves are not reassuring for this coding technique. In
particular, one would have expected lower exposure ratings for sequences
ending on the second key as these are missing the return to the first (main)
key (as would be expected for Western tonal music). This further highlights
the need of an additional control condition collecting closure ratings for
music presented without additional visual tasks (missing here). Indeed, the
authors’ interpretation (see page 24 and elsewhere) would require the
observation of lowest closure ratings for the second-key endings.
The focus of this study is on revealing linguistic and non-linguistic influences on
music harmony processing. We did not seek to investigate the general perception of
first-key-endings and second-key-endings. We now acknowledge (see page 20) that
dedicated experiments are necessary for these sorts of questions.
Furthermore, the ratings were given at the end of the sequence; so far from
the manipulated critical item – It seems important to also use an additional
task (with response times related to the critical item).
Two behavioural studies investigating the influence of music on language have also
used dependent variables collected after a manipulated moment in time (reference 2:
Fedorenko et al. used comprehension accuracy and did not find an effect in RT;
reference 30: Fiveash et al. used memory performance). This shows that the
influence of music on language can be shown both with online and offline measures.
Our offline measure does not stand out in this respect. Moreover, if the offline nature
of our dependent variable rendered our paradigm indeed less sensitive than a
paradigm using online measures, this would work against our results. Specifically, it
would make it less likely to a) find a difficulty effect for language syntax trials and
b) find the difficulty effect for language syntax trials to be significantly different to
the difficulty effect for control trials. We now acknowledge the difference between
on-line and offline measures in our discussion, see page 35.
The authors need to take into account the debate on sensory and cognitive
expectations (e.g., Leman, 2000; Collins et al., 2014; Bigand et al., 2003;
Koelsch et al., 2007) to temper the interpretation in terms of musical syntax.
Indeed, the introduced “critical chord” is not only a chord of the second key,
but also a chord introducing new, previously unheard tones and thus might
be creating a sensory violation. The material needs to be checked with a
model, such as the one proposed by M. Leman, or all interpretations adjusted
accordingly.
We politely disagree with the reviewer that the debate on sensory versus cognitive
expectations is of relevance for the present study. First of all, music and language
were presented in different sensory modalities. It appears unlikely that the visual
expectation of an upcoming word could interfere with the auditory expectation of a
chord at the level of sensory processing. Secondly, the modulating ninth chord was
present in all critical trials. If it does indeed create a sensory violation, this effect will
be present in all critical trials. In other words, linguistic influences on music cannot
be explained by the sensory consequences of introducing a second key because this
harmonic change happened in all critical trials, whether a garden-path trial or not.
Experiment 1
Results
Page 21: The data starting line 40 should be presented in link with the
interaction with language, as it was modulating the effects.
We are afraid we do not fully understand the suggestion by the reviewer at this point.
We have simplified the presentation of the results of experiment 1 (see pages 18 -
19). We hope this resolves this issue.
Page 22: The crucial three-way interaction was only marginally significant
p=.068.
We do not claim that the three-way interaction is significant and also do not discuss
it as such (see pages 19 and 20-22).
Page 24: The additional analysis with digit span as a co-variate is not
convincing as it might not be sensitive enough (as also suggested by the null
effects of this analysis).
There are three lines of evidence to suggest that working memory is not involved in
the syntax effect we find. First of all, the digit span ANCOVA suggests otherwise.
This analysis is based on 54 people and did not even reveal marginally significant
interactions with working memory, see supplementary materials pages 3 - 4 for
details. Still, even if this analysis is thought to be insensitive, a working memory
account would predict non-specific effects which we do not find (see pages 30 - n31
and page 37). Lastly, we have added additional references (references 23-26) also
showing a clear distinction between general working memory and syntax processing
in fMRI and lesion studies. We feel that, together, these lines of evidence rule out a
working memory account for our results.
Method/Material
Page 15 indicates 40 critical items, while the other conditions have 60
critical items, thus not “ensuring an equal number”. It seems also
problematic that the arithmetic condition did not contain filler items (in
contrast to the other conditions).
In each arithmetic/linguistic difficulty × key-ending design cell people were exposed
to 10 trials. However, because the linguistic manipulation in experiment 1 had three
levels (3 difficulty levels × 2 key-ending levels × 10 trials per design cell = 60 items)
instead of two (2 difficulty levels × 2 key-ending levels × 10 trials per design cell =
40 items), more items were created. As mentioned before, arithmetic trials were 50%
filler trials (see page 15).
Did the authors observe order effects in the two experiments?
In order to answer this question, we carried out an ANOVA of the combined syntax
data of experiments 1 and 2 with the factors order (language syntax trials run first or
second), experiment (experiment 1, experiment 2), difficulty (ambiguous S-
coordination/object-relative clause, NP-coordination/subject-relative clause) and key
(first key ending, second key ending). The first two factors were between-subjects,
the other two factors were within-subjects. The significant effects reported in the
main analysis without the factor order (see pages 31 - 32) were still significant
(difficulty, key, difficulty × key; ps < .05). The factor order was marginally
significant (F(1,112) = 3.06, p = .083, p<U+03B7>2 = .027), indicating a slightly higher
proportion of high closure ratings in trials run after the control task (M = .695)
compared to before (M = .650). No other effect was significant (ps > .2). This shows
that task order did not interact with any of the effects of interest.
Please clarify the description of counterbalancing of item versions (page 17)
and explain why.
We counter-balanced the item versions for two reasons: a) in order to rule out that a
specific music-language match has any systematic effect, b) to counter-balance
position effects. Specifically, language item 1 might be presented in condition A to
participant 1, condition B to participant 2 and condition C to participant 3. For these
three participants, the position of the item in the experiment is the same.
Furthermore, the language item is paired with the same music stimulus for these
three participants. For the next three participants, this item has a different position
(determined by chance) and is matched with a different music stimulus (determined
by chance). In the interest of space, we simplify our description of counter-balancing
on pages 14-15.
Experiment 2:
The pre-test 2 should also analyze the 10th word, which might reveal an
effect.
As shown in the supplementary material (pages 5 - 7) we analysed the reading times
of the pre-critical eighth word, the critical ninth word and the post-critical tenth
word.
Page 30 top: Are numbers mixed up here? 88ms vs. 20ms and 78ms vs. 40ms
do not seem equally salient (should it be 88 vs. 78 and 20 vs. 40?).
As mentioned in the supplementary material (page 6) the statistical analysis of
reading times is based on mean logged reading times. The values the reviewer
mentions were median values of subject-specific median reading times. This
difference was confusing. To ameliorate the situation, we decided to now report de-
logged average log reading times instead, see supplementary material page 6. This
way, we stay closer to the actual inferential analysis of the RT data.
The combined analysis (page 35) should be dropped as manipulations and
difficulty levels are not comparable.
Both manipulations were syntactic in nature and both had an effect on music ratings.
Their difficulty levels can be compared by turning to the difficulty ratings in the pre-
tests. These show a difficulty effect of 0.53 (experiment 1) and 0.35 (experiment 2).
We introduced the factor experiment in the ANOVA in order to capture effects due
to manipulation differences. This factor was not significant as a main effect [F(1,114) <
1] nor in any interaction ps > .2; see pages 31 - 32. Together, these reasons make us
believe that the effect of both manipulations was similar and that a combined
analysis is justified.
Page 37: How were the F2-analyses conducted? As there were two different
types, this needs to be presented more clearly.
We have expanded the presentation of the analyses by items, see supplementary
material pages 8 - 10. F2-analyses (by linguistic items) were conducted very
similarly to F1 analyses (by participants). For F2 analyses, we averaged music
ratings not by participants (across items), but instead by linguistic items (across
participants) before analysing these averages in an inferential statistical tests.
Discussion.
Regarding Slevc et al. (2009), the interpretation (as well as the introduction
section) needs to take into account that this study did not observe the
classical advantage of in-key chords over out-of-key chords (response times
were slower for the in-key chords; see Table 1 and page 378 in Slevc et al.,
2009).
In the interest of a short and succinct manuscript (see major criticism of reviewer 1)
we do not discuss previous studies in much detail. It might well be interesting that no
key main effect was observed in the critical sentence region by Slevc et al. (2009;
reference 5), but neither did Perruchet & Poulin-Charronnat (2013; reference 9). In
their study, it emerged in the post-critical sentence region only. It is also not
consistently found by Hoch et al. (2011; reference 3) who do not find it in their
syntax experiment, but do find it in their semantic experiment. We feel that Slevc et
al.’s study does not stand out in not finding a general in-key advantage. Why this
advantage sometimes emerges is arguably a discussion which is beyond the scope of
this paper.
The authors should acknowledge that the advantage of the studies cited page
40 is that their measured response was time-locked on the relevant item – not
collected at the end, as here.
See above and manuscript page 35.
Further comments:
Footnote 3 is a vague statement. It would be necessary to analyze their
material for that feature.
Footnote 5 is not clear. What is the three-way interaction referring to here?
And where can 1932ms be found? What are sub-processes of harmonic
processing?
Footnote 5: The sound material should be made available as supplementary
material of the journal.
Footnote 7: This would require testing of sequences without modulations and
reporting the closure ratings (the authors might find the answer in their filler
trials?).
The supplementary materials are missing.
Page 6: “in separate theoretical frameworks” – Please clarify.
Page 8: the statement on visual language task is too strong here; internal
subvocal reading might lead to similar effects and cannot be excluded.
Page 8: “integrate chords” into?
Page 9: Note that reference 22 did not include modulations.
Why coördinations? Check spelling throughout the ms.
All further comments were used to adjust the manuscript. All critical sound files are
available as supplementary material.
Comments by reviewer # 3
This is an interesting study that contributes to a strand of research in the
literature that uses dual-task paradigms to anwer the question of whether
there is overlap in resources or mechanisms in music and language (and
other domains). I had the feeling that there were quite a number of issues
with Experiment 1, many of which are repaired in Experiment 2 which is
overall much better controlled. However, since Experiment 1 is not fully
convincing, neither is the global analysis that collapses both experiment
(which is difficult to justify anyway given that the experiments differ in many
ways).
We now characterize experiment 1 as an exploratory study and experiment 2 as a
confirmatory study. However, we leave the combined analysis in the manuscript
because a) participants in both experiments were exposed to an equal number of
trials in each design cell (10), b) both manipulations targeted syntactic differences, c)
we used the same musical items in both experiments, d) we used the same task in
both experiments, e) the factor experiment was introduced to capture differences
between the manipulations but it does not significantly modulate any of the main
effects or interactions (ps > .2; see pages 31 - 32). This leads us to think that the
experiments are similar enough to justify a combined analysis. Note that we
acknowledge the partly exploratory nature of the combined analysis on page 33:
“One should bear in mind that experiment 1 was exploratory in nature, and thus the
result of the combined analysis should be replicated.”
At the level of theory, the authors are not really clear about what they mean
with syntactic “resources”. What is the place of these resources in theories of
language comprehension and of music perception? How compelling, given
the work in psycholinguistics on this issue, is the notion of resources that are
specific to the processing of syntax?
In the discussion section of our paper (pages 35 - 36) we speculate on the role shared
resources might have, drawing on insights from psycholinguistics. Specifically, we
speculate whether syntactic working memory or syntactic unification could be the
role of shared music-language resources. We conclude that the present study cannot
distinguish between these two accounts.
1. Design of Experiment 1. This design is not fully symmetrical. There is a
temporary ambiguous and unambiguous S-conjunction and a temporary
ambiguous NP-conjunction. The latter condition is labeled as “non-garden
path,” presumably because it is tacitly assumed that the NP-conjunction is
the preferred interpretation. However, it is never tested whether this is indeed
the preferred interpretation for these participants and items and neither is it
tested whether this STAYS the preferred interpretation during the course of
the experiment (after all, the frequency of S-conjunctions during the session
is much higher than normal, possibly leading to a shift).
Experiment 1’s pre-test has shown that ambiguous S-coordination trials were
perceived as more difficult than NP-coordination trials (supplementary material page
1). Similarly, the comprehension accuracy data in the main experiment (Exp. 1)
showed higher accuracy for NP-coordination trials than ambiguous S-coordination
trials (page 17). This is indicative of a parsing preference towards NP-coordination
for this material in Dutch, as found in previous studies using different materials and
measures of interest (references 17 - 19, 21). As mentioned on page 12 participants
were exposed to as many S-coordination sentences as NP-coordination sentences, i.e.
the material was not designed to bias participants towards a new parsing preference.
If, on the other hand, people lost a parsing preference towards NP-coordinations
during the experiment, this should have made it less likely to find an effect of
language syntax on music. The fact that we find an effect indicates that the parsing
preference was strong enough overall.
Why was there no unambiguous NP conjunction in the design (e.g., “zowel de
man als de vrouw….”)?
The idea of an unambiguous NP-coordination is certainly interesting and should be
explored in the future. We simply followed the design of previous studies which
contrasted ambiguous S-coordinations and NP-coordinations (e.g., reference 17).
Why were there no pretests on the garden-path effects of the stimuli?
As mentioned above, we consider the difficulty ratings in the pre-test and the
sentence comprehension results to be indicative of a garden-path effect. Specifically,
ambiguous S-coordination trials were rated as significantly more difficult (M = 2.99,
SD = 1.02) than NP-coordination trials (M = 2.46, SD = 1.11) [t(23) = 4.67, p < .001,
p<U+03B7> = .487], see supplementary material page 1. In experiment 1, comprehension
2
prompts after ambiguous S-coordination sentences were answered less accurately (M
= 83%, SD = 16%) than the same prompts after NP-coordination trials (M = 90%, SD
= 15%) [t(53) = 2.28, p = .027, p<U+03B7>2 = .089], see page 17. Both results show that
ambiguous S-coordination trials were more challenging to process than NP-
coordination trials, i.e. that there was a garden-path effect.
Why was position of the item during the session not included as a variable?
The position of an item during the session was counter-balanced and random.
Therefore, this factor cannot have any systematic influence on the results. Moreover,
it did not strike us as theoretically crucial to include this factor.
2. Related to the previous point: in my experience disambiguation of an S-
conjunction using a comma is not very effective; readers often seem to miss
the comma, rendering the sentence effectively ambiguous.
We agree with the reviewer that unambiguous S-coordination trials are not
equivalent to non-garden-path trials, as seen in our pre-test results on page 13 and in
the supplementary material page 1. Therefore, we concentrate the analysis of
experiment 1 on the contrast between ambiguous S-coordinations and NP-
coordinations. The analysis involving unambiguous S-coordination trials is included
in the supplementary material (pages 2 - 3).
3. Math condition. The math secondary task exerted no effect on the closure
judgments. But how do we know this is really because the closure judgments
draw on a specialized pool of resources? Can’t it be the case that the
difference between the hard and easy math task was simply too small to have
an effect on a more global pool of resources?
The difference between hard and easy arithmetic trials was very noticeable to the
participants in the first pre-test. When participants were told to judge the difficulty of
the trials (seven point scale), we observed a clear difference between easy and
difficult math trials (hard: M = 3.90, SD = 1.35; easy: M = 2.99, SD = 1.43) [t(23) =
5.71, p < .001, p<U+03B7>2 = .586], see supplementary material page 2. This difference was
actually greater in the arithmetic task (M = 0.91) than in the language task (M = 0.53)
[F(1,23) = 5.47, p = .028, p<U+03B7>2 = .192]. We take this as evidence against the suggestion
that the strength of the difficulty manipulation is the reason for why we do not see an
effect for arithmetic trials.
4. Dependent variable. On the one hand, it is really interesting that the
authors find information in a set of ratings that suffer from a ceiling effect.
On the other hand, to do it like this is clearly a post-hoc decision and it is
conceivable that this dv has limited sensitivity to detect subtle effects. This is
problematic, given that the claim for specialized resources depends crucially
on some conditions not showing an effect (namely the math task and the
semantic garden path condition).
We now write that the data analysis strategy chosen in experiment 1 was a post-hoc
decision (see page 22). However, this is not the case for experiment 2, which was
purely confirmatory in all respects and used the same analysis strategy.
We agree that simply finding a null effect for control manipulations would have been
weak evidence for specialized resources. However, we find significant differences
between the syntax and control manipulations in terms of their effects on harmonic
judgements. These significant interaction terms (see pages 19 and 29) cannot be due
to limited sensitivity.
Please note that we have shared our raw data without re-coding and make matlab
code available for reproducing all figures from the raw data. In our experience, a data
analysis strategy based on mean raw ratings shows the same pattern of effects, but is
statistically less sensitive.
5. Analyses. By-item analyses are only reported in the analysis that collapses
both experiments. Why not for all analyses? I also miss analyses that test for
effect by positition in the session and analyses that include musical expertise
as a variable.
We now report by-item analyses for both experiments separately as well as combined
in the supplementary material (pages 8 - 10). A full analysis with z-scored musical
training as a co-variate is included in the supplementary material as well (pages 7 -
8). We include an analysis with the factor order (whether the language syntax task
was run first in an experimental session or second) in detail in response to reviewer
#2. We did not find a significant influence of this factor on closure ratings (ps > .05).
Given the limited theoretical interest of this analysis, we do not include it in the
manuscript.
6. Accuracy of object-relative clause comprehension. The prompts after OR
sentences were answered correctly in only 37% of the trials. In other words,
in 63% of the trials, participants misinterpreted them as a SR sentence. This
seems problematic – it looks as if the participants abandoned a full analysis
of the sentences on many of the trials, possibly in order to attend the melodies
better (after all, the primary task concerns the melodies). This aspect of the
data is not discussed.
We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing out this aspect of our data. We now
discuss it in the manuscript on page 33.
7. Influences of music on semantic processing and vice versa. Page 41 points
out that earlier research found that harmony violations increased syntactic
effects more strongly than semantic effects in past research (Perruchet &
Poulin-Charronet, 2013). Given the weaker semantic effect there, it is
perhaps not surprising that the current study, testing the reverse direction,
also found no semantic effect – it is simply more difficult to detect a semantic
garden path effect than a syntactic garden path effect. Further though, if the
authors wish to make a strong claim about assymetric influences between
semantic processing and harmony processing they would need to show that
they can replicate P & P’s effect using their semantic garden path sentences.
We no longer make claims about the asymmetry of semantic effects on music and
vice versa. On page 37 we merely suggest that “General attention as well as shared
syntactic resources might be involved in musical influences on language (5,9), while
language influencing music relies solely on syntactic resources. This proposal should
be tested in the future.”
8. Writing. The paper is generally well-written, but there is an excessive
number of footnotes, some of which might better be integrated with the text.
We have reduced the number of footnotes to two footnotes.

1. testing the music material without concurrent language task
have followed your and reviewer #2’s suggestion and tested 60 new participants on a music-only
sion of the task - without a concurrent non-musical task. The details of this post-test can be found in
supplementary materials (pp. 10 - 11). The overall impression one gets from the post-test is that
monic processing is not radically different with and without a concurrent task. Only one condition
cond-key endings) behaved slightly differently in the post-test compared to the experiments. Our
ms about shared syntactic processing between music and language are based on a different condition
st-key endings), which led to virtually identical closure ratings with and without a concurrent task.
erefore, we feel that the post-test strengthens our claims regarding the influence of language syntax on
sic harmony processing. The latter is not unusual when performing two tasks simultaneously.
2. ‘attentional accents’
es and Boltz (ref. 14) refer to many different accents entraining attention. We are now more specific in
ing about harmonic accents, as done in reference 14 (p. 479ff).
3. subject-specific median-split analysis
er forms of data transformation were indeed considered but did not perform as sensitively as the
lysis presented here. For example, we also tried an exponential transformation of the data in Exp. 1.
e equivalent of the three-way ANOVA presented in section 2.2.2.3. Language syntax vs. arithmetic
ealed a marginally significant task x difficulty interaction [F(1,53) = 3.57, p = .064, p<U+03B7>2 = .063]. When
ng the square transformation, the same interaction was significant [F(1,53) = 4.97, p = .030, p<U+03B7>2 = .086].
en trying the cube transformation, the same interaction was also significant [F(1,53) = 4.52, p = .038, p<U+03B7>2
79]. However, none of these transformations appeared as sensitive as the subject-specific median split
lysis [task × difficulty, F(1,53) = 5.20, p = .027, p<U+03B7>2 = .089]. We hope that it becomes clear that while
analysis approach might seem unusual, it is by no means the only approach to reveal an influence of
guage-syntax difficulty on music ratings without a concurrent influence of arithmetic difficulty. Note
t by sharing our raw data the interested reader can try out different data transformations herself/himself.

mments by reviewer # 2
First, it is problematic to use ratings of trial difficulty as the basis for the material construction.
Subjective (conscious) ratings of difficulty might well be different from processing difficulty. This
criticism of the material construction and validation becomes even more important as the authors
do not observe the expected language effects.
st of all, this criticism does not apply to Exp. 2 whose pre-test used a self-paced reading paradigm, see
plementary materials pages 5 - 7. In terms of experiment 1, its pre-test did evidence the expected
iculty main effect for the language difficulty ratings [F(2,46) = 14.08, p < .001, p<U+03B7>2 = .380], see
plementary materials pages 1 - 2. The expected difficulty effect also emerges when analysing the
guage task accuracy based on comprehension prompt answers [t(53) = 2.28, p = .027, p<U+03B7>2 = .089], see
in text page 17. The claim that ‘the authors do not observe the expected language effects’ is
refore not supported. A narrow reliance on conscious ratings is also not part of our reasoning.
Second, a similar concern applies for the music material. The authors did not pretest their
material to investigate whether listeners perceive the musical structure manipulation as intended,
when presented without language material. This becomes even more important as the results do
not fit with the predictions for musical structure processing in either language condition. It is
thus not clear whether the influence of language is really on musical structure processing.
have followed your suggestion and tested 60 new participants on a music-only version of the task, i.e.
hout a concurrent non-musical task. The following figure summarizes the results of this post-test:
efly, this post-test showed that no-cadence, first-key, and authentic cadence endings were rated very
ilarly without a concurrent language or arithmetic task. Second-key endings, however, less often
eived a high closure rating without a concurrent task compared to with, leading to a smaller difference
ween first-key and second-key ending ratings in this post-test. Still, the numerical trends were in the
e direction, i.e. there is no indication in the post-test data that second-key endings are heard as less
l closed compared to first-key endings. In sum, participants who only did the music task performed
task similarly to participants who did it while engaging in a second task at the same time. Further
ails can be found in the supplementary materials (pp. 10 - 11).
Third, the authors reject the relevance to take into account the debate on sensory and cognitive
expectations (see cover letter, page 7). However, the criticism of potential sensory violations
applies also when material is presented in different modalities and when presented in all critical
trials. Indeed, the use of strong harmonic changes contains sensory violations AND musical
structure/syntax violations. Consequently, it is impossible to make claims about specific
interactions between the processing of musical structures and of linguistic structures when these
interactions could also be caused by the sensory violations.
the reviewer’s argument to hold, one would have to assume the following:
a) A modulation from one key to another leads to sensory violations in the auditory domain.
en that harmonic modulations are part of the standard repertoire of Western tonal music, this strikes us
ather unlikely.
b) The processing of sensory violations in the auditory domain and processing of syntactic
llenges in the visual domain are linked. We are not aware of a convincing theoretical framework for
h a link, except for general attention. We are discussing a possible role for general attention in the
nuscript and come to the conclusion that it does not explain the influence of language syntax on music.
c) The processing of sensory violations in the auditory domain can have an influence on harmonic
sure ratings occurring approximately 3 seconds later. Using the contrast between authentic cadence
ings and no cadence endings, we have shown that participants are very sensitive to harmonic
ectations when giving their ratings. We are not aware of a similar sensitivity of harmonic closure
ngs to purely sensory features of the input.
d) The negative influence of sensory violations in the auditory domain on harmonic closure
ngs only occurs when a syntactic challenge is presented in the visual domain. It does not occur when
arithmetic or semantic challenge is presented in the visual domain. We are unaware of a convincing
oretical framework which would support such a claim.
Fourth, the justification for the combined analyses is not convincing – in particular as the
difficulty effect changes from experiment 1 to experiment 2 from 0.53 to 0.35 (cover letter, page
9).
he greater difficulty effect of experiment 1 indeed led to a different pattern of harmonic closure ratings
pared to the smaller difficulty effect of experiment 2, then this should be captured by the factor
periment in the ANOVA. However, this factor was not significant as a main effect [F(1,114) < 1] nor in
interaction ps > .2; see pages 31 - 32.
Experiment 1 is also problematic for the unexpected absence of processing difference between
unambiguous and ambiguous S-coordination sentences.
noted by reviewer # 3 ‘disambiguation of an S-conjunction using a comma is not very effective; readers often
m to miss the comma, rendering the sentence effectively ambiguous’. We agree that this might be the reason
the rather weak influence of the disambiguating comma. Please note that our conclusions are not
ed on unambiguous S-coordination trials.
Note that the manuscript still refers to this first experiment as Experiment 1 and not as
“exploratory study” as indicated in the cover letter.
have adjusted the section headings to make the difference between exploratory and confirmatory
eriments clear.
The cover letter indicates that “a data analysis strategy based on mean raw ratings shows the
same pattern of effects” as does the surprising, unusual re-coding of the data. These results
should also be shared with the reader, and should be presented rather than those based on the
unusual re-coding strategy.
ur response to the editor (above) we show that the result of different re-coding strategies which we
d on the data of experiment 1. As you can see, different re-coding strategies led to similar outcomes
it is not the case that our particular choice of analysis influenced the results disproportionately. We
itely disagree that simply ignoring a ceiling effect is the best way to analyse our data. With such an
lysis approach, very few trials with low ratings can have a disproportionately large influence on the
an estimate, leading to potentially spurious patterns. However, the reader can come to his or her own
clusions based on the raw data which we make available. Commenting out lines 42 to 67 in

have added information on the mean and spread (standard deviation) of our digit span measure, see
plementary material page 4. We observed the following values: overall digit span: M = 16.78, SD =
9; forward digit span: M = 8.56, SD = 1.88; backward digit span: M = 8.20, SD = 2.29.
The order effect analyses (page 8) should be performed separately for each experiment.
rying out an ANOVA of the combined syntax data of experiments 1 and 2 as in section 4.1 with the
itional between-subjects factor Order (language syntax trials run first or second) showed the same
nificant effects reported in the main analysis without the factor Order (see pages 31 - 32; Difficulty,
y, Difficulty × Key; ps < .05) without a significant involvement of the factor Order (ps > .05). Doing
same analysis separately for experiments 1 and 2 reveals the following. The ANOVA of the language
ck of experiment 1 (see section 2.2.2.1) with the additional factor Order reveals the same significant
cts as before (see page 18; Difficulty, Key; ps < .01). The factor Order was not significant, neither as
ain effect [F(1,52) = 3.41, p = .071, p<U+03B7>2 = .061], nor as an interaction with any other effect (ps > .1). The
OVA of the syntax block of experiment 2 (see section 3.2.2.1) with the additional factor Order reveals
same significant effects as before (see page 28; Difficulty, Key; ps < .05). The factor Order was not
nificant, neither as a main effect [F(1,60) < 1], nor as an interaction with any other effect (ps > .2). This
ws that task order did not interact with any of the effects of interest in any of the experiments.

Appendix C
Nijmegen, 11 December 2015
Dear Dr Aime,
We are submitting a revised version of our article (RSOS-150042) entitled “Language
influences music harmony perception – effects of shared syntactic integration resources
beyond attention”. Apologies for the slight delay in getting back to you.
We have adjusted the manuscript based on the comments by reviewer #2. As you can see in
our responses to reviewer #2’s concerns, there is a considerable amount of repetition in
his/her comments across the different rounds of review. We feel that our earlier replies are not
taken seriously, although we did our best to provide to the point and rather elaborate replies to
earlier comments. We believe that these are the three main points by reviewer #2 which
remain:
1) The harmonic closure ratings follow a different pattern to what reviewer #2 expects.
 We provide two experiments showing that this pattern is replicable in a double task
setting, when music ratings are given while people engage in a concurrent non-musical
task. Moreover, we find a very similar pattern when a post-test – which reviewer #2
suggested – presents music material without a concurrent non-musical task.
Therefore, the harmonic closure ratings follow a consistent pattern for which we
give a simple explanation (p. 20). Despite not confirming reviewer #2’s
expectations, the pattern we find is not a fluke.
2) According to reviewer #2, the cognitive process we invoke for explaining the music
rating effects (music harmony processing) is unnecessary as an allegedly simpler
auditory sensory memory mechanism can explain the findings as well.
 In three rounds of reviews we have made clear that this alternative explanation is
not a good account for our data. In the previous response to reviewer #2’s comments,
we outlined 4 conditions which need to be met before a sensory memory account is a
viable explanation. In the response to our reply, reviewer #2 claims that only one of
the four conditions is met. Therefore, the more widely accepted view that cognitive
representations of harmonic relations between tones/chords is at the heart of
music-language syntax-based influences is supported here. Reviewer #2’s
alternative explanation does not account for our data.
3) Our analysis is not based on raw-ratings of musical closure, but instead on a re-
coding of raw-ratings into high or low closure. Reviewer #2 believes that an analysis
based on raw ratings is to be preferred.
 The closure data revealed an unexpected ceiling effect, necessitating a re-coding.
The re-coding we chose was an exploratory analysis step in experiment 1 but not in
experiment 2. We provide raw ratings and analysis code in the supplementary
materials. Therefore, we provide a robust analysis which, we believe, is perfectly
appropriate. Reviewer #2’s concerns are not justified.
Please note that we have also adopted many other recommendations by all three
reviewers. In our view – and we evaluated this as objectively as we could – these changes
should take away the concerns expressed by the reviewers. However, reviewer #2 continues to
express strong opinions regarding our study with little substantiation. We therefore find it
difficult to reply although we have evidently tried our best in the reply below.
Could you please forward this information to the action editor, so s/he can make an informed
decision regarding our manuscript? Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Richard Kunert (corresponding author)

comments by reviewer #2
As I have indicated in an earlier review, the study integrates in an interesting, growing
research domain and the addressed question could make an important contribution by
testing different manipulations as well as different directionality between music and
language interactions. However, as the presented experiments have strong
shortcomings and raise numerous concerns, I cannot recommend this study for
publication. The authors can use this study as a good starting point to improve their
approach and implementation to further develop this research line.
The revised manuscript now includes a post-test for the musical material, presented
without linguistic task. The results confirm high closure ratings for cadence endings
and low closure ratings for no-cadence endings. However, the results did not show
significant differences between first-key and second-key endings, even though – as
pointed out by the authors – the means suggested the difference in the same direction
as for the main experiment. This led the authors to conclude to “virtually identical
closure ratings” (a statement, which seems too strong and would need to be
tempered).
Regarding tempered language, we now write the following in the manuscript: ‘The observed
main effect of key is not of interest in this study. The fact that second-key endings more often
receive high closure ratings than first-key-endings likely reflects the relatively fast decline of
key availability if a harmonic key is not reinforced by heard chords. Whether this is also the
case without a concurrent task was investigated in a post-test which is part of the
supplementary materials. Briefly, this post-test showed that no-cadence, first-key, and
authentic cadence endings were rated very similarly without a concurrent language or
arithmetic task. Second-key endings, however, less often received a high closure rating
without a concurrent task compared to with, leading to a smaller difference between first-key
and second-key ending ratings in this post-test. Still, the numerical trends were in the same
direction, i.e. there is no indication in the post-test data that second-key endings are heard as
less well closed compared to first-key endings. In sum, participants who only did the music
task performed this task similarly to participants who did it while engaging in a second task at
the same time.’ (pp. 20-21 of main document). Therefore, we use tempered language in the
manuscript, and refrain from making too strong a statement.
However, the first-key and second-key endings were the two crucial conditions of the
main experiment, and the comparisons were interpreted as processing of harmonic
structures and musical syntax. Music theory (with its foundations of musical syntax)
would predict the reverse pattern: stronger closure for first-key endings (respecting
tonal unity) than second-key endings (violating this syntactic rule). The finding thus
suggests that participants might use other features for their judgments than musical
syntax, such as for example, that acoustically the last two chords of the second-key
ending fit more strongly with the tones of the preceding bar than is the case for the
first-key ending.
There is no indication in our data that participants weigh the fit of the last tone with different
preceding bars in order to determine which bar presents a stronger fit. Instead, participants
rate authentic closure endings, whether they are in the key of the last preceding tones or in the
key of the beginning of the piece, generally as good closure (more than 50% of trials in all
authentic closure conditions). The seemingly simpler explanation of reviewer #2 (a trade-off
between linking the last two chords to a first or a second heard key) is therefore not viable.
Instead, we believe that participants can hold more than one key online as a potential
integration site for incoming chords. However, if a key is not reinforced, it becomes
increasingly less available. Therefore, first-key-endings, which refer back to a key which was
not reinforced for four chords, receive a lower rating than second-key-endings, whose key
was just build up by the preceding four chords.
The mechanism which we propose does not match a music theoretic principle which
reviewer #2 invokes – tonal unity. Therefore, we ran a post-test. The post-test revealed that
the difference between ratings of first-key-endings and second-key-endings is similar with a
concurrent non-linguistic task (experiments 1 and 2) and without (post-test). Therefore, the
deviation from the principle of tonal unity appears less an unnatural processing strategy
adopted by participants in experiments 1 and 2, and more a feature of how human
beings comprehend music. Reviewer #2’s expectation does not seem to match the reality
of how music is experienced.
We tested music comprehension with a common dependent variable adopted in
previous studies from different labs, for example reference 21. All we added is to embed them
in a double-task design. As the post-test shows, this does not render them very unusual.
This brings us again to the point that the ninth chord (the first chord in the second key
following the pivot chord) introduces tones that had not been presented before.
Consequently, this chord is not only belonging to a new tonal entity (key), but is also
introducing an acoustic violation (in comparison to other preceding information that
is stored in short-term memory or sensory memory). We thus cannot disentangle
whether it is musical syntax processing or sensory feature processing, and Occam’s
razor rather calls for the more parsimonious interpretation (not requiring tonal
knowledge etc.). The authors write in their coverletter “A modulation from one key to
another leads to sensory violations in the auditory domain. Given that harmonic
modulations are part of the standard repertoire of Western tonal music, this strikes us
as rather unlikely”. However, this statement ignores previous debates in music
cognition domain: In Western tonal music, tonal and sensory features/structures are
often correlated, and experimental approaches are required to control for sensory
features to allow for conclusions about tonal structure processing or tonal knowledge
(see, for example, the work by R. Parncutt, M. Leman, J. Bharucha or E. Bigand).
In our answer to the previous reviewer comments, we sketch four assumptions that would
need to be met before sensory expectations can be taken to underlie our results. Here,
reviewer #2 responds to the first and we agree that it is possible. This, however, does not take
away the fact that three more assumptions would need to be met before a sensory expectations
explanation could fully account for our results, that is, before it would be a more
parsimonious explanation. In detail, these assumptions are (quoting from our previous letter to
the editor):
1) The processing of sensory violations in the auditory domain and processing of
syntactic challenges in the visual domain are linked. We are not aware of a convincing
theoretical framework for such a link, except for general attention. We are discussing a
possible role for general attention in the manuscript and come to the conclusion that it does
not explain the influence of language syntax on music.
2) The processing of sensory violations in the auditory domain can have an influence
on harmonic closure ratings occurring approximately 3 seconds later. Using the contrast
between authentic cadence endings and no cadence endings, we have shown that participants
are very sensitive to harmonic expectations when giving their ratings. We are not aware of a
similar sensitivity of harmonic closure ratings to purely sensory features of the input.
3) The negative influence of sensory violations in the auditory domain on harmonic
closure ratings only occurs when a syntactic challenge is presented in the visual domain. It
does not occur when an arithmetic or semantic challenge is presented in the visual domain.
We are unaware of a convincing theoretical framework which would support such a claim
(see also reply to the next point).
Therefore, an alternative explanation for our findings based on sensory memory
requires assumptions for which we see now basis. Reviewer #2’s alternative explanation
cannot account for our findings.
Related to this point, the authors write in their coverletter that the influence of the
sensory violation “does not occur when an arithmetic or semantic challenge is
presented in the visual domain. We are unaware of a convincing theoretical
framework which would support such a claim”. However, the data pattern might be
created by the fact that the three manipulations, materials and tasks differ in their
level of difficulty and required processing capacity (as also suggested by the findings
(“the difficulty effect was greater in the language task than in the arithmetic task”,
page 19; see also page 28). This might thus lead to interactive patterns or not.
We consider an account which explains the results in terms of difficulty differences on page 5
(section ‘attentional load account’). In the discussion section (page 37) we come to the
conclusion that this account is not well suited to explain our results. In detail, we write that ‘In
the present experiments, it could be argued that critical language syntax trials might be overall
less demanding than control task trials, leaving more attention to music perception. However,
there is no evidence for such an account here. As the difficulty ratings of the pre-tests
revealed, critical language syntax trials were sometimes seen as overall easier (experiment 1)
or harder (experiment 2) than their control task counterparts (ps = .001; see supplementary
material). Thus, in this study, there is no linear relationship between the effect of a task on
music perception and its overall difficulty.’ (pp. 37 - 38).
Alternatively, reviewer #2 might not refer to the overall difficulty of the concurrent
tasks but instead to the difficulty difference between the easier and harder conditions, e.g.,
between a non-garden-path and a garden-path condition. The conclusion would be the same.
Regarding experiment 1, pre-test 1 revealed a greater difficulty effect for arithmetic trials
(0.91) than for language syntax trials (0.53), leading us to conclude that ‘effects based on
general task difficulty should be more easily visible in the arithmetic task. Thus, if there is an
effect of language on music and it is due to general task difficulty, then the arithmetic control
task should show an effect as well.’ (pp. 13-14). Therefore, trial difficulty is not a good
explanation for our results. Reviewer #2’s alternative explanation based on trial
difficulty cannot account for our findings.
The passage reviewer #2 refers to does not relate to trial difficulty ratings but instead
to the factor Difficulty in the analysis of harmonic closure ratings. On page 19 we removed
this misunderstanding: ‘In order to see whether the difficulty effect in the musico-linguistic
task was significantly different from the one in the musico-arithmetic task we performed a
three-way within-subjects ANOVA on the harmonic closure ratings with the factors Task
(language, arithmetic), Difficulty (ambiguous S-coordination/hard, NP-coordination/easy) and
Key (first key ending, second key ending).’
In addition, here it is relevant to underline that the authors observe an interaction
only when they combine Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 for the linguistic
manipulations (even though different linguistic manipulations were used). No such
combined analysis has been proposed for data on arithmetic or semantic structures
(and no data are available to do so).
It is not clear to us what the theoretical relevance of a combined analysis of the arithmetic and
the semantic tasks would be. The manipulations were different in kind between these two
tasks. Note that this is not the case for the language syntax trials of experiments 1 and 2.
There, the cognitive process which the different kinds of language syntax manipulations
targeted is the same. For this reasons we felt it appropriate to combine the data of experiments
1 and 2.
Reviewer #2 might imply that merely a lack of statistical power makes us believe that
non-syntactic influences from language on music are not possible while a well-powered
combined analysis of experiments 1 and 2’s syntax trials suggests a syntactic influence from
language on music. Such a statistical power explanation for our results strikes us as very
unlikely, because even the numerical trends of the control conditions are in the wrong
direction (see Figures 3 & 4). Even with unlimited power, the same trends would not lead to
the same conclusion for control conditions as for language syntax conditions. Therefore,
experimental power is not a viable explanation for our results.
Indeed, the interaction was only significant for the combined analyses (the stars
added to Figures 3 and 4 indicating significance for only one of the two contrasts are
thus not justified based on statistics of each experiment).
In the figures we do not indicate the significance level of the interaction. Rather, we indicate
the significance level of the simple main effect t-tests at each level of the music factor. We
have adjusted the figure legends in order to clarify this point.
(Note that the justification of this combined analysis (see cover letter) is not
convincing, the factor experiment or related interactions might not be significant
because of missing power.)
We agree that non-significant p-values are ambiguous as to whether they support the null
hypothesis of no difference between conditions or whether they indicate that the data supports
neither the null nor the alternative hypothesis. However, in our case, this is not problematic
because the factor Experiment is of little theoretical interest, and we draw no conclusions
from the non-significant results. Instead, we discuss why numerical (non-significant) trends
are stronger in one experiment rather than another (p. 34). Claims of over-interpreting non-
significance are thus not justified.
Regarding the recoding of the data, I have to admit that I do not understand why the
authors refer to a ceiling effect that calls for the unusual recoding of the data.
Maximum proportion of closure reached is at .8 only.
The purpose of recoding the data was to address a ceiling effect. Reviewer #2 doubts the
existence of a ceiling effect after the ceiling effect has been addressed by recoding the data.
We take this to mean that recoding is somewhat successful. To be sure, we did check the
distribution of raw scores in the critical conditions and it does appear left skewed. The
following figure displays raw scores across participants for different Likert scale answer
categories (critical trials of Exp. 1 only):
If the authors insist on using their unusual median scoring, they need to provide the
information about how many items/data points have been removed because they were
on the median.
We have provided MATLAB code which makes the recoding as explicit as possible. In order
to remove ambiguities in the manuscript itself, we supply the necessary information on page
17 of the main document: “For each participant we coded ratings as either indicating high
closure (subject-specific median of critical trial ratings or higher) or not.” Therefore, ratings
on the median were taken to indicate high closure. They were not removed.
Methods: The authors did not observe the expected effect for the unambiguous S-
coordination sentences, thus they “concentrate” on the other contrast and push these
data into the supplementary materials. First, this is misleading for the readers as all
sentence types were presented in the same experimental session. Second, it is not clear
why these sentences were included into the experiment since the “pre-test” had
revealed this finding.
In the first round of reviews (dated 10 April 2015), reviewer #3 questioned whether
unambiguous S-coordination trials could confidently be labelled non-garden-path trials, as we
did in our original submission. In order to address this issue, the analysis involving the
unambiguous S-coordination condition was moved from the main document to the
supplementary materials, and the analyses in the main document were focussed on the
conditions which were more clearly garden-path and non-garden-path conditions.
We included unambiguous S-coordination trials because, originally, we were curious
whether the hierarchy of difficulty ratings seen between the three language syntax conditions
in pre-test 1 (ambiguous S-coordination > unambiguous S-coordination > NP-coordination)
would be seen again in the influence of language on harmonic closure ratings. As seen in
Figure S1, this is indeed the case. For a detailed inferential analysis, please consult the
supplementary material (pp. 1 - 3). We decided to keep these results in the supplementary
materials since the concern of reviewer #3 is justified, and we don’t want to
overinterpret the result of a potentially problematic comparison.
For the arithmetic stimuli, easy and hard operations were selected (page 12), but filler
items included intermediate operations AND easy operations, thus increasing the
number of ‘easy items’, but not ‘hard items’.
We are afraid that we do not understand reviewer #2’s problem with the experimental design
of Exp. 1. In psycholinguistics it is standard practice to include filler trials of variable
difficulty which are usually less demanding than a critical condition, e.g., a garden-path
condition. We applied this reasoning to both the language filler trials and the arithmetic filler
trials. We do not see how the nature of the arithmetic filler trials invalidates our design.
For comparability between materials, it seems also problematic to have 120 trials for
the “musico-linguistic part” of the experiment, but 80 trials only for the “musico-
arithmic part”.
This is a misunderstanding which we are happy to clarify. On page 12 of the manuscript we
write that there “were 40 critical items, thus ensuring an equal number of arithmetic and
linguistic critical trials in each Difficulty × Key-ending design cell (10 trials).” Different trials
counts were, thus, due to a different number of levels of the difficulty factor in the arithmetic
task and in the language task. An equal number of trials went into the comparisons
between easy and difficult trials in the music-language part of the experiment and the
music-arithmetic part of the experiment.
Page 15, lines 3-17: what does “condition” refer to (B, C…)? Is this the music
material type? But this seems to contradict the information about the pairing “with the
same music stimulus” (line 12). Please clarify.
In this context we meant language condition. We adjusted the manuscript accordingly.
Page 22: Labeling Experiment 2 as “confirmatory” is misleading as different
manipulations are used here.
We politely disagree that confirmatory experiments require an identical, previous,
exploratory experiment. In this manuscript, the label ‘confirmatory’ refers to the fixed nature
of the design and analysis before data acquisition.
Page 27: The analysis cannot be the same as in experiment 1 as the conditions are
different.
We politely disagree. Both analyses employ a 2 x 2 repeated measures ANOVA on identically
recoded data.
Page 28: As the comprehension prompts, “often did not target the semantic ambiguity
of the sentences”, how can the authors be sure that semantic ambiguity was processed
by the participants?
Reviewer #2 voiced a similar concern in the first round of reviews. Our reasoning remains
unchanged on this point. As mentioned in the manuscript on page 26, the second pre-test of
experiment 2 revealed that participants’ reading slows down when encountering the
semantically disambiguating word. Furthermore, semantic garden-path trials were judged as
more difficult than non-garden-path trials, see supplementary material pages 6 - 7. Crucially,
these results were obtained in a pre-test with the same comprehension prompts as in the main
experiment. This shows that people do process the semantic ambiguity even when they
are not forced to do so by a comprehension prompt which is presented after the
sentence.
Another problematic point of the results (page 29) is the observation that the
interaction Manipulation x Difficulty did not include the factor Key, which would be
necessary for the advanced interpretation.
We do not claim that the three-way interaction Manipulation × Difficulty × Key is significant
in the data of experiment 2. By ‘advanced interpretation’, reviewer #2 likely refers to the role
that shared music-language resources have in harmonic processing. Our reasoning regarding
this point is based on the analysis of the combined data of experiments 1 and 2. Given the
exploratory nature, we acknowledge that ‘the result of the combined analysis should be
replicated’ (p. 34). Claims of over-interpreting a difference in significance levels of simple
main effects without a significant interaction effect are, thus, not justified.
Introduction:
Page 5, line 17: “an unexpected instrument” might also tax fewer attentional
resources, so this argumentation does not hold.
We have adjusted the wording to make clear that the interpretation we present is the original
authors’: ‘A timbral unexpectancy (an unusual instrument) was without effect. The authors
interpreted this as evidence against acoustic deviancy alone underlying the musical influence
on language.’ (p. 5)
Page 6, line 22: why should facilitated processing lead to an increased priming effect?
Poulin-Charronnat and colleagues believe that semantic priming is dependent on the
availability of attentional resources for language processing. When a critical word is
processed during a concurrent tonic chord, attention is greater than during a subdominant
chord. For details, the publication making this claim should be consulted (reference 9).
The ANOVAs of order effects should be included in the manuscript.
In the interest of brevity (see reviewer #1’s concerns in the first round of reviews), we have
included these analyses in the supplementary materials.
Discussion:
page 36: The authors should further analyze the differences between the studies – for
example, Steinbeis and Koelsch used tasks on music and language materials (like the
authors here do too) while Koelsch 2005 only used a language task.
In the first round of reviews, reviewer #1 considered the manuscript too long and the detailed
discussion of ERP components ‘beyond the scope of the present behavioural study’. We agree
with reviewer #1 that a detailed discussion of ERP components is beyond the scope of this
paper. Please note that we do not claim to have falsified Steinbeis & Koelsch (reference 6).
We believe that ‘more research is needed’ (p. 36) beyond the current manuscript in order to
understand different results between studies.
