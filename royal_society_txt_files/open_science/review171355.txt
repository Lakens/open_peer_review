This is a very nice paper, well written, with a clear message, and rigorous science. It describes
that if a MOF, which was synthesised in the presence of a templating solvent, is heated to a high
temperature, then there is a phase transition to a denser form. The denser form then becomes
stiffer, as would be expected. It is useful of this paper to point out that DSC could, and should, be
used more widely to check for such transitions in the MOF community. After all, MOFs are
porous structures templated by a solvent. That means that many of them will not be the most
thermodynamically favourable structure in the absence of said solvent.
I would be happy to recommend it for publication subject to a few minor corrections:
1) In the abstract, line three. The transition is said to be “only uncovered through use of DSC”.
This should be changed. I am happy for them to say it “was uncovered through use of DSC”, or
“first uncovered through use of DSC”. But DSC is not the only way this could be done. Variable
temperature diffraction would work as well, a point they themselves make in the conclusions.
2) The description/definition of MOFs in the first sentence of the introduction must be clarified
and put in context. I find the re-branding of MOFs to instead mean co-ordination polymers
dishonest and quite frankly somewhat Orwellian.
Porous coordination polymers are well defined and have been known for a hundred years or so.
MOFs are much more resent subset of coordination polymers, and with specific properties. MOFs
are generally considered to be a branch of coordination polymers that are both crystalline and
porous. Therefore, a MOF that is made amorphous or non-porous does not really become an
"amorphous MOF", or "non-porous MOF" - it just reverts to being a coordination polymer. This
means that you can make a MOF amorphous, but you can’t make and amorphous MOF.
Similarly, you can make a MOF non-porous, but you can't make a non-porous MOF.
Some differentiation of coordination polymer and MOF should be provided in the introduction.
The definition given for a MOF is far too general and would also apply perfectly well as a
definition for coordination polymer. If that was true, there would be absolutely no need for the
term MOF in the first place. The reference provided for the definition itself is quite clear on this,
so I find the sentence used from in to equate a MOF to a coordination polymer to be somewhat
taken out of context. For example, that reference has the following abstract:
"Crystalline metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are formed by reticular synthesis, which creates
strong bonds between inorganic and organic units. Careful selection of MOF constituents can
yield crystals of ultrahigh porosity and high thermal and chemical stability. These characteristics
allow the interior of MOFs to be chemically altered for use in gas separation, gas storage, and
catalysis, among other applications. The precision commonly exercised in their chemical
modification and the ability to expand their metrics without changing the underlying topology
have not been achieved with other solids. MOFs whose chemical composition and shape of
building units can be multiply varied within a particular structure already exist and may lead to
materials that offer a synergistic combination of properties.”
Which makes it clear that MOFs would be expected to be crystalline and porous.
I think the author should add a little context to the introduction to be a little more honest with the
reader, to put it into context that MOFs are a) a subclass of coordination polymers, and b)
crystalline and porous.
3) Concerning the cracks in the crystals. This would be useful to document more fully. The
crystals contract when the solvent is removed, as would be expected. This contraction naturally
causes cracking in the crystal. It would be beneficially to run a quick SEM and include
representative images of these cracks in the SI. Likewise, please comment on the broadening of
the peaks in the PXRD in comparison to the relatively sharp peaks before the transition. These are
likely a result of small crystallite size. Would it be possible to use the Scherrer to calculate a
crystallite size?
4) Concerning the transition to a lower energy phase. Presumably the initial phase was lowest in
energy in the presence of solvent, but became higher in energy after removal of solvent. But was
kinetically trapped. With heating the framework had the energy to re-arrange to the preferred
structure in the absence of solvent. However, what would happen if this new structure was
3
immersed in the same solvent? Would it revert to the original structure? Please test this and state
if it reversible or not. (N.B. – publishable either way, just think this should be included).
5) results and discussion, 5th line (10 by numbering down left hand side of page). “excothermic
process at with no” Remove at?
6) Same page, line 32 (by left hand numbering) “gained yielded” – pick one.
7) I would prefer “heating step” or “heating cycle” to “upscan” which I think is unhelpful – but I
will leave this up to you. For example “Subjected to upscans at a heating rate of either 10 K/min
or…” could be written as “heated at either 10 K/min or…”.

Bennett and co-workers report on the thermally induced solid-solid phase transformation of
ZnPurBr to a new phase with srs topology. The transformation process was studied in detail by
DSC, DFT, single crystal XRD and nanoindentation techniques. The design of new MOF
structures has been very challenging since the combination of most available inorganic and
organic counterparts have been demonstrated. Through thermal phase transition, the authors
demonstrate the creation of ZnPurBr-ht material with improved framework rigidity. This is a
very interesting study and the manuscript is well presented. I have only few minor remarks listed
as follows:
1. It was not mentioned in the text about the accessible porosity of ZnPurBr-ht material to either
nitrogen or argon?
2. What is the overall percentage of transformation in weight? What is the determined chemical
composition for ZnPurBr-ht? According to the paper published by Kahr et al. (Chem. Commun.,
2012,48, 6690-6692), ZnPurBr has a theoretical unit cell formula weight of 543.85 versus 264.39 for
ZnPurBr-ht.
3. I would suggest the authors to remove Figure 1D. Figure 1D was not mentioned in the text and
it has completely different Zn coordination environment to ZnPurBr and ZnPurBr-ht.
4. The CIF file of the new material ZnPurBr-ht should also be provided as supporting
information.
5. Recently published article on solid-solid phase transformation synthesis of a MOF has not been

Thank you for providing us with the referee reports for the above manuscript. We have done our best to
answer them, though the 7 day limit prohibits some of the suggested experiments due to upcoming
synchrotron time at which the whole group is present.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a very nice paper, well written, with a clear message, and rigorous science. It describes that if a
MOF, which was synthesised in the presence of a templating solvent, is heated to a high temperature,
then there is a phase transition to a denser form. The denser form then becomes stiffer, as would be
expected. It is useful of this paper to point out that DSC could, and should, be used more widely to check
for such transitions in the MOF community. After all, MOFs are porous structures templated by a solvent.
That means that many of them will not be the most thermodynamically favourable structure in the absence
of said solvent.
We are delighted that the referee finds the paper acceptable for publication.
I would be happy to recommend it for publication subject to a few minor corrections:
1) In the abstract, line three. The transition is said to be “only uncovered through use of DSC”. This should
be changed. I am happy for them to say it “was uncovered through use of DSC”, or “first uncovered
through use of DSC”. But DSC is not the only way this could be done. Variable temperature diffraction
would work as well, a point they themselves make in the conclusions.
This is a very good point indeed and the offending word has been removed.
2) The description/definition of MOFs in the first sentence of the introduction must be clarified and put in
context. I find the re-branding of MOFs to instead mean co-ordination polymers dishonest and quite
frankly somewhat Orwellian.
Porous coordination polymers are well defined and have been known for a hundred years or so. MOFs
are much more resent subset of coordination polymers, and with specific properties. MOFs are generally
considered to be a branch of coordination polymers that are both crystalline and porous. Therefore, a
MOF that is made amorphous or non-porous does not really become an "amorphous MOF", or "non-

you can't make a non-porous MOF.

reference has the following abstract:
"Crystalline metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are formed by reticular synthesis, which creates strong
bonds between inorganic and organic units. Careful selection of MOF constituents can yield crystals of
ultrahigh porosity and high thermal and chemical stability. These characteristics allow the interior of MOFs

Which makes it clear that MOFs would be expected to be crystalline and porous.
I think the author should add a little context to the introduction to be a little more honest with the reader, to
put it into context that MOFs are a) a subclass of coordination polymers, and b) crystalline and porous.
I have replaced reference 1 with one that defines MOFs as “a Coordination Network with organic ligands
containing potential voids.” It is not my intention to become involved in a semantics argument. The first
sentence has however been amended.
3) Concerning the cracks in the crystals. This would be useful to document more fully. The crystals
contract when the solvent is removed, as would be expected. This contraction naturally causes cracking in
the crystal. It would be beneficially to run a quick SEM and include representative images of these cracks
in the SI. Likewise, please comment on the broadening of the peaks in the PXRD in comparison to the
relatively sharp peaks before the transition. These are likely a result of small crystallite size. Would it be
possible to use the Scherrer to calculate a crystallite size?
The short time for revisions afforded preclude the suggested SEM, though the optical images in the inset
of Figure 4 show some indication as to the extent. The crystallite size distribution after the transition is
likely to be inhomogeneous because of cracking of existing single crystals.
4) Concerning the transition to a lower energy phase. Presumably the initial phase was lowest in energy in
the presence of solvent, but became higher in energy after removal of solvent. But was kinetically trapped.
With heating the framework had the energy to re-arrange to the preferred structure in the absence of
solvent. However, what would happen if this new structure was immersed in the same solvent? Would it
revert to the original structure? Please test this and state if it reversible or not. (N.B. – publishable either
way, just think this should be included).
It is possible that the structure may revert to an open one upon heating in solvent, however the reversible
transitions which occur in MOFs may require extremely specific conditions (e.g. solvent, T, t), and
although we find polymorphism extremely interesting, it is not the focus of this present work.
5) results and discussion, 5th line (10 by numbering down left hand side of page). “exothermic process at
with no” Remove at?
Thanks very much for the point, this has been removed.
6) Same page, line 32 (by left hand numbering) “gained yielded” – pick one.
We have picked yielded. Thank you for pointing this out.
7) I would prefer “heating step” or “heating cycle” to “upscan” which I think is unhelpful – but I will leave
this up to you. For example “Subjected to upscans at a heating rate of either 10 K/min or…” could be
written as “heated at either 10 K/min or…”.
We have changed this in line with the suggestion of the referee.

presented. I have only few minor remarks listed as follows:
We are very thankful for the interest of the referee and the pertinent points outlined below.
1. It was not mentioned in the text about the accessible porosity of ZnPurBr-ht material to either nitrogen
or argon?
The original (excellent) paper describing the synthesis pointed out the non-porous nature of the room
temperature phase, the density reduction will also mean the high temperature phase is non porous.
2. What is the overall percentage of transformation in weight? What is the determined chemical
composition for ZnPurBr-ht? According to the paper published by Kahr et al. (Chem. Commun., 2012,48,
6690-6692), ZnPurBr has a theoretical unit cell formula weight of 543.85 versus 264.39 for ZnPurBr-ht.
A line has been added for this in the Table in the SI. Solvent molecules were included in the room
temperature structure.
3. I would suggest the authors to remove Figure 1D. Figure 1D was not mentioned in the text and it has
completely different Zn coordination environment to ZnPurBr and ZnPurBr-ht.
This has been done.
4. The CIF file of the new material ZnPurBr-ht should also be provided as supporting information.
This can be downloaded from the CCDC, with the number 1573648.
