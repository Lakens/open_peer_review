Dear All,
I have read with great interest your manuscript and I believe it may deserve eventually
publication in RSOS however not enough data has been collected to grant the claims in the
manuscript.
The manuscript sets to demonstrate that duration compression is mediated essentially by global
motion mechanisms. To this aim the authors use adaptors with various coherence level and test
stimuli of 100% coherence. Duration compression occurs only when the adaptor has high
coherence and this is taken as evidence that coherence is necessary for adaptation.
However, if I understand correclty, this effect is also consisent with the idea that compression
occurs when adaptor and tests have similar distribution of motion directions (i.e. random
direction do not overlap with coherent vertical directions). To demonstrate that high-coherence
stimuli are really necessary, one ought to make a 2x2 experiment in which adaptors can be
coherent or random and tests can be either coherent or random. If the authors' claims are correct
(and I have no reason to doubt it) duration compression should occur only when both adaptors
and tests have high coherence.
I think this is important and is mandatory.
Said this I have a few further small remarks.
- The first is that in the sub section 3.1. you write "In contrast to Experiment 2, the perceived
global.." I guess you meant "Experiment 1"
- The second concerns the literature. Recently Fornaciai et al have demonstrated that duration
compression occurs only for some specific types of pattern motion (e.g. translating rigid gratings)
but not other patterns (such as windmill or ripples in the pond). I think that this work, just like
yours, challenges the idea that duration compression occurs only as local adaptation.
http://www.nature.com/articles/srep23341
Therefore I think it ought to be included and discussed thoroughly.
- Also I have found no extensive statements on speed matching, which we all know to be
important. Did you employ it? In experiment 2 the various tests are matched between themselves
but are they matched to the comparison stimulus? Please state these issues clearly to reassure the
reader that we are dealing with the properties of the duration mechanisms and not the speed
mechanisms.

This is a fairly simple manuscript investigating the conditions under which adaptation induced
compression of event duration occurs. Their first experiments shows, not surprisingly, that the
amount of suppression depends on the motion coherence of the adaptor stimulus. But when the
local speeds were adjusted so the global speed did not vary with coherence, the dependence on
coherence vanished, suggesting that only global speed mattered. They then very reasonably
conclude that as the compression depends on global, rather than local speed, it probably occurs at
a mid- to high-level, maybe MT.
The experiments are simple and well designed, and the manuscript well written (despite sending
me to the dictionary on the first sentence...). The conclusions follow well from the data. My only
comment is that they are unaware of a very recent paper (below) showing that the compression
occurs only for linear, not for circular or radial motion. This is not in obvious agreement with the
current results, and should be discussed.

Thanks for the minor changes to the paper. I now follow completely your point and I can agree
on the conclusions
(reviewers’ comments italicized)
Reviewer #1
1. The manuscript sets to demonstrate that duration compression is mediated
essentially by global motion mechanisms. To this aim the authors use adaptors with various
coherence level and test stimuli of 100% coherence. Duration compression occurs only when
the adaptor has high coherence and this is taken as evidence that coherence is necessary for
adaptation.
Response: While Experiment 1 was initially designed to investigate the relationship
between adaptor coherence and duration compression magnitude, we did not want to give
the impression that we conclude that “coherence is necessary for adaptation”. Indeed, our
second experiment rules out any relationship between motion coherence and duration
compression magnitude; instead the data from Experiment 2 provides compelling evidence
that the results of Experiment 1 (increasing duration compression magnitude) were driven
by the adaptors’ global speed rather than motion coherence per se. As we explain in the
manuscript, the increasing duration compression found in Experiment 1 is a consequence of
a) a previous report that the duration compression effect is speed tuned, and b) the global
speed of the adaptor approaching that of the test stimulus. We acknowledge that the
reviewer did not pick up on this subtlety, so we have made the manuscript clearer by
appending the following sentence to paragraph 3 of the Discussion:
“This suggests that the increase in duration compression magnitude observed in Experiment
1 was not a consequence of increasing the adaptor’s motion coherence level, but was a
consequence of the increasing pattern speed of the adaptor.”
2. ..if I understand correctly, this effect is also consistent with the idea that compression
occurs when adaptor and tests have similar distribution of motion directions (i.e. random
direction do not overlap with coherent vertical directions). To demonstrate that high-
coherence stimuli are really necessary, one ought to make a 2x2 experiment in which
adaptors can be coherent or random and tests can be either coherent or random. If the
authors' claims are correct (and I have no reason to doubt it) duration compression should
occur only when both adaptors and tests have high coherence.
Response: As pointed out, above, we think the reviewer may have misunderstood part of
our design and interpretation. We do not conclude that high coherence (or speed) stimuli
are necessary for inducing duration compression. Nor do we claim that the effect should
occur only when both adaptor and test have high coherence (or speed). For this reason we
feel it is not necessary to run an experiment which tests for an outcome our previous results
do not predict. Again, we appreciate that our argument could have been a little clearer, so
we have added to the text in the Intro to Experiment 2, as well as in the Discussion. The
following sentence has been appended to section 3.1:
3. ..in the sub section 3.1. you write "In contrast to Experiment 2, the perceived global.."
I guess you meant "Experiment 1"
Response: We thank reviewer #1 for pointing this out. We have corrected the typo.
4. Recently Fornaciai et al have demonstrated that duration compression occurs only for
some specific types of pattern motion (e.g. translating rigid gratings) but not other patterns
(such as windmill or ripples in the pond). I think that this work, just like yours, challenges the
idea that duration compression occurs only as local adaptation. Therefore I think it ought to
be included and discussed thoroughly.
Response: Reviewer #2 makes the same observation and also requests that we should
include this work in our discussion. The following has been added as the penultimate
paragraph of the Discussion:
“A recent report by Fornaciai, Arrighi and Burr (2016) also points to the existence of timing
mechanisms at the global-processing stage; but, intriguingly, the duration compression
effect which revealed the mechanisms was found to be induced only by translational-
motion adaptors, with other more complex motion adaptors having no effect on perceived
duration. Since the adaptors used in our experiments contained dots moving in many
different directions, it could be argued that duration compression is not restricted to just
translational motion. However, we would suggest that our results align with those of
Fornaciai et al; this is because, despite containing dots with a wide range of trajectories, the
perceived pattern motion of our adaptor stimuli is unidirectional translation. Indeed, this is
consistent with the finding that the degree of duration compression was determined by the
speed of global translational motion.”
5. I have found no extensive statements on speed matching, which we all know to be
important. Did you employ it? In experiment 2 the various tests are matched between
themselves but are they matched to the comparison stimulus? Please state these issues
clearly to reassure the reader that we are dealing with the properties of the duration
mechanisms and not the speed mechanisms.
Response: The last paragraph in the Procedure section of Experiment 1 addresses this
point, and highlights that the comparison stimulus speed was matched to the perceived
speed of the test stimulus. However, Reviewer #2 also points out that this is not made clear
for Experiment 2. We have inserted the following sentence into the Procedure of
Experiment 2:
“As in Experiment 1, the comparison stimulus’s speed was matched to observers’ perceived
speed of the test stimulus.“
Reviewer #2
1. My only comment is that they are unaware of a very recent paper (below) showing
that the compression occurs only for linear, not for circular or radial motion. This is not in
obvious agreement with the current results, and should be discussed.
