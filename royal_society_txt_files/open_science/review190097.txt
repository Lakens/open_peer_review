The manuscript describes a series of studies exploring the effect of action variability on word
learning in 18-, 30-, and 36- to 48-month old children and adults. Participants were presented
with a looking time task in which they were trained with two novel object-word mappings across
four training trials. Participants saw actions performed on the objects during labeling; actions
were either the same on each of the two trials (consistent) or different (inconsistent). The
youngest children showed no evidence of word learning in either condition. 30-month-old infants
and 36- to 48-month old toddlers learned words in the consistent condition only. Finally, adults
learned words in both conditions. The authors conclude that young children (but not young
infants) can capitalise on redundant multimodal information when learning words.
Note that the supplemental materials on the submission portal appear to relate to bibliographic
management; I haven’t been able to open them.
Overall the manuscript addresses an interesting question, offers a new contribution to the word
learning literature, and will be accessible to a wide audience. I’ll first address the points in the
reviewer guidelines; I’ve provided more detail below.
1. Scientific accuracy, including statistical analysis: The use of GCA is relatively novel in infancy
research and adds substantial insight into the evolution of children’s looking behavior over time.
I have some questions about the analyses, detailed below.
2. Whether the research methods are appropriate, and evidence is provided for the conclusions
drawn. The research methods are appropriate and the conclusions are merited by the results as
they stand, although the Discussion needs some clarification
3. Writing style and accessibility for a wide audience. The paper is largely well-written although
there are some places which would benefit from rephrasing. I’ve listed these in the Minor Points
section
4. Use of suitable illustrations, tables and supplementary material to illustrate results. Figures and
tables are appropriate and informative.
5. Appropriate length. The manuscript is concise.
6. Ethics. I have no ethical concerns about the research.
7. Data sharing. The authors have made their scripts and data available on Open Science
Framework and I have been able to access all files.
Comments and questions
Overall
1) The term semantic (in)consistency suggests a match or mismatch between the semantics of the
action and the word; e.g., a hopping action for a toy rabbit is semantically consistent, while a
hopping action for a toy snake is semantically inconsistent. Given that stimuli in the current
study are novel actions and novel words, there are no a priori semantics, so no match or
mismatch between the action/word pairings. “action consistency” (which the authors also use)
would be a more neutral term.

Methods
2) While it’s great that the sample sizes are bigger than is typical in developmental research, it
would be helpful to know how these were determined.
3) What were the sizes of the AOIs? If AOIs differed substantially, this could explain the main
effect of Object which I mention in more detail below.
Results
4) p-values of more than .05 should not reported as null, rather than as trends towards
significance.
5) Although Label and Object were included as control factors, these predictors have a significant
effect on the majority of the growth curve models, and the effect of Object in particular is always
in the same (positive) direction except for one instance. Although this finding is not central to the
motivation of the study, I would like to know what drives it. Are participants only learning
names for one of the objects? It would also be clearer to have the same variable names in the
tables as in the text (i.e. either Label or Name)
6) Table 2: the caption mentions an asterisk but there are no asterisks in the table. Do the authors
mean their 1) notation? Relatedly, why are the coefficients for the polynomial interactions not
meaningful? I’m not suggesting this is an error - I have limited knowledge of GCA (as would
other readers), so a brief explanation might be appropriate (same applies to Table 3).
7) Why is sex included as a predictor in the second model (Table 3) but not the first (Table 2)?
Looking at the R script I think this is a typo in the MS.
8) It’s not clear from the participants section that only a subset of parents completed the language
measures. In the footnote on page 9 the authors explain that the language measures were
dropped in order to preserve sample size. On my understanding, though, LMEMs can deal with
missing data, so it would seem sensible to report models including these measures unless the
subset is very small. Alternatively, if the language measures had no statistical effect, the authors
could state this in the footnote - “did not contribute strongly to the models” is ambiguous as to
significance.
Discussion
9) In places I found the flow of the discussion difficult to follow: dynamic systems approaches
and multimodal input are introduced on page 12, followed by the Gogate/Hollich Emergentist
Coalition Model, followed by auditory overshadowing (see my next comment on this section),
followed by dynamic systems and multimodal input, followed by dynamic systems again. The
authors also bring in active learning; although this is an important field I feel mentioning it here
muddies the water, as this study used a non-naturalistic design. Overall, subheadings would help
to make the line of argument clearer
10) On pages 12-13 the authors talk about salience of language over actions and argue that “from
a certain age” words are more salient than actions. Are they referring to their 30-month-olds here,
and is the claim that language is less salient for younger children? How does this relate to the
auditory overshadowing effects shown in infants (e.g., Robinson & Sloutsky, 2007)? Given the
relevance of the auditory overshadowing literature to the discussion in this paragraph it would
be helpful to have more detail.

Minor points
Abstract:
“exacerbate” -> “hinder”
Ages: present ranges for all age groups, or months for all age groups; be consistent with use of
months versus years
p.2, l.34: “Temporal alignment of actions accompanying caregiver speech is around 76% during
year 1 [4] and have already been shown to accompany 2-year-old children’s speech [10].” This
sentence isn’t clear; perhaps “…and 2-year-old children accompany their own speech with
actions”
p.2, l.42: “Young infants seem to benefit from multimodal input when, for example, they were
presented” – tenses are mixed here
p.2, l.56: an example of what these authors considered a referential action to be would be helpful
p.3, l.10: “Language can also facilitate the comparison of actions already in 10-month-olds” – “in
infants as young as 10 months” would work better than “already in 10-month-olds” (similar
comment applies to uses of “already in X-month-olds” elsewhere)
p.3, l.30: “studies have shown that consistency in form of the same location associations” ->
“studies have shown that consistency in referent location”
p.3, l.54: “although 30-month-olds would learn labels” -> “although 30-month-olds learned
labels”
p.4, l.27: “passed” -> “past”
p.4, l.28: “does not influence” -> “would not influence”
p. 6, l.46: “For the test phase, it was coded” -> “For the test phase, we coded”
p.7, l.14 “childrenâ<U+02D8>AZ´ s”: something’s gone wrong with formatting here
p.7, l.50: “If, however, they look to the correct target during the time” – I wasn’t clear what this
sentence meant
Figure 4: “Time from label onset” would be clearer as the figure caption
p.12, l.35: “a word and an object might seem arbitrary”: this isn’t clear; perhaps “a word and an
object might seem unrelated”
p.12, l.58: “auditory words, and language in particular, may be more salient”: this suggests that
language is part of words, rather than words being part of language… “words may be more
salient” would work better.
p.13, l. 9: “Of interest is also the difference” -> “Also of interest is the difference”
p.13, l.21: the mention of the water wheel comes out of the blue

Comments to the Author:
Dear Authors,
Thank you for submitting your work to the Royal Society Open Science journal for consideration.
I apologize for the amount of time it has taken to provide you with an evaluation—it took longer
than usual to find reviewers for your manuscript. I’m pleased to tell you that on the basis of my
own assessment of the manuscript, as well as the comments of two reviewers, we would like to
accept the manuscript for publication pending revisions. There are two major things that should
be addressed in your revision:
1. Clarification of Methods/Results:
• I am confused about what the relative contribution of the two analyses you present are: in
particular, I do not understand what the ANOVA/t-tests add to your interpretation of your data.
This is particularly so as the overall ANOVA shows no significant interaction between Age x
Condition, rendering follow-up age-specific t-tests unwarranted. This stands in contrast to what
you see in the more powerful GLMM analysis. Please could you clarify what we learn from the
ANOVAs? It’s not clear to me that they are needed at all.
• Reviewer 1 notes a number of other issues in the reporting of methods/results, all of which I
think can be dealt with relatively easily.
2. Both reviewers also note problems with drawing comparisons between the action consistencies
manipulated in your paradigm and “action semantics”. Reviewer 1 has suggested that much of
the problem could be eliminated by simply talking about “action consistency” rather than
semantic information; this is also my impression. This opens up avenues for discussion about
how the presence of action features may contribute to semantic representations (i.e., consistent
actions result in an action feature, inconsistent action pairings do not).
The reviewers also bring up a number of more minor points, which you may consider if you feel
it improves your manuscript. In general, my advice would be to focus on the substantive points
raised, rather than focusing on typos.
The revised manuscript will be sent back to at least one reviewer.
Best wishes,
Shirley-Ann Rueschemeyer

Appendix B
Review: Semantic consistency of actions influences young children’s
word learning
Associate Editor
Thank you for submitting your work to the Royal Society Open Science journal for
consideration. I apologize for the amount of time it has taken to provide you with an
evaluation—it took longer than usual to find reviewers for your manuscript. I’m pleased to
ell you that on the basis of my own assessment of the manuscript, as well as the comments
of two reviewers, we would like to accept the manuscript for publication pending revisions.
There are two major things that should be addressed in your revision:
1. Clarification of Methods/Results:
• I am confused about what the relative contribution of the two analyses you present
are: in particular, I do not understand what the ANOVA/t-tests add to your interpretation of
your data. This is particularly so as the overall ANOVA shows no significant interaction
between Age x Condition, rendering follow-up age-specific t-tests unwarranted. This stands
n contrast to what you see in the more powerful GLMM analysis. Please could you clarify
what we learn from the ANOVAs? It’s not clear to me that they are needed at all.
• Reviewer 1 notes a number of other issues in the reporting of methods/results, all of
which I think can be dealt with relatively easily.
- Thank you for this comment. We included both types of analyses because we believe
that the ANOVAs and t-tests make it easier to situate our results in the broader
context of the literature, while the GLMMs provide higher resolution and allow us to
account for variance in the data. Further, we believe that comparisons between the
two analyses allow for a more differentiated picture of the results. We have now
included a paragraph on the statistical approaches in the discussion.
2. Both reviewers also note problems with drawing comparisons between the action
consistencies manipulated in your paradigm and “action semantics”. Reviewer 1 has
suggested that much of the problem could be eliminated by simply talking about “action
consistency” rather than semantic information; this is also my impression. This opens up
avenues for discussion about how the presence of action features may contribute to
semantic representations (i.e., consistent actions result in an action feature, inconsistent
action pairings do not).
- We have now used “consistency” instead of “semantic consistency” throughout the
manuscript.
The reviewers also bring up a number of more minor points, which you may consider if you
eel it improves your manuscript. In general, my advice would be to focus on the substantive
points raised, rather than focusing on typos.
Reviewer 1
The manuscript describes a series of studies exploring the effect of action variability on word
earning in 18-, 30-, and 36- to 48-month old children and adults. Participants were
presented with a looking time task in which they were trained with two novel object-word
mappings across four training trials. Participants saw actions performed on the objects
during labeling; actions were either the same on each of the two trials (consistent) or
different (inconsistent). The youngest children showed no evidence of word learning in
either condition. 30-month-old infants and 36- to 48-month old toddlers learned words in
he consistent condition only. Finally, adults learned words in both conditions. The authors
conclude that young children (but not young infants) can capitalise on redundant
multimodal information when learning words.
Note that the supplemental materials on the submission portal appear to relate to
bibliographic management; I haven’t been able to open them.
- Thank you for this comment. We checked this again to ensure that this was the .bib
file that is required to compile a LateX document with bibliography entries.
Overall the manuscript addresses an interesting question, offers a new contribution to the
word learning literature, and will be accessible to a wide audience. I’ll first address the
points in the reviewer guidelines; I’ve provided more detail below.
- Thank you very much for your detailed feedback! We highly appreciate your
comments and believe that they have significantly improved our work and the
manuscript.
1. Scientific accuracy, including statistical analysis: The use of GCA is relatively novel in
nfancy research and adds substantial insight into the evolution of children’s looking
behavior over time. I have some questions about the analyses, detailed below.
2. Whether the research methods are appropriate, and evidence is provided for the
conclusions drawn. The research methods are appropriate and the conclusions are merited
by the results as they stand, although the Discussion needs some clarification
3. Writing style and accessibility for a wide audience. The paper is largely well-written
although there are some places which would benefit from rephrasing. I’ve listed these in the
Minor Points section
4. Use of suitable illustrations, tables and supplementary material to illustrate results.
Figures and tables are appropriate and informative.
5. Appropriate length. The manuscript is concise.
6. Ethics. I have no ethical concerns about the research.
7. Data sharing. The authors have made their scripts and data available on Open
Science Framework and I have been able to access all files.
Comments and questions
Overall
1) The term semantic (in)consistency suggests a match or mismatch between the semantics
of the action and the word; e.g., a hopping action for a toy rabbit is semantically consistent,
while a hopping action for a toy snake is semantically inconsistent. Given that stimuli in the
current study are novel actions and novel words, there are no a priori semantics, so no
match or mismatch between the action/word pairings. “action consistency” (which the
authors also use) would be a more neutral term.
- We now use “consistency” instead of “semantic consistency” throughout the
manuscript.
Methods
2) While it’s great that the sample sizes are bigger than is typical in developmental research,
t would be helpful to know how these were determined.
- There are few comparable studies looking at children’s learning of words with
simultaneously presented actions. Studies do exist with regard to the influence of
variability on learning but these appear to be underpowered (e.g., Twomey, Ma &
Westermann, 2017). We therefore did not have a suitable prior on which to base the
power analyses. We therefore decided to test a higher number of children than usual
relative to earlier studies, aiming for at least 24 children per condition per age-group.
3) What were the sizes of the AOIs? If AOIs differed substantially, this could explain the main
effect of Object which I mention in more detail below.
- The AOIs were identical in size and we have now added this information in the
methods.
Results
4) p-values of more than .05 should not reported as null, rather than as trends towards
significance.
- We now report that these values are above the threshold we set for significance in
our study.
5) Although Label and Object were included as control factors, these predictors have a
significant effect on the majority of the growth curve models, and the effect of Object in
particular is always in the same (positive) direction except for one instance. Although this
inding is not central to the motivation of the study, I would like to know what drives it. Are
participants only learning names for one of the objects? It would also be clearer to have the
same variable names in the tables as in the text (i.e. either Label or Name)
- As you note, we believe it to be important that these factors were included as control
factors. Based on a visual analysis of the data we do not think it is the case that
participants learned names for only one of the objects. Rather, we believe these
differences arise from differences in the curvature of the response to both objects at
best. For comparison we plotted the data for all age groups in the consistent
condition separated by objects here and provide the code on OSF.
- We have now changed the wording in the table.
6) Table 2: the caption mentions an asterisk but there are no asterisks in the table. Do the
authors mean their 1) notation? Relatedly, why are the coefficients for the polynomial
nteractions not meaningful? I’m not suggesting this is an error - I have limited knowledge of
GCA (as would other readers), so a brief explanation might be appropriate (same applies to
Table 3).
- Thank you for this remark. Coefficients reflect the amount of influence of one specific
level of a factor. For example, we might have the factor “Object” with the levels
“blue” and “yellow”. The GLMM automatically assigns a “baseline level”, let’s say
“blue” in this example (usually ordered by alphabet or some other order indicator). A
main effect of Object can then be seen as a change in the coefficient for the yellow
object compared to the blue object. When we now consider an interaction, let’s say
between the factor “Object” and “Label”, this coefficient would reflect the change for
object (i.e., change for yellow compared to blue) and for label (i.e., Tanu compared
to Loki) and their interaction. Accordingly, the coefficients do not represent the
interaction alone, and it is therefore not helpful to interpret them with regard to the
interaction. We have now included a note on this in the table footnote.
7) Why is sex included as a predictor in the second model (Table 3) but not the first (Table
2)? Looking at the R script I think this is a typo in the MS.
- Thank you for noting this, it was indeed a typo and we corrected the description of
the model now.
8) It’s not clear from the participants section that only a subset of parents completed the
anguage measures. In the footnote on page 9 the authors explain that the language
measures were dropped in order to preserve sample size. On my understanding, though,
LMEMs can deal with missing data, so it would seem sensible to report models including
hese measures unless the subset is very small. Alternatively, if the language measures had
no statistical effect, the authors could state this in the footnote - “did not contribute
strongly to the models” is ambiguous as to significance.
- Vocabulary scores did not significantly influence the results. We have changed the
phrasing accordingly. Because the function drop1 cannot deal with missing data but
provides a good method to evaluate the main effects and interactions, we decided to
keep the models without the vocabulary score. Note however, that they are part of
the dataset on OSF.
Discussion
9) In places I found the flow of the discussion difficult to follow: dynamic systems
approaches and multimodal input are introduced on page 12, followed by the
Gogate/Hollich Emergentist Coalition Model, followed by auditory overshadowing (see my
next comment on this section), followed by dynamic systems and multimodal input,
ollowed by dynamic systems again. The authors also bring in active learning; although this is
an important field I feel mentioning it here muddies the water, as this study used a non-
naturalistic design. Overall, subheadings would help to make the line of argument clearer
- Thank you for this comment. We have now reorganized the discussion and hope that
the argumentation is now clearer.
10) On pages 12-13 the authors talk about salience of language over actions and argue that
“from a certain age” words are more salient than actions. Are they referring to their 30-
month-olds here, and is the claim that language is less salient for younger children? How
does this relate to the auditory overshadowing effects shown in infants (e.g., Robinson &
Sloutsky, 2007)? Given the relevance of the auditory overshadowing literature to the
discussion in this paragraph it would be helpful to have more detail.
- This is a very important point. We have now extended this section and discuss our
results with regard to auditory overshadowing in more detail.
Minor points
Abstract:
“exacerbate” -> “hinder”
- We have now changed this sentence to “This type of additional information in the
context might influence young children's word learning.” to incorporate all possible
directions in which the influence could go.
Ages: present ranges for all age groups, or months for all age groups; be consistent with use
of months versus years
- We have now changed it to months for all age groups.
p.2, l.34: “Temporal alignment of actions accompanying caregiver speech is around 76%
during year 1 [4] and have already been shown to accompany 2-year-old children’s speech
10].” This sentence isn’t clear; perhaps “…and 2-year-old children accompany their own
speech with actions”
- We have now included your version of the sentence in the manuscript.
p.2, l.42: “Young infants seem to benefit from multimodal input when, for example, they
were presented” – tenses are mixed here
- We have now changed the beginning of this paragraph: “The high co-occurrence of
words and actions in the input of the child might be accompanied by cross-domain
influences between words and actions. Indeed, studies have shown that young
infants seem to benefit from multimodal input when learning novel words.” We then
continue with the review of the literature.
p.2, l.56: an example of what these authors considered a referential action to be would be
helpful
- We have now added an example from their paper.
p.3, l.10: “Language can also facilitate the comparison of actions already in 10-month-olds” –
“in infants as young as 10 months” would work better than “already in 10-month-olds”
similar comment applies to uses of “already in X-month-olds” elsewhere)
- We have now changed both sentences.
p.3, l.30: “studies have shown that consistency in form of the same location associations” ->
“studies have shown that consistency in referent location”
- We have now changed this sentence accordingly.
p.3, l.54: “although 30-month-olds would learn labels” -> “although 30-month-olds learned
abels”
- We have now changed this sentence accordingly.
p.4, l.27: “passed” -> “past”
- We have now replaced “passed” with “past”.
p.4, l.28: “does not influence” -> “would not influence”
- We have now replaced “does” with “would”.
p. 6, l.46: “For the test phase, it was coded” -> “For the test phase, we coded”
- We have now changed this sentence accordingly.
p.7, l.14 “childrenâ<U+02D8>AZ´ s”: something’s gone wrong with formatting here
- We fixed the formatting.
p.7, l.50: “If, however, they look to the correct target during the time” – I wasn’t clear what
his sentence meant
- We rephrased this sentence and hope it is now clearer: “If the participants do
recognise the target upon hearing its label, we would expect a quadratic- or quartic-
shaped curve, reflecting how participants’ fixations are intially at chance level (prior
to hearing the label), increasing towards to the target upon hearing its label, and
then going back to chance level (dark blue).”
Figure 4: “Time from label onset” would be clearer as the figure caption
- We thought that “time from label onset” would be misleading since we exclude the
data up to 240 ms after label onset to allow for the initiation of a fixation (e.g.,
Swingley et al., 1999).
p.12, l.35: “a word and an object might seem arbitrary”: this isn’t clear; perhaps “a word and
an object might seem unrelated”
- We have now changed this sentence accordingly.
p.12, l.58: “auditory words, and language in particular, may be more salient”: this suggests
hat language is part of words, rather than words being part of language… “words may be
more salient” would work better.
- We have now changed this sentence accordingly.
p.13, l. 9: “Of interest is also the difference” -> “Also of interest is the difference”
- We have now changed this sentence accordingly.
p.13, l.21: the mention of the water wheel comes out of the blue
- We have rephrased this sentence now by leaving the water wheel out and focusing
on the contrast between familiar and novel objects: “Notably here, the 14-month-
olds were presumably already familiar with images of the dog and the truck and only
had to learn the mapping between the novel object and its label, and it is likely that
this increased familiarity with the objects may have led to children mapping the
words onto these objects with greater ease”.
Reviewer 2
Here are my comments, I certainly believe your work has merit. I particularly like the growth
model curve analyses, which make a lot of sense developmentally. However it my analysis
hat Some major revisions are necessary:
Using zscores and median when comparing children and adults for first ANOVA. I also did not
see anything in the results or discussion on the particular point of residual analysis that
violated the homogeneity constraint, nor whether you had any power analysis results.
Clarifying hand guided movements and representational actions (gestures), removing the
abbit example.
Situating your work compared to Gogate’s, you are not doing Pucini et al.’s (gestures)
Adding new hypotheses in the discussion.
- Thank you for your detailed review of our work! We think your comments improved
our work and the manuscript substantially.
Below are in-text my comments:
ntroduction
Page 2
Line 12: this sentence seems like an overgeneralization to me. Depending on context,
ndividual differences, samples, the numbers will change. I suggest to add ‘in the context of
he studies of XYZ’, ...
- We have now changed this sentence to “In a study by Gogate and colleagues,
temporal alignment of parental language and actions in naming events was around
76% for preverbal infants, underscoring the co-occurrence of speech and action in
early communication with infants”.
s this a new method? Is this a modification of a method? Please reference in first
paragraph!
- We have now added the preferential looking paradigm as a reference here.
Line 29: we do not know if the pace are similar, generalization here. May be say that they
also rapidly learn actions...
- We have now changed the sentence to “Similarly, infants display rapid development
in the action domain from early on”.
Lines 30-33: it is one study with star fish shape only (not very ecologically valid) and p at
048. So may be say that a first study using star fish actions suggest that 7 to 9 month olds
preferred looking at... than at... , which the authors interpreted as statistical learning.
- We have now removed the sentence and the reference because, as you note, this
might reflect weak evidence of infants’ action segmentation and it is not relevant for
our argumentation.
Line 35: again, overgeneralization, rephrase.
- We have now changed this sentence to “as mentioned above, Gogate and colleagues
found in their study that temporal alignment of actions accompanying caregiver
speech was around 76% during year 1”.
Line 54-56: in the study cited, they used representational gestures (symbolic) not
movements like Gogate’s. It should be distinguished throughout the paper whether you are
alking about gestures or actions or it gets confusing. May be define the terminology you are
going to use: actions, movements, gestures...
- We wanted to avoid going into the gestures/actions literature because this would
require opening up an entire field which is somewhat tangential to the actions under
study. But we have now made it clear in the manuscript whenever we talk about
gestures (which is only in the context of the Puccini & Liszkowski study).
Page 3
First paragraph: use ‘may’ rather ‘can ‘ or results suggest that under certain circumstances,
children can...
- We have now changed “can” to “may”.
Do you consider your ‘actions’ Hopping and wiggling ears for rabbits, just as gestures
conventionalized ones) ?
ustification of choice. There is a confusion here for the reader as the experimenter move
he tani and löcki whole body = activated movements but the example (hopping and
wiggling) provided is about gestures. May be use Gogate examples, that are also about
activated movements by a hand.
- We have now clarified here that we refer to manipulation of objects, i.e., parents
making the rabbit hop or wiggling its ears rather than a hopping or wiggling gesture
performed in the absence of the object.
Line 44 and next: Presenting variability separated from consistency is one way to do it,
however literature shows that both are necessary and possibly in interaction, may be
suggest this. I believe it is is what you did as you have a within design.
- We totally agree and have now added a paragraph on the importance of both
aspects for learning.
Page 4:
Results should not be mixed with hypotheses and so remove line 30-31 and
Add a paragraph on why you selected 18 month olds, and 30 month olds and 3 to 4 year olds
based on the literature.
- We chose 18-month-olds and 30-month-olds to capture children on either side of the
vocabulary spurt. 3- to 4-year-olds were added on later following the results of the
30-month-olds. We have now rephrased this in the manuscript.

- We have now changed “who” to “whom”.

- We have now fixed the formatting issue here.
Design: line 11 please report that it is a between participants design. Anova, etc ... your DV is

- We have now rephrased this aspect and hope that it is clearer.
Please indicate if you had power measure
- There are few comparable studies looking at children’s learning of words with
simultaneously presented actions. Studies do exist with regard to the influence of
variability on learning but these appear to be underpowered (e.g., Twomey, Ma &
Westermann, 2017). We therefore did not have a suitable prior on which to base the
power analyses. We therefore decided to test a higher number of children than usual
relative to earlier studies, aiming for at least 24 children per condition per age-group.
You are testing consistency and variability independently but children are also exposed to
hose concomitantly, why did you not consider this, justify.
- We needed to have at least two objects per condition to ensure that we could
account for object preferences in our data. Were the design to be a within-subjects
design this would have required children to learn 4 novel-word object associations
with four different actions presented in the task. We believed this to be too
demanding for the age-ranges tested here and decided instead to focus on learning
across conditions.
Table 1, what is the unit of measure?
Why is the mean 000, I do not understand these numbers, are they zscores?
- The scores are averaged proportional target looking scores, that have been corrected
for participants’ looking behavior in the baseline phase. Thus, 0 refers to no changes
from the baseline phase. We have now added a sentence to the table caption to
facilitate the interpretation of these values: “Scores of 0 reflect that averaged target
looking is at chance level, any values above 0 reflect target looking, and values below
0 reflect distractor looking“.

Line 53. You start with a theoretical model and then go to ‘in practice’. Do you have any
eferences to provide for the ‘in practice’? for adults and children? I like the graph, very
useful.
- We are very glad you like the graph. We have now added Mirman et al., 2008 as a
reference for the adults and Von Holzen et al., 2019 as a reference for the children.
Add a reference for adding a participant id as random factor.
- We have now added Mirman, 2014 as a reference here.
The controls are well thought of and explained.
- Thank you!
As are the linear, quadratic and cubic function of time and also target fixation patterns.
- Thanks again.
Homogeneity violated in residuals.
- Homogeneity was indeed an issue in our analysis, and can often be a problem for
looking time data. We transformed our data to log values because this can help to
address the issue. However, the problem of homogeneity still remained. We
therefore decided to analyse our data without the data transformation but also note
that the results have to be interpreted with care.
Line 49 ? power calculations undertaken to ensure that sample sizes were adequate to test
he hypothesis considered; are these zscores? They should be, may be use median rather
han mean for outliers in zscores.
- There are few comparable studies looking at children’s learning of words with
simultaneously presented actions. Studies do exist with regard to the influence of
variability on learning but these appear to be underpowered (e.g., Twomey, Ma &
Westermann, 2017). We therefore did not have a suitable prior on which to base the
power analyses. We therefore decided to test a higher number of children than usual
relative to earlier studies, aiming for at least 24 children per condition per age-group.
The results are well explained and provide an interesting developmental comparison.
- Thank you! We are glad that the coherences are clear.
t would be important to check the results with your entire data [including the removed
data] to see if what you had removed would change the results.
- We have analysed the data again including all outliers, and overall, the results remain
the same. Sometimes, p-values are even lower than in the current analysis since
mean looking scores that are higher than 2SD above the average are excluded from
the reported analysis and may bias the results when not excluded. We are therefore
confident that the results are not driven by our exclusion criteria. Indeed, all the data
are available on OSF should someone wish to analyse the data in a different way.
Discussion
n Gogate, the setting was quite different a real world situation, with a mom and a 3D object
n a meaningful a playful setting. So comparisons may not be granted here, and is another
hypothesis as to why you did not find an effect besides the background hypothesis in
younger children.
You may want to cite references having found issue with learning from screen, TV, ... in
oddlers maybe P. Kuhl: learning from social experience?
- Thank you for suggesting this alternative hypothesis. We have now included it in our
paragraph on the 18-month-olds’ difficulties to learn words in our setting.
Line 45: Children also learn word independent of action, these are called conventions!
Overgeneralization.
- We now explicitly state that this is meant in the context of our study.
Line 46: you cannot use stage with dynamic systems, it is antinomic. You can use
developmental time instead (because of individual differences).
- Thank you for highlighting this. We have now changed this sentence to “In terms of a
dynamic systems account, this development reflects how the interaction between
the learner and the complexity of the multimodal environment plays a role in shaping
the learning experience”.
