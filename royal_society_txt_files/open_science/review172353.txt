Jennifer Johnson and Simon Durrant present a study about the effect of cathodal transcranial
direct current stimulation during REM sleep on memory performance.
15 healthy subjects with a mean age of 21 years were studied.
The main result was an improvement of neutral declarative memory (word list recognition task)
when CtDCS was applied with a frequency of 0.75 Hz.
This is an interesting and well written paper. Introduction and Discussion are of great length.
I only have three minor questions:
Page 2 line 16: “slow oscillations dominate slow wave sleep” Is Ref. 9 (Prehn-Kristensen et al.) a
correct reference for this?
Page 10 line 31: Why are not the raw values given?
Page 18 line 25: “boosting SO activity”: Is this confirmed by the results, because spectral power
analyses revealed no differences?

Sleep plays a key role on memory consolidation and over the years different frameworks have
been proposed on how different sleep rhythms relate to different memory types: For declarative,
hippocampal dependent memories slow oscillations with phase-locked spindles and ripples
3
during deep sleep are essential. Emotional memories on the other hand appear to be driven by
theta oscillations during REM sleep. Lastly, evidence suggests the consolidation of procedural
memories underlies sleep spindles. An important tool to examine the causality between brain
rhythms and memory is brain stimulation. In the present work, Johnson et al. apply cathodal
tDCS, i.e. a non-invasive electrical stimulation alternating between zero and a negative maximal
amplitude, to examine how slow oscillations and theta influence the performance on an
emotional recognition and serial reaction time task. The authors found that stimulation
mimicking slow oscillations improves recognition of neutral memories whereas theta stimulation
showed no effect on any behavioural measure.
Given the controversy surrounding the replicability of the seminal tDCS finding by Marshall in
2006, I am very critical (perhaps too much) on any tDCS findings without proper control
conditions. In this case, the authors have mixed two important aspects: SO stimulation in NREM
vs. REM and asymmetric theta stimulation. Controlling for this aspects might have allowed a
better interpretation of these results. However, the improvement of neutral recognition is
intriguing and indeed, the effects of brain stimulation during sleep on emotional memories have
not been studied extensively. That said, I have several critical comments regarding the methods
and concepts behind this study, which is why I am very hesitant to give my full support for a
publication as of now.
Major comments
- Design: What puzzled me the most is the rational to stimulate SO in during REM sleep. NREM
and REM sleep differ strongly not only in brain patterns, i.e. SO occur per definition not in REM,
but also in endocrine milieus. What was the hypothesis driving this approach. This is very
important, not only because a paper is cited that didn’t show any effect of tDCS on neutral
memory in REM, but for any future application. Does this mean that the brain is more susceptible
to memory reactivation during REM than NREM? As mentioned before a control condition
comparing 0.75-Hz stimulation during NREM would have been more appropriate.
- Stimulation
(a) Why did the authors place the anodal electrode on the contralateral forearm, despite the two
citied papers on page 6, line 57 referring to reference electrodes on the head? Aiming for an
asymmetric stimulation pattern, it is not clear how much of the stimulation did spread into the
contralateral (i.e. left) hemisphere, which might explain the absent effects for the theta condition.
To ensure a stronger asymmetry mastoid reference might have been better and to test the
valence-specificity a control condition swapping the hemisphere would be more meaningful.
(b) I am even more concerned whether the stimulation really occurred during REM sleep. In most
other works applying oscillating or pulsating tDCS stimulation was performed block-wise this
would allow to check the current sleep stage after each block. The authors assume they
continuously stimulated REM or they later stated that 0.75 Hz stimulation periods should be
scored as SWS. Did the authors at least check the sleep stage after stimulation was stopped? Did
subjects still show signs of REM sleep? This is very important for the interpretation of the results.
- Emotional memory task: I am a bit hesitant to refer to the findings on the emotional word task
as declarative memory. In my view, the authors are rather probing recognition memory and a
real interpretation of declarative memory is not possible as a baseline before sleep is missing. Can
the authors perhaps comment on this?
- Analysis:
(a) The sleep architecture analysis were very confusing with regard to the inclusion or exclusion
of the stimulation period. Stimulation artefacts hamper the scoring and, related to my previous
comment, the author assume REM or SWS (see. P. 15, line 13) but this is all speculative.
Furthermore, theta rhythm is not a necessary criterion to score REM sleep in humans, but wake-
4
like EEG patterns, rapid eye-movements and low EMG are. I would advise the authors to simply
exclude the stimulation period from all analysis, but importantly an equivalent period needs to
be discarded for the Sham condition as well. Judging Table 1 this was not done which will
influence any comparison with this condition.
(b) The authors nicely analysed SWA and theta and power in REM sleep and basically ruled out
any cumulative effects. Besides the fact that SWA should not be so dominant in REM sleep, the
subsequent SWS is totally ignored, but might affect the behavioural results as well.
(c) It would make it much easier for the reader to understand the enormous amount of results if
they are all shown as bar graphs similar to Figure 4.
(d) The reporting of trends as not significant or marginal is not consistent. In particular, on page
10, line 29, a p-value of 0.21 is interpreted as marginally significant while in line 10 on the same
page an identical value is reported as non-significant. Consistent interpretation would mean the
neutral word finding (in terms of an ANOVA interaction) is questionable.
Minor Comments:
- I am sorry, if I am too blunt, but Figure 1 and 2 need a massive overhaul. Instead of showing the
full not-readable instructions please simplify the task design. In Figure 1 it could be indicated that
the “rkn” response is only shown during recognition post sleep. Figure 2 gives no clue on how
the SRTT works. It strangely suggests the Practice and Transfer block only involve a screen with
instructions.
- Some analysis of the SRTT confused me. There are many comparisons between control and
transfer blocks. For instance, before sleep 2 control blocks were performed at the end. Were these
averaged? Did subjects learn the same control and transfer sequence before and after sleep? Why
was on page 11 the accuracy reported as differences but the RT not?
- Page 16, line 28: Which general memory improvements are meant here?

15 healthy subjects with a mean age of 21 years were studied.
The main result was an improvement of neutral declarative memory (word list

This is an interesting and well written paper. Introduction and Discussion are of great
length
Many thanks for taking the time to review our paper; we greatly appreciate it.
I only have three minor questions:
Page 2 line 16: “slow oscillations dominate slow wave sleep” Is Ref. 9 (Prehn-
Kristensen et al.) a correct reference for this?
Well spotted; we inserted the wrong reference there. We have now replaced it with a
more appropriate one from Steriade and Timofeev (2003).
Page 10 line 31: Why are not the raw values given?
On p.10 line 31, we report the interaction. The raw values (i.e. of the dependent
variable at each level of the factors) are actually given for that, but in the following
two sentences on p.10 lines 33-38, in the context of the follow-up pairwise
comparisons. These are the same values that are involved in the interaction, hence
we have only given them once, in that context.
Page 18 line 25: “boosting SO activity”: Is this confirmed by the results, because
spectral power analyses revealed no differences?
This is a fair point. We have reworded this to clarify that we meant increased activity
within the SO band, during the 0.75 Hz stimulation period.

Reviewer #2
Sleep plays a key role on memory consolidation and over the years different
frameworks have been proposed on how different sleep rhythms relate to different
memory types: For declarative, hippocampal dependent memories slow oscillations
with phase-locked spindles and ripples during deep sleep are essential. Emotional
memories on the other hand appear to be driven by theta oscillations during REM
sleep. Lastly, evidence suggests the consolidation of procedural memories underlies
sleep spindles. An important tool to examine the causality between brain rhythms
and memory is brain stimulation. In the present work, Johnson et al. apply cathodal
tDCS, i.e. a non-invasive electrical stimulation alternating between zero and a
negative maximal amplitude, to examine how slow oscillations and theta influence
the performance on an emotional recognition and serial reaction time task. The
authors found that stimulation mimicking slow oscillations improves recognition of
neutral memories whereas theta stimulation showed no effect on any behavioural
measure.
Given the controversy surrounding the replicability of the seminal tDCS finding by
Marshall in 2006, I am very critical (perhaps too much) on any tDCS findings without
proper control conditions. In this case, the authors have mixed two important
aspects: SO stimulation in NREM vs. REM and asymmetric theta stimulation.
Controlling for this aspects might have allowed a better interpretation of these
results. However, the improvement of neutral recognition is intriguing and indeed, the
effects of brain stimulation during sleep on emotional memories have not been
studied extensively. That said, I have several critical comments regarding the
methods and concepts behind this study, which is why I am very hesitant to give my
full support for a publication as of now.
Many thanks for taking the time to review our paper, and for your many detailed
comments below; we are very grateful. We understand that tDCS results - including
those of Marshall from 2006 - often suffer from problems of replication, though of
course this is part of a much wider problem in cognitive neuroscience as discussed
extensively in recent literature. We fully subscribe to the need for rigorous scrutiny
and scientific standards. It’s worth noting, however, that one of the principal driving
forces behind problems with replication is that non-significant findings, or findings
that deviate from previous high-profile papers, are often treated as unpublishable, so
only the original findings ever see the light of day. This is one of the reasons we are
very keen, subject to the rigorous peer review that you have provided, that our work
should be published and made available for other researchers in the field to view,
judge for themselves and add to their overall evidence base when evaluating the
effects of tDCS during sleep.
Major comments
- Design: What puzzled me the most is the rational to stimulate SO in during REM
sleep. NREM and REM sleep differ strongly not only in brain patterns, i.e. SO occur
per definition not in REM, but also in endocrine milieus. What was the hypothesis
driving this approach. This is very important, not only because a paper is cited that
didn’t show any effect of tDCS on neutral memory in REM, but for any future
application. Does this mean that the brain is more susceptible to memory
reactivation during REM than NREM? As mentioned before a control condition
comparing 0.75-Hz stimulation during NREM would have been more appropriate.
This is a fundamental design question which is important for all research using tDCS
during sleep. There are really three parts to the question: why stimulate at a given
frequency, why stimulate in a given sleep stage, and what is an appropriate control
condition. The answers to the first two questions are interrelated: there is a lot of
evidence that REM sleep is involved in emotional memory consolidation (see van der
Helm & Walker, 2011, for a brief summary of early evidence and concepts), and in
particular theta activity during REM sleep in particular is involved in emotional
memory consolidation (see the recent review by Hutchison & Rathore, 2015). Any
study that seeks to manipulate emotional memory consolidation through tDCS,
therefore, must include theta stimulation during REM sleep as one of its main
conditions. This point was noted by Barham et al. (2016) in their meta-analysis of
transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) studies involving sleep (and which includes
mainly tDCS), who said explicitly “Future studies should investigate whether TES
administered during REM sleep can modulate learning emotional information.”
(p.75). We have done exactly this.
That leaves the key question of why SO stimulation during REM sleep was used as
the second condition in our study and the key reason is that it ensures that the only
difference between the conditions is the stimulation frequency; in our view this is
essential to function as a proper control. As the reviewer rightly points out,
neurochemistry is substantially different between REM and SWS. If we compared
SO stimulation during NREM with theta stimulation during REM and found an effect,
it would not be possible to tell if the effect was due to the stimulation frequency, or
the sleep stage in which the stimulation took place because these would be entirely
confounded. Although there is undoubtedly an inherent relationship there – we do
not disagree with this and this might lead to the idea that SO stimulation should
always be in NREM - from a design perspective it is essential that these factors are
separated. In our design, if a difference is found, it must be due to the different
stimulation frequency within REM; it cannot be due to stimulation in different sleep
stages. A follow-up investigation of the mechanism might well need to consider
additional control conditions in other sleep stages in order to see if it is only the
stimulation frequency, or if sleep stage also has an effect, or indeed if they interact,
but in our view the difference must first be established in a direct non-confounded
comparison and that is what we have attempted to do. This does not necessarily
mean that we believe the brain is more susceptible to reactivation during REM than
NREM sleep; although there is some evidence for reactivation in REM (e.g. Louie &
Wilson, 2001; Sterpenich et al., 2014) , the evidence is somewhat stronger for
NREM (see, for example, O’Neill, Pleydell-Bouverie, Dupret, & Csicsvari, 2010).
Rather, it a choice based on the relevance of a sleep stage to our research question
followed by the choice of a suitable control.
It is also worth noting that previous researchers have also done this; Marshall et al.
(2006), for example, as cited by the reviewer, stimulated at SO and theta power in
the same sleep stage, which in that case was SWS, and their reasoning for doing
seemed to be broadly similar to ours. The only non-confounded alternative is to
stimulate at the same frequency in different sleep stages, as done by Marshall et al.
(2011) when using theta stimulations in REM and NREM sleep, but of course this
has the same issue of stimulating at a frequency that is not the natural prevailing
frequency of that stage, so it is not clear what the advantage of this would be.
As this was not made entirely clear previously, we have now added a more succinct
version of our reasoning here to the end of the Introduction:-
“We chose to stimulate at theta frequency (5Hz) during REM sleep,
as suggested by [28], because theta oscillations during REM sleep
have been implicated in emotional memory consolidation [17]. In
order to evaluate the specificity of stimulation at the theta frequency,
we also stimulated at SO frequency (0.75Hz), as well as having a
sham stimulation condition. The 0.75Hz stimulation was also during
REM sleep rather than NREM sleep in which SOs usually occur in
order to avoid confounding stimulation frequency and sleep stage
and ensure that the comparison was specific to frequency
differences. This is similar to the approach adopted by [44] who
stimulated at two different frequencies during NREM sleep.” (p.4)
- Stimulation
(a) Why did the authors place the anodal electrode on the contralateral forearm,
despite the two citied papers on page 6, line 57 referring to reference electrodes on
the head? Aiming for an asymmetric stimulation pattern, it is not clear how much of
the stimulation did spread into the contralateral (i.e. left) hemisphere, which might
explain the absent effects for the theta condition. To ensure a stronger asymmetry
mastoid reference might have been better and to test the valence-specificity a
control condition swapping the hemisphere would be more meaningful.
There are two questions here: why use a contralateral location and why use an arm
rather than a scalp electrode. We will address both of these. The question of
electrode placement in tDCS is an ongoing one in the literature (Woods et al., 2016),
with many different montages being used and different results being reported. In
general, the lateralisation and pattern of current distribution is primarily determined
by the site of the stimulating electrode (e.g. Woods, Bryant, Sacchetti, Gervits, &
Hamilton, 2015) while the lateralisation of the reference may show less influence on
the results (e.g. Ellison, Ball, & Lane, 2017). Nevertheless there is evidence that
using an electrode elsewhere on the scalp can lead to unexpected results, This has
led Reinhardt et al. (2017) to comment: "However, none of locations on the head,
including the cheek, provide a perfect location without any influence on unintended
brain regions" (p.9), and suggest that "some groups use the upper arm relative to a
location on the head and have found that it does not result in complications involving
the brainstem or spine (e.g., Clark et al., 2012). This many be an attractive location
for the other electrode in tDCS that does not put another cortical area in a region of
high current intensity" (p.10).
In sleep studies there is an additional complication in that the mastoids are generally
used as EEG reference locations (as they were in ours) and orbital locations are use
for detecting eye movements in REM sleep which was important for our study.
Placing a tDCS electrode at either of these locations, which are the most common
scalp reference locations, was therefore not possible. This was a particular
complication for us because we were using a small cathodal electrode in order to
create a more localised focal stimulation, but consequently had a much larger
reference electrode than is usually encountered in sleep studies; this would again
have made a scalp electrode much more problematic in terms of both interference
and reduced control of current distribution. These two arguments together made the
upper arm a much more attractive location to use and we remain convinced this was
the correct choice. When an arm reference electrode and a frontal lateralised
stimulation electrode are used, and in particular when deep brain structures such as
the amygdala may need to be reached, an ipsilateral electrode location is not a
viable proposition because current tends to flow on the lateral surface and down into
the arm, which reduces the signal strength going into the rest of the brain. Without
increasing stimulation to dangerous levels, the only viable option is to reference
contralaterally, which is what we did. We fully acknowledge that this will have led to
a reduction in hemispheric asymmetry and we are happy to acknowledge this as a
limitation in some new text in which we also briefly provide our reasoning for our
choice of electrode (see below). It is finally worth noting that the two papers
mentioned are cited within a sentence about the choice of maximum current density
that is safe and appropriate for the task; we are not citing them in reference to the
electrode placement. Our new text which discussed the electrode placement is as
follows:
“The small cathodal electrode was placed on F4 in order to create
focal stimulation in the right hemisphere. However, the anodal
electrode was consequently too large (in order to maintain a safe
current level [54]) to be placed near the EEG reference electrodes at
the mastoids or the EOG electrodes in frontal orbital locations,
without undue interference. Instead, as suggested by [57], we used
an arm electrode in order to avoid unknown effects of stimulation
from a large reference elsewhere on the scalp. This needed to be
placed contralaterally in order to provide sufficient stimulation to grey
matter which would not be achieved with safe levels of stimulation
with the relative locations of our front lateral cathodal electrode and
ipsilateral arm electrode. It should be noted, however, that this is
likely to have decreased asymmetry in activation in comparison to an
ipsilateral electrode.” (p.7)
(b) I am even more concerned whether the stimulation really occurred during REM
sleep. In most other works applying oscillating or pulsating tDCS stimulation was
performed block-wise this would allow to check the current sleep stage after each
block. The authors assume they continuously stimulated REM or they later stated
that 0.75 Hz stimulation periods should be scored as SWS. Did the authors at least
check the sleep stage after stimulation was stopped? Did subjects still show signs of
REM sleep? This is very important for the interpretation of the results.
This is indeed an important point which goes to the question of the design of this
type of study. The approach in previous studies has notably varied; for example, in
the original Marshall et al. (2004) study a 15s-on-15s-off approach was taken, while
Marshall et al. (2006) uses a 5-minute on, 1-minute off approach. The reliability of
sleep scoring during these short intervals is questionable (residual effects of
stimulation were noted during the 1-minute intervals), so the benefit of this approach
is unclear. The downside, however, is certainly clear: if participants show signs
(reliable or otherwise) of leaving the sleep stage in question, stimulation must cease
early and this creates a different pattern, or even worse a different duration, of
stimulation across participants, potentially confounded with different conditions.
More recent studies, such as Nitsche (2010) have therefore, like us, adopted a
continuous stimulation protocol instead and utilised the fact that the second period of
REM sleep has an average duration of over 30 minutes (Boukadoum & Ktonas,
1988) and so stimulation during this period is likely to be during what is
predominantly if not exclusively REM sleep. This is the approach we took.
We can, as the reviewer has pointed out, check the sleep stage at the end of
stimulation to see if participants were still in REM after the stimulation stopped, and
indeed we had checked this. On 37 out of 45 nights participants were still in REM
sleep beyond the end of the stimulation period (we have added this to the
manuscript); the nights in which another sleep stage was present after stimulation
were evenly distributed over the three conditions (3-2-3 for 5Hz, 0.75Hz and Sham
respectively), and came exclusively from four participants. Since all participants
were in REM sleep at the end of at least one stimulation period, all participants were
reliably in REM at the start of the stimulation period and expected to remain so for a
reasonable duration, and most participants were still in REM sleep beyond the end of
the stimulation period on all three nights, we feel that the technique worked well and
it is better for consistency and comparability to report data from all of the
participants. However, to check the validity of our findings we did also run the main
analysis with only the 11 participants who were still in REM sleep at the end of the
stimulation period on all three nights, and the enhanced neutral memory result was
very similar, with in fact a slightly stronger effect size (F(4,40)=2.42, p=0.06,
<U+03B7>p¬2=0.20 for just the 11 participants, compared to F(4,56)=2.47, p=0.06,
<U+03B7>p¬2=0.15 with all 15 participants as reported in the manuscript). The pattern was
similarly not different for any of other results when using only the 11 participants
either (i.e. no result that was significant became non-significant, or vice-versa), so
we feel justified in reporting the data from all 15 participants. We have, however,
acknowledged this issue, and briefly presented our reasoning and the above
information during the stimulation section in the Methods:-
“The use of a continuous stimulation period, similar to that used by
[56], was chosen to ensure a stable block of stimulation which did not
vary by structure or duration across participants. This is predicated
on the assumption, however, that REM sleep continues through the
stimulation period. This assumption by the continued presence of
REM sleep after the end of stimulation on 37 out of the 45
experimental nights; the 8 nights in which REM ended during the
stimulation were evenly split across the 5Hz, 0.75Hz and Sham
conditions (3-2-3) and exclusively in four participants. As all
participants started stimulation during REM and ended at least one
night during REM (and most all three nights), and as the pattern of
results did not vary at all when the analysis was restricted to just the
11 participants who remained in REM throughout stimulation, data
from all 15 participants is presented throughout.” (p.7)
So in summary: there is a valid reason to use continuous stimulation, our approach
worked in that for the vast majority of nights participants were still in REM sleep after
the end of stimulation, all of our participants had the same amount of stimulation
avoiding potential confounds, and that even excluding the participants who were not
still in REM on all three nights, the pattern of our results remains unchanged.
- Emotional memory task: I am a bit hesitant to refer to the findings on the emotional
word task as declarative memory. In my view, the authors are rather probing
recognition memory and a real interpretation of declarative memory is not possible
as a baseline before sleep is missing. Can the authors perhaps comment on this?
We certainly agree that this is a recognition memory task and indeed we have
labelled it as such in the paper (e.g. the subheading in the Methods section); we
have no hesitation in saying that. In current standard memory taxonomy (e.g.
(Squire, 2004)), recognition memory is still classified as a form of declarative
memory (in the sense of an over-arching duality between declarative and non-
declarative memory), even if participants cannot verbalise their response. In the
RKN task that we use, both recollection and familiarity are regarded as components
of episodic memory (Yonelinas, 2001), so we have no hesitation in stating that our
recognition memory task tests declarative memory (in the standard taxonomy, and
this is all we mean by declarative). The absence of a baseline before sleep does not
inherently change the classification in our view (the task remains a recognition
memory task probing episodic memory, in this case for emotional and neutral
memories). We believe it is important to use both recognition memory and
declarative memory terminology throughout the paper, as we have done, in order to
connect to the wide literature on the consolidation of these forms of memory more
broadly. For example, the recent review of the literature around tDCS during sleep
by Barham et al. (2016) used exactly the declarative/non-declarative distinction that
we also use (see their Table 3), and applied the term declarative to studies that used
recognition memory tasks in the way that we do.
- Analysis:
(a) The sleep architecture analysis were very confusing with regard to the inclusion
or exclusion of the stimulation period. Stimulation artefacts hamper the scoring and,
related to my previous comment, the author assume REM or SWS (see. P. 15, line
13) but this is all speculative. Furthermore, theta rhythm is not a necessary criterion
to score REM sleep in humans, but wake-like EEG patterns, rapid eye-movements
and low EMG are. I would advise the authors to simply exclude the stimulation
period from all analysis, but importantly an equivalent period needs to be discarded
for the Sham condition as well. Judging Table 1 this was not done which will
influence any comparison with this condition.
Thanks, this is a very helpful suggestion. We certainly agree that stimulation
artefacts interfere with normal sleep scoring, and therefore we have adopted the
reviewer’s suggestion and now marked all stimulation periods, and an equivalent
period (starting 4 minutes into the second REM episode) in the sham condition, as
unscored, and conducted all analyses on that basis (including spectral analyses and
sleep parameter analyses, which have all been carried out again after this change).
We have noted this in the manuscript, made the appropriate changes in the sleep
parameters analysis section and also amended Table 3 (which shows the sleep
parameters and where we also fixed one transcription error):-
“The stimulation periods were marked as unscored because the
stimulation frequency dominated the EEG during stimulation making
reliable sleep scoring impossible; an equivalent period was also
marked as unscored in the sham stimulation condition to allow valid
comparison between the conditions. All sleep-related analyses have
therefore been presented without the inclusion of the stimulation or
sham-equivalent epochs.” (p.9)
“Sleep parameter data separated by CtDCS condition are
summarised in Table 3. With standardised sleep scoring, and
excluding the unscored stimulation period from all analyses, no
differences were seen across CtDCS conditions for total sleep time,
duration of N1 sleep, duration of N2 sleep, duration of SWS, or
duration of REM sleep (all p>0.1), confirming that sleep structure was
broadly equivalent across all three stimulation conditions. This
suggests that the effect of stimulation did not significantly alter global
sleep parameters outside of the stimulation period.” (p.13)
(b) The authors nicely analysed SWA and theta and power in REM sleep and
basically ruled out any cumulative effects. Besides the fact that SWA should not be
so dominant in REM sleep, the subsequent SWS is totally ignored, but might affect
the behavioural results as well.
These are three very good points, and we have completely revamped our spectral
analysis on this basis. First, we have now focused exclusively on the post-
stimulation period and excluded stimulation (including the equivalent period in the
Sham condition) from all analyses. This is a more accurate way to examine what is
happening rather than looking at global power across the whole night. It has also,
interesting, revealed some important new findings which we have now reported and
discussed, so we are very grateful for this suggestion.
Second, as a result of that we can no longer use the global normalisation technique
which we were using (and which in retrospect we realise that we did not actually
describe in the manuscript), so we have replaced this with the much more widely
used and standard measure of relative spectral power (i.e. power in a band as a %
of total power). We hope that this will help avoid confusion and concern over the
amount of SWA reported in REM sleep, which was entirely our fault, but for the
avoidance of doubt we can confirm that our SWA and theta measures are well
aligned to previous studies. For example, Ferri et al. (2001) show that delta power
(which invariably has lower power than SWA when using AASM definitions of both
as we are) is responsible for 55-75% of spectral activity in any given epoch during
the night, including during REM sleep, a result which matches that of Zhang et al.
(2008) and Thomas et al. (2014). Similarly, the low % of theta during N3 that we
report is fully in line with the results recently reported in a rigorously controlled study
by Svetnik et al. (2017), who noted a strong effect of age, and that young adults
around the age of 20 (i.e. the age of our participants) had only around 6-8% theta
during NREM throughout the night (including N2; N3 alone would be even lower).
Different methodologies (some pure FFT, some Welch’s method, some modified
periodogram, some even still use zero-crossing), different frequency resolutions,
slightly different band definitions and different filtering regimes mean that some
variability will inevitably be seen across studies, but our values (both absolute and
relative) are certainly in line with the literature, so we are confident of both our
revised methodology and our data.
Third, we have now provided separate spectral analyses for both SWA power and
theta power in SWS as well as in REM (we only reported the latter previously).
Finally, as well as entirely rewriting the spectral analysis section in the Results, we
have expanded and clarified the section describing the methods as follows:-
“The EEGLAB toolbox for Matlab [62] was used to manually remove
artefacts in the EEG channels before spectral power was estimated
using Welch’s method with a 50% overlapping Hamming window
using 30s segments to match the scoring epoch length and a
frequency resolution of 0.2Hz [63]. Signals were high-pass filtered at
just 0.1Hz to remove the DC component without affecting SWA and
total power from 0.5Hz to 90Hz was estimated for all sleep epochs
after the period of stimulation (or equivalent period for the Sham
condition). Activation was aggregated across all available electrodes
and two bands of interest - SWA (0.5-2Hz) and theta (4-8Hz) - were
defined in line with the stimulation frequencies using standard AASM
definitions [59]. Relative power (as a % of total power) was
calculated for each band separately for both REM and SWS; power
estimation was limited to the post-stimulation sleep period in all
cases in order to focus exclusively on the part of sleep that could
have been influenced by CtDCS.
Four one-way within-subjects ANOVAs, for SWS SWA power, SWA
theta power, REM SWA power and REM theta power respectively,
were used to analyse spectral power as a function of CtDCS
condition. The relationship between spectral power and behavioural
performance was evaluated using planned Pearson’s correlations on
specific variables of interest, separately for each CtDCS condition,
based on theoretical predictions: SWA in SWS with neutral word
recognition, theta power in REM with emotional word recognition,
and both SWA in SWA and theta power in REM with AoL at retrieval.
All other combinations were also tested as unplanned correlations
with Bonferroni correction.” (p.9)
(c) It would make it much easier for the reader to understand the enormous amount
of results if they are all shown as bar graphs similar to Figure 4.
This is an excellent suggestion, and we have now included five results figures in
total, most with multiple panels, showing all of the essential data from the paper.
We believe it is important to retain the numbers as well to provide full details for
readers who want them and to aid future meta-analyses, but we are happy to help
improve understanding with these additional figures as well. The new figures follow
the structure of the Results section and show alertness, the word recognition task
results, the valence and arousal ratings, the SRTT task results and the spectral
analysis results. We have also considerably improved the formatting and visual
quality of all the figures in the paper.
(d) The reporting of trends as not significant or marginal is not consistent. In
particular, on page 10, line 29, a p-value of 0.21 is interpreted as marginally
significant while in line 10 on the same page an identical value is reported as non-
significant. Consistent interpretation would mean the neutral word finding (in terms of
an ANOVA interaction) is questionable.
Apologies; that was actually a simple mistake in copying the numbers across. We
read the correct numbers and wrote the conclusion, but then copied the numbers of
the main effect of Emotion by mistake (hence all the values were identical with that
result). We have now corrected this, and can confirm for avoidance of doubt that we
are treating all results 0.05<p<0.1 as marginally significant following the standard
convention. We would not treat p=0.21 as marginally significant.
Minor Comments:
- I am sorry, if I am too blunt, but Figure 1 and 2 need a massive overhaul. Instead of
showing the full not-readable instructions please simplify the task design. In Figure 1
it could be indicated that the “rkn” response is only shown during recognition post
sleep. Figure 2 gives no clue on how the SRTT works. It strangely suggests the
Practice and Transfer block only involve a screen with instructions.
We fully agree that these figures were really not up to standard. We have
completely redrawn them and simplified the task design as you suggest; we have
also reduced the amount of text and ensured that it is now readable and that the
resolution is significantly improved (at least in the figure file versions; the embedded
versions in the review draft may remain more problematic in that regard).
- Some analysis of the SRTT confused me. There are many comparisons between
control and transfer blocks. For instance, before sleep 2 control blocks were
performed at the end. Were these averaged? Did subjects learn the same control
and transfer sequence before and after sleep? Why was on page 11 the accuracy
reported as differences but the RT not?
All analysis focused on only the blocks of interest, which before sleep were blocks 5
and 7 (control blocks) and block 6 (transfer block), and after sleep were blocks 1 and
3 (control blocks) and block 2 (transfer block). This followed the common practice
when analysing SRTT data of ensuring that the comparison involves only control and
transfer blocks that are immediately adjacent, thus minimising the impact of learning
during the comparison blocks which can otherwise be a confounding factor. For this
reason block 8 (the second of the two control blocks performed at the end before
sleep) is not included in the analysis; its function was exclusively as part of learning
the sequence. We specified the particular control blocks of interest at the bottom of
p.11, but we appreciate it may have been unclear that these were also the only
blocks used when calculating the AoL. We have added a reminder of the blocks
used in the analysis near the start of the SRTT results section now, but more
importantly we have also now properly described the dependent measures of
interest and which control blocks were included in the analyses in the Methods
section dealing with SRTT data analysis as follows:-
“SRTT measurements included accuracy (number of correct
responses), response time (RT) and amount of learning (AoL) which
is quantified as the mean RT in the transfer blocks – mean RT in the
control blocks; hence a larger AoL represents a greater difference
between learned and unlearned RTs. All RTs above and below 3
standard deviations from the mean were removed as outliers.
All analyses focused exclusively on blocks of interest, which were the
transfer blocks (block 6 for pre-sleep sessions and block 2 for post-
sleep sessions) and the control blocks immediately adjacent to the
transfer blocks (blocks 5 and 7 for pre-sleep sessions and blocks 1
and 3 for post-sleep sessions). No other blocks were involved in the
analysis. Transfer accuracy and RT measures were averaged
across trials within the single transfer block while control accuracy
and RT measures were averaged across trials from both control
blocks of interest within a session. All measures were evaluated
using a 3 (CtDCS condition; 5Hz, 0.75Hz and Sham) x 2 (session;
pre-sleep and post-sleep) within-subjects ANOVA with Bonferroni-
corrected post-hoc t-tests where appropriate.” (p.8)
Participants learned the same control sequence before and after sleep; this is the
standard design (see, for example, Spencer et al. (2006)) necessary in order to
evaluate learning within the SRTT. If a new sequence is used instead, it would
instead measure the ability to learn something new before and after sleep, which
while interesting is a different research question. Transfer sequences were different
in order to remain unlearned and unconsolidated following the standard SRTT
design.
Finally, the accuracy and RT analyses on p.11-12 were actually the same; neither of
them were difference scores and both of them were two-way ANOVAs with the same
factors. We appreciate that our wording was somewhat unclear which may have
given the impression they were different; we have now amended the wording of both
accordingly.
“Accuracy (Figure 6A & 6B) was assessed for the control blocks of
interest as a function of each session (blocks 1 and 3 pre-sleep and
blocks 5 and 7 post-sleep) and CtDCS condition” (p.11)
“Reaction Times (RTs, shown in milliseconds; Figure 7A & 7B) were
also examined as a function of session and CtDCS condition” (p.12)
- Page 16, line 28: Which general memory improvements are meant here?
We meant SO-related memory consolidation more generally, i.e. not just as a result
of stimulation. We appreciate this was very unclear and have rewritten this sentence
to clarify our argument.
“The process of downscaling can explain why the benefits of SOs for
memory consolidation may also occur after artificial stimulation at the
SO frequency.” (p.16)

Response to Reviews
Reviewer #2
The authors have left no stone untouched for this revision and I highly appreciate
how they responded to all my comments. The revision strongly improved the
manuscript and I am happy to give my recommendation for its publication.
There is only one little suggestion, I'd like to add: It might be useful to indicate
significant results in the Figures 4 to 8 directly, in order to draw the readers attention
to them easier.
Many thanks for taking the time to review our paper; we greatly appreciate it and we
fully agree it has been strongly improved as a result. We are grateful for the
constructive nature of your previous comments, for giving us a chance to address
them and for the acknowledgement of our efforts in the revision.
The suggestion to add indicators of significant results is a good one, and we have
duly added those where possible to all of the results figures. We have also duly
amended the figure captions to explain the significance levels referred to.
