This manuscript reports on the positive selection displayed by the salivary apyrase-coding gene
of Cimex, which helps blood feeding by the bug.
The results are solid, but I disagree with the statement on Background (line 96-99) that states:
"Similar salivary proteins have been observed to be under positive selection in other blood-
feeding insects, such as soft ticks [14] and sandflies [13], and therefore may play an important role
in parasite adaptation to feeding on different host taxa."
First, reference 14 just suggests positive selection based on synonymous/non-synonymous
substitutions, which is not sufficient to exclude neutral evolution. Reference 13, on the other
hand, denies the existence of positive selection for the salivary apyrase gene of sandflies. I include
excerpts of this publication below.
The authors also failed to cite
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24237399
Where the mosquito salivary apyrase coding gene, as well as other genes, were determined to
have codons under positive selection.
The authors also expected signals of positive selection to be stronger in human-associated Cimex
populations, but found the reverse association. One possible explanation, not given in the article,
is that a population bottleneck could have occurred after the relatively recent insect association
with humans, thus decreasing genomic diversity. This could call for future work on detecting
genomic sweeps on human and non-human insect populations.
Excerpts from reference 13:
========================
We conclude that the apyrases of these Phlebotomus species, including P. ariasi, are currently
under predominantly purifying selection, not positive selection.
Positive selection among sites was detected by Random-site models, with codons 131, 132 and
145 identified but not statistically supported.
No positive selection was demonstrated for any class of exposed sites (nucleotide or calcium
binding, increased ADPase activity and putative epitopes) compared with either the other
(buried) sites or the null model of homogeneity among sites.
Furthermore, no population showed a significant departure from neutral expectation using the
associated MK and NI tests (Table 3), indicating no long-term strong positive directional or
balancing selection. The same result was obtained for a MK test of all individuals from France
and Spain (N = 419, P = 1.0, NI = 0.919) and the total data set (N = 459, P = 1.0, NI = 0.951). Type 2
errors are unlikely for the MK test applied to populations where N = 50–100 (Zhai et al. 2009;
Ochola et al. 2010).
Three tests for selection in current or recent generations (Fu & Li's D, EW and Tajima's D) showed
no significant deviation from neutral expectation in any population (Table 3), after Bonferroni
corrections for family-wise type 1 errors, thereby providing support neither for positive
directional or balancing selection nor for population expansions or selective sweeps.
3
No population test provided any support for positive directional selection, balancing selection or
selective sweeps in populations of P. ariasi associated with both geographical and environmental
variation (altitudes 100–1114 m.a.s.l.) in Europe (Fig. 1 and Table S1).
Our findings, using a combined population genetic and phylogenetic approach applied to
sandfly salivary peptides, lead us to conclude that there is an absence of contemporary positive
or balancing selection on functional and antigenic sites of the apyrase of P. ariasi.

label_comment_2
My three major concerns regarding the submitted manuscript are:
1. The short length of the nucleotide regions under consideration
2. Ascertainment bias and a lack of controls
3. Testable speculation in the discussion
The nucleotide regions amplified are ~33% and ~50% of the apyrase and nitrophorin genes,
respectively. Typically, the statistical assessment of whether a codon is under significant selection
requires knowledge of the background dN/dS. This is usually across the whole gene sequence,
here background dN/dS is based on partial fragments. The entire gene sequences could be
determined using overlapping PCR primers.
A common problem with associating genotype with phenotype is that people select a few
candidate genes form a species' genome and test those. Signs of selection are then associated to a
trait under study. There are many more genes encoded by the genomes of these Cimex parasites.
Ideally, they should all be tested in the manner described in the submitted manuscript. The real
question is how many Cimex genes have codons under selection which are associated with
specific host species? What if an alpha-tubulin gene demonstrated similar selection as the apyrase
gene? Would this invalidate the method? Here, I am not asking for the authors to sequence the
genomes of each species - though this is no longer prohibitive. Instead they should survey some
4
genes that one would expect not to be associated with host-specificity. As they have already
sequenced CO1 and EF1a, these would suffice as potential negative controls.
In the discussion, the authors speculate that codons under selection in the Cimex apyrase gene
and associated with bat could help Cimex cope with temperature fluctuations. On the speculation
scale this is definitely high. It is also testable - to a point. Structural models of apyrase exists, e.g.
1S18_A (PDB) in the PDB. If the authors sequenced a full-length Cimex apyrase, they could use
threading or other modelling techniques to generate a model of Cimex apyrase. Further
modelling would allow them to test the effect of the selected codons in maintaining structural
integrity. I appreciate that this is extra work, however, I am concerned that speculative
statements of genotype to phenotype association in the discussion will be cited as fact in later
works. This occurs all too frequently.

I wish to thank the authors for their consideration of my comments and thorough response.
I remain skeptical that the gene fragments that they've sequenced are of sufficient length to

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24237399
Where the mosquito salivary apyrase coding gene, as well as other genes, were determined to have
codons under positive selection.
Response: We modified lines 96-100 to reflect the suggestion of Reviewer 1: “Similar salivary
proteins have been observed to be under positive selection in other blood-feeding insects,
such as in mosquitoes [15], and potentially also in soft ticks [14] (but not in others, such as
sandflies [13]), and therefore may play an important role in parasite adaptation to feeding on

a population bottleneck could have occurred after the relatively recent insect association with humans,
thus decreasing genomic diversity. This could call for future work on detecting genomic sweeps on
human and non-human insect populations.
Response: We added a sentence at lines 349-352 with the suggestion made by Reviewer 1:
“Additionally, a decrease in overall genetic diversity in human-associated cimicid populations
potentially caused by recent founding events, as suggested by Booth et al. [51], could also
dampen any signal of selection on salivary protein genes in those populations.”

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
My three major concerns regarding the submitted manuscript are:
1. The short length of the nucleotide regions under consideration
2. Ascertainment bias and a lack of controls
3. Testable speculation in the discussion
The nucleotide regions amplified are ~33% and ~50% of the apyrase and nitrophorin genes,
respectively. Typically, the statistical assessment of whether a codon is under significant selection
requires knowledge of the background dN/dS. This is usually across the whole gene sequence, here
background dN/dS is based on partial fragments. The entire gene sequences could be determined using
overlapping PCR primers.
Response: We did attempt to sequence as much of each gene as possible, across all of the
specimens included in our study. Because we analyzed a number of different species, and
there were species-specific occurrences of insertions and deletions, amplifying the entire
fragment in all species was exceedingly challenging. At lines 135-140, it reads: “We designed
primers to amplify fragments of two salivary protein genes (apyrase and nitrophorin) that
have a known function that is directly linked to efficiency of blood-feeding in C. lectularius,
based on published mRNA sequences initially obtained from salivary glands of C. lectularius
[21–23]. We designed our primers to maximize the size of the resulting fragment while also
maximizing the number of specimens for which we obtained successful amplification.”
Background dN/dS of the candidate gene is used for the first step of all codon-based
analyses, where information from the candidate gene sequences and from the phylogenetic
tree (in our case, built using info from EF1a and CO1) is used to obtain a best-fitting model of
evolution. We are confident that gene fragments of a length of more than 35% of the entire
gene should be representative of the entire gene, and allow proper identification of the
correct evolutionary model for our data. In particular, we would point out that the partial
gene sequences we obtained encompass a diversity of structural elements in both proteins,
and also encompass areas in the interior and exterior of the 3D structure of the proteins. For
comparison, cited studies analyzing salivary apyrase in mosquitoes and sandflies (references
13 and 15 in the manuscript) also used partial sequences (slightly more than 50%) of the
entire coding region. We added a sentence at lines 144-146: “Resulting fragments code for a
diversity of structural elements in both proteins, and encompass areas in the interior and
exterior of the 3D structure of the proteins [27,28].”
A common problem with associating genotype with phenotype is that people select a few candidate
genes form a species' genome and test those. Signs of selection are then associated to a trait under
study. There are many more genes encoded by the genomes of these Cimex parasites. Ideally, they
should all be tested in the manner described in the submitted manuscript. The real question is how
many Cimex genes have codons under selection which are associated with specific host species? What if
an alpha-tubulin gene demonstrated similar selection as the apyrase gene? Would this invalidate the
method? Here, I am not asking for the authors to sequence the genomes of each species - though this is
no longer prohibitive. Instead they should survey some genes that one would expect not to be
associated with host-specificity. As they have already sequenced CO1 and EF1a, these would suffice as
potential negative controls.
Response: We agree with Reviewer 2 that sequencing the whole genome in each of the
specimens in our analysis would have been ideal. However, with limited resources and having
to balance the number of specimens analyzed against the amount of sequence data, we had
to focus on a few candidate genes that were known to have a direct involvement in efficiency
of blood feeding in cimicids. We also agree that using other genes that are not a priori known
to have any implication in blood feeding as a negative control is essential. For precisely this
reason, we used EF1a and CO1 gene fragments as internal controls in our analyses. We
modified a sentence to better explain the way we used information from the EF1a and CO1
gene fragments, at lines 168-171: “We used this phylogenetic tree in our analyses of
selection (see following paragraphs) as an internal negative control [32]. This procedure
maximizes the robustness of inferences about selection in candidate gene sequences (here,
apyrase and nitrophorin genes) of specimens from a variety of species.”
We also followed up on the suggestion by Reviewer 2 to perform the three codon-based
analyses on both the EF1a and the CO1 genes. To do so we had to use a Neighbor-Joining
phylogenetic tree as internal negative control (default procedure implemented in the web
version of the HyPhy package); we could not use the hypothesized species tree here because
it was built using evolutionary information from the same two genes, which would make the
analysis circular. As expected, given that EF1a and CO1 are assumed to largely behave
neutrally, we found no codon showing a significant signal of either positive or negative
selection with all three of the codon-based analyses (MEME, FEL and REL). Furthermore, no
signal of positive selection was detected by in any single one of the codon-based analyses.
We have not included these additional analyses in the manuscript however, since using CO1
and EF1a sequences to construct the species tree in the analysis of selection at the candidate
apyrase and nitrophorin genes already provides an internal negative control. Furthermore,
since the two sets of analyses were not performed using the same internal negative control it
is difficult to make a meaningful comparison.
In the discussion, the authors speculate that codons under selection in the Cimex apyrase gene and
associated with bat could help Cimex cope with temperature fluctuations. On the speculation scale this is
definitely high. It is also testable - to a point. Structural models of apyrase exists, e.g. 1S18_A (PDB) in
the PDB. If the authors sequenced a full-length Cimex apyrase, they could use threading or other
modelling techniques to generate a model of Cimex apyrase. Further modelling would allow them to test
the effect of the selected codons in maintaining structural integrity. I appreciate that this is extra work,
however, I am concerned that speculative statements of genotype to phenotype association in the
discussion will be cited as fact in later works. This occurs all too frequently.
Response: To avoid possible over-interpretation of our hypothesis related to temperature
fluctuation and protein function, we removed statements from the Discussion that were
highly speculative about the link between temperature and selection at salivary apyrase.
Furthermore, we added a sentence at lines 329-332: “However, this remains to be tested, by
measuring the effect of amino acid substitutions on variation in the 3D structure of cimicid
salivary apyrase, and by measuring the efficiency of salivary protein variants at different
temperatures.”
Below are my other suggestions that I would like carefully considered:
Figures S2 and S3 should be in the main manuscript and not the SOM.
Response: As suggested, Figures S2 and S3 are now integral to the manuscript and are now
Figures 2 and 3.
In the methods, the authors describe several software used in different ways. In the interests of
reproducible research, I would like the authors to provide a SOM file with the command line options used
each time.
Response: We agree with Reviewer 2 that reproducibility is important, and therefore we
included all information that is needed to reproduce our analyses in the manuscript. Most of
the software we used was not command line but graphical user interface (GUI) based,
therefore a SOM type file with commands would be of limited use. Instead, we have ensured
that all relevant options are described in our Methods section. We added reference 33 in the
manuscript at line 172, which is a web page describing how to build a phylogenetic species
tree with BEAST 2.4.2, written by the same authors who built the software, and that outlines
all of the options we selected in this analysis. We added the phrase “web interface of the
Hyphy 2.2.1 package” throughout the manuscript. The only analyses that were not GUI based
used two functions from packages in R 3.2.2 (analysis of variance with ‘aov’ function from the
default ‘stats’ package, and the ‘pic’ function from the ’ape’ package), which are cited in the
manuscript. These are quite simple analyses to code in R and as such we felt that providing
the code would be trivial. We hope that these changes are sufficient to answer the comment
from Reviewer 2.
Page 4 "Adaptation of parasites to their specific hosts may be reflected in patterns of variation in
parasite genes that are involved in mediating the host-parasite conflict." This general statement should
be supported with citations and/or examples.
Response: As suggested, we added two citations on line 61: “…as suggested by Mans et al.
[14] and Arcà et al. [15].”
Page 7 "Protein Data Bank, RCSB, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers and
UCSD/SDSC, United States". Please provide the PDB identifier. The rest of this should be in the citation.
See https://pdb101.rcsb.org/more/how-to-cite for the citation details.
Response: As suggested, we modified the citation for Protein Data Bank and added a PDB
identifier on line 143.
