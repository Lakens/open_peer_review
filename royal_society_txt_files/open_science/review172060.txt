The article “Behavioral elements and sensory cues involved in sexual isolation between
Drosophila melanogaster strains” presents a detailed analysis of female receptivity to males of
the same and different strains in a system where females of the Z strain are choosier than the M
strain. The authors suggest that variation in the receptivity of females is influenced by sensory
cue quantity and quality, dependent on the strain of the female.
Overall, I found some issues with clarity of the descriptions of methods and results, and have
indicated these below.
Introduction:
Line 31: “thus reinforcing”?
Methods:
Generally, the methods section would benefit from greater specificity and clarity in the
description of experiments and analysis. Sentences such as lines 92-93 and lines 138-139 are too
vague and require the reader to hunt for specifics by going back and forth between the figures,
results, and methods. This hinders clarity of the results and discussion.
Strains—are these inbred or outbred strains?
Line 80: “induce undesired pleiotropic effects”
Lines 89-90: Were the 5 periods of 10 second intervals part of the same trial, and how much time
separated each period?
Lines 112-114: is the score relative to each of the 5 periods of 10 seconds or the total time (50
seconds)? Or, if this is not the trial referenced, what is the time period for which the activity was
observed?
Lines 116-117: were the courtship periods the same for each fly pair, or did they end when the
pair mated? If the courtship periods are different lengths, how was variation in each 1/8th time
period accounted for? For example, if the pair courted for 60 minutes, each 1/8th is 7.5minutes,
but if a pair courted for 15 minutes, each 1/8th is only 1.875 minutes and it seems like more of a
particular behavior could be measured for the flies that courted for 60 versus the ones that
courted 15 minutes by virtue of the way the time is divided rather than the actual behavior of the
flies. Additionally, if each 1/8th time period is sequential for each pair, are these time periods not
non-independent? It isn’t clear if or how the ‘repeated measures’ nature of these data were
accounted for.
Line 119: I suggest “mate less frequently under darkness…”
Line 145: missing “a” before procedure.
Line 150: “Males were maintained with a small brush” is not clear. Is this meant to say “males
were held still with a small brush”?
Results:
Lines 192-194: How do you interpret the similarity between AL and Z6 females under white and
red light, respectively in Figure s2?
Line 198: Is “mating status” the status of the individual at the beginning of the experiment or the
outcome of the trial?
Lines 199-201: It appears these comparisons are based on three observations, and as behavior is
notoriously noisy, I am concerned that this result is not entirely reliable.
3
Lines 206, 207 etc: Z6 females are referred to as mating or copulating. To aid in clarity, keep the
terminology consistent throughout.
Lines 207-208: While I understand that a fly could be doing other things such as preening while
immobile, it seems like by testing % Active Time walking and immobile, the same behavior is
being tested twice in that flies can’t be walking while immobile or vice versa.
Lines 208-210: The comparison being made either isn’t sufficiently clear or the summary is stated
too generally. I don’t see a difference for preening behavior between Z6xAL pairs that mated and
Z6xZ6 pairs that did mate and that did not mate.
Line 212: I suggest “strong” rather than “high” relationship. Also, is this an inference from your
data? If so, is there a figure that can be cited here?
Line 215: Is “male courtship intensity” courtship index or a combined measure of latency and
index? It is also not clear to me why the comparison of male courtship to intact or beheaded
females is made. Is the comparison actually between males that are interacting with intact or
beheaded females?
Lines 218-220: AL males courted beheaded Z6 females under white light to an equal degree as
Z6xAL and ALxZ6 pairs under red light when the female is beheaded, correct (Fig 2b)? I don’t
think this agrees with the second part of the sentence, unless the comparison being made is more
specific. If so, please clarify.
Lines 221-223: But the same is evidently not true for beheaded females? Looking at figure s4, I
find it odd that courtship index of males with beheaded females was so high under red light.
Line 227: Is the reference for figure 2E?
Line 228: Drop “An”.
Lines 229-231: This comparison is between data shown in figure 2E and figure 2A under white
light conditions, correct? If not please clarify. Were these comparisons made by retesting the
data? Were adjustments made for multiple comparisons? This adjustment appears to have been
made for the following comparison (lines 233-235) but not the final comparison (lines 235-236).
Line 236: A summary statement would be helpful here.
Line 245: These results are specific to figure 3A, correct?
Line 262: In the figure, each of the AL females mated more often with AL males, as indicated by
the “+” in the black part of the stacked barplot, so does this statement mean that the difference
isn’t significant between male strains, or that the difference between light types within a strain
isn’t different?
Line 268: “affected” should be “affect”
Line 284-285: I agree that it appears Z6 females mated more quickly with 1 Z6 male compared to
2 Z6 males, but figure 6b shows that copulation latency 1 Z6 male is not different from 5 and 10
Z6 males.
Discussion:
Lines 320-321: I don’t know that decreased locomotor activity explains why pairs walked less so
much as these results are consistent. It isn’t clear to me why these two measures of movement
should be considered independent.
Line 332: I don’t agree with this interpretation. Unless I’m misunderstanding which comparisons
are being referenced (in which case, please clarify), according to figure 6b, 1, 5, and 10 Z6 males
had statistically indistinguishable courtship latencies, as noted by the shared “b”.
Lines 333-336: This is very unclear. It is also not obvious to me how more matings would indicate
gametic incompatibility or why this would be expected for a homotypic pair.
Lines 343-353: Much of this discussion is based on apparently three pairs, but the limitations of
the sample size is not discussed. Because behavior is highly variable, it’s possible that the
unexpected result of increased kicking is entirely due to low sample size.
Line 373: “thus affecting”?
Line 380: “are most likely acting”?
Line 407: “will consist of exploring”?
4
Figures:
Generally, because sample sizes vary so much in some cases, it would be more helpful to know
the sample size for each group. This could be accomplished by including the number within each
of the bars and boxplots presented.
Figure 1:
Line 598: Extra “in”.
In figure 1c, are all data presented as % Active Time? The second, third, and fifth look like they
are presented as proportions, which is consistent with the legend text but not with the y-axis
label.
Figure 2:
Consider reorganizing the figure layout, so that it is consistent with the layout of the other figures
(i.e. organized across columns or rows).
Figure 3:
Is the N provided for both panel a and b?
Figure 6:
It is probably worth noting either in the figure or the legend that panel D is intentionally blank.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This is a very important examination of the sexual isolation between two D. melanogaster strains
through the examination of sensory reception, and I'm surprised no one has done this before.
This paper has the potential of making significant contributions to the understanding of the role
of mate choice in incipient speciation.

However, having said that, the paper needs some work in its presentation of the results. The
experiments seem to be well done, but the results and interpretation are difficult to follow. In
general, the paper is difficult to read. Some of the issues are with grammatical difficulties and
word choice (some are pointed out below) but the specific arguments are not always clear.
Careful editing would help.
Throughout the paper I'd like to know the sample sizes for each test. Ranges are given, but
sometimes the ranges are so large (e.g. 28-186 for Figure 6 C&D) that it is meaningless. I couldn't
figure this out from the data file because the Z6 x AL data is not presented at all. It just says "no
mating" so it is not clear that any trials were conducted. In general, the data files are missing
metadata to understand what the entries are.
I wasn't able to follow the argument about the legs. The authors argue that increased preening
with the third legs is part of an acceptance behavior, but removal of the third legs results in
increased copulation of Z6 female with AL males. This seems contradictory to me. If removal of
legs increases copulation, then the legs are inhibiting copulation. Preening may be coincidental.
What is missing here is an examination of the effect of legs (and wings) on Z6 females with Z6
males. Females often kick males off and may not be able to do so in the absence of thirds legs. If
this is the case, then Z6 X Z6 copulation success should increase as well. I don't understand the
argument that kicking stimulates AL males and inhibits Z6 males. The sample size is much too
small to make any clear conclusions and the Z6 females that mated did not kick the AL males
more than they did the Z6 males with whom they mated.
The whole discussion would benefit from a revision focused on discussing the data in the order it
is presented in the results and eliminating all rehashing of the results. At the moment, the
discussion jumps from one idea to another (for example, different sensory cues are discussed
(figures 3, 4 and 6) before going back to vision (Figure 2)). Much of the discussion is about the
results and should be moved to that section; some examples are below.
Other researchers have taken the ablation approach to studying the effects of sensory reception
and signal production on mating in other species, but this is not mentioned. This has been used
to look at differences between subspecies. Some recommended papers:
Colyott et al 2016 Animal Behaviour 120:93
Giglio & Dyer 2013 Ecology and Evolution 3:365
Gleason et al 2012 Animal Behaviour 83:217
Yukilevich et al 2016 Evolution 70: 526
Specific comments:
Line 64: "eperiments" should be "experiments"
Lines 91-103: At what time of day (relevant to lights on) were the behavioral experiments
conducted?
Lines 110-112 are confusing:
1. what is an "elementary" behavior?
2. "relatively" should be "relative"
3. is this the amount of time spent on a particular behavior relative to the amount of time spent in
courtship?
Lines 104-117: How long was the observation period? Probably this varied if the pair mated, but
6
there also should a statement (e.g. from introduction of the males to copulation? What was the
total amount of time the pair was observed if the pair didn't mate?).
Line 117: Here the fact that the courtship period was divided into eight periods is introduced, but
this is not explicitly stated. I was confused about the 1/8th until reading much further in the
paper.
Line 162: Because there could be more than one pair in the whole mating chamber, make it clear
that you are writing about the focal pair and not the extra pair.
Line 165: Males were discarded, but what happened with the females?
Line 183-184: Where are the data for the individual sex activities given? The paper states that
they are correlated, but I only see a measure of activity for each pair, not for each sex.
Figure 1A: what are the sample sizes for each of these. I couldn't find this.
Figure 1 B (and elsewhere): The box and whisker plots are explained, but the x for the Z6 x AL
matings are not. I guess that there were only three of these matings and the values for each one is
displayed, but this is not explained. Again, all the sample sizes need to be included.
Lines 203-204: "Copulating females of the two pairs increased the duration of head preening…" It
is not possible to determine this from the information presented. Of the preening time, more of it
was spent in head preening-this is not necessarily a duration measure.
Lines 217-219 (and elsewhere): Some comparison statements are confusing, such as "Compared to
other pairs, Z6 males courted less frequently intact and beheaded AL females, under white
light…" The exact pairs that are being compared are not clear. Just looking at the Z6 males with
intact AL females, although the courtship frequency is lower within the intact, white light group,
it is not lower than in the intact, red light group. Perhaps that comparison isn't meant, but it is
implied by "compared to other pairs." Throughout the paper, the specific comparisons being
made need to be explicit. In addition, if the comparison is only within a group, then in white
light, Z6 males with beheaded AL females do not have a significantly reduced courtship
frequency compared to Z6 females with beheaded Z6 females.
Lines 241-245: A discussion of Figure 3B seems to be missing.
Figure 4 B is confusing because the manipulation was done to the male, yet the figure is arranged
by type of female. I think it would be more instructive to compare, for example Z6 male response
to each type of female side-by-side. In that way it would be more clear that these manipulations
affect homotypic courtship more than heterotypic courtship.
Figure 5 legend: "Stacked" not "staked". Define "the expected situation." Is the expected that 50%
of the observed copulations would be with either type of male? The exact hypothesis being
tested here isn't clear. For the wing ablations, state that the descriptions are pictured in the figure
from left to right.
Lines 267-268: The statement "All the tests performed with Z6 females showed that the genitalia-
impaired male did not affect the courtship success of the intact male…" isn't completely correct.
The type of male did not affect the relative courtship success of the intact male, but he may have
still affected the intact male's copulation success, but comparisons to isolated males were not
made.
7
Lines 283-285: Z6 females did not copulate faster with one versus five or ten Z6 males if the letters
by the bars are the same. This statement needs to be changed.
Lines 312-315: this is a single sentence and cannot be a paragraph on its own. (in general,
throughout the discussion, there are one and two sentence paragraphs that need to be either
expanded or incorporated into other paragraphs).
Lines 337-338: This sentence was very hard to understand. I think what is meant is that AL
females only discriminated between AL and Z6 males when paired under red light. Under white
light they were not discriminant. The following sentence states the obvious, that light affects
discrimination, but then the final message is missing. In the absence of light, AL females are
likely using other cues to choose males. At this point, females may rely on other sensory cues. A
conclusion here is that more study is needed, of the type that were done with the Z6 female
manipulations, to determine what AL females use to discriminate males.
Line 345: "consistent" rather than "coherent"
Line 346: "eventually" is not the right word here.
Line 354: "When they become sexually receptive…" This should be "When females accept
males…" Females become sexually receptive when they are sexually mature. This statement is
about a specific acceptance signal.
Paragraph lines 354-366. This paragraph discusses two completely different uses of wings. One
idea is about female wings and the other is about male wings. These should be split up and
discussed separately because the wings are used in different contexts. For the females, the wing
preening idea is incompletely explained. In addition, there is no discussion of how removal of
female wings increases Z6 x AL mating and this may be because the females are unable to fully
reject the males. With respect to the male wing ablation study, this discussion confuses female
choice and male competitive success with respect to male wings and male copulation success as
dictated by the wings. The study can only look at female choice and male competitive success.
Concluding that removal of the anterior margin changes sensory cue reception may be true, but
cannot be concluded in a competitive/choice setting. Another study needs to be done with single
males with wing ablations compared to intact males to determine if male behavior is altered
because the male is not receiving cues appropriately. The experiment also doesn't explain why
anterior margin ablation is different from whole wing removal. Presumably the same cue
reception would be missing in both.
Line 367: This is very awkwardly phrased and misses the point that the extra sensory cues are
from other males. The rest of the paragraph is mostly a restatement of the results without a
complete discussion of social experience on mating.
Paragraph lines 380-389: An argument is made that olfactory communication ablation has a larger
effect than auditory communication ablation, but auditory communication ablation was not
tested in females: funiculi were ablated whereas aristae were not. This comparison cannot be
done for females and is a major hole in the paper. Another study may have done the experiment,
but it has to be repeated here for direct comparison given that the success of the controls might be
different. I also do not understand the argument that there is a different between AL and Z6
sensory cues associated with the funiculi given these data. That might be true given the male
data, but those data are not discussed here.
Line 405: Contemporary strains cannot be ancestral to each other. Modify this statement.
8
Lines 406-408: "Our next challenge will consist to explore whether…" A whether statement needs
two alternatives and only one is presented here. Better would be "Our next challenge will be to
explore…"
Overall, I'm excited by this paper but I think it could be easier to understand.

2 Z6 males, but figure 6b shows that copulation latency 1 Z6 male is not different from 5 and 10
Z6 males.
Discussion:
Lines 320-321: I don’t know that decreased locomotor activity explains why pairs walked less so
much as these results are consistent. It isn’t clear to me why these two measures of movement
should be considered independent.
Line 332: I don’t agree with this interpretation. Unless I’m misunderstanding which comparisons
are being referenced (in which case, please clarify), according to figure 6b, 1, 5, and 10 Z6 males
had statistically indistinguishable courtship latencies, as noted by the shared “b”.
Lines 333-336: This is very unclear. It is also not obvious to me how more matings would indicate
gametic incompatibility or why this would be expected for a homotypic pair.
Lines 343-353: Much of this discussion is based on apparently three pairs, but the limitations of
the sample size is not discussed. Because behavior is highly variable, it’s possible that the
unexpected result of increased kicking is entirely due to low sample size.
Line 373: “thus affecting”?
Line 380: “are most likely acting”?
Line 407: “will consist of exploring”?
Figures:
Generally, because sample sizes vary so much in some cases, it would be more helpful to know
the sample size for each group. This could be accomplished by including the number within each
of the bars and boxplots presented.
Figure 1:
Line 598: Extra “in”.
In figure 1c, are all data presented as % Active Time? The second, third, and fifth look like they
are presented as proportions, which is consistent with the legend text but not with the y-axis
label.
Figure 2:
Consider reorganizing the figure layout, so that it is consistent with the layout of the other figures
(i.e. organized across columns or rows).

Is the N provided for both panel a and b?

It is probably worth noting either in the figure or the legend that panel D is intentionally blank.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a very important examination of the sexual isolation between two D. melanogaster strains
through the examination of sensory reception, and I'm surprised no one has done this before.
This paper has the potential of making significant contributions to the understanding of the role
of mate choice in incipient speciation.
However, having said that, the paper needs some work in its presentation of the results. The
experiments seem to be well done, but the results and interpretation are difficult to follow. In
general, the paper is difficult to read. Some of the issues are with grammatical difficulties and
13
word choice (some are pointed out below) but the specific arguments are not always clear.
Careful editing would help.
Throughout the paper I'd like to know the sample sizes for each test. Ranges are given, but
sometimes the ranges are so large (e.g. 28-186 for Figure 6 C&D) that it is meaningless. I couldn't
figure this out from the data file because the Z6 x AL data is not presented at all. It just says "no
mating" so it is not clear that any trials were conducted. In general, the data files are missing
metadata to understand what the entries are.
I wasn't able to follow the argument about the legs. The authors argue that increased preening
with the third legs is part of an acceptance behavior, but removal of the third legs results in
increased copulation of Z6 female with AL males. This seems contradictory to me. If removal of
legs increases copulation, then the legs are inhibiting copulation. Preening may be coincidental.
What is missing here is an examination of the effect of legs (and wings) on Z6 females with Z6
males. Females often kick males off and may not be able to do so in the absence of thirds legs. If
this is the case, then Z6 X Z6 copulation success should increase as well. I don't understand the
argument that kicking stimulates AL males and inhibits Z6 males. The sample size is much too
small to make any clear conclusions and the Z6 females that mated did not kick the AL males
more than they did the Z6 males with whom they mated.
The whole discussion would benefit from a revision focused on discussing the data in the order it
is presented in the results and eliminating all rehashing of the results. At the moment, the
discussion jumps from one idea to another (for example, different sensory cues are discussed
(figures 3, 4 and 6) before going back to vision (Figure 2)). Much of the discussion is about the
results and should be moved to that section; some examples are below.
Other researchers have taken the ablation approach to studying the effects of sensory reception
and signal production on mating in other species, but this is not mentioned. This has been used
to look at differences between subspecies. Some recommended papers:
Colyott et al 2016 Animal Behaviour 120:93
Giglio & Dyer 2013 Ecology and Evolution 3:365
Gleason et al 2012 Animal Behaviour 83:217
Yukilevich et al 2016 Evolution 70: 526
Specific comments:
Line 64: "eperiments" should be "experiments"
Lines 91-103: At what time of day (relevant to lights on) were the behavioral experiments
conducted?
Lines 110-112 are confusing:
1. what is an "elementary" behavior?
2. "relatively" should be "relative"
3. is this the amount of time spent on a particular behavior relative to the amount of time spent in
courtship?
Lines 104-117: How long was the observation period? Probably this varied if the pair mated, but
there also should a statement (e.g. from introduction of the males to copulation? What was the
total amount of time the pair was observed if the pair didn't mate?).
14
Line 117: Here the fact that the courtship period was divided into eight periods is introduced, but
this is not explicitly stated. I was confused about the 1/8th until reading much further in the
paper.
Line 162: Because there could be more than one pair in the whole mating chamber, make it clear
that you are writing about the focal pair and not the extra pair.
Line 165: Males were discarded, but what happened with the females?
Line 183-184: Where are the data for the individual sex activities given? The paper states that
they are correlated, but I only see a measure of activity for each pair, not for each sex.
Figure 1A: what are the sample sizes for each of these. I couldn't find this.
Figure 1 B (and elsewhere): The box and whisker plots are explained, but the x for the Z6 x AL
matings are not. I guess that there were only three of these matings and the values for each one is
displayed, but this is not explained. Again, all the sample sizes need to be included.
Lines 203-204: "Copulating females of the two pairs increased the duration of head preening…" It
is not possible to determine this from the information presented. Of the preening time, more of it
was spent in head preening-this is not necessarily a duration measure.
Lines 217-219 (and elsewhere): Some comparison statements are confusing, such as "Compared to
other pairs, Z6 males courted less frequently intact and beheaded AL females, under white
light…" The exact pairs that are being compared are not clear. Just looking at the Z6 males with
intact AL females, although the courtship frequency is lower within the intact, white light group,
it is not lower than in the intact, red light group. Perhaps that comparison isn't meant, but it is
implied by "compared to other pairs." Throughout the paper, the specific comparisons being
made need to be explicit. In addition, if the comparison is only within a group, then in white
light, Z6 males with beheaded AL females do not have a significantly reduced courtship
frequency compared to Z6 females with beheaded Z6 females.
Lines 241-245: A discussion of Figure 3B seems to be missing.
Figure 4 B is confusing because the manipulation was done to the male, yet the figure is arranged
by type of female. I think it would be more instructive to compare, for example Z6 male response
to each type of female side-by-side. In that way it would be more clear that these manipulations
affect homotypic courtship more than heterotypic courtship.
Figure 5 legend: "Stacked" not "staked". Define "the expected situation." Is the expected that 50%
of the observed copulations would be with either type of male? The exact hypothesis being
tested here isn't clear. For the wing ablations, state that the descriptions are pictured in the figure
from left to right.
Lines 267-268: The statement "All the tests performed with Z6 females showed that the genitalia-
impaired male did not affect the courtship success of the intact male…" isn't completely correct.
The type of male did not affect the relative courtship success of the intact male, but he may have
still affected the intact male's copulation success, but comparisons to isolated males were not
made.
Lines 283-285: Z6 females did not copulate faster with one versus five or ten Z6 males if the letters
by the bars are the same. This statement needs to be changed.
15
Lines 312-315: this is a single sentence and cannot be a paragraph on its own. (in general,
throughout the discussion, there are one and two sentence paragraphs that need to be either
expanded or incorporated into other paragraphs).
Lines 337-338: This sentence was very hard to understand. I think what is meant is that AL
females only discriminated between AL and Z6 males when paired under red light. Under white
light they were not discriminant. The following sentence states the obvious, that light affects
discrimination, but then the final message is missing. In the absence of light, AL females are
likely using other cues to choose males. At this point, females may rely on other sensory cues. A
conclusion here is that more study is needed, of the type that were done with the Z6 female
manipulations, to determine what AL females use to discriminate males.
Line 345: "consistent" rather than "coherent"
Line 346: "eventually" is not the right word here.
Line 354: "When they become sexually receptive…" This should be "When females accept
males…" Females become sexually receptive when they are sexually mature. This statement is
about a specific acceptance signal.
Paragraph lines 354-366. This paragraph discusses two completely different uses of wings. One
idea is about female wings and the other is about male wings. These should be split up and
discussed separately because the wings are used in different contexts. For the females, the wing
preening idea is incompletely explained. In addition, there is no discussion of how removal of
female wings increases Z6 x AL mating and this may be because the females are unable to fully
reject the males. With respect to the male wing ablation study, this discussion confuses female
choice and male competitive success with respect to male wings and male copulation success as
dictated by the wings. The study can only look at female choice and male competitive success.
Concluding that removal of the anterior margin changes sensory cue reception may be true, but
cannot be concluded in a competitive/choice setting. Another study needs to be done with single
males with wing ablations compared to intact males to determine if male behavior is altered
because the male is not receiving cues appropriately. The experiment also doesn't explain why
anterior margin ablation is different from whole wing removal. Presumably the same cue
reception would be missing in both.
Line 367: This is very awkwardly phrased and misses the point that the extra sensory cues are
from other males. The rest of the paragraph is mostly a restatement of the results without a
complete discussion of social experience on mating.
Paragraph lines 380-389: An argument is made that olfactory communication ablation has a larger
effect than auditory communication ablation, but auditory communication ablation was not
tested in females: funiculi were ablated whereas aristae were not. This comparison cannot be
done for females and is a major hole in the paper. Another study may have done the experiment,
but it has to be repeated here for direct comparison given that the success of the controls might be
different. I also do not understand the argument that there is a different between AL and Z6
sensory cues associated with the funiculi given these data. That might be true given the male
data, but those data are not discussed here.
Line 405: Contemporary strains cannot be ancestral to each other. Modify this statement.
Lines 406-408: "Our next challenge will consist to explore whether…" A whether statement needs
16
two alternatives and only one is presented here. Better would be "Our next challenge will be to
explore…"
Overall, I'm excited by this paper but I think it could be easier to understand.

label_comment_3
I really appreciate the effort the authors have made to revise this paper. Not only do I like it
better because the explanation is so much clearer, understanding the data better has increased my
excitement for it. I think this is a great examination of the signals and reception required for
mating preferences and will be of general interest.
17
Of course I still have a couple questions and comments, but I think these are easily handled.
Copulation latencies
I couldn’t find an explanation of how copulation latency was calculated in the absence of
copulation. I think the authors excluded those pairs, but this needs to be stated explicitly because
the result is that in graphs such as Figure 3B, the copulation latency of the control looks like it is
0, which it isn’t. It cannot be graphed. This also means that the sample sizes for 3B are not
correct because they should be smaller than the sample sizes for 3A. The same is true for the
lower half of Figure 6
Line 42: “means” instead of “mean”
Line 84: I realize that the time of lights on was given in the previous paragraph, but it is more
correct to put the time of observation relative to lights on than to give local time. Help the reader
out by changing this.
Line 287. “affected” instead of “affect”
Line 301 “two-part” instead of “two-parts”
Line 329: relatively high: this is such a subjective statement. Yes, it indicates that copulation takes
place sometime beyond the observation period, but it is only about half the fertility of Z6XZ6
pairs (and about a third of AL females with either type of male). Please modify to explain exactly
what you mean.
Line 351: This sentence is confusing because it appears to contradict itself. I think it might help if
you first stated that under white light AL females were less choosy than Z6 females before going
on to explain how red light was different.
Line 676 “stacked” instead of “staked”
Figure 1A. There is a letter missing above the 8/8 for Z6/AL No copulating
“No copulating” should be either “No copulation” or “Non-copulating”
To explain one of my remarks from the previous review, I wrote: Lines 267-268: The statement
"All the tests performed with Z6 females showed that the genitalia-impaired male did not affect
the courtship success of the intact male..." isn't completely correct. The type of male did not affect
the relative courtship success of the intact male, but he may have still affected the intact male's
copulation success, but comparisons to isolated males were not made.”
The issue is that having a second (glued) male present may make a difference to the mating
success of the intact male, but you did not compare pairs of males to single males. Instead, you
compared the type of glued male. Modifying the sentence to “All the tests performed with Z6
females showed that the type of genitalia-impaired male did not affect the courtship success of
the intact male…” will take care of the problem.
Throughout the paper, when a sentence is started with “differently,” the word should be replaced
by a phrase such as “in contrast” because this is a non-standard usage of “differently.”

Dear Editor,
Please find below our comments to the two reviewers, and our explanation on the way we
dealt with them.
You will see in the revised version that we took all these comments in consideration. We also
hank you for the time you spent handling the ms and both reviews.

ntroduction:
Line 31: “thus reinforcing”?
"… secondary changes, this reinforcing the strength …" was changed to "…
secondary changes reinforcing the strength…" (new L31)
Methods:
Generally, the methods section would benefit from greater specificity and clarity in the
description of experiments and analysis. Sentences such as lines 92-93 and lines 138-139 are
oo vague and require the reader to hunt for specifics by going back and forth between the
igures, results, and methods. This hinders clarity of the results and discussion.
Lines 92-100: " Tests performed under white or red light lasted 60 minutes. […] The test
nvolving intact females allowed us to estimate the female receptivity,.."
This was changed to " Tests performed under white or red light lasted 10 and 60
minutes (see below). Depending on the experiment, all or some of the following female
x male fly pairs were tested: ALxAL, Z6xAL, ALxZ6 and Z6xZ6. A single male was
aspirated without anaesthesia in the observation chamber. After 10 minutes, a virgin
female (intact or beheaded) was introduced and we observed the male activity and
noted both latencies of courtship and copulation (time from introduction to time of
behaviour onset). Observations lasted 10 minutes or until copulation occurred. We
calculated the courtship index (percentage of time spent by the male courting the
female during the observation time). Pairs were kept together for 60 minutes to
estimate courtship and copulation frequencies. The test involving intact females
allowed us to estimate the female receptivity (acceptance of the male),…"

New L. 69: " These inbred strains…"
Line 80: “induce undesired pleiotropic effects”
Done
Lines 89-90: Were the 5 periods of 10 second intervals part of the same trial, and how much
ime separated each period?
" After a 10 min adaptation period, the number of lines crossed was counted during a
total of 50 — 5 periods of 10 — seconds." was changed to " After a 10 min adaptation
period, its locomotor activity was quantified by computing the number of lines crossed
during a total of 50 seconds (five 10 sec periods with a 50 sec interval between each
period)." (new L.90-92)
Lines 112-114: is the score relative to each of the 5 periods of 10 seconds or the total time (50
seconds)? Or, if this is not the trial referenced, what is the time period for which the activity
was observed?
L. 115-116 " the proportion of time spent relative to the total observation time
(expressed as the mean ± SEM (28))."
Lines 116-117: were the courtship periods the same for each fly pair, or did they end when the
pair mated? If the courtship periods are different lengths, how was variation in each 1/8th
ime period accounted for? For example, if the pair courted for 60 minutes, each 1/8th is
7.5minutes, but if a pair courted for 15 minutes, each 1/8th is only 1.875 minutes and it seems
ike more of a particular behavior could be measured for the flies that courted for 60 versus
he ones that courted 15 minutes by virtue of the way the time is divided rather than the actual
behavior of the flies. Additionally, if each 1/8th time period is sequential for each pair, are
hese time periods not non-independent? It isn’t clear if or how the ‘repeated measures’ nature
of these data were accounted for.
We have tried to better explain this in the new L. 116-121 "We again analysed
videotaped behaviours to measure locomotor activity: a transparent sheet divided into
six equal areas was placed on the video monitor screen, and we scored the number of
boundaries crossed by each fly of the tested pairs. The dynamic activity during the
observation period was estimated as the number of boundaries crossed during each
1/8th fraction of the total observation period for each pair; it means that the duration
of each fraction of the period was relative, not absolute, and could have a different
length between pairs (28)."
Line 119: I suggest “mate less frequently under darkness…”
Done
Line 145: missing “a” before procedure.
Done
Line 150: “Males were maintained with a small brush” is not clear. Is this meant to say
“males were held still with a small brush”?
This was changed to " Males were held still with a small brush until the glue was dry."
(new L. 155)
Results:
Lines 192-194: How do you interpret the similarity between AL and Z6 females under white
and red light, respectively in Figure s2?
We did not interpret it, we only observed that Z6 flies are less active than AL ones.
Line 198: Is “mating status” the status of the individual at the beginning of the experiment or
he outcome of the trial?
Yes. We added "…according to the copulation status at the end of the trial" in the
revised version (new L. 205).
Lines 199-201: It appears these comparisons are based on three observations, and as behavior
s notoriously noisy, I am concerned that this result is not entirely reliable.
This is now discussed in new L. 372-375. "Although video data were obtained on
relatively small samples (due to the rare copulation frequency in Z6xAL pairs), the
significance of the behavioral differences was detected by statistical tests taking the
sample size into account."
Lines 206, 207 etc: Z6 females are referred to as mating or copulating. To aid in clarity, keep
he terminology consistent throughout.
Done: we chose “copulating”
Lines 207-208: While I understand that a fly could be doing other things such as preening
while immobile, it seems like by testing % Active Time walking and immobile, the same
behavior is being tested twice in that flies can’t be walking while immobile or vice versa.
To clarify this, we have added in the revised version (new L. 214-215): "… immobile
(not moving and not showing any other visible behavior;…"
Lines 208-210: The comparison being made either isn’t sufficiently clear or the summary is
stated too generally. I don’t see a difference for preening behavior between Z6xAL pairs that
mated and Z6xZ6 pairs that did mate and that did not mate.
The detailed explanation was provided in the paragraphs before. Here, for the sake of
clarity, we just propose a short summary to the reader.
Line 212: I suggest “strong” rather than “high” relationship. Also, is this an inference from
your data? If so, is there a figure that can be cited here?
The beginning of L. 212 was modified according to the reviewer remarks: "Given the
strong relationship between locomotory behaviour and copulation (Fig.1 A),…" (new
L. 220)
Line 215: Is “male courtship intensity” courtship index or a combined measure of latency and
ndex? It is also not clear to me why the comparison of male courtship to intact or beheaded
emales is made. Is the comparison actually between males that are interacting with intact or
beheaded females?
We changed “Male courtship intensity was also compared…” to "Male courtship index
was also compared…" (new L. 224)
Lines 218-220: AL males courted beheaded Z6 females under white light to an equal degree
as Z6xAL and ALxZ6 pairs under red light when the female is beheaded, correct (Fig 2b)? I
don’t think this agrees with the second part of the sentence, unless the comparison being made
s more specific. If so, please clarify.
This whole paragraph (L. 216-222) was replaced by " Under white light (W), Z6 male
showed a reduced courtship frequency with all females except their own intact females
[…]. In particular, under W, they showed a similarly decreased courtship frequency
with both beheaded females […]. Compared to other pairs, Z6 males courted less
frequently intact and beheaded AL females […]. Differently, AL males courted slightly
more often intact Z6 females under red light (R) and beheaded Z6 females under W,
compared to other pairs […]. Under R, the courtship frequency generally strongly
decreased with intact females but not with beheaded females. Also, the courtship index,
which showed no — or a slight difference — between pairs under R was strongly
decreased with intact females […]."
Lines 221-223: But the same is evidently not true for beheaded females? Looking at figure s4,
find it odd that courtship index of males with beheaded females was so high under red light.
Since beheaded females do not walk, the probability for a male to find them is higher.
Once he has located the female (which rarely escape), the male can court her for a
longer time compared to a moving female.
Line 227: Is the reference for figure 2E?
No. Fig. 2F
Line 228: Drop “An”.
Done
Lines 229-231: This comparison is between data shown in figure 2E and figure 2A under
white light conditions, correct? If not please clarify. Were these comparisons made by
etesting the data? Were adjustments made for multiple comparisons? This adjustment
appears to have been made for the following comparison (lines 233-235) but not the final
comparison (lines 235-236).
Now, we explain that the Marascuilo procedure allows us to compare independent data
sets (new Line 246)
Line 236: A summary statement would be helpful here.
Done: " In summary, while impairment of visual cues did not allow us to increase
copulation frequency during one hour in Z6xAL pairs, this frequency was significantly
increased during the subsequent 23h-period." (new L.248-250)
Line 245: These results are specific to figure 3A, correct?
Yes. Now, we have divided the previous Fig. 3 in 2 panels Fig. 3A & B
Line 262: In the figure, each of the AL females mated more often with AL males, as indicated
by the “+” in the black part of the stacked barplot, so does this statement mean that the
difference isn’t significant between male strains, or that the difference between light types
within a strain isn’t different?
This remark was also made by the reviewer 2. Now we have tried to better explain this
in Fig. 5A caption: "The frequencies of non-copulating pairs and of copulating a Z6
and AL males were compared using a Wilks G2 likelihood ratio test completed with a
computation of significance by cell (+ and – symbols indicate a significantly increased
or decreased number of copulation events, respectively, compared to the expected
situation based on the hypothesis of independence between the female type and the
light condition relatively to her choice of a male —or of no male—)." (new L. 667-
672)
Line 268: “affected” should be “affect”
Done
Line 284-285: I agree that it appears Z6 females mated more quickly with 1 Z6 male
compared to 2 Z6 males, but figure 6b shows that copulation latency 1 Z6 male is not
different from 5 and 10 Z6 males.
"… but their copulation was faster with one Z6 male than with two and more Z6
males" was changed to "…but their copulation was faster with one Z6 male than with
two Z6 males (new L. 301-302)
Discussion:
Lines 320-321: I don’t know that decreased locomotor activity explains why pairs walked less
so much as these results are consistent. It isn’t clear to me why these two measures of
movement should be considered independent.
This sentence was removed
Line 332: I don’t agree with this interpretation. Unless I’m misunderstanding which
comparisons are being referenced (in which case, please clarify), according to figure 6b, 1, 5,
and 10 Z6 males had statistically indistinguishable courtship latencies, as noted by the shared
“b”.
"…than with two or more Z6 males" was changed to "…than with two Z6 males"
(new L. 347)
Lines 333-336: This is very unclear. It is also not obvious to me how more matings would
ndicate gametic incompatibility or why this would be expected for a homotypic pair
The previous sentence (L 333-336) " If alternatively, more matings occured in Z6xZ6
pairs during the 24h period, this means that these flies suffer of a gametic
incompatibility (60)." was changed to " If alternatively, more copulations yielding less
progeny occurred in Z6xZ6 pairs during the 24h period, this suggests that some of
these flies suffered of a gametic incompatibility as already observed in heterotypic pairs
(64)."
Lines 343-353: Much of this discussion is based on apparently three pairs, but the limitations
of the sample size is not discussed. Because behavior is highly variable, it’s possible that the
unexpected result of increased kicking is entirely due to low sample size.
This is discussed in new L. 372-375. Cf. supra
Line 373: “thus affecting”?
"…repulsive effect (66), this affecting copulation in Z6xZ6 pairs" was changed to
"…repulsive effect (69), potentially affecting copulation in Z6xZ6 focal pairs" (nex L.
408-409)
Line 380: “are most likely acting”?
"The stimuli … are likely and mostly acting through olfactory perception" was
changed to "The stimuli … may mostly act through olfactory perception" (new L. 414-
415)
Line 407: “will consist of exploring”?
Taking into account remarks of both reviewers, " Our next challenge will consist to
explore whether the survival…" was changed to "Our next challenge will consist of
exploring whether or not the survival…"
Figures:
Generally, because sample sizes vary so much in some cases, it would be more helpful to
know the sample size for each group. This could be accomplished by including the number
within each of the bars and boxplots presented.
Done
Figure 1:
Line 598: Extra “in”.
Deleted
n figure 1c, are all data presented as % Active Time? The second, third, and fifth look like
hey are presented as proportions, which is consistent with the legend text but not with the y-
axis label.
This was a mistake in y-axis legend: “% Active Time” has been changed to “%
Observation Time”.
Figure 2:
Consider reorganizing the figure layout, so that it is consistent with the layout of the other
igures (i.e. organized across columns or rows).
We think that such reorganization would require us to divide this figure into 2 or 3
panels and not specially improve its readability.
Figure 3:
s the N provided for both panel a and b?
N are now provided for each figure (and panel)
Figure 6:
t is probably worth noting either in the figure or the legend that panel D is intentionally
blank.
It is only to illustrate that no copulation occurred in Z6xAL pairs whatever flies were
placed in the lower part of the observation chamber. This is now more obvious with the
sample sizes (N) provided below each bar or plot.
We want to thank the reviewer 1 for her/his very detailed and constructive comments
on our ms. We hope that our rewritting meets all her/his expectations
________________________
wer: 2
Throughout the paper I'd like to know the sample sizes for each test. Ranges are given, but
sometimes the ranges are so large (e.g. 28-186 for Figure 6 C&D) that it is meaningless. I
couldn't figure this out from the data file because the Z6 x AL data is not presented at all. It
ust says "no mating" so it is not clear that any trials were conducted. In general, the data files
are missing metadata to understand what the entries are.
Sample sizes were added in each figure below each corresponding bar or plot.
wasn't able to follow the argument about the legs. The authors argue that increased preening
with the third legs is part of an acceptance behavior, but removal of the third legs results in
ncreased copulation of Z6 female with AL males. This seems contradictory to me. If
emoval of legs increases copulation, then the legs are inhibiting copulation. Preening may be
coincidental. What is missing here is an examination of the effect of legs (and wings) on Z6
emales with Z6 males. Females often kick males off and may not be able to do so in the
absence of thirds legs. If this is the case, then Z6 X Z6 copulation success should increase as
well. I don't understand the argument that kicking stimulates AL males and inhibits Z6 males.
The sample size is much too small to make any clear conclusions and the Z6 females that
mated did not kick the AL males more than they did the Z6 males with whom they mated.
This was rewritten in our revised version of the ms (new L. 370-402)
The whole discussion would benefit from a revision focused on discussing the data in the
order it is presented in the results and eliminating all rehashing of the results. At the moment,
he discussion jumps from one idea to another (for example, different sensory cues are
discussed (figures 3, 4 and 6) before going back to vision (Figure 2)). Much of the discussion
s about the results and should be moved to that section; some examples are below.
Discussion was reorganized according to Reveiwer2 comments. We hope that we have
improve its readability.
Other researchers have taken the ablation approach to studying the effects of sensory
eception and signal production on mating in other species, but this is not mentioned. This
has been used to look at differences between subspecies. Some recommended papers.
These references are now added (# 19-22) (new L. 39)
Specific comments:
Line 64: "eperiments" should be "experiments"
Done
Lines 91-103: At what time of day (relevant to lights on) were the behavioral experiments
conducted?
This was already indicated in the previous version: "12 L: 12 D cycle (subjective day
8:00am-8:00pm)" (new L. 72) & " Behavioural observations were always performed
from 9 am to noon" new L. 84-85)
Lines 110-112 are confusing:
1. what is an "elementary" behavior?
This was explained in Lasbleiz et al. (24). According to Ethovision software, behaviour
could be described in terms of behavioural states and of elementary behaviours.
Behavioural states consist in various elementary behaviours.
To clarify this poinbt, we have added in the revised version (new L. 114): "each
complex behaviour consisting of a set of elementary behaviours"
2. "relatively" should be "relative"
Done
3. is this the amount of time spent on a particular behavior relative to the amount of time
spent in courtship?
Not relative to the observation time (see our reply to reviewer 1).
Lines 104-117: How long was the observation period? Probably this varied if the pair mated,
but there also should a statement (e.g. from introduction of the males to copulation? What
was the total amount of time the pair was observed if the pair didn't mate?).
We have added (new L. 107): " … for 10 minutes or until copulation occurred…"
Line 117: Here the fact that the courtship period was divided into eight periods is introduced,
but this is not explicitly stated. I was confused about the 1/8th until reading much further in
he paper.
We have tried to better explain this (new L. 118-121): "The dynamic activity during the
observation period was estimated as the number of boundaries crossed during each
1/8th fraction of the total observation period for each pair; it means that the duration
of each fraction of the period was relative, not absolute, and could have a different
length between pairs (28)."
Line 162: Because there could be more than one pair in the whole mating chamber, make it
clear that you are writing about the focal pair and not the extra pair.
Done (new L. 145, 163 & 167)
Line 165: Males were discarded, but what happened with the females?
This was added in the revised ms (new L. 167): “and females kept"
Line 183-184: Where are the data for the individual sex activities given? The paper states that
hey are correlated, but I only see a measure of activity for each pair, not for each sex.
We have added a new Figure (now Fig. S3A).
Figure 1A: what are the sample sizes for each of these. I couldn't find this.
Sample sizes are now provided in all figures
Figure 1 B (and elsewhere): The box and whisker plots are explained, but the x for the Z6 x
AL matings are not. I guess that there were only three of these matings and the values for
each one is displayed, but this is not explained. Again, all the sample sizes need to be
ncluded.
This information was already provided in Material and Methods paragraph 3Courtship
and copulatory behaviours”: "…female x male fly pairs were tested: ALxAL…". We
have added the same explanation another time in the paragraph “Role of visual
signals, locomotion...” (new L. 222).
Lines 203-204: "Copulating females of the two pairs increased the duration of head
preening…" It is not possible to determine this from the information presented. Of the
preening time, more of it was spent in head preening-this is not necessarily a duration
measure.
This sentence was changed to " Copulating females of the two pairs increased the
relative duration of head preening whereas wing preening was only decreased in non-
copulating Z6xAL pairs." (new L. 209-211)
Lines 217-219 (and elsewhere): Some comparison statements are confusing, such as
"Compared to other pairs, Z6 males courted less frequently intact and beheaded AL females,
under white light…" The exact pairs that are being compared are not clear. Just looking at
he Z6 males with intact AL females, although the courtship frequency is lower within the
ntact, white light group, it is not lower than in the intact, red light group. Perhaps that
comparison isn't meant, but it is implied by "compared to other pairs." Throughout the paper,
he specific comparisons being made need to be explicit. In addition, if the comparison is
only within a group, then in white light, Z6 males with beheaded AL females do not have a
significantly reduced courtship frequency compared to Z6 females with beheaded Z6 females.
Please, see our response to Reviewer 1
Lines 241-245: A discussion of Figure 3B seems to be missing.
Now, we have added (new L. 260-261): " These manipulations did not affect
copulation latency (Fig. 3 B)."
Figure 4 B is confusing because the manipulation was done to the male, yet the figure is
arranged by type of female. I think it would be more instructive to compare, for example Z6
male response to each type of female side-by-side. In that way it would be more clear that
hese manipulations affect homotypic courtship more than heterotypic courtship.
We kept this pattern since the Fig 4B was organized to follow a similar organization as
the Fig 4 A.
Figure 5 legend: "Stacked" not "staked". Define "the expected situation." Is the expected that
50% of the observed copulations would be with either type of male? The exact hypothesis
being tested here isn't clear. For the wing ablations, state that the descriptions are pictured in
he figure from left to right.
Our hypothesis is the independence between the type of the female (Z6 or AL) and the
light condition on female choice for a male (or no male). In other words, the ratio of
choosen male is the same in both conditions. Based upon this hypothesis, theoretical
frequencies (expected values) are Ei = row total x column total/overall total.
Now, we have added in the Fig. 5A caption: : "…expected situation based upon the
hypothesis of independence between the type of the female and the light condition on
her choice for a male —or no male—)"( new L. 669-672). See also our replu to
Reviewer 1
For the wing ablations, state that the descriptions are pictured in the figure from left to right.
Done
Lines 267-268: The statement "All the tests performed with Z6 females showed that the
genitalia-impaired male did not affect the courtship success of the intact male…" isn't
completely correct. The type of male did not affect the relative courtship success of the intact
male, but he may have still affected the intact male's copulation success, but comparisons to
solated males were not made.
We are not sure to understand the meaning of this sentence and we wonder how it
could be possible to perform such experiment?
Lines 283-285: Z6 females did not copulate faster with one versus five or ten Z6 males if the
etters by the bars are the same. This statement needs to be changed.
Done. Please, see our response to Reviewer 1
Lines 312-315: this is a single sentence and cannot be a paragraph on its own. (in general,
hroughout the discussion, there are one and two sentence paragraphs that need to be either
expanded or incorporated into other paragraphs).
Done
Lines 337-338: This sentence was very hard to understand. I think what is meant is that AL
emales only discriminated between AL and Z6 males when paired under red light. Under
white light they were not discriminant. The following sentence states the obvious, that light
affects discrimination, but then the final message is missing. In the absence of light, AL
emales are likely using other cues to choose males. At this point, females may rely on other
sensory cues. A conclusion here is that more study is needed, of the type that were done with
he Z6 female manipulations, to determine what AL females use to discriminate males.
This paragraph was rewritten (new L. 353-357): " AL females were much less choosy
than Z6 females since AL females discriminated between AL and Z6 males under red
light only (Fig.2E). This indicates that the visual signals differently impacted the
courtship of AL or Z6 males paired with AL females and that, in the absence of light,
AL females were likely using other cues to choose males. Further studies involving
similar Z6 female manipulations are needed to determine which cues are used by AL
females to discriminate males."
Line 345: "consistent" rather than "coherent"
Done
Line 346: "eventually" is not the right word here.
Removed
Line 354: "When they become sexually receptive…" This should be "When females accept
males…" Females become sexually receptive when they are sexually mature. This statement
s about a specific acceptance signal.
We have changed this to " When females accept males, their open their wings…" (new
L. 386-387)
Paragraph lines 354-366. This paragraph discusses two completely different uses of
wings. One idea is about female wings and the other is about male wings. These should be
split up and discussed separately because the wings are used in different contexts. For the
emales, the wing preening idea is incompletely explained. In addition, there is no discussion
of how removal of female wings increases Z6 x AL mating and this may be because the
emales are unable to fully reject the males. With respect to the male wing ablation study,
his discussion confuses female choice and male competitive success with respect to male
wings and male copulation success as dictated by the wings. The study can only look at
emale choice and male competitive success. Concluding that removal of the anterior margin
changes sensory cue reception may be true, but cannot be concluded in a competitive/choice
setting. Another study needs to be done with single males with wing ablations compared to
ntact males to determine if male behavior is altered because the male is not receiving cues
appropriately. The experiment also doesn't explain why anterior margin ablation is different
rom whole wing removal. Presumably the same cue reception would be missing in both.
This paragraph was rewritten and divided into two parts pertaining to female wings
and to male wings (new L. 370-402)
Line 367: This is very awkwardly phrased and misses the point that the extra sensory cues are
rom other males. The rest of the paragraph is mostly a restatement of the results without a
complete discussion of social experience on mating.
"Some of the additional sensory stimuli provided without physical contact affected the
copulation frequency of Z6xZ6 pairs" was changed to: "Extra additional sensory
stimuli provided by males physically separated affected the copulation frequency of
focal Z6xZ6 pair" (new L. 403-404)
Paragraph lines 380-389: An argument is made that olfactory communication ablation has a
arger effect than auditory communication ablation, but auditory communication ablation was
not tested in females: funiculi were ablated whereas aristae were not. This comparison cannot
be done for females and is a major hole in the paper. Another study may have done the
experiment, but it has to be repeated here for direct comparison given that the success of the
controls might be different. I also do not understand the argument that there is a different
between AL and Z6 sensory cues associated with the funiculi given these data. That might be
rue given the male data, but those data are not discussed here.
We did not repeat the data since it was shown by Colegrave et al. (ref. 40) and by some
of us (ref 30, Grillet et al., 2012) that acoustic stimuli do not influence female.
However, we agree on the remark made by the reviewer that all these experiments
could have been redone. This is just a problem of publication space. Our conclusion
are therefore based on the comparison of our data with those provided by the literature
and by us. It is worth to note that the experiment published in Grillet 2012 and those
presented here were performed during the same period of time (corresponding to the
PhD thesis of Micheline Grillet).
Line 405: Contemporary strains cannot be ancestral to each other. Modify this statement.
L. 403-405 "The cosmopolitan distribution of M strains, […], suggests that the survival
of Z strains, considered to be the ancestral form of the D.melanogaster species…" was
changed to "The cosmopolitan distribution of current M strains, […], suggests that the
survival of contemporary Z strains, considered to be derived of the ancestral form of
the D. melanogaster species…"
Lines 406-408: "Our next challenge will consist to explore whether…" A whether statement
needs two alternatives and only one is presented here. Better would be "Our next challenge
will be to explore…"
Done. Please, see our response to Reviewer 1
We want to warmly thank Doctor Jennifer Gleason for her very sharp, exhaustive and
constructive comments on our ms. We hope that our rewritting meets all her
expectations.
