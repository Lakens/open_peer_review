The main issue with the paper is that the research contribution is not clear. What is the research
question that the authors are trying to find out ? What is the hypotheses they are testing ? The
novelty statement needs to be very clear in the introduction and the contributions clearly defined.
For example what are the currently challenges of existing methods / algorithms for automatic
detection of learning styles ?
In the introduction what do you mean by learning efficiency – please define this term – with a
reference.
The introduction talks about the proposed work in the context of e-learning systems – the authors
should also look at more recent work by Crockett and Latham

In the introduction, the authors refer to the questionnaires on learning style. Although the paper
focuses on Felder-Silverman – design for engineering students, the authors should note that other
questionnaires such as Honey and Mumford have been designed for establishing the learning
styles of different disciplines.
The authors should also clearly define the difficulties faced by dynamically updating the learning
style during a persons engagement with an intelligent tutoring system.
Please define what you mean by a cold start problem ? (page 3)
In the discussion of Bayesian networks the references [14,15] are old i.e. 1997 and 1999 and some
new references to support the current state of the art.
Figure 1 and 2 needs explanation i.e. define X1…X4.
Missing reference for Chow-Liu algorithm on page 8 and for mutual information equation.
In section 4, the authors present there learning style detection model. At the start of this section (
page 9) they say “.. in order to avoid the inconvenience of filling up a lengthy learning style
questionnaire the study suggests the learning style of students is preset “. Then on page 10, the
author state that the students were required to fill the Felder-Silverman online – so I am
confused here ?
The experiment states you are using a current popular education system in this study – a
description of this system is required please.
For the experiment, why was 46 participants chosen – please justify – maybe using other studies
as a guide. How as the data collected? How did the students interact with the system to collect
the data? Please expand on data collected on page 12. This could be done in a table where all the
attributes used in the study are described. Tables 1 to 4 need to be fully explained in the text. In
fact all tables should have a detailed explanation of the columns and the content especially the
abbreviations that are used. How many records were generated?
On page 10, line 41 the authors state “ they need to mine data” – who is they ?
How did you validate the model produced in Figure 4.

Results need more discussion in relation to the experimental hypothesis that you are testing.
Statistical analysis should be carried out.
The paper should be proof read and all abbreviations need to be defined.

label_comment_2
The reason for using tree-augmented naive Bayesian structure is presented on (page 4, line 6):
"The tree augmented naïve
Bayes combines the ability of Bayesian networks..." However, in the subsequent paragraph, how
it is used to build the learning style classification model is not sufficiently explained. A few more
sentences explaining the mapping of a tree-augmented Bayesian network in the problem domain
and the reason why it is better compared to an ordinary Bayesian network would greatly
improve the clarity the explanation at that stage.
In the discussion just before the Conclusion section (page 16), the phrase "...because the tree
augmented naïve algorithm loosens the conditional independence assumption which is
consistent with the reality." needs to be explained in the context of the experiment.
Does the tree-augmented approach always perform better than the naive method in all situations
(i.e., there are many online courses with lots of variations in their delivery)? Is its performance
consistent, or are there course delivery factors that can affect its performance? The authors should
discuss this issue sufficiently since it is typical to have many courses in a particular online study
program.

The reviewer has examined the amendments made by the authors, however it is felt that some of
the comments have not been fully addressed:
1) In the first version of the paper, it was requested that the words “learning efficiency” be
defined – the authors have responded by changing this phrase and replacing it with “learning
effectiveness” - this phrase must be defined. For example, what was the metrics used in the
study to give a measure meant of learning effectiveness ? - Was learning gain part of these
metrics ?
2) There have been minor updates to the references – but still I feel the more recent references
suggested could have been added
3) The discussion that accompanies the results could be in more depth – especially in relation to
the impact of the work – based on the “learning effectiveness”
4) The authors have stated that they have used Moodle (which I am very familiar) as the learning
system in this paper. I am unsure of the connection between the students pre-set learning styles
and how they will be presented with static material on Moodle. If I am a visual learner, does this
mean I only see media / video options of material or this is recommended to me? I think, the
relationship between the functionality and offerings of Moodle and how the Bayesian network
utilises these offerings in relation to learning style needs to be clarified.

1. There are still typographical and grammatical errors, such as:
- Page 5, second para: It should be "In this paper, we propose (a) new approach ... to improve (the
precision of learning style prediction)."
- Page 5, title of Subsection I.2: It should be "Learning Styles Revisit(ed)"
Please proofread your manuscript once again.
2. Page 18, para 3 (after Table 11):
This paragraph discusses the results of the TANB method and states the superiority of the
method compared to the Bayesian method. However, the authors seems not to be very sure about
the reason: "... has higher precision than the Bayesian network, a POSSIBLE reason is that ...".
Please be confirmed on this and provide stronger arguments, since this is an important point that
may lead to high-level, application-oriented implications of the results which may become
interesting topics for further research.

1. Comment: The main issue with the paper is that the research contribution is not clear.
What is the research question that the authors are trying to find out? What is the
hypotheses they are testing? The novelty statement needs to be very clear in the
introduction and the contributions clearly defined. For example, what are the currently
challenges of existing methods / algorithms for automatic detection of learning styles?
Response: Thank the reviewer for the comments. We have recognized that this description
in the previous copy were not clear. Some of paragraphs have been rephrased to clarify
and highlight the research questions. The main research question of this paper is to
improve the detecting precision, especially comparing with Bayesian family which is one
of most widely adopted in this field.
2. In the introduction what do you mean by learning efficiency – please define this term
– with a reference.
Response: We appreciate the careful reading and comments. ‘learning efficiency’ is not a
specific term here, we have replaced by using more accurate words ‘learning effectiveness’.
3. The introduction talks about the proposed work in the context of e-learning systems –
the authors should also look at more recent work by Crockett and Latham
• Crockett, K.A., Latham, A. Whitten, N. On predicting learning styles in conversational
intelligent tutoring systems using fuzzy decision trees International Journal of Human-
Computer Studies 97, pp 98-115 2017 Academic Press. DOI:
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2016.08.005
• Latham, A.M., Crockett, K.A., McLean, D.A. An Adaptation Algorithm for an Intelligent
Natural Language Tutoring System, Computers and Education, Volume 71, pp 97–110,

In the discussion of Bayesian networks the references [14,15] are old i.e. 1997 and 1999
and some new references to support the current state of the art.
Response: Thank the reviewer’s comments. We have updated some more recent
references for both learning styles aspect and Bayesian network aspect.
4. In the introduction, the authors refer to the questionnaires on learning style. Although
the paper focuses on Felder-Silverman – design for engineering students, the authors
should note that other questionnaires such as Honey and Mumford have been designed
for establishing the learning styles of different disciplines.
Response:Thank the reviewer’s comment. Yes, we noted that. In the introduction section,
we set two past researches as examples, they used two different learning style models:
Felder-Silverman and Kolb’s in different disciplines.
5. The authors should also clearly define the difficulties faced by dynamically updating
the learning style during a persons engagement with an intelligent tutoring system.
Please define what you mean by a cold start problem ? (page 3)
Response: above issues have been explained and defined.
6.Figure 1 and 2 needs explanation i.e. define X1…X4.
Missing reference for Chow-Liu algorithm on page 8 and for mutual information equation.
Response: the explanation and correction have been adopted accordingly.
7.In section 4, the authors present there learning style detection model. At the start of this
section (page 9) they say “.. in order to avoid the inconvenience of filling up a lengthy
learning style questionnaire the study suggests the learning style of students is preset “.
Then on page 10, the author state that the students were required to fill the Felder-
Silverman online – so I am confused here?
Response: Thank the reviewer for the comments. We have recognized that this description
in the previous copy were not clear. The students were required to fill up the questionnaire
only for the experiment of this study. We have rephrased that to clarify.
8. The experiment states you are using a current popular education system in this study –
a description of this system is required please.
Response: the experiment was tested on Moodle platform; more detailed descriptions were
added.
9. For the experiment, why was 46 participants chosen – please justify – maybe using other
studies as a guide. How as the data collected? How did the students interact with the
system to collect the data? Please expand on data collected on page 12. This could be
done in a table where all the attributes used in the study are described. Tables 1 to 4 need
to be fully explained in the text. In fact all tables should have a detailed explanation of the
columns and the content especially the abbreviations that are used. How many records
were generated?
On page 10, line 41 the authors state “they need to mine data” – who is they ?
How did you validate the model produced in Figure 4.
Response: the participants and data collection have been descripted in more detailed,
including the numbers and background of participants, number of records. We have added
a table which includes all the attributes and their descriptions regarding data collection. All
of tables are fully explained.
On page 10, line 41, “they need to mine data”, This sentence has been rephrased.
The model in Figure 4 is based on other studies as a guide, the references have been
added accordingly.
10. Results need more discussion in relation to the experimental hypothesis that you are
testing. Statistical analysis should be carried out.
Response: In response to this comment, we have thus extended the discussion section.
Several aspects of the results were discussed in more detailed.
11.The paper should be proof read and all abbreviations need to be defined.
Response: the paper has been carefully revised and proof read, hope can make our
manuscript more readable.

1.The reason for using tree-augmented naive Bayesian structure is presented on (page
4, line 6): "The tree augmented naïve Bayes combines the ability of Bayesian networks..."
However, in the subsequent paragraph, how it is used to build the learning style
classification model is not sufficiently explained. A few more sentences explaining the
mapping of a tree-augmented Bayesian network in the problem domain and the reason
why it is better compared to an ordinary Bayesian network would greatly improve the clarity
the explanation at that stage.
Response: We very much appreciate the careful reading of our manuscript and valuable
suggestions. We have revised the whole paragraph to compare the proposed approach
with ordinary Bayesian network and naïve Bayesian in this domain. In additional, we have
clarified the reason of choosing tree augmented naïve Bayesian method for improving the
detection precision.
2.In the discussion just before the Conclusion section (page 16), the phrase "...because
the tree augmented naïve algorithm loosens the conditional independence assumption
which is consistent with the reality." needs to be explained in the context of the experiment.
Response: In response to this comment, we have added a brief explanation in relation to
the experiment.
3.Does the tree-augmented approach always perform better than the naive method in all
situations (i.e., there are many online courses with lots of variations in their delivery)? Is its
performance consistent, or are there course delivery factors that can affect its performance?
The authors should discuss this issue sufficiently since it is typical to have many courses
in a particular online study program.
Response: thank the reviewer for the suggestions. Due to this is pilot experiment, only
tested within specific platform and subject, there is no sufficient data to test its performance
consistency. We have pointed out this as limitation of current study.

The reviewer has examined the amendments made by the authors, however it is felt that
some of the comments have not been fully addressed:
1) In the first version of the paper, it was requested that the words “learning efficiency” be
defined – the authors have responded by changing this phrase and replacing it with
“learning effectiveness” - this phrase must be defined. For example, what was the
metrics used in the study to give a measure meant of learning effectiveness? - Was
learning gain part of these metrics?
Response: we appreciate the careful reading and comments. The focus of the paper is not
to discuss the "learning effectiveness" -- given that there is no pre- and post-test conducted
in the main experiment to gauge the "learning effectiveness". The focus is just about the
precision of the learning style detection using tree augmented naïve Bayesian. The first
and second sentences of the abstract mislead the readers thinking that aside from
measuring the accuracy and precision of the detection. We have rephrased these
sentences to indicate the importance of learning styles detection.
2) There have been minor updates to the references – but still I feel the more recent
references suggested could have been added –
Response: thank the reviewer for the comments. More recent references were updated
and added.
3) The discussion that accompanies the results could be in more depth – especially in
relation to the impact of the work – based on the “learning effectiveness”.
Response: as mentioned in comment 1, there is no pre- and post-test conducted in the
main experiment to gauge the "learning effectiveness". But, we have extended discussion
section to explain how the precision can be improved compared to ordinary Bayesian in
the context of the experiment in more detail.
4) The authors have stated that they have used Moodle (which I am very familiar) as the
learning system in this paper. I am unsure of the connection between the students pre-set
learning styles and how they will be presented with static material on Moodle. If I am a
visual learner, does this mean I only see media / video options of material or this is
recommended to me? I think, the relationship between the functionality and offerings of
Moodle and how the Bayesian network utilises these offerings in relation to learning style
needs to be clarified.
Response: on Moodle, it presented with same static material to all students, all learning
materials were well-balance for different learning style dimensions. We inferred the values
of the nodes corresponding to the dimensions of a learning style given evidences of the
student’s behavior with the system. We have clarified this in section 4.4.

1. There are still typographical and grammatical errors, such as:
- Page 5, second para: It should be "In this paper, we propose (a) new approach ... to
improve (the precision of learning style prediction)."
- Page 5, title of Subsection I.2: It should be "Learning Styles Revisit(ed)"
Please proofread your manuscript once again. –
Response: we appreciate the careful reading. The manuscript has been carefully revised
and proof read again, hope can make our manuscript more readable.
2. Page 18, para 3 (after Table 11):
This paragraph discusses the results of the TANB method and states the superiority of the
method compared to the Bayesian method. However, the authors seem not to be very sure
about the reason: "... has higher precision than the Bayesian network, a POSSIBLE reason
is that ...". Please be confirmed on this and provide stronger arguments, since this is an
important point that may lead to high-level, application-oriented implications of the results
which may become interesting topics for further research. –
Response: thank the reviewer for the comments. We have revised the sentence,
furthermore, we have added more discussion to explain the results, more references were
added as well to support our findings.
