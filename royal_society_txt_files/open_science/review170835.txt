Comments on Mares et al.
This paper represents data for 6-9 years on reproductive variables in a passerine bird in an arid
African environment. The authors use AIC as a means of distinguishing among different
candidate models in order to assess the relative strength of the correlation between demographic
variables and temperature and precipitation, respectively. Mares et al. report correlations
between both these weather variables and reproduction. The paper is well written and the data
are properly analyzed.
Major comments:
1. Causation. The authors state numerous times that variable X affected or influenced variable Y,
even when their data are entirely correlational. This is unwarranted, and the authors should
revise the text and delete all such causal statements. Clearly numerous other factors may account
for these effects so there is no strong basis for such claims.
2. AIC. The authors stick to delta AIC < 2, while most ecologists nowadays use a cut-off of AIC =
6.
3. Nest predation. The authors mention snake predation, but eventually never get around to
quantify the cause of nest failure. This means that it is unclear whether failure is due to weather,
food, predation or any combination of these variables.
4. Northern vs. southern hemisphere. The authors mention in a couple of places that the effects of
temperature and precipitation are stronger in one hemisphere than another, but then in other
places their conclusions are not so clear. I am not convinced that there is any difference for a
given level of temperature or precipitation.
Other comments:
1 3-4: You cannot really write ‘influenced by’ when you are writing about correlations. You could
state ‘are correlated with’
2 20-25: It is not obvious why northern and southern species should differ
2 30: Order keywords alphabetically.
3 7-9: You need a reference for temperature being more predictable than precipitation.

Authors studied the breeding output of an arid-land passerine based on a relatively long dataset
in relation to rainfall and temperature. While the authors provide some interesting results, others
should be improved. I have three main concerns:
Probability of breeding. P8, L14-22. I see your reasoning (“the number of pairs that initiated a
clutch (i.e. successes) and the number of pairs that did not breed (i.e. failures: all potential
breeding pairs minus those that initiated a clutch) in each colony in a given season, were fitted as
the two-vector response variable”) too complicated to be followed. Indeed, in your Fig. 3 you
show a more ‘traditional’ approach, that is, the percentage. Thus, I recommend you to analyze
this rate with a GLMM with a binomial distribution and logit-link function as implemented in the
package lme4.
Rainfall in the previous breeding season. P7, L22-24. I see here a problem, as this would make
sense if the females you study were already breeders the previous year. However, you include
also 2-year old females that could be yearlings the previous year, and very likely non-
reproductive females (P4, L40-41). Furthermore, several factors could have influenced the
‘quality’ (i.e., more of less stressful) of previous breeding season (for instance, its duration). I
think you should remove this variable, as too many confounding factors arise. Speak about trade-
offs between current and future investment in breeding (P11, L6-7), without knowing who is
breeding is clearly overambitious.
Colony size. You have no single word in your Discussion about the effect of colony size.
However, I think your results regarding this variable are sometimes artifacts (or simply obvious),
and I think you should explain why you do not think so (as I guess you don’t agree with me). If
there are more pairs in a colony, I would expect a longer breeding season as there is higher
chance of an individual to start breeding, following him the rest of the colony as breeding is often
linked to conspecific behaviour (P8, L13-15 “Breeding seasons were also longer for larger
colonies”). Larger colonies are also expected to have larger number of clutches (P8, L55-56 “The
number of clutches also increased with colony size”) and fledglings (P9, L6 “The number of
fledglings produced increased with colony size”). In P10, L10-12 “Longer breeding seasons
typically involved an increase in the mean number of clutches laid, from 8 to 35 per colony
4
during the shortest and longest breeding seasons”, is this increase proportional to colony size? To
be honest, I have no clear how could you control for colony size, but I am pretty sure that you
should do it.
Also, as several birds were ringed (P4, L11), I wonder whether you could explore (even with a
data subset) the role of female traits (identity, age) in breeding parameters.
Minor comments:
P3, L26-29. You could close this sentence by citing again those references suggesting the role of
temperature on breeding in arid-land birds, because, as commented below, I think you should
give more importance to these works that studied your same topic.
P5, L11-14. I do not understand your sentence “opting for simpler models (those with fewer
estimated parameters) when more than one model had <U+0394>AIC < 2 and similar fits to the data in
terms of log-likelihood [42]” as 1) it is complicated that two models have exactly the same AICc;
and, 2) AICc already accounts for the number of parameters [AICc=AIC+ 2K (K+1) / (n-K-1)]. See
also P8, L35-36.
P6, L1-14. When you say “the best measure” do you mean “the best predictor”? The same applies
to temperature. Why a lag of six days? Any biological reason? Why did you not use for
temperature the same lag (7, 15, 30 days) as for the rainfall?
P6, L31-38. If the term was finally dropped, delete this paragraph!
P7, L52-54. Rephrase as if you write “the year”, you should write “were highest”, don’t you think
so? However, I prefer something like “the higher the spring temperature and the recent rain, the
earlier the sociable weavers began breeding”.
P8, L26-28. Remove “(with an AICc within 2 of the model with the lowest <U+0394>AIC)”.
I do not understand why you discuss on the effects of weather on the reproduction of northern
species (P9, L32-43), and you do not do the same with those works that previously studied your
topic in arid-lands (e.g., refs 20, 21 or 23).

Reviewer: 1
RM: Many thanks for revising the manuscript and for your constructive and insightful comments.
Major comments:
1. Causation. The authors state numerous times that variable X affected or influenced variable Y, even
when their data are entirely correlational. This is unwarranted, and the authors should revise the text
and delete all such causal statements. Clearly numerous other factors may account for these effects so
there is no strong basis for such claims.
RM: Thank you for pointing this out. We agree that speaking of correlations is most appropriate for our
type of study, and have revised the whole manuscript accordingly.
2. AIC. The authors stick to delta AIC < 2, while most ecologists nowadays use a cut-off of AIC = 6.
RM: While a cut-off of 2 is still widely used in behavioural ecology studies, we agree that a cut-off of 6
may be preferable in some/most cases and that using a different cut-off should be justified. We have
now added in the manuscript, that we used a stringent <U+0394>AIC cut-off (i.e. < 2, for considering only
models with substantial support) because we were attempting to find parsimonious models within
candidate sets that included correlated climatic variables and nested models (line 154). There is no
clear-cut rule for how best to use AIC model selection in these cases (see Burnham & Anderson 2002;
Freckleton 2011), and we believe that using a less stringent cut-off of 6 would not be of much use for
arriving at a subset of best models.
3. Nest predation. The authors mention snake predation, but eventually never get around to quantify the
cause of nest failure. This means that it is unclear whether failure is due to weather, food, predation or
any combination of these variables.
RM: We were interested in determining the climatic factors that are correlated with numbers of clutches
and fledglings produced, and to do so, controlled for predation rate within each colony (i.e. nest failure
attributable to snakes) – we have now rephrased to make this clear (lines 249-250). Attempts to further
quantify predation by snakes are in the following cited (line 131) paper: Covas et al. 2008. Behav. Ecol.
Sociobiol. 63, 103–112. It would not be possible to further tease apart the effects of temperature/rainfall
on food availability from, for example, direct physiological effects in our observational study.
4. Northern vs. southern hemisphere. The authors mention in a couple of places that the effects of
temperature and precipitation are stronger in one hemisphere than another, but then in other places
their conclusions are not so clear. I am not convinced that there is any difference for a given level of
temperature or precipitation.
RM: Thank you for pointing this out, we agree. By mentioning that most studies are from northern
species, we were merely highlighting the point that most long-term studies on the effects of
rain/temperature on breeding come from northern, temperate-region species. We agree, however, that
this may be unnecessary and can lead to confusion, so have focused on the important contrast between
“temperate” and “subtropical, arid” environments.
Other comments:
1 3-4: You cannot really write ‘influenced by’ when you are writing about correlations. You could state
‘are correlated with’.
RM: Changed as suggested.
2 20-25: It is not obvious why northern and southern species should differ.
RM: Deleted ‘northern’ as not relevant to this statement.
2 30: Order keywords alphabetically.
RM: Changed as suggested.
3 7-9: You need a reference for temperature being more predictable than precipitation.
RM: Added Noy-Meir I. 1973. Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 4, 25–51.
3 35-36: Please add a reference.
RM: Added Covas et al. 2002. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 269, 1905–1909.
3 49: Again ‘influence’ is too strong a word for correlations.
RM: As we are not talking about the results of any particular study here – we are simply stating that we
don’t know how the amount or timing of rainfall influences reproductive parameters – we have left it as
is.
3 51-52: ‘affect’ is too strong.
RM: Changed to ‘correlated’.
3 53-54” ‘effects’ is too strong.
RM: Changed to ‘correlations’
4 43-44: see details.
RM: Changed as suggested.
4 48-49: latter were not.
RM: Changed as suggested.
4 52-53: Please report sample size.
RM: Done.
7 42-45: Please add df.
RM: This section on daily predation rates has been edited for clarity, and the statistical comparison
(which would require that we mention the df as rightly pointed out) no longer applies.
9 7-8: no significant effect
RM: Changed to “no clear correlation”.
9 47-49: Clearly rainfall is a superior determinant of termite swarming than temperature.
RM: We have toned down the statement referred to here, to clarify that temperature may be a
contributing factor, rather than the main factor.
10 2-7: See also Behav. Ecol. 18:62-70, 2007.
RM: Thank you. We’ve cited the results of the work on this species (plus others) by using the following
reference: Møller et al. 2010. J. Anim. Ecol. 79, 777–784.
11 11-15: Do not report results in the discussion.
RM: Thank you for pointing this out. We have rephrased to: “...and there is some evidence to suggest
that the number of potential breeders (i.e. adults aged two years or older) drops below colony means
after years of low rainfall (R. Mares, unpublished)”
Table S2: duration of the breeding season.
RM: We’ve kept it as “length” rather than “duration” to be consistent with the rest of the manuscript.
Reviewer: 2
RM: Many thanks for revising the manuscript and for your constructive and insightful comments.
Major comments:
1. Probability of breeding. P8, L14-22. I see your reasoning (“the number of pairs that initiated a clutch
(i.e. successes) and the number of pairs that did not breed (i.e. failures: all potential breeding pairs
minus those that initiated a clutch) in each colony in a given season, were fitted as the two-vector
response variable”) too complicated to be followed. Indeed, in your Fig. 3 you show a more ‘traditional’
approach, that is, the percentage. Thus, I recommend you to analyse this rate with a GLMM with a
binomial distribution and logit-link function as implemented in the package lme4.
RM: Thank you for pointing out the lack of clarity. The method we used is a way of conducting a
weighted regression for proportion data in R, and in our study, allows accounting for differences in the
number of potential breeding pairs across colonies (range = 2 – 75). Given the differences in numbers,
we think ours is a more appropriate method than an unweighted regression (i.e. using only
percentages), but we acknowledge that the text was not clear. We have edited the text and added a
reference.
2. Rainfall in the previous breeding season. P7, L22-24. I see here a problem, as this would make sense
if the females you study were already breeders the previous year. However, you include also 2-year old
females that could be yearlings the previous year, and very likely non-reproductive females (P4, L40-
41). Furthermore, several factors could have influenced the ‘quality’ (i.e., more of less stressful) of
previous breeding season (for instance, its duration). I think you should remove this variable, as too
many confounding factors arise. Speak about trade-offs between current and future investment in
breeding (P11, L6-7), without knowing who is breeding is clearly overambitious.
RM: Thank you for pointing this out – we agree that ‘rainfall in the previous season’ needs to be treated
with caution, but argue that it is important to include the term in our study. We have clarified our
justification for including this term in our models (line 229: “Rainfall in the previous breeding season
(406 mm [226 to 652]), was also included as a predictor given its expected effect on current food
availability [55]”) and expanded our discussion incorporating the above comments (lines 388-402).
3. Colony size. You have no single word in your Discussion about the effect of colony size. However, I
think your results regarding this variable are sometimes artifacts (or simply obvious), and I think you
should explain why you do not think so (as I guess you don’t agree with me). If there are more pairs in
a colony, I would expect a longer breeding season as there is higher chance of an individual to start
breeding, following him the rest of the colony as breeding is often linked to conspecific behaviour (P8,
L13-15 “Breeding seasons were also longer for larger colonies”). Larger colonies are also expected to
have larger number of clutches (P8, L55-56 “The number of clutches also increased with colony size”)
and fledglings (P9, L6 “The number of fledglings produced increased with colony size”). In P10, L10-12
“Longer breeding seasons typically involved an increase in the mean number of clutches laid, from 8 to
35 per colony during the shortest and longest breeding seasons”, is this increase proportional to colony
size? To be honest, I have no clear how could you control for colony size, but I am pretty sure that you
should do it.
RM: We agree with what has been pointed out here, and purposefully had not discussed the results for
colony size, as it was simply included in all models to control for its expected correlations with all
dependent variables – we have now clarified this in the manuscript (lines 207 and 231). Indeed, some of
these correlations are obvious and therefore the term needed to be included in the models. Regarding
the statement in P10 (now line 349), the observed increase in number of clutches per colony with
breeding season length is not proportional to colony size (i.e. colony size was not correlated to length of
the breeding season). We agree that this was unclear, and have now included the information in the
manuscript.
4. Also, as several birds were ringed (P4, L11), I wonder whether you could explore (even with a data
subset) the role of female traits (identity, age) in breeding parameters.
RM: The aim of our study was to look at reproduction parameters at the colony level. We agree that an
individual based study (with a likely reduced sample size) would also be interesting and contribute to
exploring further the roles of temperature and rainfall in breeding – this, however, is beyond the scope
of the work presented in our manuscript.
Minor comments:
P3, L26-29. You could close this sentence by citing again those references suggesting the role of
temperature on breeding in arid-land birds, because, as commented below, I think you should give more
importance to these works that studied your same topic.
RM: Thank you for pointing this out. We’ve added the following to line 74: “In arid regions, temperature
may also be used as a cue for breeding [23]...”. We’ve also incorporated the suggestion of putting our
results in the context of previous studies in arid regions (see below).
P5, L11-14. I do not understand your sentence “opting for simpler models (those with fewer estimated
parameters) when more than one model had <U+0394>AIC < 2 and similar fits to the data in terms of log-
likelihood [42]” as 1) it is complicated that two models have exactly the same AICc; and, 2) AICc
already accounts for the number of parameters [AICc=AIC+ 2K (K+1) / (n-K-1)]. See also P8, L35-36.
RM: This is based on work by Burnham & Anderson (2002) and Arnold (2010), among others. Burnham
& Anderson (2002) suggest that “models having <U+0394>AIC within about 0–2 units of the best model should
be examined to see whether they differ from the best model by 1 parameter and have essentially the
same values of the maximized log-likelihood as the best model. In this case, the larger model is not
really supported or competitive, but rather is “close” only because it adds 1 parameter and therefore will
be within 2 <U+0394>AIC units, even though the fit, as measured by the log-likelihood value, is not improved.”
Arnold (2010) writes: “Such models are 2 <U+0394>AIC units because the penalty for one additional parameter
is +2 AIC units, but model deviance is not reduced by an amount sufficient to overcome the 2-unit
penalty and, hence, the additional parameter provides no net reduction in AIC.” This applies to both AIC
and AICc (Arnold 2010).
P6, L1-14. When you say “the best measure” do you mean “the best predictor”? The same applies to
temperature. Why a lag of six days? Any biological reason? Why did you not use for temperature the
same lag (7, 15, 30 days) as for the rainfall?
RM: Yes, we mean “the best predictor” and have changed the text as suggested. We included a lag of six
days for an effect of rainfall based on observational work by Maclean (1984), which we have cited. We
did not include a lag for temperature, as seasonal changes are more gradual than those for rainfall, and
the measures used in our study (daily and average over the previous 30 days with linear weighting)
should reflect these changes.
P6, L31-38. If the term was finally dropped, delete this paragraph!
RM: We think it’s important to mention that we had planned to include the term, especially because it is
included in all the other analyses, but have moved the original statement from the main text to the
supplementary material.
P7, L52-54. Rephrase as if you write “the year”, you should write “were highest”, don’t you think so?
However, I prefer something like “the higher the spring temperature and the recent rain, the earlier the
sociable weavers began breeding”.
RM: Thank you, we agree that the phrasing was confusing, so have deleted “the year”.
P8, L26-28. Remove “(with an AICc within 2 of the model with the lowest <U+0394>AIC)”.
RM: Deleted as suggested.
I do not understand why you discuss on the effects of weather on the reproduction of northern species
(P9, L32-43), and you do not do the same with those works that previously studied your topic in arid-
lands (e.g., refs 20, 21 or 23).
RM: Thank you for pointing this out. We have edited and added the following to put our work in the
context of previous studies on correlations between temperature and laying dates: “Our results suggest
that temperature is also an important cue for breeding in subtropical arid regions, and support those
from a two-year study in another arid-region species, the trumpeter finch (Bucanetes githagineus),
which showed that low temperatures were correlated with a delay in reproduction [23]” We also discuss
results from work in temperate regions because this is where most long-term breeding data comes
from.
