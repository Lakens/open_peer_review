General comments:
It was a pleasure reading this manuscript. It was well written and the Material and Methods
section give a clear overview about the planning and execution of the experiment and the many
aspects of the statistical analysis, which makes it easier to follow your many results.
The manuscript offers a new facet in the factors that influence underground nest excavation in
social insects and hints at a possible connection to social immunity. It might be well worth
exploring the question of ants ‘immune priming’ when excavating a nest.
I only have some minor comments (see below). There is only one thing I was missing.
While the discussion examines the details of the results, you should add some sentences that
answer the questions that the reader will have when reading your title. How does soil
contamination impact nest growth? And how does it impact the shape of an ant nest? If you add
a short few-sentence answer to these main questions at the end of the discussion (although I have
seen some authors put these at the beginning of the discussion before going into the details), I
think this would be a good and memorable ‘take-home’ message to readers.
Abstract:
I am missing the description of the methods used. You go directly from your scientific question to
your results.
Line 37: I do not understand your argumentation of the first part of the sentence ‘could be used as
a cue for selecting suitable nesting sites’. Are you saying that non-lethal doses of fungal spores
make a site more suitable? Please reformulate this sentence.

Discussion:
Line 303: You wrote the experiments were conducted in a dark box so to enable taking photos to
reveal shape transition. But did you conduct some pre-experiment in the lab where you exposed
workers to spore-infected sand and observed whether there was noticeable grooming behaviour?

Line 316: Is something known about the natural levels of these spores in soil? Are they higher or
lower than the used level?
Line 348: Were the colonies used in the study collected close to one another or from different
sites, which might account for their different displayed preferences for either contaminated or
non-contaminated soil. It might have been interesting to analyse the spore-contamination rate in
the soil around the collected colonies to have an indication whether the workers would benefit
from ‘immune priming’.
Also, as you mentioned social immunity in the introduction. In the discussion, you could link two
arguments to social immunity. First, avoidance of contact with fungal spores (line: 311-313) and
second your argument about ‘immune priming’ (line: 346-347). The concept of social immunity,
whether it is displayed by the ants by either avoiding or actively seeking fungal spores, should
not be left out of the discussion.

23 ABSTRACT
24 As entomopathogens are detrimental to the development or even survival of insect societies,
25 the ant colonies should avoid digging into a substrate that is contaminated by fungal spores.
26 Here, we test the hypotheses that Myrmica rubra ant workers 1) detect and avoid fungus-
27 infected substrates, and 2) excavate nest patterns that minimize their exposure to
28 entomopathogenic spores. Small groups of M. rubra workers were allowed to dig their nest in
29 a 2D-sand plate of which one half of the substrate contained fungal spores of Metarhizium
30 brunneum while the other was spore-free. We found that the overall digging dynamics of M.
31 rubra nests was not altered by the presence of fungus spores. By contrast, the shape of the
32 excavated areas markedly differed: control nests showed rather isotropic patterns whereas
33 nests that were partially dug into a fungus-contaminated substrate, markedly deviated from a
34 circular shape. This demonstrates that the sanitary risks associated to a digging substrate are
35 key-factors in nest morphogenesis. We also found that M. rubra colonies were able to
36 discriminate between the two substrates (fungus-infected or not). Furthermore, some colonies
37 unexpectedly showed a high consistency in excavating mainly the infected substrate. This
38 seemingly suboptimal preference for a contaminated soil suggests that non-lethal doses of
39 fungal spores could help ant colonies to trigger “immune priming”. The presence of fungi
40 may also indicate favourable ecological conditions, such as humid and humus-rich soil, that
41 ants use as a cue for selecting suitable nesting sites.

47 INTRODUCTION
48 Insect societies have developed a complex network of social interactions that allow them to
49 achieve efficient cooperation for the benefit of the whole colony. These patterns of
50 interactions are shaped, at least partially, by the spatial structure of the nest. Nest patterns
51 result from stigmergic processes in which the built-structure acts as feedback on the digging
52 behaviour of individuals, leading to adaptive, self-organized patterns, without the need for any
53 template, centralized control, or even direct communication between nestmates [1-3].
54 Although composed of basic building modules such as chambers interconnected by galleries
55 [4], the nest patterns of insect societies can highly diverse, from non-ramified to tree-like
56 structures [4]. These structures can be modified in order to meet specific functional values
57 such as thermoregulation [5], food storage [6], nest ventilation [7] or protection against
58 intruders and predators [8,9]. In particular, the nest acts as an effective physical barrier against
59 pathogens [8,10]. Furthermore, by spatially organizing interactions between workers, the nest
60 structure can limit contact between pathogen-exposed foragers located in the peripheral nest
61 chambers and inner-nest individuals, such as larvae or queens [8]. Seen in this way, the nest
62 pattern can be considered as part of the social immunity, a term describing the colony-level
63 disease protection resulting from cooperation between nestmate individuals [11]. Since the
64 location and the structure of collectively-built nests will condition the level of ants’ exposure
65 to soil pathogens, the digging patterns should be considered as organizational components of
66 social immunity that, together with behavioural and physiological adaptations, prevent
67 pathogen uptake and transmission in the ant colony..
68 The topological features of a nest reflect both the intrinsic features of the colony and the
69 characteristics of its environment. In the case of subterranean nests built by social insects, the
70 colony-size [2,4,12,13], as well as environmental factors, such as humidity [14], temperature
71 [15] or granulometry of the digging substrate [16] regulate the digging behaviours of
72 individuals and thus the final shape of their nest. The contamination of the soil by pathogens
73 can also influence the digging activity of termites and ants. For instance, Coptotermes lacteus
74 termites display an avoidance response or dug out shorter tunnels into substrates infected by
75 Metarhizium brunneum fungus [17]. Likewise, Solenopsis invicta ant workers selectively
76 avoid building their nest in nematode-infected soils [18]. However, some counter-examples
77 exist, for example Formica selysi queens [19] and Monomorium pharaonis ant workers [20]
78 show a strong preference for fungus contaminated nests as opposed to spore-free nests. In the
79 present study, we challenged Myrmica rubra ant colonies with soil patches infected by M.
80 bruneum spores. We investigated whether the choice of the substrate, the digging dynamics,
81 as well as the size and topology of the nest were influenced by the presence of potentially
82 harmful pathogens. For this, we tested small groups of 50 Myrmica rubra workers in a two
83 dimensional digging setup [13,16] in which one half of the substrate contained fungal spores
84 of Metarhizium brunneum while the other was spore-free. This allowed us to assess whether a
85 contaminated substrate leads to a decrease of excavated soil as well as to a nest topology that
86 minimizes the level of ants’ exposure to fungus spores.

89 METHOD
90 Maintenance of ant colonies
91
92 Eleven colonies of Myrmica rubra ants containing one queen, 200 to 300 workers and brood
93 were used for the experiments. In the laboratory, each colony was reared in a plastic tray
94 (Janet type: 47 x 29cm) in which the floor was covered with plaster and the borders coated
95 with Polyetrafluoroethylene (Fluon, Whitford, UK) to prevent ants from escaping. A square
96 10 cm wide glass plate, placed three millimetres above the ground and covered with a red
97 filter, was used as a nest ceiling. Each colony was fed with one mealworm (Tenebrio molitor)
98 three times per week while water and sucrose solution (0.3 M) were provided ad libitum.
99 Laboratory conditions were kept at 21 ±1°C and 50 ±5% humidity rate, with a constant
100 photoperiod of 12 hours per day.
101
102 Preparation of spore suspensions
103
104 We used a commercial strain of Metarhizium brunneum fungus (Strain F52 from Novozymes)
105 that is produced in the form of barley grains coated with fungal spores. This generalist
106 entomopathogen fungus is known to kill more than 200 insect species [21] and to prevail in
107 the soil fungi communities of many different biotopes, including those inhabited by Myrmica
108 rubra ants [22,23]. Four barley grains were first put in a Petri dish (55 mm diameter) lined
109 with a thin layer of potato dextrose agar (Sigma-Aldrich). The dish was then placed in an
110 incubator for 14 days at a temperature of 25°C to provide optimal conditions for sporulation.
111 Fresh conidia were then collected in a 5 ml of 0.05% Triton-x solution (Sigma-Aldrich) [24].
112 We estimated spore concentration by counting spores on a haemocytometer (1 µl, ©Brand,
113 ref. 718005) placed under a microscope (x400 magnification). Finally, dilutions were made
114 using 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) to reach a final concentration of around 1× 106
115 spores/ml. In addition, the viability of conidia was determined by placing 5 ml of the final
116 solution of spores on a thin layer of potato dextrose agar and by incubating it at 25°C for four
117 days.
118
119 Preparation of digging substrates
120
121 We used Brusselian sand as a digging substrate. This sand has the great advantage of having a
122 fine and homogeneous granularity that prevents the nest from collapsing during the digging
123 process. Before being used as nest substrate, the sand was sieved and sterilized at a
124 temperature of 100°C for 45 minutes. We then prepare the fungus-contaminated substrate by
125 mixing 25 ml of the spore solution (1× 106 spores/ml) per 100 g of sand. As a control, spore-
126 free substrate was made by adding 25 ml of solution containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.05%
127 Triton-x per 100 g of sterilized sand. The used level of Metarhizium spores (25 104 spores/g
128 soil) was of the same order of magnitude as the natural density of Metarhizium detected in
129 soils (on average 103- 104 CFU g-1 soil reported by Keller et al. 2003). By choosing the upper
130 value of natural spore levels, we faced ants with a clear-cut sanitary challenge that is likely to
131 trigger the avoidance, if any, of fungus-contaminated substrate by ant colonies. Based on the
132 protocol developed by Toffin et al. [13], the digging area of each nest consisted of two glass
133 plates (20 x 20 cm), between which we spread out a thin layer of sand (2 mm high, 180 g) to
134 allow a 2-D view of the digging activity through time. In the case of experimental nests, the
135 digging area consisted in two equal halves (10 x 20 cm) of infected (90 g) and spore-free sand
136 (90 g). The digging area of control nests was made of two halves of spore-free sand.
137
138 Digging activity and nest pattern
139
140 From each of the eleven colonies (hereafter called mother colonies), we randomly sampled
141 three groups of 50 workers: two groups were assigned to the experimental condition
142 (experimental nests, N = 22) and the third one was used as control (control nests, N = 11). The
143 replication of the experimental condition allowed us to assess the effect of the mother colony
144 on the digging response of ants to the contaminated substrate. Each group of 50 workers was
145 dropped into a circular arena (55 mm diameter) to be tested two hours later and was not fed
146 until the end of the experiment to prevent them from being engaged in other tasks than nest
147 excavating ones. This starvation did not reduce the ants’ survival, since less than 2% (mean:
148 1.84% ±0.26, N = 33) of the ants died at the end of the experiment. The nest sand plates were
149 randomly placed in groups of four in a closed wood box to simulate the darkness of natural
150 nests. We started the experiment by connecting the circular arena hosting the group of 50
151 tested ants to a central hole made on the upper glass plate covering the digging area. The
152 connection was made with a vertical plastic tube (3.5 cm) that was filled with clean sand to
153 encourage ants to start digging. The digging process was followed for 40 h once the first ant
154 reached the central hole of the nest sand plate. Snapshots of the digging area were taken under
155 red light every five hours using a Logitech camera (HD Pro C920) placed 20 cm below the
156 glass plates. Image J Software was used to automatically compute both the dug area (A) and
157 the perimeter (P) of the nest for each snapshot. This allowed us to quantify the dynamics of
158 digging activity and to compare nest patterns between the two halves of each nest plate.

163 Non-parametric tests with a significance level of alpha = 0.05 were used since all data did not
164 meet the normality assumption. With regards to the digging activity, a general linear mixed
165 effect model (GLM) was used to investigate the effect of treatment (control vs. experimental
166 nests), colony and time on the area excavated by colonies. Colony and treatment were treated
167 as categorical variables, whereas time was considered as a continuous variable. Moreover,
168 time and treatment were specified as fixed effects, colony as a random effect and replicates as
169 a nested random factor within colony to account for the repeated measurements performed on
170 mother colonies [25]. Full models included treatment (control or experimental nest), colony
171 and time as explanatory variables, and time by treatment interaction. In addition, we used a
172 Mann-Withney U test to compare the final excavated volumes between control and
173 experimental nests.
174 Within each type of nest, we also used GLM analyses to test for the effect of the side (left vs.
175 right side for the control nests or clean vs. infected side for the experimental nests), colony
176 and time on the area excavated by ants. Wilcoxon matched pairs tests were used to compare
177 the final excavated areas between the two sides in the experimental or in the control nests. In
178 order to evidence ants’ preference for a spore-free substrate, we tested whether the number of
179 ant colonies for which the most dug part was the clean half of the setup, differed from random
180 by using a binomial test.
181
182 We characterized nest patterns by their level of digitation as well as by the anisotropy of their
183 shape. As regards the level of digitation in control or in experimental nests, we assessed
184 whether the perimeters of the final excavated areas significantly deviated from those expected
185 from a circular shape, by using Wilcoxon matched pairs test. In the case of a perfect circle,
186 the relationship between the area (A) and the perimeter (P) of a nest can be described by the
187 linear equation log (P)= log(µ) + <U+03C9> log(A), where the parameters’ values are µ = 2vp and <U+03C9> =
188 0.5. For both the control and the experimental nests, the values of µ and <U+03C9> were estimated
189 from the intercept and the slope of regression lines that best fitted log-transformed values of
190 final perimeters as a function of final areas. The slopes and intercepts of these linear fittings
191 were compared between experimental and control nests by using F-tests.
192 As regards the anisotropy of nest shapes, we first measured the maximum and the minimum
193 Feret diameters which are respectively the maximal and the minimal distances between two
194 parallel tangents of the nest shape (Fig. 1). These two values were calculated after considering
195 all possible orientations of tangents (0° to 180°). The aspect ratio, i.e. the maximum over the
196 minimum Feret values, indicates the anisotropy of the pattern [26], with high aspect ratios
197 characterizing patterns that are strongly asymmetrical. The aspect ratios were compared
198 between control and experimental nests by using Mann Whitney U tests.
199 In order to test for a colonial effect on the digging activity, we used Kendall's coefficient of
200 concordance to assess whether experimental groups coming from the same mother colony had
201 excavated similar nest areas at the end of the experiment. In addition, a colonial preference for
202 one type of substrate was assessed by using the McNemar test.

206 Ethical note
207 No licences or permits were required for this research. Ant colonies were collected with care
208 in the field and maintained in nearly natural conditions in the laboratory. Ants were provided
209 with suitable nesting sites, food and water thus minimizing any adverse impact on their
210 welfare. After the experiments, fungal-infected ants were removed from their foraging area to
211 protect colonies from disease spread and were killed by freezing. The rest of the colony was
212 kept in the laboratory and reared during their senescence until their natural death.

214 RESULTS
215 Digging activity
216
217 We found no significant effect of the treatment or time by treatment interaction on nest
218 growth dynamics (GLM: treatment effect: F(1.250)= 0.02; P= 0.88 and time by treatment
219 interaction: F(1.250)= 0.51; P= 0.48. Fig. 2a). However, for both control and experimental
220 nests, there was a highly significant effect of time (GLM: time effect: F(1.250)= 119.02; P<
221 0.001) on the excavated area. Ants were the most active in digging during the 10 first hours
222 with around half of the final total area being excavated (mean of 42.2% and 53.1% for the
223 control and the experimental nests, respectively. Fig. 2a). From 30 h onwards, the digging
224 activity nearly ceased, and the excavated areas increased by only 9.9% for the control nests
225 and by 7.5% for experimental ones during the 10 last hours. Ultimately, a similar excavated
226 area was reached in the control and experimental nests (Median values of 15.2 cm² and 12.1
227 cm² respectively. Mann-Withney U test: U= 90; P= 0.55. Fig. 2a).
228
229 In the control nests, the left and the right side of the sand plates were dug with similar growth
230 dynamics (GLM: Time by side interaction: F(1.162)= 1.68; P= 0.20) and led to the same total
231 area excavated (Median of 6.8 cm² and 6.8 cm² for the left and the right sides, respectively.
232 Wilcoxon matched pairs test: T= 28; P= 0.66. Fig. 2b).
233 Similarly, the growth of dug areas over time in the infected and the clean sides of the
234 experimental nests were not different (GLM: Time by side interaction: F(1.327)= 3.67; P= 0.06.
235 Fig. X), and reached similar final excavated areas (Median of 5.8 cm² and 5.7 cm² for the
236 clean and the infected sides, respectively. Wilcoxon matched pairs test: T= 95; P= 0.31. Fig.
237 2c).
238
239 With regards to the ants’ preference for digging into one side of the setup, the percentage of
240 colonies that mostly dug in the left side (54%, N= 11) of control nests did not differ from
241 random (Binomial test: P= 0.50). This confirmed that there was no bias due to external
242 stimuli or substrate heterogeneities in our sand plates. The most dug part of control nests grew
243 at a rate that was only slightly faster and not significantly different from the least dug one
244 (GLM: Time by side interaction: F(1.162)= 2.42; P= 0.12. Fig. 3a). The findings were quite
245 different for the experimental nests. When considering the growth dynamics in the most dug
246 part, the excavation increased at a significantly higher rate than the least dug part of the setup
247 (GLM: Time by treatment interaction: N= 22; F(1.338)= 30.48; P< 0.001. Fig. 3b). As a result,
248 from 10 hours onwards after the start of the digging activity, the excavated volume became
249 significantly larger in the most dug part of the setup compared to the other side (GLM, Tukey
250 Post-Hoc Test: P= 0.006). Unexpectedly, not all the ant colonies preferred to dig into the
251 spore-free side of the experimental nests. Indeed, the proportion of colonies (55%, N= 22) that
252 had mostly dug the clean half of the setup did not differ from random (Binomial test: P=
253 0.74). Furthermore, differences in the growth dynamics between the most and the least dug
254 side were of the same magnitude, regardless of whether the most dug part was the clean side
255 (GLM: Time by treatment interaction: N= 10; F(1.147)= 13.26; P< 0.001. Fig. 3c) or the
256 infected side (GLM: Time by treatment interaction: N= 12; F(1.177)= 35.58; P< 0.001. Fig. 3d).
257
258
259 Nest pattern
260
261 Due to their digitated contour, the perimeters of the final excavated areas were always higher
262 than those expected from a circular shape of the same area, for both the control and the
263 experimental nests (Wilcoxon Matched pairs tests: T= 0; P= 0.003 and T= 0; P< 0.001 for the
264 control and the experimental nests, respectively. Fig. 4). In addition, control and experimental
265 nests showed the same linear relationship between the ln-transformed final values of the
266 perimeter’s length and excavated area (F-Tests: slopes: F(1.29)= 0.57; P= 0.46; Intercepts:
267 F(1.30)= 0.07; P= 0.79. Fig. 4) demonstrating that deviation from a perfect circle was of the
268 same order of magnitude regardless of soil contamination.
269
270 The anisotropy of nest patterns was estimated by the aspect ratio, i.e. the maximum over the
271 minimum Feret values. These ratios were significantly higher for the experimental nests than
272 for the control ones (Mann-Whitney U test: U= 65; P= 0.03. Fig. 5). Typically, the final
273 pattern of control nests remained rather symmetrical (Fig. 6a), while ants’ digging activity
274 seemed more directional in experimental nests leading to the emergence of long galleries
275 extending preferentially in one side of the setup (Fig. 6b,c).
276
277
278
279
280 Colonial effect
281
282 We found a strong colonial effect on ants’ digging activity (GLM: Colony effects: F(21.327)=
283 9.41; P< 0.001). Indeed, the final excavated areas were highly correlated between the two
284 experimental groups that originated from the same mother colony (Kendall test: t= 0.89; P<
285 0.05). Surprisingly, a colonial effect was also observed in the ants’ preference for a given type
286 of digging substrate. In most cases (nine out of eleven colonies), each pair of experimental
287 groups that came from the same mother colony choose to focus the main part of their digging
288 activity in the same type of substrate (McNemar test: <U+03C7>²= 0.50; P= 0.48). Indeed, the
289 percentages of the total area that were dug into the infected side of the experimental nests and
290 were highly correlated between the two replicates (Fig. 7).

292 DISCUSSION
293 Myrmica rubra ants that were faced, at least during the first steps of digging, with a soil
294 contaminated by fungal spores, excavated nests of which the patterns differed from the
295 symetrical shape of control nests built out of a spore-free substrate. Indeed, the presence of
296 spores in one half of the experimental nests led to anisotropic patterns with a few galleries
297 extending more in one side of the setup. Surprisingly, half of the colonies preferentially dug
298 the contaminated part of the substrate, while the other half of colonies focused excavation in
299 the spore-free side of the setup. In addition, this preference for one type of substrate seemed
300 to be a colonial trait, as shown by the high consistency of choices made by groups of digging
301 ants that were drawn from the same mother colony.
302
303 With regards to the digging activity, M. rubra workers were poorly efficient in nest
304 excavation compared to other ant species such as Lasius niger of which the same number of
305 workers dug out 10 times larger areas [13]. As commonly observed for several ant species
306 [4,13,27,28], the digging dynamics showed a logistic shape. First, the excavation behaviour of
307 ants was amplified by several processes such as the release of attractive digging pheromones
308 [2] and/or through inter-attraction between workers. Then, the excavation rate progressively
309 decreased until the nest volume was adjusted to the size of ants’ population [4,29]. This
310 digging dynamics is usually coupled with morphological transitions from a round to ramified
311 shape of the excavated area [12,13,16,30]. During the first steps of nest excavation, the high
312 density of ants along the initially short perimeter of a nest promotes a uniform digging activity
313 and therefore a round and smooth shape of the nest. Then, as the nest area increases, the
314 average density of digging ants falls to a critical value and small buds appear on the nest
315 perimeter at locations where the number of digging ants was still high. Finally, while the main
316 chamber stops expanding, buds are enlarged and become lateral galleries. In other words, a
317 high density of digging workers promotes a circular main chamber that expands in an
318 isotropic way, whereas a low density of diggers locally promotes the formation of galleries
319 and anisotropic nest patterns. This suggests that the higher level of anisotropy observed in our
320 experimental nests may result from a lower densities of digging ants along the nest perimeter.
321 The lower densities of digging workers could be due to some individuals refraining from
322 excavating and being engaged in other tasks such as increased grooming, once they were
323 initially faced with fungal spores. Therefore, similarly to the colony size [12] or the
324 granularity of the substrate [16], the soil contamination by a pathogen is another factor that
325 has a considerable impact on the nest morphogenesis, most probably by modifying the
326 digging rate and/or local density of digging individuals.
327 Pathogen avoidance is considered a first line of disease defense in animals. In the case of
328 social immunity, insect societies should reduce exposure to sanitary risks by avoiding to dig
329 their nest in contaminated areas. However, in sharp contrast with our expectations, around
330 half of the colonies dug most of their nest area in the infected side of the setup. Excavating in
331 a contaminated substrate appears as a counter-intuitive and maladaptive behaviour since M.
332 brunneum fungus is known to be efficient at killing M. rubra workers [31-35]. These findings
333 also contrast with previous studies reporting that ants actively avoid direct physical contact
334 with entomopathogenic fungi [36-38], possibly by perceiving chemicals emitted by fungal
335 spores [39].
336 Previous studies on Atta sexdens ants [40] and on Macrotermes michaelseni termites [41]
337 showed that workers increasingly avoided fungal pathogens depending on their concentration
338 and their virulence. In our case, the level of soil contamination could be under the threshold
339 that enables the detection of spores by ants or that triggers ants’ avoidance. However, this
340 explanation should be discarded for the two following reasons. First, if the amount of conidia
341 was too low to be detected by ants, the patterns of experimental nests should have been
342 similar and as symmetrical as those of control nests in which ants were faced with a spore-
343 free substrate. Second, since colonies were highly consistent between replicates in
344 preferentially digging into either the infected or the spore-free sand, this strongly suggests that
345 ant workers were able to discriminate between the two substrates. Furthermore, in half of the
346 tested colonies, nestmates even seemed to be attracted by fungal spores as they preferentially
347 dug into the infected substrate. Such an unexpected behaviour was also reported for
348 Monomorium pharaonis ant colonies that display a clear preference for infected sites when
349 they migrate to a new nest [20]. Similarly, young queens of the ant Formica selysi are
350 attracted to nest sites contaminated with Beauveria and Metarhizium pathogens [19] although
351 the latter are known to be responsible for a considerable rate of failures during colony
352 foundation by soil-nesting species [19,42].
353 From a functional perspective, the seemingly suboptimal preference shown by some colonies
354 for a substrate containing live entomopathogenic fungus may be explained in several ways.
355 First, the fungal pathogen may have manipulated the ants by luring them with odour cues in
356 order to increase its probability to contaminate the whole ant colony. However, host
357 manipulation often results from a process of co-evolution between the host and highly
358 specialized parasites. This is not the case with Metarhizium fungus which targets a broad
359 spectrum of insect hosts [21]. Together with the strong selection pressure usually exerted on
360 hosts to resist manipulation [37], a fungus-driven attraction of ants to infected substrate
361 appears an unlikely phenomenon in our case. Second, while being potentially a sanitary
362 challenge for the ants, the presence of fungi may also be a cue associated with suitable nesting
363 sites, indicating favourable ecological conditions, such as humid and humus-rich soil [37].
364 Finally, regardless of substrate contamination, the similar death rates observed in all colonies
365 after 40 hours of digging, indicate that the amount of conidia present in the soil was not a
366 lethal threat for the ants. Previous studies found that contacts with a pathogen at non-lethal
367 doses reduce the susceptibility of individuals to later exposure to the same pathogen [43-45]
368 or others [46]. Although still controversial in invertebrates [47,48], this process of “immune
369 priming” could trigger the upregulation of specific immune genes involved in antifungal
370 responses [49,50]. By enhancing the survival of group members to a later pathogen challenge,
371 immune priming may be an important physiological component of social immunity that
372 increases fitness gain at the colony level. The observed preference of some ant colonies for
373 infected sites could therefore be an adaptive strategy for the host that leads to a colony-wide
374 ‘‘vaccination’’ if all nestmates come into contact with a low level of contaminated soil. In
375 order to be beneficial, such a vaccination-effect requires the probability of re-encountering the
376 same pathogen to be high, which is the case here since M. rubra ants and M. brunneum
377 fungus naturally occur in the same habitats [22,23].
378
379 Overall, we showed that M. rubra colonies are able to discriminate between substrates on the
380 basis of their pathogenicity, displaying either avoidance of or attraction to the contaminated
381 substrate. Mechanisms that underlie such discrimination remain unclear but led to anisotropic
382 nest patterns, thereby demonstrating the key-role of soil biotic factors on nest morphogenesis.
383 The preference for fungal-infected soils seems to be a colonial trait and may be associated
384 with factors that are beneficial to the colony. Further investigations are still needed to
385 understand whether these two distinct nesting strategies are based on genetic factors, are due
386 to different features of ants’ nesting biotopes or outcome from differences in life-history traits
387 of ant colonies such as their previous exposure to entomopathogenic fungi.
388 To conclude, we found that the pathogen load of a digging substrate is a key-factor in nest
389 morphogenesis. The presence of entomopathogenic spores in the soil does not alter the
390 growth dynamics of excavated nests but makes their shape less isotropic with a few long
391 galleries extending in the substrate. Quite unexpectedly, pathogen avoidance was not
392 systematic as some colonies even showed the opposite preference of fungus-contaminated
393 substrate. The relevance of this seemingly suboptimal preference remains to be investigated.
394 The present study is a first report of pathogen-induced changes in collectively-built nests and
395 more work is needed to understand this relatively unexplored area of disease defence in social
396 insects.

600 Fig. 1. Characterization of the nest anisotropy. The aspect ratio is given by the maximum over the minimum
601 values of Feret diameters. High values of the aspect ratio characterize patterns that are strongly asymmetrical.
602 Part 1 of the setup was made of spore-free substrate in all the nests. Part 2 was made either of spore-free
603 substrate in the control nests or of fungus-contaminated substrate in the experimental nests.

605 Fig. 2. Dynamics of excavated areas (median ± Interquartile range) (a) in control (N= 11) and experimental nests
606 (N= 22), (b) in the left vs. the right side of the control nests and (c) in the fungus-contaminated vs. the spore-free
607 side of the experimental nests.

609 Fig. 3. Dynamics of excavated areas (median ± Interquartile range) in the most dug part (filled symbols) and in
610 the least dug part (empty symbols) in the case of (a) control nests or of (b) experimental nests. Change of the
611 excavated area (median ±SD) over time when (c) the clean side (N= 10) or (d) the infected side (N= 12) was the
612 most dug part of the experimental nests.

614 Fig. 4. Final perimeters (P) as a function of final excavated areas (A) in control nests (N= 11; empty circles) and
615 in experimental nests (N= 22; filled triangles). Data values were log-transformed. Then, they were best-fitted by
616 regression lines of which the equations were Log (P)= 0.86 x Log (A) + 0.69 (R2= 0.92, black plain line) for
617 control nests and Log(P)= 0.72 x Log(A) + 0.84 (R2= 0.59, black dashed line) for experimental nests. As a
618 reference, the red line illustrates the expected length of perimeter as a function of the excavated area in the case
619 of a circular shape.
