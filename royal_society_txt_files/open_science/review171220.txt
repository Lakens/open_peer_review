The manuscript entitled of “Optimization of Methylene Blue removal by stable emulsified liquid
membrane using Plackett-Burman and Box-Behnken designs of experiments” reports the effect of
diluents and operating parameters on the stability of an emulsified liquid membrane (Span80 as
surfactant, D2EHPA as extractant and sulphuric acid as internal phase) based on Plackett-
Burman design. Using the stable emulsified liquid membrane, the removal of methylene blue was
also investigated. This manuscript is complete and logically organized, and the experiments are
well designed and conducted. However, the novelty of this manuscript is not clear enough, and
there are many grammar errors in the manuscript (particularly in Experimental Section and
Results and Discussion Section). Therefore, this manuscript is recommended to be published in
Royal Society Open Science after a major revision.
1. The authors have published several articles “Journal of the Taiwan Institute of Chemical
Engineers 59 (2016): 26-32”, “Energy Procedia 50 (2014): 1008-1016” and “Energy Procedia 36
(2013): 1232-1240” to remove dyes using an emulsified liquid membrane. The methods and
discussion used in those articles are quite similar as this manuscript. Please give a brief
introduction on the recent progress of dye removal using emulsified liquid membranes, and
further elaborate the novelty of this manuscript.
2. There are so many grammar errors in the manuscript (particularly in Experimental Section and
Results and Discussion Section). Please correct all of them throughout the manuscript. For
example,
Page 3, Line 29-30: “It is a viscous yellow liquid, having a hydrophilic/lipophilic balance of…”
should be changed to “It is a viscous yellow liquid with a hydrophilic/lipophilic balance of…”.
Page 3, Line 30-32: “The mobile transporter of dyes… very soluble in organic solvents.” should be
changed to “The mobile transporter of dyes… is very soluble in organic solvents.”.
Page 3, Line 40-41: “Sulphuric acid… was used in the internal aqueous phase as dye-acceptor
stripping agents, was supplied by Fluka.” should be changed to “Sulphuric acid (Fluka)… was
used in the internal aqueous phase as dye-acceptor stripping agents.”.
Page 3, Line 41-43: “The methylene blue (cationic dye) chemical formula… taken as pollutant
model and provided by Sigma Aldrich.” should be changed to “The methylene blue (cationic
dye) with chemical formula… was taken as pollutant model and provided by Sigma Aldrich.”.
Page 3, Line 44-45: “Then, using a mechanical stirrer type RW20 Kjank & Kunkel for…” should be
changed to “Then a mechanical stirrer type RW20 Kjank & Kunkel was used for…”.
Page 3, Line 51: “H2S04” should be changed to “H2SO4”.
Page 3, Line 53-56: “after 10 minutes of contact time, the pH of external phase decrease because
the leakage of H ions in the external phase this phenomena nominated emulsion brakeage (B)
determined by application of a balance material vis-a-vis ions H+”. I know what the authors
mean, but the description should be further polished.
Page 4: Line 15-16: “BM” should be changed to “MB”.
Page 6, Line 12 and Line 15: “methylene bleu” should be changed to “methylene blue”.
3. Please keep “gas-oil”, “gas oil” and “gasoil” consistent throughout this manuscript.

4. Page 4, Line 41, the authors gave the statement “N-heptane, present only 4 significant
factors…”. However, the Pareto Chart in Figure 1 shows that N-heptane has three significant
factors similar as Cyclohexane, and concentration of Span80 is not the significant factor.
5. Regarding to the removal of methylene blue using the emulsified liquid membrane, the
extraction yield is a very important factor to be considered. Another significant factor is the
recycling. Once methylene blue is extracted by the emulsified liquid membrane, how could the
emulsion system be recycled?

Responses to Reviewers
Reviewer: 1
Comment 1
1- The authors have published several articles “Journal of the Taiwan Institute of
Chemical Engineers 59 (2016): 26-32”, “Energy Procedia 50 (2014): 1008-1016” and
“Energy Procedia 36 (2013): 1232-1240” to remove dyes using an emulsified liquid
membrane. The methods and discussion used in those articles are quite similar as this
manuscript. Please give a brief introduction on the recent progress of dye removal using
emulsified liquid membranes, and further elaborate the novelty of this manuscript.
Response to comment 1
The use of emulsified liquid membranes for the separation or recovery of various
organic or inorganic compounds in the chemical industry has known industrial
applications, as well as the recovery of toxic or precious metals in the field of water
reatment. On the other hand, the extraction of dyes by these membranes does not date
ong ago; moreover, we were the first in 2008 to tackle this phenomenon (see references
19 and 25 in this manuscript). Now several researchers are interested in this subject but
here are not yet industrial applications in this way.
Comment 2
2-There are so many grammar errors in the manuscript (particularly in Experimental Section
and Results and Discussion Section). Please correct all of them throughout the manuscript.
For example,
Page 3, Line 29-30: “It is a viscous yellow liquid, having a
hydrophilic/lipophilic balance of…” should be changed to “It is a viscous
yellow liquid with a hydrophilic/lipophilic balance of…”.
Page 3, Line 30-32: “The mobile transporter of dyes… very soluble in
organic solvents.” should be changed to “The mobile transporter of dyes…
s very soluble in organic solvents.”.
Page 3, Line 40-41: “Sulphuric acid… was used in the internal aqueous phase
as dye-acceptor stripping agents, was supplied by Fluka.” should be changed to “Sulphuric
acid (Fluka)… was used in the internal aqueous phase as
dye-acceptor stripping agents.”.
Page 3, Line 41-43: “The methylene blue (cationic dye) chemical formula… taken as ollutant
model and provided by Sigma Aldrich.” should be changed to “The methylene blue (cationic
dye) with chemical formula… was taken as pollutant model and provided by Sigma Aldrich.”.
Page 3, Line 44-45: “Then, using a mechanical stirrer type RW20 Kjank & Kunkel for…”
should be changed to “Then a mechanical stirrer type RW20 Kjank & Kunkel was used for”.
Page 3, Line 51: “H2S04” should be changed to “H2SO4”.
Page 3, Line 53-56: “after 10 minutes of contact time, the pH of external phase decrease
because the leakage of H ions in the external phase this phenomena nominated emulsion
brakeage (B) determined by application of a balance material vis-a-vis ions H+”. I know what
he authors mean, but the description should be further polished.
Page 4: Line 15-16: “BM” should be changed to “MB”.
Page 6, Line 12 and Line 15: “methylene bleu” should be changed to “methylene blue”.
Response to comment 2
All grammar errors reported by the reviewer are corrected and the manuscript is revised in his
otality.
Comment 3
3- Please keep “gas-oil”, “gas oil” and “gasoil” consistent throughout this manuscript.
Response to comment 3
This form “gas-oil” has been maintained throughout all this manuscript
Comment 4
4- Page 4, Line 41, the authors gave the statement “N-heptane, present only 4 significant
actors…”. However, the Pareto Chart in Figure 1 shows that N-heptane has three significant
actors similar as Cyclohexane, and concentration of Span80 is not the significant factor.
Response to comment 4
t is true, the discussion did not correspond to the figure of the Pareto Chart of n-heptane,
because there was an error; pareto cyclohexane was mistakenly copied for n-heptane.
This error was restored by inserting the true Pareto Chart of n-heptane which is consistent
with the discussion
Comment 5
5. Regarding to the removal of methylene blue using the emulsified liquid membrane,
he extraction yield is a very important factor to be considered.Another significant factor is
he recycling. Once methylene blue is extracted by the emulsified liquid membrane, how
could the emulsion system be recycled?
Response to comment 5
En effet,Le recyclage de la membrane est la deuxième étape qui est une suite logique de ce
ravail. Nous avons déjà essayé une desextraction du colorant et une regeneration de la
membrane “Energy Procedia 36 (2013): 1232-1240”, mais nous avons l’intention
d’approfondir ce phénomène par d’autres méthodes électrochmiques, au moyen des Ulrasons
etc.
ndeed, the recycling of the membrane is the second step which is a logical continuation of
his work. We have already tried a dye extraction and regeneration of the membrane "Energy
Procedia 36 (2013): 1232-1240", but we intend to deepen this phenomenon by other
electrochemical methods, by means of Ulrasons etc.
