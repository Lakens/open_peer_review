The manuscript describes an interesting idea of using an economic and efficient approach to
improve the wet strength of defatted soybean flour (DSF) based wood adhesives. Previous
studies mainly focus on the modification of soybean protein components within DSF, this study
highlighted the importance of carbohydrate components within DSF for the improvement of
water resistance. The interactions within DSF related to soybean protein component and soybean
carbohydrate component during thermal treatment have been discussed sufficiently. This
adhesive is a very promising area of research. It is a unique contribution to the area of bio-based
adhesives. This manuscript was well written based on the experimental results. This work is
certainly an interesting work and is suggested to be published after addressing the following
concerns.
1. In the section of 2.2 related to the “Thermal Treatment of DSF”, details on the thermal
treatment of DSF are not provided, such as how you performed thermal treatment, in oven or
other equipment, the thermal treatment was performed in sealed or open container?
2. In Fig.3, please use the same y-axis unit as either “(s)” or “/s”
3. Thorough check for punctuation and typographical errors.

We are grateful to you and the reviewers for the constructive comments on our article.
We have carefully completed our revisions to the manuscript based on the reviewers’

The manuscript describes an interesting idea of using an economic and efficient
approach to improve the wet strength of defatted soybean flour (DSF) based wood
adhesives. Previous studies mainly focus on the modification of soybean protein
components within DSF, this study highlighted the importance of carbohydrate
components within DSF for the improvement of water resistance. The interactions
within DSF related to soybean protein component and soybean carbohydrate
component during thermal treatment have been discussed sufficiently. This adhesive
is a very promising area of research. It is a unique contribution to the area of
bio-based adhesives. This manuscript was well written based on the experimental
results. This work is certainly an interesting work and is suggested to be published
after addressing the following concerns.
We thank the reviewer for these positive comments. We have revised carefully
and accordingly all the issues mentioned below.
1. In the section of 2.2 related to the “Thermal Treatment of DSF”, details on the
thermal treatment of DSF are not provided, such as how you performed thermal
treatment, in oven or other equipment, the thermal treatment was performed in
sealed or open container?
More detailed information on the thermal treatment of DSF has been included in
the manuscript. DSF was first put on an open metal plate to form a thin layer, and
then placed the plate containing DSF in an oven at various temperatures (65, 80, 95,
110, and 125 °C).
2. In Fig.3, please use the same y-axis unit as either “(s)” or “/s”
The y-axis unit in Fig.3 has been changed to “(s)” in the manuscript.

Comments to the Author(s)
Authors have reported on improving the water resistance of defatted soybean flour
(DSF)-based wood adhesives. Different characterisation techniques were used to
analyse the samples. Below are some of the minor corrections:
We appreciated the reviewer for this meaningful comment, which brings a lot of
benefits to us. We have revised carefully and accordingly all the issues mentioned
below.
1) Introduction is too long. It should be more concise.
We have shortened our introduction to make it concise.
2) Have the authors tried higher temperature(>125 C)
Yes, we have done that, we have also thermal treatment of DSF at 155 °C, and
ultimately resulting in poor properties, this was probably mainly due to the
thermal degradation of some DSF component.
3) Figure 1 is not clear
We have revised the Figure 1 to make it clear.
4) Thermal stability of the materials should also be mentioned
A detailed TGA test has been included in the manuscript as Figure 6 to measure
the thermal stability of the materials.
Figure 6. TGA curves and their derivate curves for cured DSF and T-DSF based
adhesives.
For cured DSF and T-DSF based adhesives, the thermal stabilities were shown in
figure 6. After thermal treatment of DSF, the thermal stabilities of T-DSF based
adhesives were higher than that of DSF based adhesives, this was due to the thermal
treatment of DSF could facilitate crosslinking between EMPA and DSF, as thermal
treatment resulted in self-crosslinking or re-aggregation of soybean protein and the
Maillard reactions between soybean protein and soybean carbohydrate, as confirmed
by FT-IR analysis and XPS results. Moreover, the thermal stability of T-DSF-80 +
EMPA adhesive is the highest among all the T-DSF + EMPA based adhesives. This
was attributed to the increased cross-linking density due to T-DSF-80 contained more
reactive groups to undergo crosslinking reaction, as confirmed by FT-IR analysis and
the acetaldehyde value.
5) Revise thoroughly for minor language mistakes
We have carefully checked and revised the language mistakes.
6) Some of the recent article on soy should be cited such as: Synthesis and
applications of biodegradable soy based graft copolymers: a review; ACS Sustainable
Chemistry & Engineering 4 (1), 1-17 (2016); RSC Advances 4 (35), 18240-18249
