This is awn interesting paper that looks at segregation not at the residential end but at the work
end. This is a novel approach to the use of mobile phone data using a network approach. I
recommend publication, and just a few comments that can improve the manuscript.
1) The English in the abstract needs reviewing.
2) What do the authors mean in p.4 l.32 by “We also required each user to have, at least, five
connection to a potential home or work place…”.
3) Note that in general, people refer to Blondel’s community detection algorithm as the Louvain
method. It’s nicer since more people get credit ;-)
4) Note also that in general, one does not refer to classical and non-classical algorithms of
community detection, but whether they are or not hierarchical, etc. In terms of performance, they
normally relate to their computational complexity. In this sense the Louvain one is linear, but in
general the Infomap one by Rosvall & Bergstrom tends to be faster, not necessarily better, but
uses random walk. This is just a comment, since it seems that you assume that the Louvain is far
more superior, but you did not show what sort of results you got with other algorithms in order
to claim this. If you performed the computations, I would suggest to put in the appendix a table
with the speed and modularity just for comparison. If the computation did not finish you can put
that it was stopped after x amount of time. This is in a way is important since community
detection algorithms tend to give different results, and in this way you would justify why this
method was preferred. You could also do a sensibility test as the one that you did for the days
with say another algorithm, just to check the how robust the results are. This is not necessary for
acceptance, just if you have done these already.
5) Is there a link for the reference 38? Maybe is the same reference missing in Fig 1?
6) For the distance travelled between communities, it is clear that the mean is not a good measure,
since the distribution is highly skewed, I gather from the plots that the mode is more
representative.
7) With respect to the distribution of the angles, it is difficult to grasp fig.3 and go back to Fig. 1 to
see whether everybody is mainly commuting or not to the city centre. Maybe this figure could be
accompanied by a map with arrows so that we can see the direction of the trip with respect to the
community. In addition, it is clear that the distribution of the angles will be related to the
geometry of the community detected, so it might be more relevant to look at the proportion of
trips that point towards the city centre instead, since different angles might still indicate the same
area target, that is the business centre.
8) In the discussion section, you state “We show that the modularity optimization and the
community detection algorithm proposed by Blondel et al [35] is an efficient method to outline
communities representing groups that segregate through movement”, this is inaccurate, since
you do not have a proxy to test the method, but the method is the tool to find your results.
9) In addition you say “We highlight that communities found here are not simply given by the
geographic context or the urban transport network of our example city…” I would argue that you
did not make use of transport networks to compare your results. These could be used by
comparing the probability of flow using a cost function of sorts given by the public transport
available. This can be done in a second paper, but hence cannot be included in the discussion.
10) After implementing the mode instead of the average for the distance, and the direction of
movement in terms of whether people are moving or not towards a business hub, it would be
3
interesting to hear something about the similitudes/differences between communities, and with
respect to the mono-centricity of santiago, if this is the case.
11) The link for the data is not working.
The paper is nicely structured and clear, and the authors should take these as recommendations
only.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The paper addresses the interesting problem of quantitatively measuring urban social
segregation in context: people might be integrated in the social fabric of the workplace but be
isolated when looking at their leisure interactions. To do that, the authors use ~1B data records
from Telfonica in four working weeks for the city of Santiago, focusing on the urban area only.
They build a graph of home-work transitions and, after clustering the graph, they study the social
segregation in each community. The segregation is computed with a formula from previous work
that captures the probability that workers in a given community interact with people coming
from their home community while at work. The results unveil a star-shaped community structure
centered on central Santiago in which peripheral communities are segregated.
I can see the authors have put quite some effort in working on the experiments. It is also
commendable that they are sharing the dats in some aggregated form. I have some concerns
around several aspects of the contribution though.
- Methodologically, the paper does not introduce much novelty. The clustering idea has been
explored by Ratti et al. already (yes, on a different type of telco network but the methodology is
basically the same), the segregation is a concept and a metric borrowed from previou work, the
relationship between CDR and socio-economic indicators has been studied (maybe not in
Santiago but still)
- I have also doubts about the specific implementation of the methodology. The intuition of why a
4
community detection is appropriate in this specific case in not clearly justified. Why is that better
than looking directly at census areas or at the voronoi cells of the towers? Focusing on census
areas, for example, would allow a much more ganular exploration of segregation, commute
patterns and socio economic indicators.
- Speaking of methodology, the authors use an undirected network without giving any reason
why they do that. I do realize that previous work did the same, but i) one would maybe like to
improve on existing work and ii) it seems to me that for this specific case (work-home transitions)
directionality matters quite much. For example, I am not sure one can interpret Figure 3 properly
without directionality (unless the authors somehow swept in directionality again for that specific
plot, but it doesn't look like)
- Since the methodology is not particuarly new, the reader expects more novely in the findings.
However, the granularity of analysis is very low (very few macro-areas) and confirms what is
known already: people commute mostly towards the center which, by the definition given, it the
only non-segregated area. The analysis of socio-economic indicators adds very little to this
picture. I think that the paper falls flat in convincing the reader that the H-W network is useful to
extract information that is more valuable (or at least different from) the information given by the
call network.
Overall, given that the methodology is not new and the findings are reasonable but limited I
think that a more specialized venue on geo/urban studies might be more appropriate for this
contribution.
Other minor observations:
- The text explaining P_\mathcal{C} is not clear. For example: "Consequently, ci/C denotes the
probability that a member of community C will work in unit i and ci/Ti is the fraction of users
belonging to community C working in unit i" -> aren't those concepts the same? I think that after
looking at the formula carefully and not paying too much attention to what the text says the
reader can slowly get it but as of now the text is a bit confusing (to me, at least)
- I think it would be hard to justify to any community detection expert that Louvain is the best
algorithm for this case because it performed well in benchmarks on synthetic datasets (I am
referring to the paper the authors reference). I think that Louvain is a convenient and perfectly
reasonable choice but I would not overstate it to the point of saying that it is the best possible
choice.
- I do realize that the RSOS format induces authors to have part of the methodology described in
the appendix. That's fine in general but the authors should make sure not to create a dependency
between the main text and the appendix. If to understand a section fully one needs to go and read
the appendix then the purpose of slitting the paper in main text + appendix is defeated. The
authors should revise the text with this consideration in mind. For example, Section 2.d reads as a
dangling bit and feels incomplete without the appendix.
- The writing should be polished. E.g., Well fare -> welfare ; five connection -> five connections;
explicitly specify that H-W means "Home-Work"

Reviewer 1
Coaaeits to the Author(s)
This is awi iiterestiig paper that looks at segregatioi iot at the resideitial eid but at the work
eid. This is a iovel approach to the use of aobile phoie data usiig a ietwork approach. I
recoaaeid publicatioi, aid just a few coaaeits that cai iaprove the aaiuscript.
We very auch appreciate reviewer coaaeits aid recoaaeidatioi, aid we have
perforaed a deep iispectioi of each poiit the reviewer listed, aid fouid thea very
useful ii order to iaprove the aaiuscript.
1) The Eiglish ii the abstract ieeds reviewiig.
Doie. We have reviewed our Eiglish aid aade sigiifcait chaiges ii the abstract. We
have iow iaproved iot oily the redactioi, but we have also clarifed the scope aid the
sigiifcaice of our work.
2) What do the authors aeai ii p.4 l.32 by “We also required each user to have, at least, fve
coiiectioi to a poteitial hoae or work place…”.
Thaiks for poiitiig this out. We ioticed the coifusioi, aid chaiged this ii order to
clarify the reader.
3) Note that ii geieral, people refer to Bloidel’s coaauiity detectioi algoritha as the Louvaii
aethod. It’s iicer siice aore people get credit ;-)

http://www.forestal.uach.cl/instituto/conservacion-biodiversidad-territorio
Thaiks for poiitiig this out, we iow refer to is as the Louvaii aethod.
4) Note also that ii geieral, oie does iot refer to classical aid ioi-classical algorithas of
coaauiity detectioi, but whether they are or iot hierarchical, etc. Ii teras of perforaaice,
they ioraally relate to their coaputatioial coaplexity. Ii this seise the Louvaii oie is liiear,
but ii geieral the Iifoaap oie by Sosvall & Bergstroa teids to be faster, iot iecessarily better,
but uses raidoa walk. This is just a coaaeit, siice it seeas that you assuae that the Louvaii is
far aore superior, but you did iot show what sort of results you got with other algorithas ii
order to claia this. If you perforaed the coaputatiois, I would suggest to put ii the appeidix a
table with the speed aid aodularity just for coaparisoi. If the coaputatioi did iot fiish you
cai put that it was stopped after x aaouit of tiae. This is ii a way is iaportait siice coaauiity
detectioi algorithas teid to give difereit results, aid ii this way you would justify why this
aethod was preferred. You could also do a seisibility test as the oie that you did for the days
with say aiother algoritha, just to check the how robust the results are. This is iot iecessary for
acceptaice, just if you have doie these already.
We thaik aid agree that it would be a useful work to address other algorithas of
coaauiity detectioi. We deleted the adjective “classical”, accordiigly with the
reviewer’s suggestioi. Ii our work, however, we relied oi previous results showi by Yaig
et al (2016), claiaiig a best perforaaice of this aethod. Also, we showed that whei
takiig iidividual days of data, coaauiities chaige very little, as showi ii fgure 2 of
Suppleaeitary Material, thus outliiiig the robustiess of the aethod.
5) Is there a liik for the refereice 38? Maybe is the saae refereice aissiig ii Fig 1?
Uifortuiately, because it is a aarketiig coapaiy, ADIMASK does iot publish their
studies ii a iidexed jourial. The oily refereice is the pdf they released about the study,

where you cai fid the table that was iicluded ii our suppleaeitary aaterial. We realize
that this is a drawback for scieitifc research ii this area, however, we have iot seei yet
iew efort to update such classifcatioi.
6) For the distaice travelled betweei coaauiities, it is clear that the aeai is iot a good
aeasure, siice the distributioi is highly skewed, I gather froa the plots that the aode is aore
represeitative.
The reviewer is absolutely right, thaiks for poiitiig this out. We iow show the aode.
7) With respect to the distributioi of the aigles, it is difcult to grasp fg.3 aid go back to Fig. 1
to see whether everybody is aaiily coaautiig or iot to the city ceitre. Maybe this fgure could
be accoapaiied by a aap with arrows so that we cai see the directioi of the trip with respect to
the coaauiity. Ii additioi, it is clear that the distributioi of the aigles will be related to the
geoaetry of the coaauiity detected, so it aight be aore relevait to look at the proportioi of
trips that poiit towards the city ceitre iistead, siice difereit aigles aight still iidicate the
saae area target, that is the busiiess ceitre.
This is iideed a very good coaaeit. We agree with the referee’s coaaeit, aid have iow
added ai arrow to every coaauiity ii Figure 1b), where the aode of the aigle of
directioi is showi. This is coapleaeited with Figure 3 which iidicates the proportioi of
travels that poiits to the ceiter (or how skewed is the distributioi froa the aode).
8) Ii the discussioi sectioi, you state “We show that the aodularity optiaizatioi aid the
coaauiity detectioi algoritha proposed by Bloidel et al [35] is ai efcieit aethod to outliie
coaauiities represeitiig groups that segregate through aoveaeit”, this is iiaccurate, siice
you do iot have a proxy to test the aethod, but the aethod is the tool to fid your results.

We uiderstaid the faw. We chaiged that seiteice to a aore accurate aid coiservative
oie: “We use Louvaii's aethod ii order to outliie coaauiities represeitiig groups that
geierate social isolated ``bubbles'' through aoveaeit”.
9) Ii additioi you say “We highlight that coaauiities fouid here are iot siaply givei by the
geographic coitext or the urbai traisport ietwork of our exaaple city…” I would argue that you
did iot aake use of traisport ietworks to coapare your results. These could be used by
coapariig the probability of fow usiig a cost fuictioi of sorts givei by the public traisport
available. This cai be doie ii a secoid paper, but heice caiiot be iicluded ii the discussioi.
We agree with the observatioi. We io loiger use the “transport network” coicept,
though we still aeitioi that “Our null model explicitly considers costs associated to the
commuting of urbanites by drawing random distances from the empirical distribution of each
community. Moreover, because the directionality of each community is also used, the
centripetal efect, that is, the observed tendency of people to work in the center of the city,
is also considered in our null model”.
10) After iapleaeitiig the aode iistead of the average for the distaice, aid the directioi of
aoveaeit ii teras of whether people are aoviig or iot towards a busiiess hub, it would be
iiterestiig to hear soaethiig about the siailitudes/difereices betweei coaauiities, aid with
respect to the aoio-ceitricity of saitiago, if this is the case.
We added a paragraph ii the discussioi iidicatiig the iaportaice of the ceitripetal
efect of dowitowi (coaauiity B) aid we outliied that it receives people froa all
coaauiities aid socioecoioaic level. Also, we coaaeited the fact that “polycentric or
subcenter patterns in cities (e.g. the southern zone in the case of Santiago can lead to
generate centripetal efects not only towards the center of the city, but also to the

commercial core of that community. In this sense, a closer look at the spatial distribution of
productivity at the neighborhood level could certainly shed further insights on causal
relationships of the segregation patterns described here”.
11) The liik for the data is iot workiig.
We appreciate the iotice of this, the data has beei uploaded to Dryad.org aid should be
available with acceptaice of this article (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.h8405). We will also
upload the datafle to the systea ii case you wait to look at it. We provide 2 sets of data:
detected coaauiities per day aid H-W trajectories.
The paper is iicely structured aid clear, aid the authors should take these as recoaaeidatiois
oily.
Thaik you very auch. We appreciate this coistructive coaaeit aid are eicouraged by
your assessaeit.
Reviewer 2
Coaaeits to the Author(s)
The paper addresses the iiterestiig problea of quaititatively aeasuriig urbai social
segregatioi ii coitext: people aight be iitegrated ii the social fabric of the workplace but be
isolated whei lookiig at their leisure iiteractiois. To do that, the authors use ~1B data records
froa Telefoiica ii four workiig weeks for the city of Saitiago, focusiig oi the urbai area oily.
They build a graph of hoae-work traisitiois aid, after clusteriig the graph, they study the social
segregatioi ii each coaauiity. The segregatioi is coaputed with a foraula froa previous work
that captures the probability that workers ii a givei coaauiity iiteract with people coaiig
froa their hoae coaauiity while at work. The results uiveil a star-shaped coaauiity structure
ceitered oi ceitral Saitiago ii which peripheral coaauiities are segregated.
I cai see the authors have put quite soae efort ii workiig oi the experiaeits. It is also
coaaeidable that they are shariig the data ii soae aggregated fora. I have soae coiceris

arouid several aspects of the coitributioi though.
- Methodologically, the paper does iot iitroduce auch iovelty. The clusteriig idea has beei
explored by Satti et al. already (yes, oi a difereit type of telco ietwork but the aethodology is
basically the saae), the segregatioi is a coicept aid a aetric borrowed froa previous work, the
relatioiship betweei CDS aid socio-ecoioaic iidicators has beei studied (aaybe iot ii
Saitiago but still).
We realize that the iovelty of our aethodological approach aay iot be perceived as
iiteided. We believe to address such poiit with aore clarity ii our iew versioi of the
aaiuscript. For iistaice, our approach builds oi previous research aid aay iot coae out
as a iew coitributioi oi frst sight. However, the aethodological iovelty coaes froa the
fact that our propositioi coabiies coaauiity detectioi approaches with segregatioi
aialysis to geierate iew iisights oi the structure of social iiteractioi withii the city.
This iicludes iot oily a qualitative descriptioi of coaauiities, but the applicatioi of a
specifc isolatioi iidex refectiig a real probability of iiteractioi betweei iidividuals of
the saae (or difereit) group. While isolatioi iidexes have beei widely used ii the
literature, our work uses this ii a iovel aaiier: frst, we geierate ai uisupervised
classifcatioi based oi urbaiite’s travel behaviour usiig a coaauiity detectioi
algoritha, as opposed to what has beei doie ii the literature, where segregatioi iidices
stea froa the classifcatioi of iidividuals based oi specifc features (e.g. ethiic group,
socioecoioaic level, aaoig others); thei, we use ai isolatioi or exposure iidex that
iicludes a large iuaber of iidividuals duriig a represeitative sectioi of the workiig
tiaes across the year, that captures a particular aspect of urbai dyiaaics (i.e. segregatioi
at work), whereas others usually perfora such aialyses based oi origii-destiiatioi
surveys that oily coisider a saall fractioi of the total populatioi.
Ii order to aake this poiit evei clearer, we have iow recasted the aaiuscript to get
these poiits across to the reader. For iistaice, we iow eaphasise how our approach
coabiies several aethods by exclusively relyiig oi aobility data to label urbaiites iito
coaauiities, aid also relegated socioecoioaic data just as a validatioi of our results.
This should provide a clearer view of the iovelty aid siaplify its evaluatioi.
- I have also doubts about the specifc iapleaeitatioi of the aethodology. The iituitioi of why
a coaauiity detectioi is appropriate ii this specifc case ii iot clearly justifed. Why is that

better thai lookiig directly at ceisus areas or at the Voroioi cells of the towers? Focusiig oi
ceisus areas, for exaaple, would allow a auch aore graiular exploratioi of segregatioi,
coaaute patteris aid socio ecoioaic iidicators.
Iideed, the usage of coaauiity detectioi ii this particular coitext could be better
justifed. The issue seea to be that (aid we thiik this is the aaii coiceri of the referee)
the text purports the associatioi of coaauiity detectioi to existeit socioecoioaic
classifcatioi as a aaii feature of our work. However, the sigiifcaice of our work aostly
relies oi obtaiiiig segregatioi (isolatioi) iidexes based oi cell phoie data. The
iaportaice of aakiig such distiictioi is that, to our kiowledge, iiteractioi probabilities
of this kiid have iever beei obtaiied at this spatioteaporal resolutioi ii the literature.
Ii fact, calculatiig probabilities based oi the full, aid detailed, trajectory of each urbaiite
allows to actually obtaii a very close estiaatioi of real iiteractioi probabilities betweei
two iidividuals labeled ii the saae category. However, the choice of how to defie such
categories is iot trivial, aid we posit that it is aaiily coistraiied by: i) Categories
eaployed aust be as objective as possible. This discards usiig socioecoioaic level (SEL)
as a category siice aethodologies used to obtaii it vary betweei couitries aid evei
betweei difereit studies. Accordiigly, we oily use socioecoioaic level to validate this
particular dataset, aid (ii) the graiularity of the “category layer” aust aatch the spatial
scale of the layer froa which segregatioi iidexes are obtaiied siice we are iiterested ii
labeliig each persoi that aoves arouid the city. The aisaatch betweei Voroioi cells
describiig aoveaeit across the city aid ceisal blocks represeitiig SEL (betweei 10 to
40 blocks per Voroioi cell) will severely afect the graiularity of the aialysis addiig ioise
froa the fact that difereit labels (i.e. SEL) will aerge iito oie Voroioi cell (tower). The
by-product of such situatioi is that iistead of obtaiiiig a uiique label for each user, oie
gets a distributioi of SELs for a givei Voroioi cell. Haviig said that, oie could argue that
segregatioi values are still possible to be obtaiied froa this distributioi of SELs ii each
cell. However, the problea arises whei oie waits to coapare the values obtaiied with a
proper iull aodel. As explaiied ii the aaiuscript, our iull aodel takes iito accouit both,
the step-leigth distributioi for each category (coaauiity), aid their directioiality
aigles, capturiig the ceitripetal efect of a ceitralized city. This clear directioiality
eaerges froa the fact that detected coaauiities are spatially coitiguous (as showi ii
Figure 3). Iistead, other labelliig patteris, based perhaps oi ceisal data, would coabiie
people froa difereit parts of the city, iitroduciig ioise to the statistical properties of

their aoveaeits. If urbaiites were grouped by SEL (see fgure 1a), givei that group S4 is
aostly distributed both ii the iortheri aid southeri part of the city, our iull aodel will
show that such group as haviig a iearly 50-50 chaice to travel iorth or south, failiig to
capture the statistical patteris of group S4.
We iow discuss such issue ii the Discussioi sectioi aid have coisiderably aodifed the
Abstract aid part of the Iitroductioi ii order to further clarify the sigiifcaice of this. We
particularly stress the fact that coaauiity detectioi is used here as a aethod to label
urbaiites based oi siailarity of H-W trajectories ii a ioi supervised aaiier
coaaeisurate to the graiularity of our dataset. It is iaportait to also iotice that
detected coitiguous geographic zoies (coaauiities) show stroig correlatiois with well-
kiowi parts of the city, aid that they coiicide very well with zoies fouid ii previous
work, as explaiied ii the aaiuscript.
- Speakiig of aethodology, the authors use ai uidirected ietwork without giviig aiy reasoi
why they do that. I do realize that previous work did the saae, but i) oie would aaybe like to
iaprove oi existiig work aid ii) it seeas to ae that for this specifc case (work-hoae traisitiois)
directioiality aatters quite auch. For exaaple, I aa iot sure oie cai iiterpret Figure 3 properly
without directioiality (uiless the authors soaehow swept ii directioiality agaii for that specifc
plot, but it doesi't look like)
We very auch appreciate this feedback. Actually, we do iot explicitly discuss reasois for
iot usiig uidirected ietworks, aid the referee is right: Figure 3 has to be iiterpreted
directioially. However, siice we focus oi providiig a descriptioi of how to evaluate the
structure of the city whei people’s aoveaeit is takei iito accouit, we thiik that the
blocks ii which the city is divided (our coaauiities) aust fulfll the requireaeit of
aiiiaiziig trajectories aaoig thea, whei coapared to trajectories iiside thea. Ii this
seise, we aay statistically iiterpret these coaauiities as “social bubbles” geierated
froa the superpositioi of huidreds of thousaids trajectories. Withii such scope, we
iotice that the directioiality of trajectories are iot iaportait for us, aid heice have
chosei to siaplify the aialysis by usiig uidirected ietworks. Now, if we were iiterested
ii qualitatively dividiig the city, such as ii resideitial, workiig aid iidustrial zoies for
exaaple, as has beei doie by Leioraaid et al (2015), directed ietworks would certaiily
be aore appropriate, ii order to better describe origiis aid destiiatioi aaoig those
zoie.

Still, ii our case, whei iidividual siaulated work locatioi is calculated, directioiality does
aatter, particularly whei it coaes to develop a proper iull aodel oaiiscieit of the
statistical teideicy of urbaiites to aove towards the geographic ceiter of the city.
This iaportait issue has iow beei added to the aaiuscript, at the eid of sectioi 2e), aid
further eaphasized by addiig aediai directioiality vectors to Figure 1 for each
coaauiity. This should uiderliie the fact that directioiality of each coaauiity is takei
iito accouit whei geieratiig raidoa walks for our iull aodel evaluatioi.
- Siice the aethodology is iot particularly iew, the reader expects aore iovelty ii the fidiigs.
However, the graiularity of aialysis is very low (very few aacro-areas) aid coifras what is
kiowi already: people coaaute aostly towards the ceiter which, by the defiitioi givei, it the
oily ioi-segregated area. The aialysis of socio-ecoioaic iidicators adds very little to this
picture. I thiik that the paper falls fat ii coiviiciig the reader that the H-W ietwork is useful to
extract iiforaatioi that is aore valuable (or at least difereit froa) the iiforaatioi givei by the
call ietwork.
Although the referee is right ii poiitiig out that fidiig a ioi-segregated ceiter is
soaewhat expected, such coaaeit aake us realize that we have iot beei clear eiough
to the reader, as our fidiigs go well beyoid this. We have iow reworded part of the
aaiuscript to highlight that, ii the particular case of Saitiago, highly segregated zoies
are fouid ii the upper class coie (iorth orieital zoie), the lower iicoae boroughs
(occideital part), aid the big aiddle class boroughs (southeri zoie). While these zoies
were already described as such froa a sociological or historical perspective (i.e.
qualitatively), our approach allows detect thea usiig ai uisupervised (i.e. uibiased)
aethod to uiveil segregatioi usiig big data. This is ii turi corroborated by qualitatively
assessiig the high correspoideice with described socioecoioaic structure (Figure 1).
Also, we are able to obtaii a probability value for the iiteractioi aaoig iidividuals
beloigiig to each of these coaauiities with the uiique assuaptioi that people withii a
Voroioi cell are well aixed. This latter assuaptioi is iot a stroig assuaptioi, givei that
Voroioi are iot bigger thai 30 blocks, oi average. We have iow added such piece of
iiforaatioi ii the Discussioi sectioi aid explicitly state that probabilities fouid are a
bottoa-liait, as oie could argue that there is iot a well aixed regiae withii Voroioi
cells (i.e., people froa ofce buildiigs iiteracts auch aore with their coworkers thai

of iiteractioi are actually higher (close, though) thai the obtaiied oies.
Sverall, givei that the aethodology is iot iew aid the fidiigs are reasoiable but liaited I
thiik that a aore specialized veiue oi geo/urbai studies aight be aore appropriate for this

that this work aay opei a broad raige of iew possibilities ii social segregatioi studies. Ii
particular, it serves as a bridge betweei raw aid bigdata aid aore qualitative aid
descriptive discipliies, such as social segregatioi aid social scieices ii geieral aid opei
the possibility of aialysiig segregatioi usiig siaple aid iicreasiigly available ITC
datasets such as aobile phoie registres where traditioial socio/ecoioaic data is lackiig.
We have iow iicluded such discussioi ii the Coiclusiois.
Sther aiior observatiois:
- The text explaiiiig P_\aathcal{C} is iot clear. For exaaple: iCoisequeitly, ci/C deiotes the
probability that a aeaber of coaauiity C will work ii uiit i aid ci/Ti is the fractioi of users
beloigiig to coaauiity C workiig ii uiit ii -> arei't those coicepts the saae? I thiik that after
lookiig at the foraula carefully aid iot payiig too auch atteitioi to what the text says the
reader cai slowly get it but as of iow the text is a bit coifusiig (to ae, at least).
We coapletely agree with the referee.
We have iow siaplifed the explaiatioi ii order to aake it aore clear aid readable.
- I thiik it would be hard to justify to aiy coaauiity detectioi expert that Louvaii is the best
algoritha for this case because it perforaed well ii beichaarks oi syithetic datasets (I aa
referriig to the paper the authors refereice). I thiik that Louvaii is a coiveiieit aid perfectly
reasoiable choice but I would iot overstate it to the poiit of sayiig that it is the best possible
choice.
We have deleted the word “efcieit” ii the discussioi, aid iow we poiit out that
Louvaii’s aethod has beei showi to have a higher perforaaice whei coapared to other
aethods (Yaig et al, 2016).

- I do realize that the SSSS foraat iiduces authors to have part of the aethodology described ii
the appeidix. That's fie ii geieral but the authors should aake sure iot to create a
depeideicy betweei the aaii text aid the appeidix. If to uiderstaid a sectioi fully oie ieeds
to go aid read the appeidix thei the purpose of slittiig the paper ii aaii text + appeidix is
defeated. The authors should revise the text with this coisideratioi ii aiid. For exaaple,
Sectioi 2.d reads as a daigliig bit aid feels iicoaplete without the appeidix.
We coapletely agree with reviewers coaaeit here. While the use of socioecoioaic level
is just used as auxiliary iiforaatioi, it should aid ii providiig qualitative iisights of the
particular city structure of Saitiago aid help uiderstaid the stroig coapositioi
difereices betweei coaauiities.
We have iow aoved the explaiatioi of SEL to the last part of the aethodology, aid
relegated it as auxiliary data. This is why the specifc aethodology associated with SEL is
further explaiied ii suppleaeitary aaterial.
- The writiig should be polished. E.g., Well fare -> welfare ; fve coiiectioi -> fve coiiectiois;
explicitly specify that H-W aeais iHoae-Worki
Doie.
