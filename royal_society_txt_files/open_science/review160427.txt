General comment
The manuscript by Hynson reports on fungus-plant carbon and nitrogen exchange of two (out of
three) terrestrial endemic orchid species from different locations of the Hawaii islands. The
author analyzed leaf carbon and nitrogen stable isotope natural abundance and leaf nitrogen
concentrations of the two target species and compared these data with isotope abundance and
nitrogen concentration data of accompanying autotrophic plants and with data of related orchid
species already available from temperate regions. The experimental approach is solid and uses
state-of-the-art analytical techniques. The data are treated in a solid manner including conversion
of delta values into site-independent enrichment factors and are tested for significance using
adequate statistical approaches. The structure of the manuscript is logical, based on hypotheses
and easy to read. Relevant literature is considered in a balanced manner.
The results show mostly significant enrichment in the heavy nitrogen isotope 15N and increased
leaf nitrogen concentrations for the two target orchid species and simultaneously no 13C
enrichment or even 13C depletion in comparison to autotrophic plants. This finding is in
agreement with data available for a broad set of terrestrial temperate orchid species mycorrhizal
with fungi of the rhizoctonia group including species closely related to the orchids investigated
here. The author correctly concludes from this finding that carbon stable isotope abundance is
obviously not suited to unequivocally identify organic matter gain by rhizoctonia-mycorrhizal
orchids from their fungal hosts. However, the author uses the 15N enrichment and increased total
nitrogen concentration in the leaf tissues of the two Hawaiian orchid species as an indirect
indicator of organic matter gain from the fungal source and classifies the two investigated orchid
species as most probably partially mycoheterotrophic, i.e. gaining organic matter from two
sources, photosynthesis and fungal hosts.
Why are these findings relevant and worth publishing? Ecophysiology of the orchid mycorrhiza
is currently a topic of vast development and broad interest. The data presented here confirm
findings for other orchid species available from the literature. However, more important, they
extend our current knowledge almost exclusively based on terrestrial orchids from temperate and
boreal regions to a tropical region. By the moment there is a huge deficit in our knowledge on the
ecophysiology of tropical orchids despite of the fact that the vast majority of orchids lives in the
tropics. As correctly stated by the author knowledge on the ecophysiology of temperate orchids
cannot simply be transferred to tropical orchids, because matter demand and supply conditions
in temperate and tropical regions are essentially different, i.e. in the tropics nitrogen availability
to plants is usually higher than in temperate or boreal regions.
I am missing a brief statement on the question why the few orchid species in Hawaii are
exclusively rhizoctonia-mycorrhizal species. Why are there no ectomycorrhiza-associated
species? I suspect that ectomycorrhizal trees as hosts for ectomycorrhizal fungi are missing in
Hawaii or their diversity is rather low. Please have a closer look on Liebel et al. (2010, Am. J. Bot.
97: 903-912) with respect to this point.

Specific comments
Line 100: Add reference 23 to the statement on ectomycorrhizal fungi. Lee et al. investigated not
only saprotrophic, but also ectomycorrhizal fully mycoheterotrophic species.
Line 104: The statement in brackets “though to a lesser degree in saprotrophic species” is not fully
correct and should be revised. Please note that fully mycoheterotrophic orchids on wood-decay
saprotrophic fungi are less enriched in 15N, but more enriched in 13C than fully
mycoheterotrophic orchids on ectomycorrhizal fungi.
Line 493: I suspect “leafess” should be replaced by “leafless”.
Lines 498-500: This publication is in the meantime out as a print version and should be cited
accordingly.

label_comment_2
This paper deals with indirect evidence of partially heterotrophic metabolisms of two Hawaiian
endemic orchids investigated by an isotopic approach. Beyond a limited relevance for orchids in
general (the choice of endemic species for a general question of tropical biology looks
unexpected), the absence of more direct physiological approaches makes the paper not relevant
for a large audience. Moreover, the conclusion on ‘potentially partially mycoheterotrophy’ is
controversial to me, looking at the 13C abundance and its response to light. The absence of data
on mycorrhizal fungi (taxonomic identity, expected isotopic behaviours) makes the paper a bit
4
preliminary. Although isotopic analyses are correctly carried out, and although the text is clear (a
bit long by places), this paper looks suitable for a more specialized journal.
Main questionable points are to be found for lines: 65-68, 110, 119, 269-272, 289-293, 274.
Lines 48-50 remember that families are artificially delimited by taxonomists, no biological reality.
Line 58, see Plant Research DOI 10.1007/s10265-016-0856-6
Lines 65-68 and 82-83 the 15N enrichment looks like a statistical, not a metabolic link, and is not
convincing to me. If 13C is not modified, there is no clear evidence that it is of fungal origin?
Line 70, this discovery was first made by Gebauer & Meyer 2003 for isotopes. Moreover, in the
tropical regions, there are mycoheterotrophic species linked to saprotrophic fungi, I would not
insist so much on the temperate pattern.
Lines 77-79 no real evidence for parasitism in any orchid mycorrhizal rhizoctonias to my
knowledge.
Line 95 this was also stated by Selosse & Martios (2014, Trends in Plant Sciences 19: 683) also
using 15N in their arguments (again not directly convincing).
Line 102 is ref (20) from Costa Rica of general relevance especially for 15N / N content?
Line 110 ‘more enriched in 15N (due to a more open nitrogen cycle)’ unclear to me; moreover
why would orchids over-abuse N just because it is more available? Finally, you cannot see the
tropical regions as a single dynamic, this is really overstated and the N cycle and patterns of
nutrition may depend on sites. Contrarily to an ancient Europocentric view, the tropics are
diverse!
Line 119 why focusing on endemic species to achieve a study that is supposed to tell general
stories on tropical regions?
Line 138 do you have reason(s) from their ecology to predict a partial heterotrophy?
Line 259 (and 107), there are several data here and there form the mycoheterotrophy literature
available – to be checked and quoted appropriately, even if marginal.
Lines 269-272 really a not-convincing conclusion in my eyes: what about if fungi use a different N
source than these mycorrhizal on local plants? What about a higher or different N extraction from
the fungus to drive a different 15N pattern? Remember that the mycorrhizal partners and
mycorrhizal physiology in surrounding plants is likely not the same as in orchids!
Line 271 and 283 (for example) for such generalization (tropical regions as a unique condition) see
above line 110.
Lines 289-293 looks unconvincing to me, the 13C depletion is unexpected as described here
poorly fits the conclusion on heterotrophy (unless you follow the indirect argument by Selosse &
Martios 2014; the arguments by the authors also pertain to lines 303-307 but are speculative so
far).
Line 274 better report light values if you have them. Partial mycoheterotrophic plants are
expected to increase 13C abundance in the shade (see Preiss et al. 2009 paper in Proc Roy Soc):
you observe the opposite here!
Line 293 leafless, ok, but green or not?

exclusively rhizoctonia-mycorrhizal species. Why are there no ectomycorrhiza-associated
species? I suspect that ectomycorrhizal trees as hosts for ectomycorrhizal fungi are
missing in Hawaii or their diversity is rather low. Please have a closer look on Liebel et
al. (2010, Am. J. Bot. 97: 903-912) with respect to this point.
Response: Thank you for raising this point, I have revised the section of the introduction
to address the fact that Hawaii’s orchids are not associated with ectomycorrhizal fungi
and are part of the rhizoctonia guild (lines 132-143)
Specific comments
Line 100: Add reference 23 to the statement on ectomycorrhizal fungi. Lee et al.
investigated not only saprotrophic, but also ectomycorrhizal fully mycoheterotrophic
species.
Response: Done
Line 104: The statement in brackets “though to a lesser degree in saprotrophic species” is
not fully correct and should be revised. Please note that fully mycoheterotrophic orchids
on wood-decay saprotrophic fungi are less enriched in 15N, but more enriched in 13C
than fully mycoheterotrophic orchids on ectomycorrhizal fungi.
Response: I have revised this sentence by dropping the inaccurate statement from above
in quotations and formerly bracketed in the manuscript.
Line 493: I suspect “leafess” should be replaced by “leafless”.
Response: Corrected, thank you.
Lines 498-500: This publication is in the meantime out as a print version and should be
cited accordingly.
Response: changed, thank you.

Comments to the Author(s)
Comment: This paper deals with indirect evidence of partially heterotrophic
metabolisms of two Hawaiian endemic orchids investigated by an isotopic approach.
Response: I’m not totally clear on what the reviewer means by “indirect”, I’m guessing
what the reviewer would like to see are pulse chase experiments where one could follow
the fate of fungal vs photosynthetically derived compounds? If this is the case, these
types of experiments, though perhaps a more “direct” means of measuring compound
flux than naturally abundant stable isotopes, also have their limitations. For example,
they are only able to measure the exchange of carbon and/or other nutrients such as
nitrogen for short “snapshots” of time (See Hynson et al. 2013 chapter in
Mycoheterotrohpy Ed. Vincent Merckx for more details). The benefit of using a naturally
abundant stable isotope approach (rather than the aforementioned pulse-chase) is that
carbon and nitrogen stable isotope profiles are integrators of the C and N acquisition
strategies of plant throughout their lifespan (See Dawson et al. 2002 Annual Review of
Ecology and Systematics Vol. 33 pp. 507-559 and Robinson 2001 Trends in Ecology &
Evolution 16, 153-162 as examples). Also, the purpose of this research was to see if the
patterns of isotopic composition and nitrogen content previously observed from
temperate regions hold in the tropics for rhizoctonia associated orchids.
Comment: Beyond a limited relevance for orchids in general (the choice of endemic
species for a general question of tropical biology looks unexpected),
Response: I disagree that the choice of endemic species limits the relevance of these data
for orchids in general because close relatives of the study species are widely distributed
both in tropical and temperate regions, thus I would argue that the target species from this
study are highly relevant to orchid biology because ecophysiological comparisons can be
made while accounting for phylogenetic relatedness (ie I am comparing closely related
species within the same genus or subtribe). Also, these data represent some of the first
from rhizoctonia-associated tropical terrestrial orchids so whether the species are
endemic or not does not seem to me to have much bearing on their relevance to orchid
biology.
Comment: the absence of more direct physiological approaches makes the paper not
relevant for a large audience.
Response: Again, I’m not certain what the reviewer is referring to in terms of “direct
physiological approaches”, but please see above response. Also, this study is relevant for
a large audience because there is broad interest in: 1) orchid biology and ecophysiology,
and 2) plant-fungal interactions. I have attempted to highlight these points in the revised
introduction and discussion.
Comment: Moreover, the conclusion on ‘potentially partially mycoheterotrophy’ is
controversial to me, looking at the 13C abundance and its response to light.
Response: I understand the reviewers concern regarding naming the species of orchids
from this study “partially mycoheterotrophic” thus I have added to the discussion that
based solely on 13C values the target species would not be considered partially
mycoheterotrophic (lines 318-319). I have also added further rationale for why 13C may
not be the best indicator for partial mycoheterotrophy among rhizoctonia associated
orchids. Also, differences in A. sandvicensis’ e13C values across islands may not be owed
to differences in site irradiance, I simply pose this as one possibility. I have now included
an equally probable alternative (lines 301-306).
Comment: The absence of data on mycorrhizal fungi (taxonomic identity, expected
isotopic behaviours) makes the paper a bit preliminary.
Response: I disagree that this paper is a bit preliminary as it provides the first integrated
measure (naturally abundant stable isotope profiles) of terrestrial tropical orchids’
ecophysiology. I agree however that additional information on the mycorrhizal partners
of the study species is important. So, I have included this data (while still in prep) in the
introduction (lines 132-138).
Comment: Although isotopic analyses are correctly carried out, and although the text is
clear (a bit long by places), this paper looks suitable for a more specialized journal.
Response: I disagree that this study would not fit the readership of Royal Society Open
Access because 1) The Royal Society publications have a long history of publishing
papers on the ecology of orchids and mycoheterotrophic plants (for example Taylor et al.
(2004). Evidence for mycorrhizal races in a cheating orchid. Proceedings of the Royal
Society of London B: Biological Sciences, 271(1534), 35-43; And Bidartondo et al.
(2004). Changing partners in the dark: isotopic and molecular evidence of
ectomycorrhizal liaisons between forest orchids and trees. Proceedings of the Royal
Society of London B: Biological Sciences, 271(1550), 1799-1806; And Hynson et al.
(2009). Evidence of a myco-heterotroph in the plant family Ericaceae that lacks
mycorrhizal specificity. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological
Sciences, 276(1675), 4053-4059.)
Comment: Main questionable points are to be found for lines: 65-68, 110, 119, 269-272,
289-293, 274.
Response: I have done my best to try and clarify statements in the aforementioned lines
of text and have provided more details on these revisions below.
Comment: Lines 48-50 remember that families are artificially delimited by taxonomists,
no biological reality.
Response: I’m not totally sure what the reviewer would like me to change in this
statement. Family Orchidaceae is a phylogenetically well-supported group of plants and
my point in this portion of the introduction was merely to state that they are
geographically widespread, I’m not attempting to comment on their biology.
Comment: Line 58, see Plant Research DOI 10.1007/s10265-016-0856-6
Response: I assume that the reviewer mentions this paper because it shows evidence of
partial mycoheterotrophy in an orchid with very reduced leaves? Thus not all partially
mycoheterotrophic orchids look like their autotrophic relatives? In hopes that this is the
point the reviewer is trying to make, I have revised this statement to say “…as these are
leafy green individuals that based on appearance, generally look just like their
autotrophic relatives” (emphasis added here to show revision).
Comment: Lines 65-68 and 82-83 the 15N enrichment looks like a statistical, not a
metabolic link, and is not convincing to me. If 13C is not modified, there is no clear
evidence that it is of fungal origin?
Response: I have to disagree that the 15N enrichment among the orchids from this study
is merely a statistical link and not metabolic. On average the orchids were around 3 parts
per mil enriched in 15N relative to autotrophs which is greater than differences in 15N
relative abundance between congeneric and sympatric tropical plant species that either
derive N from ant debris or the soil, and greater than differences among conspecifics of
an insectivorous plant species where some individuals derive a greater portion of N from
litterfall than prey (Moran et al. 2003). (as two examples Treseder et al. 1995 Nature;
Moran et al. 2003 International Journal of Plant Sciences). I have addressed this point in
the revised Discussion (lines 268-275)
Comment: Line 70, this discovery was first made by Gebauer & Meyer 2003 for
isotopes. Moreover, in the tropical regions, there are mycoheterotrophic species linked to
saprotrophic fungi, I would not insist so much on the temperate pattern.
Response: The Bidartondo et al. 2004 reference is the most appropriate here because it
was the first study to look both at fungal partnerships and stable isotope profiles, Gebauer
& Meyer, while the first to examine the stable isotope profiles of green orchids did not
examine fungal partners. Tropical saprophytic fungi associated orchids are described in
the introduction (lines 98-100).
Comment: Lines 77-79 no real evidence for parasitism in any orchid mycorrhizal
rhizoctonias to my knowledge.
Response: I have dropped the mention of parasitism among these fungi.
Comment: Line 95 this was also stated by Selosse & Martios (2014, Trends in Plant
Sciences 19: 683) also using 15N in their arguments (again not directly convincing).
Response: I have chosen to only include the recent study by Gerhard et al. and not the
aforementioned review, as the prior reference provides data with evidence of a link
between organic substrate use by rhizoctonia-associated orchids (similar to fully
mycoheterotrophic orchids) and 15N abundance. I agree with the reviewer that further
studies are needed to derive the specific mechanism leading to the significant 15N
enrichment found in these orchids and I have touched upon this in the revised discussion
(lines 343-344).
Comment: Line 102 is ref (20) from Costa Rica of general relevance especially for 15N /
N content?
Response: This reference is fitting for the statement it is currently linked to on the
isotopic profiles of CAM epiphytic orchids.
Comment: Line 110 ‘more enriched in 15N (due to a more open nitrogen cycle)’ unclear
to me; moreover why would orchids over-abuse N just because it is more available?
Finally, you cannot see the tropical regions as a single dynamic, this is really overstated
and the N cycle and patterns of nutrition may depend on sites. Contrarily to an ancient
Europocentric view, the tropics are diverse!
Response: I have revised this section for clarity and throughout the manuscript qualified
the generalities about tropical N cycles noting that the tropics are diverse.
Comment: Line 119 why focusing on endemic species to achieve a study that is
supposed to tell general stories on tropical regions?
Response: I understand the reviewers point, but the focus of this study was to compare
tropical rhizoctonia-associated orchids with their temperate/Mediterranean counterparts
and to provide some of the first ecophysiological data on tropical terrestrial orchids. My
focus was not specifically to make generalities about tropical regions. Thus the endemic
status of the study species does not seem too relevant, rather the fact that they have
closely related temperate/Mediterranean congenerics or species in the same subtribe that
are well-represented in previous ecophysiological studies was key to making these
comparisons.
Comment: Line 138 do you have reason(s) from their ecology to predict a partial
heterotrophy?
Response: As discussed earlier in the Introduction, there is mounting evidence that
rhizoctonia-associated orchids may be partially mycoheterotrophic, but this evidence is
based only on temperate/Mediterranean species, thus I set out to see if these lines of
evidence held for related tropical species. I have revised the introduction and discussion
to clarify these points.
Comment: Line 259 (and 107), there are several data here and there form the
mycoheterotrophy literature available – to be checked and quoted appropriately, even if
marginal.
Response: I have added the Hynson et al. 2013 reference which summarizes recent
findings on the ecophysiology of rhizoctonia, saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal
associated orchids and demonstrates a bias for studies of the first group towards
temperate regions.
Comment: Lines 269-272 really a not-convincing conclusion in my eyes: what about if
fungi use a different N source than these mycorrhizal on local plants? What about a
higher or different N extraction from the fungus to drive a different 15N pattern?
Response: The reviewer is correct that the 15N signature of rhizoctonia associated
orchids is likely owed to these fungi utilizing a 15N enriched source relative to other
mycorrhizal fungi and/or a different form of extracting N from the symbiont. What I am
discussing is exactly this and that the source/form is fungal derived. I have fully revised
this section of the discussion to clarify these points (lines 281-292)
Comment: Line 271 and 283 (for example) for such generalization (tropical regions as a
unique condition) see above line 110.
Response: I have qualified these statements so as to not make generalizations about the
tropics.
Comment: Lines 289-293 looks unconvincing to me, the 13C depletion is unexpected as
described here poorly fits the conclusion on heterotrophy (unless you follow the indirect
argument by Selosse & Martios 2014; the arguments by the authors also pertain to lines
303-307 but are speculative so far).
Response: Again I fully agree that additional studies are necessary, but I am not basing
my proposition of partial mycoheterotrophy on the arguments raised by Selosse &
Martos, rather the previous work showing partial mycoheterotrophy in Liparis nervosa
and the fact that there is a Liparis sp. that is leafless (L. aphylla) and likely at least
partially mycoheterotrophic, also Liparis belongs to subfamily Epidendroideae which
contains fully mycohetertrophic taxa, these lines of evidence support a possible
evolutionary predisposition to partial mycoheterotrophy in Liparis hawaiensis. I have
revised this section of the discussion though to clarify that based solely on the 13C values
of L. hawaiensis there is no indication of partial mycoheterotrophy.
Comment: Line 274 better report light values if you have them. Partial
mycoheterotrophic plants are expected to increase 13C abundance in the shade (see Preiss
et al. 2009 paper in Proc Roy Soc): you observe the opposite here!
Response: The paper by Preiss et al that the reviewer mentions was focused on
ectomycorrhizal partially mycoheterotrophic orchids, not rhizoctonia associated ones,
which likely behave isotopically differently for carbon due to different substrate use by
their fungi. Indeed I did find differences in the 13C values of A. sandvicensis among
populations, but it is not clear that these are directly related to the light environment, this
is just one possibility. I have revised this section of the discussion to clarify this point.
Comment: Line 293 leafless, ok, but green or not?
Response: from the photograph in the relevant publication it looks like this species
certainly contains chlorophyll, however, similar to Corallorhiza trifida it may not meet its
C-demands solely via photosynthesis (see Cameron et al. 2009. New Phytologist, 183(2),
358-364). I have revised this section accordingly.

Orchids are one of the most widely distributed plant families. However, current research
the ecophysiology of terrestrial orchids is biased toward temperate species. Thus, it is
rently unknown whether tropical terrestrial orchids belong to similar trophic guilds as their
perate relatives. To examine the ecophysiologies of two tropical terrestrial orchids I analyzed
carbon and nitrogen stable isotope compositions and nitrogen concentrations of the Hawaiian
emics Anoectochilus sandvicensis and Liparis hawaiensis. I compared these values with
se of surrounding vegetation and their temperate relatives. I found that A. sandvicensis was
sistently enriched in the heavy isotope of nitrogen (15N) and had higher nitrogen (N)
centrations than surrounding vegetation, and these values were even higher than those of its
perate relatives. Carbon stable isotope composition among populations of A. sandvicensis
ied by island. These results point to local environment and evolutionary history determining
ecophysiology of this species. Whereas L. hawaiensis was also enriched in 15N and had on
rage higher N concentrations than surrounding vegetation, these values were not significantly
erent from temperate relatives, indicating that evolutionary history may be a stronger
dictor of this orchid species ecophysiology than environment. I suggest that both Hawaiian
cies are potentially partially mycoheterotrophic.

roduction
Orchids are an example of one of the most successful colonizations of the earth by a
gle plant family, they exist on every continent and their distributions extend to even the most
ote oceanic islands. Orchidaceae is also one of the most species rich plant families and
tains a diversity of functional guilds from epiphytes, to terrestrial herbs and evergreen species
Perhaps one of the most interesting guilds of orchids are the non-photosynthetic
coheterotrophs [2]. Mycoheterotrophy entails plants meeting all, or a portion of their carbon
ands via symbiotic interactions with root-inhabiting fungi [3]. All orchids studied to date are
sidered initially mycoheterotrophic as they rely on fungi to provide germinating seeds with
necessary carbohydrates and nutrients for development [4]. As orchids mature, their
endency on fungal nutrition ranges from full to partial mycoheterotrophy to autotrophy [5].
Detection of partial mycoheterotrophy among orchids poses a particular challenge, as
se are leafy green individuals that based on appearance, generally look just like their
otrophic relatives. Two lines of evidence have been used to establish whether an orchid is
tially mycoheterotrophic. The first is the analysis of the naturally abundant carbon and
ogen stable isotope profiles of orchids. Many partially mycoheterotrophic species are
iched in both the heavy isotope of carbon (13C) and nitrogen (15N) relative to surrounding
otrophic species [6]. In the case of carbon (C), this enrichment is owed to the use of fungal
ived compounds for growth and reproduction, rather than C assimilated through
tosynthesis [6]. The cause of 15N enrichment among partially mycoheterotrophic species is
clear, but often mirrors that of fully mycoheterotrophic species and may be owed to the use
rganic substrates originating from fungi, rather than assimilated from the soil [6]. The second
of evidence for partial mycoheterotrophy has been molecular identification plants’
corrhizal fungal symbionts. Originally, Bidartondo et al. 2004 found that some leafy green
hid species were both enriched in 13C and 15N relative to other species, and partnered with
omycorrhizal fungi [7]. Ectomycorrhizal fungi had already been established as the hosts to
y mycoheterotrophic orchids [8], thus it was proposed that partially mycoheterotrophic
cies must also solely rely on this guild of fungi [9]. However, more recent analyses have
ealed that partial mycoheterotrophy is much more widespread within Orchidaceae than
viously thought [10]. The majority of orchid species associate with the polyphyletic group of
hid mycorrhizal fungi known as the rhizoctonias [4]. These fungi include Tulasnellaceae,
atobasidiaceae and Sebacinales species that range in their ecologies from saprotrophs, to
ophytes, to mycorrhizal with other plant groups [4]. In the case of rhizoctonia-associated
hids, carbon stable isotope profiles do not always provide clear evidence of partial
coheterotrophy [10-13]. However, recent measurements of additional ecophysiological traits
led researchers to question whether some species that are not enriched in 13C, but
nificantly enriched in 15N may be at least partially reliant on fungal nutrition [10].
Suspicion of partial mycoheterotrophy in rhizoctonia-associated orchids arose when
earchers were consistently finding significant 15N enrichment, and in some cases significantly
her leaf nitrogen content, relative to other orchids and surrounding autotrophs [6]. Initially,
se species were referred to as cryptic mycoheterotrophs [6]. More recently, Gebauer et al.
16) hypothesized that enrichment hydrogen stable isotopes can be used as a proxy for carbon
ns via fungi since all organic compounds exchanged between fungi and orchids contain
rogen and carbon [10]. Analyzing the stable isotope profiles of deuterium (2H) and oxygen
) they found that four species of rhizoctonia-associated orchids are similarly enriched in
se isotopes as ectomycorrhizal partially and fully mycoheterotrophic orchid species. These
ings support the widespread existence of partial mycoheterotrophy among rhizoctonia-
ociated orchids, and that significant 15N enrichment can be used as an indicator of partial
coheterotrophy. However, previous studies of rhizoctonia-associated orchids have all been
ried out in temperate or Mediterranean climates [7, 11-19] so it remains to be seen if the
erns of 15N enrichment and high leaf nitrogen content hold for related tropical species.
To date the stable isotope profiles of tropical orchids have only been examined for
phytic CAM species [20] and terrestrial fully mycoheterotrophic species associating with
er saprotrophic [21-23] or ectomycorrhizal [23, 24] fungi. In contrast to mycoheterotrophic
cies, CAM epiphytic orchids tend to be depleted in 15N and enriched in 13C and have lower
N content relative to their host trees [20]. Whereas similar to their temperate counterparts,
ical fully mycoheterotrophic orchids associated with ectomycorrhizal or saprotrophic fungi
enriched in both 13C and 15N, and have higher N content than surrounding autotrophs [6, 22-
.
Terrestrial rhizoctonia-associated orchids are common in the tropics [25], but their stable
ope profiles and nitrogen content have yet to be examined, thus it remains to be seen whether
physiological patterns of these orchids remain consistent across climatic zones. Though
rohabitats vary greatly within the tropics, due to generally greater nitrogen availability in the
ics relative to more temperate regions, one might predict that tropical species would be more
iched in 15N (owing to preferential loss of 14N via leaching and denitrification) and have
rall greater leaf nitrogen content [26]. If this were the case, then any relative enrichment in
or relatively higher N content owed to partial mycoheterotrophy in tropical rhizoctonia-
ociated orchids may be masked [6, 10]. Alternatively, tropical rhizoctonia-associated orchids
are capable of partial mycoheterotrophy may be more enriched in 15N and have nitrogen
tents that are significantly higher than both surrounding autotrophic vegetation and those of
r temperate relatives. In this study I set out to examine the carbon and nitrogen
physiologies of two tropical orchid species endemic to the Hawaiian Islands.
The Hawaiian Islands are host to three native orchid species, which are also endemic to
Islands, Anoectochilus sandvicensis (tribe Cranichideae), Liparis hawaiensis (tribe
laxideae), and the critically endangered species Peristylus holochila (=Platanthera holochila
e Orchideae) [27, 28]. Due to the rarity of P. holochila, I focused this study only on L.
aiensis and A. sandvicensis. Both species are found on all the major Hawaiian Islands [27],
are considered rare with A. sandvicensis classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN Red
t of Threatened Species [29]. The genus Liparis has a global distribution with the exception of
poles. It is estimated to have over 400 species and is well-represented throughout the Pacific
nds and particularly rich in the Paleotropics [30]. The genus Anoectochilus has more than 40
cies and is widespread throughout tropical regions [31].
Tribal relatives of A. sandvicensis and L. hawaiensis vary in their mycorrhizal specificity,
m associating with a single clade or species of Tulasnella in Goodyera pubescens and Liparis
folia, respectively [32], to more broad associations with a diversity of Ceratobasium and
asnella species in Anoectochilus formosanus [31] and L. loeselii [33]. Based on Sanger
uencing of the fungal barcode locus (the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer) from a
set of the individuals of A. sandvicensis and all individuals of L. hawaiensis from the current
dy both species associate strictly with either Ceratobasidium spp. or Tulasnella spp.,
pectively (Hynson unpublished). Furthermore, there is only one currently identified native
omycorrhizal host tree in Hawaii (Pisonia sandwicensis) and its distribution does not overlap
h the endemic orchids [34]. The sister species to L. hawaiensis, L. japonica associates only
h specific Tulasnella species [35], while other species of Anoectochilus appear to be more
erse in their fungal partnerships associating with rhizoctonias and in A. roxburghii, at least
normally saprotrophic species of Mycena [31, 36]. Combined, these lines of evidence
port L. hawaiensis and A. sandvicensis belonging to the rhizoctonia-associated guild of
hids.
In this study I address the following questions: 1) based on their 15N and 13C
positions and N concentrations do two tropical terrestrial orchid species show indications of
tial mycoheterotrophy? 2) Do these orchids exhibit similar patterns of 15N composition, and N
centrations as their temperate relatives? And 3) Do these tropical orchids and their temperate
tives have similar patterns of 15N and 13C enrichment relative to their respective surrounding
etation? To address these questions I compare the isotope profiles and nitrogen
centrations of A. sandvicensis and L. hawaiensis to neighboring plants as well as their
perate orchid relatives.

pling scheme and site descriptions
Over a two-year period from July 2013 to July 2015 I sampled 11 sites across four islands
waii, Maui, Oahu and Kauai) containing the Hawaiian orchid Anoectochilus sandvicensis and
e sites from Oahu with the orchid Liparis hawaiensis (Table 1). Populations of the two
hid species are rare within the Islands, but can be locally abundant. Anoectochilus
dvicensis is a terrestrial creeping herb with extensive rhizomes, while L. hawaiensis is a
estrial or epiphytic herb with rooting rhizomes and pseudobulbs from which the leaves arise
]. Both species are generally confined to native rainforest habitats and are frequently rooted in
mus, decaying logs or in the case of L. hawaiensis growing epiphytically. Historically A.
dvicensis occurred between 300-1500 m in elevation, and L. hawaiensis could be found from
level to over 3,000 m in elevation [27]. Today, populations of both orchids are primarily
ricted to higher elevation sites where native vegetation remains intact (Hank Oppenheimer
sonal communication). Permission to access and sample orchid populations was granted by
land owners/managers for each site and collecting permits were obtained.
Vegetation types for orchid collection sites were montane wet-mesic native forests (Mt.
ala, Oahu; Volcano National Park, Hawaii; Waikamoi Nature Preserve, Maui; Kahili Ridge,
uai). I selected my sampling sites based on the following criteria: at least one cluster or
ividual of A. sandvicensis or L. hawaiensis was growing terrestrially within 0.5 m of at least
other understory species, with at least two individuals per species. Due to the rhizomatous
ure of A. sandvicensis, determining individuals in the field is challenging. To avoid sampling
same individual twice, I separated my sampling sites by at least 10 m. I also sampled leaves
imilar age and from plants of similar size in an effort to control for the influences of plant
nology on stable isotope composition. At each site I sampled one to four leaves of A.
dvicensis or one leaf of L. hawaiensis (Table 1). As site specific references for the stable
ope composition of autotrophic plants leaves from the surrounding understory were also
ected (Table 1). To control for microsite variability that may influence the stable isotope
position of plant tissues, autotrophic leaf samples were taken from within a 0.5 m radius of
r corresponding A. sandvicensis cluster or L. hawaiensis individual and from similar heights
he leaves of the orchids. Samples were bagged until I returned to either the University of
waii Manoa on Oahu, or my lodging on the other islands where they could be further
cessed.
ble isotope and nitrogen content analyses
Within hours of being collected, leaf samples from each individual plant were dried at
roximately 80°C for a minimum of 6 hours and up to 12 depending on the water content of
species. Dried leaves were ground to a fine powder, weighed and analyzed for nitrogen
tent, nitrogen and carbon stable isotope abundances via elemental analyzer/continuous flow
ope ratio mass spectrometry at the Center for Stable Isotope Biogeochemistry at the
versity of California Berkeley as in Hynson et al. (2009) [11]. Measured isotope abundances
denoted as d values and are calculated according to the equation: d15N or d13C =
ample/Rstandard-1) x 1000 [‰], where Rsample and Rstandard are the ratios of heavy isotope to light
ope of the samples and the respective standard. The long-term precisions for d13C and d15N
ed on the laboratory’s working standards (NIST 1577 bovine liver and sucrose solution) are:
‰ for d13C and 0.2‰ for d15N.
a analysis and statistics
Because leaf stable isotope compositions are influenced by local climatic conditions, to
ke comparisons of these values among islands I used a data normalizing calculation know as
sotope enrichment factor (e) approach [37]. Enrichment factors were calculated on a site-by-
basis in the following way: e= dXsample-dXref where dXsample is the d15N or d13C of an
ividual sample (A. sandvicensis, L. hawaiensis, or autotrophic species) and dXref is the mean
N or d13C of all autotrophic plants from a given site. Enrichment factors per island and species
group in the case of autotrophs) were then averaged (Figure 1). Average nitrogen (N)
centration (mmol gdw-1) by orchid species and autotrophic references per island are shown in
ure 2. All values are shown ±1 standard error (SE).
Shapiro-Wilk tests revealed that none of the data were consistently normally distributed
N concentration, e13C or e15N thus statistical comparisons between A. sandvicensis, L.
aiensis and autotrophic references for all three island were made using non-parametric
skal-Wallis tests with Bonferrroni corrections for multiple comparisons when appropriate.
tistical comparisons could not be made for Hawaii Island due to inadequate replication (A.
dvicensis n=1). Tests incorporated the spread of enrichment factors not only for A.
dvicensis and L. hawaiensis, but the autotrophic references as well since individual replicates
eference species are also subjected to the enrichment factor calculation (i.e. statistical
parisons of the two orchid species are not to zero, but the variation of the references from
o). Comparisons of the nitrogen concentrations, d15N, e15N and e13C between L. hawaiensis
its temperate relatives Liparis nervosa and L. loesellii were made using a Kruskal-Wallis test
to non-normal distribution of the data. Comparisons of the same factors for A. sandvicensis
its temperate relatives in subtribe Goodyerinae (Goodyera repens, G. oblongifolia, G.
lechtendaliana and Zeuxine agyokuana) were also made using a Kruskal-Wallis test. Data on
temperate relatives of L. hawaiensis and A. sandvicensis were extracted from prior
lications [11, 18, 38] and in the case of L. loesellii, personal communication with Julienne
iebold. All statistics were carried out in SPSS v.24 (IBM Armonk, NY) and considered
nificant at a=0.05.
ults
Delta 13C values of all plants sampled in this study were within the known ranges for C3
cies (Table 1)[39]. Patterns of 15N and 13C composition and leaf nitrogen concentrations for
ectochilus sandvicensis and Liparis hawiensis shared some similarities with their temperate
tives, but were also species and location specific (Figures 1 & 2, Table 2). Anoectochilus
dvicensis was consistently enriched in 15N relative to surrounding vegetation (Kauai mean
N 2.39(0.77)‰, P=0.018; Maui mean e15N 3.28(0.26)‰, P=0.001, Oahu mean e15N
7(0.19)‰, P<0.001, Figure 1). Patterns of 13C composition in A. sandvicensis relative to
rounding vegetation among islands were less consistent. On Kauai and Oahu A. sandvicensis
C values were not significantly different than those of reference plants (Kauai mean e13C
5(0.57)‰, Oahu mean e13C -0.50(0.31)‰, Figure 1), while on Maui A. sandvicensis was
nificantly depleted in 13C relative to references (mean e13C -3.35(0.34)‰, P=0.002, Figure 1).
ile statistical tests were not appropriate for comparisons of the single Hawaii Island
ividual of A. sandvicensis, it was depleted in 13C (e13C -2.48‰) and enriched in 15N (e15N
7‰) relative to references (Figure 1). Anoectochilus sandvicensis had higher leaf N
centrations relative to references on all the Islands except Maui, but only on Oahu were
erences in leaf N concentrations statistically significant (P<0.001, Figure 2), while marginally
on Kauai (P=0.06, Figure 2).
Liparis hawaiensis from Mount Ka’ala, Oahu was not significantly enriched in 15N (mean
N 1.24(0.82)‰) relative to surrounding references while it was significantly depleted in 13C
an e13C -2.18(0.62)‰, P=0.047, Figure 1), and had significantly greater leaf N
centrations than reference species (P=0.003, Figure 1). Average leaf N concentrations for L.
aiensis were the highest among our test species and significantly higher than references
0.003, Figure 2). Nitrogen concentrations of L. hawaiensis were not significantly different
m A. sandvicensis from the same location (Figure 2). Concurrently, e13C and e15N values were
istically indistinguishable between A. sandvicensis and L. hawaiensis individuals from Oahu.
wever, A. sandvicensis was on average more enriched in 15N and 13C than L. hawaiensis
gure 1).
Nitrogen concentrations and d15N values for A. sandvicensis from across all Islands were
nificantly higher than its temperate relatives in Goodyerinae (P=0.002 and P<0.001
pectively, Table 2). Similarly, e15N and e13C values of A. sandvicensis were significantly
her than its temperate counterparts (P=<0.001 and P=0.041 respectively, Table 2).
nversely, while on average L. hawaiensis had higher N concentrations and d15N values
tive to its temperate congeners, its e15N and e13C values were more depleted and none of
se values were statistically distinguished from their temperate counterparts (Table 2).
cussion
Tropical terrestrial orchid species are numerous, but to date there has been a bias in the
rature toward examining the ecophysiologies of temperate species [6]. To address this gap, I
vide the first data on the carbon and nitrogen ecophysiologies of two out of the three endemic
hid species to Hawaii. I found that among Islands, populations of A. sandvicensis were
sistently enriched in 15N relative to surrounding vegetation. The on average 3.05‰ 15N
ichment in A. sandvicensis is biologically significant. For example, it is greater than
erences in 15N relative abundance between congeneric and sympatric tropical plant species
either derive N from ant debris or the soil [40], and greater than differences among
specifics of an insectivorous plant species where some individuals derive a greater portion of
rom litterfall than prey [41]. Furthermore, the 15N enrichment found in A. sandvicensis is
ilar to other temperate individuals of Goodyerinae, but even more pronounced (Table 2).
ng with significant relative enrichment in 15N, A. sandvicensis generally also had higher N
centrations than surrounding vegetation. However, N concentrations in A. sandvicensis were
y significantly higher than references species on Oahu, and were on average, lower among
ui individuals. Similar to patterns of 15N enrichment, N concentrations among all A.
dvicensis individuals were significantly higher than those of its temperate relatives (Table 2).
The lines of evidence supporting partial mycoheterotrophy among rhizoctonia-associated
hids are mounting. First, all orchids studied to date are initially mycoheterotrophic, thus the
siology to feed off of fungi exists [6]. Second, Cameron et al. (2008) found transfer of carbon
m rhizoctonias to adult Goodyera repens ex situ, indicating that mycoheterotrophic C-gains
persist past germination [42]. Third, the results of Gebauer et al. (2016) demonstrated
ilarities in the isotope profiles of fully and partially myocheterotrophic ectomycorrhizal
hids relying solely on fungal derived substrates and rhizoctonia associated orchids [10]. The
rent findings show that the temperate patterns of 15N enrichment and N content hold at least
two tropical rhizoctonia-associated orchid species and provide evidence of possible partial
coheterotrophy in A. sandvicensis. These results also support the hypothesis that due to
erally relatively greater N availability in the tropics, tropical terrestrial orchids can have an
itive enrichment in 15N and N concentrations relative to temperate species.
In the case of A. sandvicensis, e13C values relative to surrounding vegetation varied by
pling location (Figure 1). This variation may be related to the light environment in which
ividual orchids were found. Liebel et al. (2015) found that the d13C values of Goodyera
ens (Goodyerinae) in Norway responded similarly to increases in light availability as
rounding autotrophic references by becoming more 13C enriched as irradiance increased [43].
eed, both the Oahu and Kauai sites from the current study were far more exposed (mountain
ridge tops) relative to the Hawaii and Maui sites, which are deeply shaded wet-mesic tropical
ests. Alternatively, the increase in e13C values among Oahu and Kauai populations relative to
waii and Maui could be owed to relative increases in fungal carbon gains. Thus, based solely
e13C the degree of partial mycoheterotrophy in A. sandvicensis remains uncertain. However,
ent work by Gebauer et al. (2016) has highlighted that 13C natural abundance may not be the
t indicator for reliance on fungal-derived compounds among rhizoctonia associated orchids
].
Though from a small sample size (n=3), 15N enrichment and N concentrations of L.
aiensis are not significantly greater than temperate congeners. This indicates that there are
always consistent additive effects of a tropical climate and belonging to Orchidaceae on
ical orchid species N physiologies. Similar to the temperate species Liparis nervosa [38], L.
aiensis from Mount Ka’ala, Oahu was on average (though not significantly so) enriched in
relative to surrounding references, while similar to Liparis loesellii (Schiebold in prep) it
significantly depleted in 13C (Figure 1), and had significantly greater leaf N content than
rence species (Figure 2). Previously, L. nervosa has been estimated to receive upwards of
% of its carbon and 18% of its nitrogen via mycoheterotrophy [6]. Given that L. nervosa and
awaiensis have similar relative 15N enrichment, and that L. hawaiensis has N concentrations
hin the same range as L. nervosa (Table 2), this species is also a candidate for partial
coheterotrophy. However, similar to A. sandvicensis, e13C values alone provide no clear
ication of partial mycoheterotrophy. Interestingly, the genus Liparis may be predisposed to
evolution of mycoheterotrophy as it belongs to subfamily Epidendroideae which contains
y mycohetertrophic taxa and there exists a leafless, but green stemmed South American
cies L. aphylla (a likely candidate for partial or full mycoheterotrophy) [6, 44].
nclusions
The current definition of mycoheterotrophy put forth by Merckx (2012) is “the ability of
ant to obtain carbon from fungi” [3]. Originally, one of the most useful indicators of carbon
ns via fungi in potentially mycoheterotrophic species was 13C enrichment above that of
rounding vegetation and more similar to the fungi on which they depend [6]. This pattern of
enrichment among partially and fully mycoheterotrophic species follows the isotope food-
in model put forth by Fry (2006) [45] and 13C enrichment appears to be a consistent trait
ong mycoheterotrophic Orchidaceae that partner with ectomycorrhizal fungi [46]. However,
is generally not the case for rhizoctonia-associated orchids, which are often depleted in 13C
how no difference in 13C enrichment relative to surrounding autotrophs [6]. This makes
ection of mycoheterotrophy less straight forward in terrestrial rhizoctonia-associated orchid
cies and has led researchers to question whether these species maintain mycoheterotrophic C-
ns post germination [11]. However, some rhizoctonia-associated orchids may still be capable
mycoheterotrophy as significant 15N enrichment along with other ecophysiological traits
erge as an additional indicator of carbon gains via fungi [10]. Furthermore, based on the
ults of this study, patterns of significant 15N enrichment and high N content among
octonia-associated orchids hold, or are even more pronounced in the tropics than temperate
ions. This suggests that 15N enriched rhizoctonia-associated orchids should be considered an
itional functional guild of mycoheterotrophs [6, 11]. Future efforts should be focused on
mining the ecophysiologies of additional tropical terrestrial orchid taxa including deuterium
position, identifying the fungal partners of these species, as well as the mechanisms by
ch compounds are exchanged between rhizoctonias and their orchid partners.
Tropical species, especially those that are island endemics, are considered some of the
st sensitive to the negative effects of global change such as habitat fragmentation and invasive
cies [47, 48]. Therefore, they should be research and conservation priorities. However,
rmation on the interactions of island endemic tropical plants with their microbial symbionts
h as mycorrhizal fungi, which are critical for plant establishment, growth and reproduction is
ely lacking [49]. Until there are more efforts put forth to study these interactions it remains
nown whether the ecologies and ecophysiologies of temperate and tropical species are
parable. This study highlights the parallels and differences among the ecophysiologies of
ical and temperate species for an important group of globally distributed plants–the orchids.
