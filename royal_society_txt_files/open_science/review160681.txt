GENERAL
The paper is ambivalent as to whether it is targeted at conservation biologists or those interested
in the evolution of defenses. If the former it needs to consider other extinction drivers in a
multifactorial model - something that Kevin may not want to do. If it going to be targeted at basic
researchers, it needs a clearer link between past and current extinction drivers and for the reader
to be told why is this interesting.

Discussion
Lines 190-202 are pretty critical unfortunately because they help inform conservation managers of
dangers to amphibian taxa. They will want to know this and it would have been nice to include
such variables in a multifactorial model that included chemical defenses. Since extinction drivers
are likely to be correlated, I think a multifactorial model is needed rather than examining one
driver in isolation. This is my key worry with this paper.
Lines 220- 234 - I dont see merit in linking psast and current extinction likelihoods. What am I
missing here?
Lines 245-265 should be condensed and presented in the Intro as well.

In conclusion, the target audience issue needs attention. After that it will fall into place.

I have read this paper carefully and with great interest. The author sets out to test the hypothesis
that chemical defense predicts extant extinction risk in amphibians. Past work by the author has
shown a link between these defenses and macroevolutionary patterns of extinction, and, given
that amphibians are currently undergoing mass extinction, it is an interesting question for both
conservationists and evolutionary biologists as to whether patterns of trait-dependent extinction
are conserved across these timescales. The author indeed finds that the extant data matches the
macroevolutionary patterns. As far as I know, this is one of just a few studies to find such a link.
The paper is generally clear, concise, and well written, and I think will represent an important
contribution to the literature. I do, however, have some methodological concerns that should be
addressed before publication.
First (and I begin with this point because it is key to my next point, which has practical relevance
for the analyses), I disagree with the author that IUCN status is not an evolving trait and should
not be treated as such (Line 123-125 and supplementary material). IUCN threat status is an
ordinal, categorical status that reflects an underlying, continuous, unobservable ‘latent’ trait:
extinction likelihood. Just as a phenotypic mean can evolve, a population’s extinction probability
can evolve. Thus we expect IUCN threat status to evolve in manner similar to Sewall Wright’s
threshold model of evolution, where expression of a discrete trait is determined by alleles at
many loci. The fact that humans assign IUCN threat status is neither here nor there: humans also
assign an arithmetic measurement scale every time we measure a species’ body length, or, for a
categorical analogy, we may bin what is actually a continuous trait (e.g., chemical defense) into
somewhat arbitrary categories.
4
The phylogenetic logistic regression used in one of the analyses indeed treats IUCN threat status
in this way. The other models, however, do not. Although the Poisson regression used with the
threat level may fit the data OK, it is not ‘correct’ in either the biological or statistical sense; the
IUCN categories are not counts/sums of rare events (the author brings up a related reason why
this model is inappropriate for the data in the discussion). An appropriate model for the ordinal
status data would treat the response in a similar way to a logistic regression, but allow for
multiple response levels and an order to transitions. Thus, a multinomial linear mixed model,
with a cumulative probit or logit link function, is probably the most appropriate (statistically and
biologically) approach to analyzing these data. This category of model can be fit, for example, in
the MCMCglmm R package (and I believe there is an example of a multinomial model in the
course notes), in SAS proc glimmix, and perhaps other software or R packages. Other papers that
analyze IUCN categories in a comparative context have used this approach (e.g., Matthews et al
2011 Proc B, Arregoita et al. 2013 Proc B, De Lisle & Rowe 2015 Proc B) and other authors have
discussed multinomial models (e.g. Hadfield & Nakagawa 2010 JEB; see also refs in Matthews et
al 2011 Proc B. for discussion of IUCN ranks). Further, figure 2 suggests that the ability of
chemical defense to predict extinction risk may depend largely on the inclusion of extinct species,
which are an extremely small subset of the data. Thus, a more convincing analysis than the one
presented in this paper would involve fitting two multinomial phylogenetic mixed models; one
with a 6 level response and one with 5 (i.e. excluding the extinct taxa, to confirm that the result
does not depend entirely on them).
The Pagel model also treats the evolution of IUCN threat inappropriately, as we don’t expect
threshold traits to evolve under a Markovian process, because under the threshold model a
lineage will be more likely to transition between character states right after a previous transition
(because it is near the threshold; see, e.g., Revell 2014 Evolution). To the author’s credit, Pagel’s
correlation model is frequently inappropriately applied to threshold traits, and the phylogenetic
logistic regression presented in the paper is testing a similar hypothesis in a more appropriate
way. A much more serious concern is that these Pagel models fail to accommodate situations in
which there is no true phylogenetic replication (Maddison & FitzJohn 2015 Sys Bio). I think, that
if the author wishes to present this Pagel analysis, the data should be at least be plotted on the
tree and presented in the paper or supplementary material to insure that there are, indeed,
multiple independent correlated transitions in the traits.
Other/Minor comments:
Line 116-117 It would be fairly easy to obtain latitude data for nearly all the species in your
dataset (e.g., the range maps are on Amphibiaweb, and you can obtain approximate median
latitude by opening them in google maps and just clicking on the approximate median; there is
presumably enough error in these range maps that the exact median from GIS is probably
overkill, plus Pyron and Wiens 2014 have published latitude data for many species). With
complete latitude data, it would be possible to put chemical defense and latitude in the same
regression model(s), and obtain standardized effect sizes. This could be a nice addition to this
study- we know latitude is a strong predictor of extinction risk in this group, and if chemical
defense had a similar effect size, this would be really cool, while I don’t think it would detract
from the result if chemical defense had a weaker effect size than latitude. I think this is optional-
it seems the correlation between these two predictors is indeed weak and probably not leading to
a spurious association between defense and extinction risk, although adding latitude in the same
model could add some insight.
Line 159, 161: Degrees of freedom should be given for the LR tests
5
Line 163-168: This result implies that lineages with chemical defense should be, on average,
younger than lineages that lack defense. Is this the case? (e.g., is there a difference in terminal
edge lengths on the dated tree between the two groups?)
Line 190-202: De Lisle & Rowe 2015 found that sexual size dimorphism is also an important
predictor of current and past extinction risk in amphibians.
Line 251-265: Could a fourth possibility be that chemical defense reflects the outcome of predator-
prey arms races, such that heavily defended species are also subject to particularly intense
predation? I also think that mentioning the different hypotheses in the introduction would
strengthen this paper- I was left wondering “why?” until I got to this section.

What is lacking from this thorough analysis is the mechanism by which chemical defenses are
associated with extinction risk. The author discusses these but then says they are beyond the
scope of the paper. Is that really true? Surely some serious arguments can be made in favour or
against each - this seems like a wasted opportunity to get to the bottom of this. It will make the
paper more memorable.
Second - yes lots of other correlates of extinction risk in amphibians - why were these not

would it actually be to throw is these documented variables in an analysis to assess relative

Review of “Chemical antipredator defense is linked to higher extinction risk”
I have read this paper for the second time. Arbuckle seems to have addressed all of my previous
concerns, which were mostly statistical. My only comments on this revised version are some
minor writing suggestions.
I think the paragraph at line 73-82 should be moved before the paragraph at line 56-72. As it
reads now chemical defense is introduced out of the blue after discussion of links between
macroevolutionary patterns and extant conservation concerns.
Line 228: Other factors such as?
Line 255-256- I found this confusing. Maybe say they are independent data sets? The results of
your work suggest that although the datasets are independent, extinction processes may not be
across these two timescales since the same patterns are observed.
Finally, It seems to me that the slow life history hypothesis doesn’t really fit, because how does it
explain the elevated speciation rates at the macroevolutionary scale? If anything it seems that
evolution of a slower life history would reduce speciation rates as generation times increase. It
seems that the “marginal habitat” idea could carry weight if chemical defense somehow leads to
rapid speciation into ephemeral adaptive zones. This would be consistent with the previous
finding of elevated speciation rates in these lineages.

Response to Reviewer Comments
hank both reviewers for their encouraging, thoughtful and insightful comments on the
nuscript. They have led to fairly wide changes to the manuscript (particularly with respect
reviewer 2's methodological suggestions), and I hope I have satisfactorily addressed the
ncerns of both reviewers. Where text from the manuscript is quoted, I have highlighted
anges in bold unless the entire section is new.

he paper is ambivalent as to whether it is targeted at conservation biologists or those
erested in the evolution of defenses. If the former it needs to consider other extinction
vers in a multifactorial model - something that Kevin may not want to do. If it going to be
geted at basic researchers, it needs a clearer link between past and current extinction
vers and for the reader to be told why is this interesting."
anks for these suggestions, I can readily see how it may come across as not clearly
nservation or evolutionary focussed. I suspect that part of this comes from the fact that,
reviewer 2 highlights, the subject of the paper "is an interesting question for both
nservationists and evolutionary biologists", which leaves me hesitant to reduce the focus
either group too much. Nevertheless, I agree that such split-purposes can be difficult to
egrate in a readable way and I have therefore added a slightly greater emphasis on the
olutionary side. This is my main interest personally and I have tried to do this by
ponding to another comment made both by yourself and reviewer 2. Specifically, I have
ded more discussion of possible explanations in the introduction in a new paragraph and
ed this to more tightly link past and current drivers of extinction. I hope this addresses the
ky issue of balance between conservation and evolution in this paper to your satisfaction.

ave pruned this paragraph slightly to improve its conciseness, although I am hesitant to

ar and concise' in writing style).
tro: Para 45-60 is also superflous - just cut to the chase and start on line 57."
ave pruned this paragraph slightly, but I feel that it is necessary as an explanation as to
y 1) it is worth testing for the effect of a trait based on results from macroevolutionary
dies, and 2) why we may or may not expect studies of extinction risk on these two scales
concur.
nishing the Intro, I am not convinced you need say anything at all about past background
inction rates. Just ask the Q - does chemical defenses handicap amphibians now.
rfectly reasonable Q. More generally we need to be made aware on logical grounds why
emical defenses should be associated with extinction in contemporary environments."
anks for flagging this up, I agree that the introduction should give reasons why we might
pect associations between chemical defence and extinction in the present day. I think I
ve addressed this concurrently with addressing some of your other comments by moving
mechanistic hypotheses for such a link to the introduction. In terms of the discussion of
ckground extinction rates, part of the interest in this paper is in considering whether
tterns of trait-dependent extinction are conserved across broad timescales, as also
hlighted by reviewer 2, so I believe it is important to keep this in.
ethods: Justify the testing of body size and latitude on logical grounds."
ven that I could argue for confounding effects in either direction on logical grounds, or
ernatively no such effects, in this case I think that the practical justification of 'previous
rk have found a particularly important effect of these traits' is better suited for present
rposes.
scussion: Lines 190-202 are pretty critical unfortunately because they help inform
nservation managers of dangers to amphibian taxa. They will want to know this and it
uld have been nice to include such variables in a multifactorial model that included
emical defenses. Since extinction drivers are likely to be correlated, I think a multifactorial
del is needed rather than examining one driver in isolation. This is my key worry with this
per."
gree, however, when I included all traits considered in the paper as potential confounders
hin the same model none of them were found to have an effect. This is despite latitude
d size being consistently associated with extinction risk (in previous work and when I
del them in unifactorial models in my dataset) and them having no detectable covariation
h chemical defence. Overall this suggests that in the dataset available in the paper there
simply not enough power to detect such effects when all included in the same model. In
s vein I note that other previous work which have detected these relationships have used
ger sample sizes that I was able to here as the overlap in species with data on chemical
fence, latitude, and body size was limited and resulted in a much smaller sample size. In
sence, this smaller sample size combined with increasing number of parameters in a
ltifactorial model seems to be reducing the power to detect effects of any particular trait.
vertheless, the lack of covariation between any of those traits and chemical defence
ggests that the effect of this trait detected in the unifactorial model is not confounded by
k of inclusion of latitude and body size, and therefore is an effect that is picked out when
s present in a model as the sole predictor (as is the case with the other traits known to
ve an effect). Although suboptimal, I hope the slightly increased emphasis on evolution
her than practical conservation in the paper lessens the importance of this point and
ains the interest of the association between defence and extinction risk in and of itself.

have read this paper carefully and with great interest. The author sets out to test the
pothesis that chemical defense predicts extant extinction risk in amphibians. Past work by
author has shown a link between these defenses and macroevolutionary patterns of
inction, and, given that amphibians are currently undergoing mass extinction, it is an
eresting question for both conservationists and evolutionary biologists as to whether
tterns of trait-dependent extinction are conserved across these timescales. The author
eed finds that the extant data matches the macroevolutionary patterns. As far as I know,
s is one of just a few studies to find such a link. The paper is generally clear, concise, and
ll written, and I think will represent an important contribution to the literature. I do,
wever, have some methodological concerns that should be addressed before
blication."
ank you, I hope I’ve managed to address the concerns you had.
rst (and I begin with this point because it is key to my next point, which has practical
evance for the analyses), I disagree with the author that IUCN status is not an evolving
it and should not be treated as such (Line 123-125 and supplementary material). IUCN
eat status is an ordinal, categorical status that reflects an underlying, continuous,
observable ‘latent’ trait: extinction likelihood. Just as a phenotypic mean can evolve, a
pulation’s extinction probability can evolve. Thus we expect IUCN threat status to evolve
manner similar to Sewall Wright’s threshold model of evolution, where expression of a
crete trait is determined by alleles at many loci. The fact that humans assign IUCN threat
tus is neither here nor there: humans also assign an arithmetic measurement scale every
e we measure a species’ body length, or, for a categorical analogy, we may bin what is
ually a continuous trait (e.g., chemical defense) into somewhat arbitrary categories."
hough I agree that it can be considered as an evolving trait and analysed as such, I think
re is still a distinction. The comparison to human-assigned arithmetic scales is not quite
curate as whatever scale we measure, for example, body size on, body size itself is still
intrinsic biological trait of the animal. In contrast, whereas Red List status (and extinction
k more generally) is modulated to varying degrees by biological attributes, it is not an
insic trait in itself. This same point has been made in the past in relation to other traits
ich do not strictly evolve but which are tightly associated with other traits enough to be
nsidered in an evolutionary framework, such as environment (e.g. Grandicolas et al.
11. Cladistics 27:181 - 185).
ave left this point in the text to acknowledge this distinction, but I have reworded the text
the methods to hopefully make this clearer by replacing the vaguer wording of human
ssification with intrinsic biology. The text now reads as follows: " I acknowledge that my
xy of extinction risk, IUCN Red List status, is not an intrinsic biological trait and so
es not, in a strict sense, evolve". That said, I should clarify here that my view is that
hough such traits are a distinct type of trait compared to one which evolves in the strictest
nse, they can indeed be treated as evolving with little issue. Having had many debates
out this with other researchers, I felt it best to spend a bit of time explaining why this is
case here as it is a contentious issue for some.
he phylogenetic logistic regression used in one of the analyses indeed treats IUCN threat
tus in this way. The other models, however, do not. Although the Poisson regression
ed with the threat level may fit the data OK, it is not ‘correct’ in either the biological or
tistical sense; the IUCN categories are not counts/sums of rare events (the author brings
a related reason why this model is inappropriate for the data in the discussion). An
propriate model for the ordinal status data would treat the response in a similar way to a
istic regression, but allow for multiple response levels and an order to transitions. Thus,
multinomial linear mixed model, with a cumulative probit or logit link function, is probably
most appropriate (statistically and biologically) approach to analyzing these data. This
egory of model can be fit, for example, in the MCMCglmm R package (and I believe
re is an example of a multinomial model in the course notes), in SAS proc glimmix, and
rhaps other software or R packages. Other papers that analyze IUCN categories in a
mparative context have used this approach (e.g., Matthews et al 2011 Proc B, Arregoita
al. 2013 Proc B, De Lisle & Rowe 2015 Proc B) and other authors have discussed
ltinomial models (e.g. Hadfield & Nakagawa 2010 JEB; see also refs in Matthews et al
11 Proc B. for discussion of IUCN ranks). Further, figure 2 suggests that the ability of
emical defense to predict extinction risk may depend largely on the inclusion of extinct
ecies, which are an extremely small subset of the data. Thus, a more convincing analysis
n the one presented in this paper would involve fitting two multinomial phylogenetic
xed models; one with a 6 level response and one with 5 (i.e. excluding the extinct taxa, to
nfirm that the result does not depend entirely on them)."
is is an excellent point and I thank you kindly for bringing it up. I have taken your
ggestions and run the relevant analyses with ordinal pGLMMs instead of Poisson pGLMs.
is failed to find an effect of chemical defence on the more fine-grained coding of threat
tus (whether or not extinct species were included, which in any case were extremely few
number), and so the text in the results and discussion has been updated accordingly.
is could potentially be a power issue as an ordinal mixed model with a 5-6 category
ponse variable (and the necessity to estimate parameters for thresholds between
egories) is far more parameter-rich than a Poisson GLM. Alternatively, it is possible that
re is no fine-grained relationship between defence and threat status: i.e. even if defence
elated to the probability of being threatened, the degree of that threat may be controlled
other factors (this is arguably more likely and considered as such in my updates to the
t).
he Pagel model also treats the evolution of IUCN threat inappropriately, as we don’t
pect threshold traits to evolve under a Markovian process, because under the threshold
del a lineage will be more likely to transition between character states right after a
vious transition (because it is near the threshold; see, e.g., Revell 2014 Evolution). To
author’s credit, Pagel’s correlation model is frequently inappropriately applied to
eshold traits, and the phylogenetic logistic regression presented in the paper is testing a
ilar hypothesis in a more appropriate way. A much more serious concern is that these
gel models fail to accommodate situations in which there is no true phylogenetic
lication (Maddison & FitzJohn 2015 Sys Bio). I think, that if the author wishes to present
s Pagel analysis, the data should be at least be plotted on the tree and presented in the
per or supplementary material to insure that there are, indeed, multiple independent
related transitions in the traits."
gree completely, hence my description and discussion of the Pagel model throughout the
nuscript explicitly considers it tentative and used only to give some additional indication
a particular (directional) hypothesis, despite the caveats. That said, I also agree that it is
ll worth showing that there have been multiple independent transitions in the trait across
tree. I have included ancestral state reconstructions to this end in Supplementary
terial as Figure S1 and references this in the methods as follows: "Such models rely on
ving multiple independent origins of the traits in question throughout the tree44, and this is
case for the traits considered herein (Fig. S1)".
ne 116-117 It would be fairly easy to obtain latitude data for nearly all the species in your
taset (e.g., the range maps are on Amphibiaweb, and you can obtain approximate
dian latitude by opening them in google maps and just clicking on the approximate
dian; there is presumably enough error in these range maps that the exact median from
S is probably overkill, plus Pyron and Wiens 2014 have published latitude data for many
ecies). With complete latitude data, it would be possible to put chemical defense and
tude in the same regression model(s), and obtain standardized effect sizes. This could
a nice addition to this study- we know latitude is a strong predictor of extinction risk in
s group, and if chemical defense had a similar effect size, this would be really cool, while I
n’t think it would detract from the result if chemical defense had a weaker effect size than
tude. I think this is optional- it seems the correlation between these two predictors is
eed weak and probably not leading to a spurious association between defense and
inction risk, although adding latitude in the same model could add some insight."
ave not included this in the current revision since, as you point out, there is no detectable
ationship between chemical defence and latitude and the time necessary to gather the
ditional data on latitude (and other important traits like body size?) for all the species in
dataset for which it is lacking would be difficult to put aside before the deadline. While
latter would not be prohibitive if I thought there was a good chance of the results being
anged as a consequence, given that isn't the case I have left it. Nevertheless, I can see
t there could be a benefit to this so, although you left it as an optional suggestion, if you
lly do feel it should be included I can address this in a future revision.
ne 159, 161: Degrees of freedom should be given for the LR tests"
ne, thanks.
ne 163-168: This result implies that lineages with chemical defense should be, on
erage, younger than lineages that lack defense. Is this the case? (e.g., is there a
erence in terminal edge lengths on the dated tree between the two groups?)"
is is a very interesting idea. I have included this in the manuscript with new text in
thods, results, and discussion, and also as a density histogram of terminal edge lengths
species with and without a chemical defence. I have noted that this is a little bit crude as
est in that it will be partly dependent on sampling distributions etc., but that it should still
d to some extent. In fact, it does in my dataset; I do indeed find an excess of chemically
fended species compared to non-defended species in the most recent 15mya bins.
ne 190-202: De Lisle & Rowe 2015 found that sexual size dimorphism is also an
portant predictor of current and past extinction risk in amphibians."
ry good point, I shouldn't have overlooked this given that it's the same reference that I
tained the body size (and latitude) data from in the first place. I ran the same type of
dels I used to check for a relationship between the potential confounding variables and
emical defence with SSD as a predictor as well, and still found no association between
t and defence. I have added this to the methods section as follows: "As sexual size
orphism has also been found to predict extinction risk35, independently of body size, I
o calculated an index of sexual size dimorphism as the size of the largest sex divided by
t of the smallest to use in another model" and "Neither absolute latitude (P=0.611) nor
dy size (male length, P=0.178; female length, P=0.148) or sexual size dimorphism
=0.539) predicted the presence of chemical defence in this dataset, and are therefore not
nsidered further for the purposes of this study".
ne 251-265: Could a fourth possibility be that chemical defense reflects the outcome of
dator-prey arms races, such that heavily defended species are also subject to
rticularly intense predation? I also think that mentioning the different hypotheses in the
oduction would strengthen this paper- I was left wondering “why?” until I got to this
ction."
cellent point, I have added in a brief discussion of this additional possibility (though the
stence of such defences often reduces predation rates, even if high predation was the
ver for their evolutionary origin). I have also split up this paragraph to present the
potheses in the introduction and left the discussion more focussed on how the results
y shed light on their relative plausibility.
ally I would like to thank the reviewers and the editor once more for their time and
mments. I firmly believe that their efforts have improved the manuscript greatly.

Appendix B
Response to Reviewer Comments
I thank both reviewers for their sincere and fruitful efforts to improve the
manuscript (and overall enthusiasm for the paper). I have tidied up the text
with reference to Reviewer 2’s comments. In response to Reviewer 1’s astute
and valid comments, I have attempted to explain my future plans in a little
more detail to clarify why I feel his suggestions would be another paper but
that, nevertheless, I think the current paper makes several points of its own. I
would like to explicitly stress therefore that I agree with Reviewer 1 in what
should be done, but I only disagree that it needs to be included as part of this
manuscript. I hope I have been clear enough in this response that the
reviewer understands my perspective, even if he still doesn’t necessarily
entirely agree.

Reviewer 1 comments
"What is lacking from this thorough analysis is the mechanism by which
chemical defenses are associated with extinction risk. The author discusses
these but then says they are beyond the scope of the paper. Is that really
true? Surely some serious arguments can be made in favour or against each
- this seems like a wasted opportunity to get to the bottom of this. It will make
the paper more memorable."
I agree entirely that assessing the mechanisms behind the link between
chemical defence and extinction is important. However, I still think that this is
separate paper in itself. Doing this properly would involve a lot of additional
data collection that would include variables selected to best represent each
of the hypotheses (requiring careful thought for some hypotheses in
particular), building of models to represent those hypotheses, and then
evaluating the relative support for these. In my view this would readily qualify
as a distinct (though related) question and project that would be suitable for a
stand-alone publication. I have now included a bit more evaluation of the
hypotheses in the discussion, primarily in relation to the marginal habitats
and slow life-history hypotheses (see the text in my response to reviewer 2’s
last comment below). However, I would emphasise that the current
manuscript does make several distinct points on the consequences of
antipredator defences for amphibians and the temporal stability of patterns of
extinction, so I think the paper still makes an interesting contribution even if it
leaves the mechanisms for a further study (in which I fully plan to incorporate
the excellent suggestions you have provided in your reviews of the current
manuscript).
"Second - yes lots of other correlates of extinction risk in amphibians - why
were these not incorporated in the analyses - eg clutch size, life history
traits? It seems a bit weak just saying "other stuff is important too but I am
not going to attempt to include it". How much extra work would it actually be
to throw is these documented variables in an analysis to assess relative
importance for risk?"
As in my previous response, the reasons for this are two-fold. Firstly, enough
variables have been associated with extinction in one study or another that
including all of those would involve quite a lot of extra work. Given the aim of
the present study is not to compare relative importance, but rather to test for
a link, I can’t see that this extra work would provide enough of a payoff.
Secondly, in part related to the number of extra variables but also to the
decrease in number of species with data for all traits as the number of traits.
This was evident even when taking into account the two particularly important
traits currently in the manuscript as this reduced the sample size substantially
(as detailed in my previous response), and it is therefore not feasible to
include all possible traits and retain enough power to detect any effects
reliably.
Reviewer 2 comments
"I have read this paper for the second time. Arbuckle seems to have
addressed all of my previous concerns, which were mostly statistical. My only
comments on this revised version are some minor writing suggestions.
I think the paragraph at line 73-82 should be moved before the paragraph at
line 56-72. As it reads now chemical defense is introduced out of the blue
after discussion of links between macroevolutionary patterns and extant
conservation concerns."
Done, and I agree, it definitely reads better that way round.
"Line 228: Other factors such as?"
Although difficult to say and likely something that varies case by case, I have
added this parenthetical statement as an example: “(including the intensity of
the drivers of declines such as habitat degradation)”.
"Line 255-256- I found this confusing. Maybe say they are independent data
sets? The results of your work suggest that although the datasets are
independent, extinction processes may not be across these two timescales
since the same patterns are observed."
Thanks for pointing this out – it reads OK to me but this is most likely
because I know what I mean. I can see how it is a little ambiguous and could
be confusing so I’ve replaced “Data for contemporary….” with ‘The datasets
used for contemporary…’ to make the difference clear.
"Finally, It seems to me that the slow life history hypothesis doesn’t really fit,
because how does it explain the elevated speciation rates at the
macroevolutionary scale? If anything it seems that evolution of a slower life
history would reduce speciation rates as generation times increase. It seems
that the “marginal habitat” idea could carry weight if chemical defense
somehow leads to rapid speciation into ephemeral adaptive zones. This
would be consistent with the previous finding of elevated speciation rates in
these lineages."
A very interesting perspective, I have added a bit more favourable
consideration of the marginal habitats hypothesis to incorporate those ideas.
I have also added that caveat to the discussion of the slow-life history
hypothesis, though I would also say that it is possible that different processes
explain variation in speciation vs extinction rates (though I agree they are
likely to be related in the way you suggest) and that differences in selection
can counteract slower rates of mutation accumulation in some cases (e.g.
see Buschiazzo et al.’s 2012 conifer paper), so I don’t think slow life-history is
necessarily precluded as an explanation for patterns of extinction. The
paragraph now reads as follows (with new text in bold):-
“There is a remaining uncertainty as to the mechanistic underpinnings of the
influence of chemical defences on the probability of extinction, but the current
results shed additional light on the plausibility of the potential mechanisms
highlighted in the introduction. The ‘costly chemical’ and ‘marginal habitats’
hypotheses are perhaps poorer explanations for increased extinction risk at
both evolutionary and contemporary scales. Reduced competition after
population declines should increase the resources available to individuals
and therefore ease the energetic trade-offs at the heart of the costly chemical
hypothesis. Similarly, the marginal habitats hypothesis relies on the intrinsic
vulnerability of low carrying capacity environments, but a substantial decline
in the population should again allow a relatively fast recovery until the
carrying capacity is once again reached, due to reduced competition 40, all
else being equal. Nevertheless, the marginal habitats hypothesis would
also explain the higher speciation rates of chemically-defended
amphibians30 if the move to such habitats is also associated with new
ecological opportunities or often simply leads to allopatric speciation.
Although different factors may influence speciation vs extinction rates,
the marginal habitats hypothesis is the only one that could
simultaneously explain both and so may provide a highly plausible
explanation for the results here. The ‘slow life-history’ hypothesis predicts
that chemical defence should lead to the evolution of slower life histories as a
result of reduced extrinsic mortality41. Because such traits are also
characterised by a slow rate of population growth 17, this is potentially a
prime candidate mechanism for a temporally stable relationship between
chemical defence and increased extinction risk in the face of many different
threats. However, one problem for this hypothesis is that slow life-
histories may also lead to slower speciation rates in many
circumstances due to longer generation times, but speciation rates
were found to be higher in chemically-defended amphibians30.”
Finally I would like to thank the reviewers once more for these few additional
comments, as a result the manuscript is now that bit more polished and
hopefully ready for publication.
