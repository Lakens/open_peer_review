This is a very interesting manuscript about the reproductive biology of two little known
Neotropical deer species. Authors pointed in this submission the goal of providing tools to
discriminate between two Mazama species. The approach has the potential to identify species
cluster within South American gray deer clade and contribute to elucidate the complex
systematics of the group. Two main suggestions of my part: 1) The inclusion of samples from
specimens belonging to other genera such as Blastocerus, Ozotocerus, Pudu, and Hippocamelus
(the last one probably the same case as gray Mazama) because the unsolved relationships within
the gray clade, and 2) there is concern about the small sample size. It is understandable that
samples from brocket deer are often difficult to acquire but it will be important to try to obtain
them from other captive breeding centers.
Line 2: It is suggested the use of "gray" instead of "grey", for consistency with Duarte et al. 2008.
Line 19: replace "by analysing" with "based on"
Line 44-45: Re-phrase "Regarding the grey clade, phylogenetic analyses based on mtDNA and
cytochrome B have shown significant genetic differences". Enlist the other mDNA genes other
than Cytb B if this is the case in cited articles.
Line 47: Include Hassanin et al. 2012

28 16 ABSTRACT
29
30 17 There is genetic evidence that the two species of Brazilian grey Mazama, Mazama
31 18 gouazoubira and Mazama nemorivaga, belong to different genera. This study
32
33 19 identified significant differences that separated them into distinct groups, by
34
35 20 analysing characteristics of the spermatozoa and ejaculate of both species. The
36 21 characteristics that most clearly differentiated between the species were ejaculate
37
38 22 colour, white for M. gouazoubira and reddish for M. nemorivaga, and sperm head
39
40 23 dimensions; the area and width were the main variables that distinguished these
41 24 species. Multivariate analysis of sperm size and sperm head format data accurately
42
43 25 discriminated the two species (discrimination between two groups) with low error
44
45 26 identification (0.0021), while the individuals analysed (discrimination between 5
46 27 groups) formed three groups (error identification = 0.16): group 1, individuals of M.
47
48 28 nemorivaga; group 2, individuals of M. gouazoubira; and group 3, a single individual
49
50 29 of M. gouazoubira. The results obtained in this work corroborate the hypothesis of

3 35 1. INTRODUCTION
4
5 36 The family Cervidae is recognised as one of the most controversial due to its
6 37 intergeneric relationships and the systematic taxonomy of the species within the
7
8 38 Cetartiodactyla order. The genus Mazama, is known to be the most complex [1,2]
9
10 39 and is separated into two clades, the grey (M. gouazoubira and M. nemorivaga) and
11 40 the red Mazama (M. americana, M. bororo and M. nana) [3]. In the red clade, the
12
13 41 species M. americana has recently been considered a complex of cryptic species,
14
15 42 because different cytotypes exist in different regions of Brazil [4] and different
16 43 degrees of reproductive isolation exist between these cytotypes [5]. Regarding the
17
18 44 grey clade, phylogenetic analyses based on mtDNA and cytochrome B have shown
19
20 45 significant genetic differences, not only between red and grey Mazama, but also
21 46 between the species M. gouazoubira and M. nemorivaga, and even among
22
23 47 individuals within the species studied [3,6]. The phylogenetic distances verified led
24
25 48 the authors to discuss the creation of new genera for each species of grey Mazama
26 49 [3], including the possible existence of subspecies or cryptic species within each of
27
28 50 the new taxonomic groups [6].
29
30 51 Differences between sperm traits are widely used to understand divergences
31 52 between species that present a strong possibility of being due to sexual selection
32
33 53 pressure [7–10]. The evolution of different characteristics in mammalian
34
35 54 spermatozoa likely occurred due to two main selection forces, the selection of the
36 55 female reproductive tract and sperm competition [11]. There is increasing evidence
37
38 56 that sexual selection acts on species divergence through the development of
39
40 57 reproductive isolation [12]. In eutherian mammals, female selection, represented by
41 58 differences in the reproductive biology of the species, can direct the evolution of
42
43 59 different sperm sizes, the period of gamete fertility, and even the amount of sperm
44
45 60 produced [13]. The size and number of gametes in an ejaculate is related to the
46 61 presence of competition and may vary strategically with sperm haploid gene
47
48 62 expression [14,15]. In a study on sea urchins, a single population diverged into two
49
50 63 species that differentiated only in the locus Binding sequence present in mtDNA; this
51 64 gene is responsible for gamete recognition and, consequently, can lead to changes
52
53 65 in sperm morphology [16]. The variation in sperm morphometry also played a crucial
54
55 66 role in the reproductive isolation of populations of Ctenomys, which together with the
56 67 karyotype variation, led to speciation of the genus [17]. Previous studies have shown
57
58 68 significant differences in sperm head size between the two species of grey Mazama

3 69 [18] and that interbreeding between the two species result in individuals with varying
4
5 70 degrees of infertility [19].
6 71 In order to clarify the discussion on the taxonomic classification of species of
7
8 72 grey Mazama, a detailed study was conducted comparing the semen characteristics
9
10 73 and sperm morphometry to determine the main differences in the reproductive
11 74 characteristics of males between the species M. gouazoubira and M. nemorivaga.
12
13 75
14
15 76 2. MATERIAL AND METHODS
16 77 (a) Animals
17
18 78 Five males were used, three grey brocket deer (G1, G2 and G3) and two
19
20 79 Amazonian brown brocket deer (N1 and N2). All bucks were maintained in 12 m2
21 80 masonry bays inside the grey Mazama management building at Deer Research and
22
23 81 Conservation Centre (Núcleo de Pesquisa e Conservação de Cervídeos,
24
25 82 NUPECCE). All animals were provided the same diet consisting of 500 g/deer/day of
26 83 high palatability, industrialised horse feed (Purina®; Omolene tradicional), and 1
27
28 84 kg/deer/day of forage: soybean (Glycine max), perennial soybean (Neonotonia
29
30 85 wightii), ramie (Boehmeria nivea) and mulberry (Morus alba). Water was provided ad
31 86 libitum, and the individuals were exposed to natural fluctuations of light, temperature
32
33 87 and relative humidity. The study was assessed by the Ethics Committee on Animal
34
35 88 Use (CEUA) of the Faculty of Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences of São Paulo
36 89 State University, which certified its compliance with the ethical principles for animal
37
38 90 experimentation adopted by the Brazilian College of Animal Experimentation
39
40 91 (COBEA), under protocol no. 014080/12.
41 92
42
43 93 (b) Semen collection
44
45 94 For bucks with a reproductive rest of more than one month, semen was
46 95 collected seven days before the study and discarded. Six semen collections were
47
48 96 performed by electroejaculation, two samples per deer, at different times over the
49
50 97 period of a year. For the electroejaculation procedure, the deer were anesthetised
51 98 intramuscularly with a combination of anaesthetics, xylazine (1 mg/kg) and ketamine
52
53 99 hydrochloride (7 mg/kg). Before introducing the electrode, the rectum was emptied
54
55 100 so that minimal interference would occur due to the presence of faeces. The
56 101 eletroejaculator (P-T Electronics®; Boring, OR, USA) was coupled to a probe that
57
58 102 was 2.0 cm in diameter and 28.0 cm in length, with three longitudinal electrodes
59
60

2
3 103 along its surface, 1.5 cm apart. Following sedation and the introduction of the
4
5 104 electrodes ventral to the rectum, each buck was submitted to electroshocks
6 105 increasing from 250 mA to 750 mA, with a mean duration of three seconds, and a
7
8 106 three-second delay between each shock (ten sequential shocks). Three stimulation
9
10 107 sequences were performed at intervals of one to two minutes during collection [20].
11 108 The semen was collected in 2 mL microtubes and maintained in a water bath at 36-
12
13 109 37oC until the procedures that followed. Semen volume was determined using an
14
15 110 automatic micropipette. The characteristics of the ejaculate were classified according
16 111 to the observation of a single researcher, to avoid differences in the determining
17
18 112 sperm colour and density (watery, milky, creamy). An aliquot of 10 uL of semen was
19
20 113 fixed in 2 mL of 10% formalin solution to determine sperm concentration by
21 114 spermatozoon counts in a Neubauer hemocytometer chamber, in concentration per
22
23 115 millilitre (sptz x 109/mL) and the concentration of spermatozoa in the ejaculate.
24
25 116
26 117 (c) Sperm morphometry
27
28 118 Smears were performed with 5 µL of fresh semen. The slides were dried at
29
30 119 room temperature and fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.06
31 120 M phosphate buffer for 24 hours. After fixing, the slides were stained with Harris-
32
33 121 Shorr stain [21] and observed under an Olympus Bx60® light microscope (Olympus
34
35 122 Optical do Brasil Ltda, São Paulo, Brazil). The images were captured on a Zeiss®
36 123 AxioCam MRm camera (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Göttingen, Germany).
37
38 124 The measurements were made using the AxioVision 4.8.2® software (Carl
39
40 125 Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Göttingen, Germany). The heads of 600 spermatozoa
41 126 per individual were measured, 300 spermatozoa per collection. The lengths of the
42
43 127 tail (principal and end pieces) and the midpiece were measured in 200 spermatozoa
44
45 128 per individual, 100 spermatozoa per collection. The dimensions of the head (area,
46 129 length, width, perimeter, elongation, ellipticity, rugosity and regularity) and flagellum
47
48 130 (tail and midpiece), were measured, as described in Figure 1. Three repetitions of
49
50 131 the measurements of each spermatozoon were performed and the means were used
51 132 for statistical analyses.
52
53 133
54
55 134 (d) Data analysis
56 135 The volume and concentration data were analysed and presented as the
57
58 136 mean and standard deviation. Previous morphological analyses cite high values of

3 137 pathologies, principally in relation to the tail (both species), abnormal head shapes
4
5 138 for M. gouazoubira and middle piece defects for M. nemorivaga [22]. One way to
6 139 prevent these defects from interfering in the calculations is to remove outlier values
7
8 140 identified by blot spot analysis. Normality tests were performed and comparisons of
9
10 141 the means between species with normal distribution of data were analysed by the t
11 142 test. For non-normal distribution of data, the Mann-Whitney test was used. To
12
13 143 determine the most significant variables for species discrimination, the stepwise test
14
15 144 was used. The mean values of the most significant characteristics of each
16 145 spermatozoon were plotted in a scatterplot matrix to observe the grouping pattern.
17
18 146 The proportions of the total length of the tail and middle piece were also analysed.
19
20 147 Finally, two discriminant analyses were performed. The first involved two groups, the
21 148 species M. gouazoubira and M. nemorivaga, while the second involved five groups,
22
23 149 with each group representing an individual deer: M. nemorivaga, N1 and N2; and M.
24
25 150 gouazoubira, G1, G2 and G3.
26 151 The data sets supporting the results of this article are available in the
27
28 152 Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity repository (ID Knb.1114.1,

31 154
32
33 155 3. RESULTS
34
35 156 The mean semen volumes showed no significant differences between the
36 157 species (p=0.638; M. gouazoubira, 458.11 ± 236.45 µL and M. nemorivaga, 417.92 ±
37
38 158 185.73 µL). The mean concentration of the ejaculate, in millions of spermatozoa per
39
40 159 ejaculate, was significantly lower (p<0.01) for M. nemorivaga (144.52 ± 111.02) than
41 160 for M. gouazoubira (759.37 ± 357.42). Intriguingly, the colour of the ejaculate was
42
43 161 markedly different for the two species; ejaculate produced by M. gouazoubira was
44
45 162 white, while for M. nemorivaga it was reddish (Figure 2). Analysis of fresh semen
46 163 under a light microscope, without cell staining, revealed the presence of reddish
47
48 164 clusters in the seminal plasma of M. nemorivaga.
49
50 165 Only two variables, elongation (p=0.606; M. gouazoubira 0.28878 ± 0.06195,
51 166 and M. nemorivaga 0.29745 ± 0.03177) and ellipticity (p=0.606; M. gouazoubira
52
53 167 1.8329 ± 0.2399, and M. nemorivaga 1.8525 ± 0.1275) showed no significant
54
55 168 differences between the species (p>0.05). The means of the remaining variables
56 169 related to sperm head morphometry showed significant differences (p<0.05) between
57
58 170 M. gouazoubira and M. nemorivaga, respectively: area (p<0.01; 28.626 ± 2.159 µm2

3 171 and 42.046 ± 2.903 µm2), length (p<0.01; 7.9752 ± 0.7102 µm and 9.4477 ± 0.3383
4
5 172 µm), width (p<0.01; 4.3830 ± 0.3043 µm and 5.1179 ± 0.2927 µm), perimeter
6 173 (p<0.01; 20.907 ± 1.017 µm and 25.281 ± 0.741 µm), rugosity (p=0.001; 0.82342 ±
7
8 174 0.04670 µm and 0.82522 ± 0.02413 µm) and regularity (p<0.01; 0.95687 ± 0.05385
9
10 175 and 0.90306 ± 0.04161). Significant differences were also observed (p<0.01)
11 176 between the mean length of the tail (52.08 ± 1.30 µm and 49.93 ± 0.98 µm) and the
12
13 177 midpiece (11.21 ± 0.41 µm and 11.83 ± 0.38 µm) of M. gouazoubira and M.
14
15 178 nemorivaga spermatozoa, but no significant difference was verified in overall length
16 179 (p=0.251; 71.28 ± 1.88 µm and 71.21 ± 1.32 µm). The mean lengths of
17
18 180 spermatozoon regions were transformed into percentages of the mean overall
19
20 181 length, showing that the composition of M. gouazoubira spermatozoa was 73.07%
21 182 tail, 15.72% midpiece and 11.21% head, while the composition of M. nemorivaga
22
23 183 spermatozoa was 70.13% tail, 16.61% midpiece and 13.26% head.
24
25 184 Stepwise analysis verified that the variable “area” was the most accurate for
26 185 species discrimination. The remaining variables, classified in descending order,
27
28 186 were: width, perimeter, rugosity, length, ellipticity, regularity and elongation. Based
29
30 187 on these results, a scatterplot matrix was constructed using the mean values of area
31 188 and width of each individual. These graphs allowed us to distinguish the formation of
32
33 189 three groups, Group 1 containing the measurements of males of the species M.
34
35 190 nemorivaga, Group 2 containing measurements of two males of the species M.
36 191 gouazoubira, and Group 3 containing the measurements of a single male of M.
37
38 192 gouazoubira (Figure 3). Even though the plotted data of individual G3 were
39
40 193 separated from the group of M. gouazoubira, they were closer to the plotted data of
41 194 other individuals of the same species than those of M. nemorivaga.
42
43 195 Discriminant analysis of two groups (Figure 4a) identified the formation of
44
45 196 groups that discriminate the two species, with a low error identification rate (0.0021).
46 197 Discriminant analysis of five groups (Figure 4b) identified the formation of three
47
48 198 groups: Group 1 containing the data of individuals N1 (misidentification error= 0:11)
49
50 199 and N2 (error = 0:12); Group 2 containing data of G1 (error = 00:39) and G2 (error =
51 200 0:19); and Group 3 only containing data of G3 (error = 0.0051). Total error
52
53 201 identification rate of the individuals was 0.16.

3 203 4. DISCUSSION
4
5 204 All the comparisons made in this study showed significant differences
6 205 between the two species of Brazilian grey Mazama. The difference in ejaculate
7
8 206 colour between the two species occurred even though the deer receiving the same
9
10 207 diet and were maintained under the same conditions of captivity. When observed
11 208 under a light microscope, the red pigment present in the seminal plasma forms
12
13 209 "clusters" of different sizes and formats that are not bound to the spermatozoa.
14
15 210 Variations in colour are common in other species, ranging in tones from yellow to
16 211 orange, are not indicative pathologies and are often related to the presence of
17
18 212 riboflavin in high concentrations, which has no influence on sperm fertility [23–25].
19
20 213 This reddish colouration was reported by Peroni et al in 2010 [26], and the authors
21 214 found no blood cells or haemoglobin in the seminal plasma samples of M.
22
23 215 nemorivaga analysed. No other reports of seminal plasma with reddish colouration
24
25 216 that are not related to haematospermia have been published for any other species
26 217 [27,28]. Further studies on the biochemistry of the seminal plasma of M. nemorivaga
27
28 218 are required to determine the chemical composition and function of this pigment in
29
30 219 the reproductive biology of the species. This difference, the reddish clusters
31 220 observed in the seminal plasma, lead us to hypothesise that the female reproductive
32
33 221 tract environment is different between species of grey Mazama. It seems reasonable
34
35 222 to assume that sexual selection, affected by differences in the female reproductive
36 223 tract [9,11,29], may have influenced this differentiation in seminal characteristics
37
38 224 between the species analysed in this study. Seminal plasma plays an important role
39
40 225 in sperm viability and transportation in the female reproductive tract [30,31].
41 226 Therefore, changes in the composition of the seminal plasma of different species
42
43 227 probably co-evolved in response to sexual selection due to sperm competition [32–
44
45 228 34].
46 229 Mazama gouazoubira ejaculate had a higher sperm concentration compared
47
48 230 with M. nemorivaga. It is known that the ejaculate obtained by electroejaculation is
49
50 231 different from that obtained using an artificial vagina, because the stimulation of the
51 232 electrode on the glands increases the secretion of seminal plasma and thereby
52
53 233 decreases the ejaculate concentration [35]. Moreover, it is likely that the glands of M.
54
55 234 nemorivaga present greater sensitivity, given the reports that the species presents
56 235 involuntary ejaculation during semen collection procedures, both in the absence of
57
58 236 stimuli, during anaesthesia with dissociative anaesthetics, and in the presence of
59
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 8 of 19
1
2
3 237 light stimuli, when cleaning the rectum prior to introducing the eletroejaculator [18].
4
5 238 Other factors that should be considered are the differences between the glands and
6 239 testicular size of each species. Although M. nemorivaga has a lower body mass than
7
8 240 M. gouazoubira [36], its sexual glands are relatively large, particularly the seminal
9
10 241 vesicle, while the testis are relatively smaller (personal communication;
11 242 unpublished). These anatomical features could also explain the difference verified in
12
13 243 ejaculate concentration between the two species. Given the larger glands, the
14
15 244 response to the electrode stimulus is likely to be greater, so the ejaculate presents a
16 245 higher volume of plasma, while smaller testis produce fewer spermatozoa [37].
17
18 246 Mazama gouazoubira spermatozoa showed a head length close to the mean
19
20 247 of the known range for Artiodactyla, which ranges from 4.8 µm (Tragulus javanicus
21 248 ravus) to 10.43 µm (Philantomba monticola) [38], whereas M. nemorivaga
22
23 249 spermatozoa resemble species with larger heads. The difference verified between
24
25 250 the sperm head dimensions was important, since the mean sperm head area of M.
26 251 nemorivaga was almost twice that obtained for M. gouazoubira. In contrast, the
27
28 252 shape of the sperm head was similar, with no significant differences in elongation or
29
30 253 ellipticity, and both species conform to the flattened ovoid shape described for
31 254 Artiodactyla [39].
32
33 255 The proportions verified for the tail and midpiece were different from those
34
35 256 reported for other deer: head length, 11-14%; midpiece, 18-21%; and tail, 66-69%, of
36 257 the overall spermatozoon length [40]. The species analysed herein presented a
37
38 258 shorter midpiece (15-16%) and a longer tail (70-73%). The main determinants of
39
40 259 spermatozoon velocity of movement are head shape and proportions between the
41 260 flagellum components, such that spermatozoa with a shorter midpiece and longer tail
42
43 261 tend to be faster [41,42]. There is evidence that sperm competition leads to the
44
45 262 selection of longer, faster spermatozoa [8,43,44], but the consequences of any
46 263 increase in size varies among species, depending on the environment in which the
47
48 264 sperm have to compete [45,46]. Although Artiodactyla shows no association
49
50 265 between spermatozoon length and the level of sperm competition [47], our results
51 266 suggest a difference in these levels between M. gouazoubira and M. nemorivaga.
52
53 267 While both species possess large spermatozoa with long tails, features known to
54
55 268 occur in fast sperm [43], M. gouazoubira has a longer tail and smaller head
56 269 compared with M. nemorivaga. Moreover, the species M. gouazoubira shows a
57
58 270 group of important features that indicate a more competitive environment, including
59
60

Page 9 of 19 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 271 greater relative testicular mass[34], a proportionally longer sperm tail in relation to
4
5 272 head length [42] and, importantly, the species lives in open habitats like the Caatinga
6 273 and Cerrado, where meeting other individuals of the same species is easier and thus
7
8 274 likely involves greater sexual competition. In contrast, the species M. nemorivaga
9
10 275 has a lower relative testicular mass, it spermatozoon has a larger head and a
11 276 proportionally shorter tail, and it lives in the Amazon rainforest, a closed environment
12
13 277 that is difficult to access and where it is much harder to find individuals of the same
14
15 278 species, which likely leads to decreased competition for females. However, further
16 279 study on the reproductive behaviour of these species is required so a more concrete
17
18 280 hypothesis can be developed concerning sperm competition in species of grey
19
20 281 Mazama.
21 282 Six of the eight morphometric variables of the sperm head showed significant
22
23 283 differences between these species. The importance of these data for differentiating
24
25 284 grey Mazama was evident in the discriminant analyses results. The spermatozoa
26 285 were classified within their species with low error rate, indicating that the variables
27
28 286 used for the analyses were sufficiently accurate to differentiate M. gouazoubira and
29
30 287 M. nemorivaga. Further research that provided data from other species of Mazama
31 288 would be interesting, in order to observe the groupings and distances formed
32
33 289 between the different species of red and grey Mazama. In a similar study on the
34
35 290 sperm morphometry of Bos taurus and B. indicus, analysis verified a higher
36 291 misidentification error rate than that reported here. Despite this, it was still possible
37
38 292 to define species-specific sperm characteristics for these bovine [48]. In the second
39
40 293 discriminant analysis, which discriminated spermatozoa from five groups (individual
41 294 identification) the classification error rate was higher among individuals within the
42
43 295 same species than between individuals of different species. The accuracy in
44
45 296 identifying the spermatozoa of one of M. gouazoubira males is worth highlighting,
46 297 since the error rate was so low it barely overlapped the classification of the two other
47
48 298 individuals of the same species. The formation of three distinct groups of individuals
49
50 299 by discriminant analysis is a strong indication that the individual separated from the
51 300 species M. gouazoubira does not belong to the same species, a finding that
52
53 301 corroborates phylogenetic studies that have raised the hypothesis that M.
54
55 302 gouazoubira is a complex of cryptic species [6]. One recent example within the
56 303 genus Mazama, is the reporting of significant differences in sperm head size
57
58 304 between the different M. americana cytotypes, which when mated, produce hybrid

3 305 offspring with varying degrees of infertility [49], corroborating data that describes the
4
5 306 species as a possible complex of cryptic species [4,5]. The accuracy achieved while
6 307 identifying the spermatozoa of two species of grey Mazama clearly indicates that
7
8 308 further analysis, including other species of the genus Mazama and additional
9
10 309 individuals of grey Mazama, is warranted. Future research, combined with recent
11 310 phylogenetic studies of these species, will increase the available data and should
12
13 311 corroborate the hypothesis of the creation of new genera of Brazilian grey Mazama
14
15 312 and could lead to the identification of new species or subspecies of M. gouazoubira
16 313 and M. nemorivaga.

20 315 5. CONCLUSION
21 316 Significant differences were verified in the comparisons proposed in ejaculate
22
23 317 characteristics and sperm morphometry, which enabled us to clearly distinguish
24
25 318 between the species M. gouazoubira and M. nemorivaga. The accuracy achieved in
26 319 discriminant analyses of sperm morphometry indicates that this should be
27
28 320 considered a valid tool for new phylogenetic studies of the genus Mazama.

Just minor changes are sugested, please see the PDF with sticky notes
Line 31: Easy to get the samples?
Answer: It is easy to get samples from captive animals. We know this methodology is
cheaper than molecular analysis, although, we have not calculated the total price, from anaesthetics to
the measurement software, so we have decided to take off the word “low-cost”. (Lines 31)
Line 57: Prezygotic
Answer: The word has been included in the text. (Line 64)
Line 60: and characteristics, see Evolution and Human Behavior, Volume 24, Issue 4, July 2003,
Pages 277–289 doi:10.1016/S1090-5138(03)00016-3
Answer: The reference has been included in the text. Reference number 17. (Line 67)
Line 70: It is important to declare if there are any pre copulatory isolation mecanisms between
Mazama
Answer: There is a fragile prezygotic barrier between both species. Although we have
included the information in the text, it is from an in press reference which is going to be published
soon. Reference number 25. (Lines 80-82)
Line 71: Please consider: The absense of reproductive isolation not always means the loss of species
identity.
Answer: We do consider others theories of speciation, although reproductive isolation is a
strong hypothesis for gray Mazama speciation. (Lines 80-84)
Line 78: Age of specimens?
Answer: Unfortunately we do not have the exactly birthdates, because all animals came from
the wild. Although because they have been at the Research Centre more than two years before this
study has started, we are sure that all five animals were adults at the moment we had started the semen
collections. Also, body morphometry (body size, body weight and number of tooth) indicated that all
five animals were adult. We included the word adult in the text. (Lines 93 and 98)
Line 97: Please describe if the males are reproductive all year
Answer: Suggestion has been accepted. (Lines 113-114)
Line 112: The use of color standars is preffered. ej Munsell Color System
Answer: We agree that a colour standard would be preferred, and we are sorry that we have
not used any. In general, for a seminal colour analysis, a gross colour classification is performed,
without colour standard. We believe that the difference in the seminal plasma colour between M.
gouazoubira (white) and M. nemorivaga (reddish) is substantial and even using a colour standard we
would find the same difference. Therefore, we believe that this mistake do not interfere in our result.
Line 157: please describe the intra individual variation to.
Answer: The paragraph and the results of statistic analyses have been changed. (Lines 193-
212)
Line 162: Is there an explanation for this difference? please discuss
Answer: Unfortunately we do not have any explanation for that reddish colour in M.
nemorivaga semen. A new study about seminal plasma proteomics will be published soon. But still,
we do not have the exact answer for its composition or its function on M. nemorivaga semen.
Line 191: are the 3 gouazoubira males from the same distribution area?
Answer: Yes, all three M. gouazoubira are from the same distribution area, São Paulo state in
Southeast Brazil. However the two M. nemorivaga are from different area of Amazon River basin,
although they are both from the South of Amazon River. We have included the geographic location of
all five animals at the manuscript. (Lines 94-98)
Line 205: discuss about the third group and explain consecuences
Answer: The three bucks used in the present study were from the same distribution area (São
Paulo state, Brazil). Further studies, in reproduction and especially in genetics, using new specimens
of M. gouazoubira from São Paulo state and others distribution areas of Brazil, should be performed.
After those studies maybe we could discuss if that third group of M. gouazoubira is real group and if
it should be named ESU (Evolutionary Significant Unit) or not. We cannot certificate that from our
analysis of seminal plasma and sperm morphometry.
Line 221: experiment about semen viability time?
Answer: Unfortunately, we do not have found any study about semen viability of M.
nemorivaga, so it’s not possible to compare with M. gouazoubira.
Line 274: please consider the litter size; is the same for both species?
Answer: Related to body size, we do consider that both species are small size deer and we
have included that information in the text. (Lines 251-254)
Line 300: You must present strongest evidence for this (ie genetic analysis)
Answer: As we do not have genetics analysis in this study, we have changed the paragraph.
(Lines 309-318)
Line 355: Complete the information. Journal? thesis?
Answer: That reference is a Doctoral Thesis. I have used the Open Biology style for
references on Mendeley, as recommended in Authors Guide - The Royal Society website
(https://royalsociety.org/journals/authors/author-guidelines/). The app has not put the complete
information. I could not find how I have to proceed for thesis reference, at the website. I have
completed the reference as: “Figueiredo, M. G. 2014 Filogenia e taxonomia dos veados cinza

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_8
This is a very interesting manuscript about the reproductive biology of two little known Neotropical
deer species. Authors pointed in this submission the goal of providing tools to discriminate between
two Mazama species. The approach has the potential to identify species cluster within South
American gray deer clade and contribute to elucidate the complex systematics of the group. Two main
suggestions of my part:
1) The inclusion of samples from specimens belonging to other genera such as Blastocerus,
Ozotocerus, Pudu, and Hippocamelus (the last one probably the same case as gray Mazama) because
the unsolved relationships within the gray clade, and
Answer: Thank you for your suggestion. We agree with your point of view but at this time, it
is not possible to include more samples. Also, it is not ease to collect samples from animals that are
not distributed in Brazil, as Pudu and Hippocamelus, especially because some countries in South
America have strict laws regarding the exchange of animal samples.
2) there is concern about the small sample size. It is understandable that samples from brocket deer
are often difficult to acquire but it will be important to try to obtain them from other captive breeding
centers.
Answer: We agree with your suggestion, however, as discussed before, it is not possible to
include more samples in this manuscript. We are the only breeding/research centre of
Mazama sp. in Brazil, the others institutions, that may have specimens of M. gouazoubira, are
zoos or rehabilitation centre. Also, as far as we know, there is no other place with specimen of
M. nemorivaga in captive in Brazil.
Line 2: It is suggested the use of "gray" instead of "grey", for consistency with Duarte et al. 2008.
Answer: Suggestion has been accepted.
Line 19: replace "by analysing" with "based on"
Answer: Suggestion has been accepted. (Line 20)
Line 44-45: Re-phrase "Regarding the grey clade, phylogenetic analyses based on mtDNA and
cytochrome B have shown significant genetic differences". Enlist the other mDNA genes other than
Cytb B if this is the case in cited articles.
Answer: The phrase has been changed. (Lines 44-45)
Line 47: Include Hassanin et al. 2012 Hassanin, A., Delsuc, F., Ropiquet, A., Hammer, C., Jansen
Van Vuuren, B., Matthee, C., … Couloux, A. (2012). Pattern and timing of diversification of
Cetartiodactyla (Mammalia, Laurasiatheria), as revealed by a comprehensive analysis of
mitochondrial genomes. Comptes Rendus-Biologies, 335(1), 32–50.
Answer: The reference has been included in the text. Reference number 7. (Line 47)
Line 51-55: Post-copulatory reproductive barriers occur after or before geographic isolation? this is
an interesting discussion point because gray Mazama are allopatric.
Answer: The post-copulatory reproductive barriers usually occur in sympatric species, before
a geographic isolation. In gray Mazama speciation, we do not know exactly the time that the
reproductive barrier occurred. It is know that South America Cervidae species came from Centre and
North America during the Pliocene (2.5-3 million years ago) and some of them evolved to new
species in South America. Duarte (2008) has reported that M. gouazoubira and M. nemorivaga
species belong to different clades that have separated around 4-5 million years ago. So we have the
hypothesis that the post-copulatory reproductive barrier between gray Mazama probably occurred
before the current geographic isolation in South America. We have included that information in the
text. (Lines 50-57)
Line 60: How much individual variation contributes to total variation in size and number of gametes?
Answer: Regarded to the individual sperm size variation, there are great differences among
individual within species related to intraspecific sperm competition. We have included this
information in the text. (Lines 73-78)
Line 70: Are there similar studies with other deer species?
Answer: We have not found similar study in other deer species.
Line 93: Is the semen collection protocol based on a standarized one??? Include in references.
Answer: The reference has been included in the text. (Line 118)
Line 134-150: Reorder univariate and multivariate analysis. Include Box's test to determine if
covariance matrices are equal. Have the variables been standarized? To exclude those variable with
minor contribution to variance a stepwise analysis can be performed (as you did) or assessing values
of Snedecor's F or Wilks' lambda.
Answer: The methods of statistic analysis have been rewritten and new statistics have been
included, as the M Box test. Due the new analyses, some results have been changed but it does not
have interfered on the discussion and conclusion. (Lines 169-183)
Line 151-153: Access to data is unavailable (link https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/knb.1114.1)
Answer: Please, access the statistic data using the following temporary url:
http://datadryad.org/review?doi=doi:10.5061/dryad.6471f (Lines 184-185)
Line 165-183: Show size and form sperm results as a table format. Include a table with the respective
contribution of the variables from the discriminant analysis and the confusion matrix with the right
identification.
Answer: Those data can be access at
http://datadryad.org/review?doi=doi:10.5061/dryad.6471f
Line 204-205: Except elongation, ellipticity and overall length
Answer: We have changed the analyses and consequently some results have been changed.
That phrase has been excluded from the text.
Line 225: in "reproductive tract [30,31]." replace "." with "," to give continuity to the phrase.
Answer: Suggestion has been accepted. (Line 233)
Line 278: Population density/abundance or sex ratio of gray Mazama is greater in open than in
closed habitat? Chance of encounter with possible competitor would increase with higher number of
males in the population.
Answer: Unfortunately there are no published data about density/abundance or sex ratio of
gray Mazama. So in the discussion we just speculate and raised hypothesis about it. (Lines 285-292)
Line 298-300: Does exists a geographic pattern related to the groups?
Answer: There is no patter of geographic distribution related to the groups. The three M.
gouazoubira (G1, G2, and G3) are from the same region in Brazil, São Paulo state; and the two M.
nemorivaga (N1 and N2) are from different places in Amazonas River basin, however, both of them
are from side of South side of Amazonian River. We have included in the text the geographic
coordinate from the original location of each animal (G1, G2, G3, N1 and N2). (Lines 93-98)
Line 308: and other South American cervids more related to gray than red Mazama.
Answer: Suggestion has been accepted. (Lines 299-301)
Line 310: Indeed, it is needed a complete sampling into the distribution range of both species to
assess the existence of cryptic species or another evolutionary unity.
Answer: We agree. Indeed, this manuscript was the first to try an alternative analysis to
corroborate with phylogenetic studies in Mazama deer. With this study it was possible to find a great
tool to use as a comparison between Brazilian gray Mazama species and we expect that further studies
should be performed to have a better picture about differences in sperm morphometry between
Neotropical deer species.
Line 339: Replace "neotropics" with "Neotropics".
Answer: Suggestion has been accepted. (Line 348)
Line 343: Replace "And" with "and".
Answer: Suggestion has been accepted. (Line 352)

Line 485-487: Reference incomplete
Answer: The reference has been deleted.
Figure 3. Keep only Figure 4 as this figure shows the three groups clearly. This result must be taken
carefully because the small sample size. It is impossible to know if a clinal pattern exists between
group conformed by G1+G2 and individual G3. Based on results it is not possible to assess the
existence of subspecies (as the title of the manuscript suggests) within M. gouazoubira until a more
extensive sampling occur
Answer: We agree with your suggestion and we have excluded the figure three. The title of
the manuscript has been changed.
Figure 4. Values in Axis Y in Figure 4a are correct? What is the contribution of each variable to this
axis to variation among individuals and between species? A table with those values would be
ilustrative. What represents the circle surrounding the points clusters?
Answer: The figure and the axis values are corrected. As we had to perform a new analysis,
we have changed the figure four. All about the canonical plot and the figure are described at the new
figure 3 legend. (Lines 558-570)
