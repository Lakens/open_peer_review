When I first read this paper, the authors appeared to make a compelling case for using genetic
data analysis to better understand the eradication attempt using genetic data analysis to estimate
the relative size of the bottleneck this population endured. However several things troubled me.
My first concern was two-fold - why did the authors not use well-established methods to estimate
effective population size from two-sample genetic data, specifically the allele frequency variance
and linkage disequilibrium estimator methods - both would be appropriate and powerful
methods for this question. I also note that allelic diversity (i.e. number of alleles) is the most
sensitive indicator of a population bottleneck and could be easily simulated, but this index was
not reported. Because the authors did not provide summary diversity statistics for pre- and post-
eradication samples (which is an essential yet missing part of the results presentation), I
generated them myself from the supplementary data table using the 18 loci retained in the
authors analysis.
I was quite surprised to note the following observations from this exercise. Unbiased expected
heterozygosity INCREASED by 0.03 following the eradication attempt - as did raw allelic
diversity:
Pop n Loci Unbiased Hz SD Obs Hz SD Alleles SD
Pre 50 18 0.5343 0.0421 0.5527 0.0166 5.50 2.26
Post 83 18 0.5678 0.0414 0.5442 0.0129 5.89 2.25
So, I can't see any evidence for a bottleneck signature in this data whatsoever, I'm sure the
apparent increases are within the ranges of sampling error, but clearly no evidence for a decline.
This suggests to me that the main finding is completely wrong. Even if I were to reverse the
pre/post sample labels - there is still no compelling evidence for a reduction in effective
population size based on allele frequency or diversity change, noting that the maximum
bottleneck of 100 simulated by the authors still falls within the confidence limits of the estimated
allele frequency change.

I think the manuscript does add to the literature, and attempts to do a novel task - evaluating the
number of survivors after a failed eradication.
I think the simulations are appropriate for the task and the conclusions sound. I think the use of
STRUCTURE in this case - while not misleading in terms of survivor/reinvader hypotheses, has
some drawbacks, with violations of assumptions, which therefore mean the analysis is less clean.
Using population assignment in conjunction with the clustering would probably tidy this up, but
I very much doubt any conclusions would be changed. It would just mean there was less noise to
explain away. STRUCTURE does the task, showing they are survivors, despite it's inherent
problems.
Other than that there are only some small notes I have added. Some of the methods in the
software are not clearly stated, and the codes for the simulations are not available. Once these
small problems have been addressed I feel the manuscript should be acceptable for publication.
Some small notes:
A sentence in the abstract stating that you also looked at the possibility of toxin resistance would
be good.
In the abstract you say 19 microsatellites, when in fact you actually use 18 for the analysis given
you removed one due to null alleles.
Line 141 You could make it clearer that there were three multiplex PCRs.
Lines 153 - 157. You don't make it clear if population information or location prior was used,
whether you allowed admixture, assumed loci were linked etc. This needs to be stated.
Lines 173 - 193 There is no reference to how you did the simulations. My assumption is that this
was custom script in R or python. If so you should upload your scripts and reference this in the

Line 228. Within these rather than within the.
Line 277. Ne of 50, How would pregnant females affect this Ne?
Line 293. Structure works assuming hardy-weinberg equilibrium in each cluster. If a population
has gone through an extreme bottleneck, then the frequency of alleles before and after the
bottleneck will likely differ - hence samples combined from before and after will no longer have
loci in hardy-weinberg. This may be the cause of your observed multiple groups on henderson.
This doesn't change the overall interpretation, just shows that this aspect of the analysis is not
really designed for this task. Pairwise assigment using something like geneclass 2 would be a

better way, as previously mentioned by a reviewer. While I do think there are probably better
ways to analyse this question, given that STRUCTURE makes assumptions that are likely to be
violated in this scenario, I doubt that the results or interpretation would change. The rats are
survivors and all analyses show this.
From reading the previous comments, it appears that in a previous iteration of the manuscript
you speculate that larger islands may have a similar percentage of rats survive to smaller islands,
but since the absolute number of survivors is larger, the chance of some of them finding each
other and breeding is larger. (though this section has been deleted). I do think this is a valid
speculation to include, as we scale up island eradications this is a point that will need to be
addressed.

One of the two reviewers of your manuscript thinks they have found a substantial problem with
your analysis and have attempted to analyse your data from the supplementary material in a
more conventional manner. If their analysis is correct then a clear problem with your
interpretation is apparent. I have not attempted to replicate their computation but this warrants
further investigation on your part. I have therefore opted for a 'reject may resubmit' decision here
to allow you to re-analyse your data as reviewer 1 suggests, revisit their observations and if you
remain convinced that your observations are robust, you can resubmit the paper as a new
manuscript.

While some of the main findings here are fairly clear (unlikely recolonization from one of the
alternate sources sampled, or the evolution or poison resistance) I am unconvinced that the
genetic data analysis shows how close to success the treatment was. The data (heterozygosity and
more notably number of alleles per locus) do not suggest that the extermination caused an
appreciable population bottleneck, and to my thinking, the evidence that the attempt came
"within a whisker" is equivocal. I would perhaps be more convinced by the use of well-
established two-sample Ne estimators (e.g. the Waples temporal method) as well as more recent
bottleneck tests, which are considerably improved. The method developed and applied here has
not been validated or independently tested, and I also note that the estimate it produces does not
have an upper confidence interval - in fact the observed allele frequency perturbation is within
one standard error of the mean (and considerably within a 95% confidence interval) for the
weakest bottleneck (100 rats) simulated. I could be more easily swayed if the results were
supported by conventional bottleneck or Ne estimation analyses, and there are numerous and
improved, accessible and validated ways to do this (e.g. see Do et al. Mol Ecol Res 2014) .

Your revision has been seen by the original reviewer who, while acknowledging that the
heterozygosity issue has been dealt with, remains sceptical about the strength of the results you

I think the authors missed my point about the upper confidence interval (on the bottleneck size,
not on the allele frequency change), yes I see that standard errors (and not CIs) are reported
around the estimate of the allele frequency change, however the point estimate for the allele
frequency change of the weakest bottleneck still falls within an SE of the point estimate. Therefore
the method as implemented does not provide an upper confidence interval for the size of the

Comments to the Author(s)
When I first read this paper, the authors appeared to make a compelling case
for using genetic data analysis to better understand the eradication attempt
using genetic data analysis to estimate the relative size of the bottleneck
this population endured. However several things troubled me. My first concern
was two-fold - why did the authors not use well-established methods to estimate
effective population size from two-sample genetic data, specifically the allele
frequency variance and linkage disequilibrium estimator methods - both would be
appropriate and powerful methods for this question. I also note that allelic
diversity (i.e. number of alleles) is the most sensitive indicator of a
population bottleneck and could be easily simulated, but this index was not
reported. Because the authors did not provide summary diversity statistics for
pre- and post-eradication samples (which is an essential yet missing part of
the results presentation), I generated them myself from the supplementary data
table using the 18 loci retained in the authors analysis.
I was quite surprised to note the following observations from this exercise.
Unbiased expected heterozygosity INCREASED by 0.03 following the eradication
attempt - as did raw allelic diversity:
Pop n Loci Unbiased Hz SD Obs Hz SD Alleles
SD
Pre 50 18 0.5343 0.0421 0.5527 0.0166 5.50 2.26
Post 83 18 0.5678 0.0414 0.5442 0.0129 5.89 2.25
So, I can't see any evidence for a bottleneck signature in this data
whatsoever, I'm sure the apparent increases are within the ranges of sampling
error, but clearly no evidence for a decline. This suggests to me that the main
finding is completely wrong. Even if I were to reverse the pre/post sample
labels - there is still no compelling evidence for a reduction in effective
population size based on allele frequency or diversity change, noting that the
maximum bottleneck of 100 simulated by the authors still falls within the
confidence limits of the estimated allele frequency change.
As explained in the cover letter, our earlier estimates of the heterozygosity change
were based on a silly error. We are eternally grateful to the referee for spotting this.
However, as explained in an expanded section of the MS (lines 160-190), there are
good reasons for being cautious about the heterozygosity approach, especially when it
suggests no population change in total contradiction to all the field evidence pointing
to a reduction in rat numbers of at least 98 percent. Accordingly, we now just present
data from the change in allele frequency.

Comments to the Author(s)
I think the manuscript does add to the literature, and attempts to do a novel
task - evaluating the number of survivors after a failed eradication.
I think the simulations are appropriate for the task and the conclusions sound.
I think the use of STRUCTURE in this case - while not misleading in terms of
survivor/reinvader hypotheses, has some drawbacks, with violations of
assumptions, which therefore mean the analysis is less clean. Using population
assignment in conjunction with the clustering would probably tidy this up, but
I very much doubt any conclusions would be changed. It would just mean there
was less noise to explain away. STRUCTURE does the task, showing they are
survivors, despite it's inherent problems.
No action taken
Other than that there are only some small notes I have added. Some of the
methods in the software are not clearly stated, and the codes for the
simulations are not available.
Code now available as Supplementary material
Once these small problems have been addressed I
feel the manuscript should be acceptable for publication.
Some small notes:
A sentence in the abstract stating that you also looked at the possibility of
toxin resistance would be good.
Done
In the abstract you say 19 microsatellites, when in fact you actually use 18
for the analysis given you removed one due to null alleles.
Corrected
Line 141 You could make it clearer that there were three multiplex PCRs.
Clarification added (l. 142-143)
Lines 153 - 157. You don't make it clear if population information or location
prior was used, whether you allowed admixture, assumed loci were linked etc.
This needs to be stated.
Clarification added (l. 158-159)
Lines 173 - 193 There is no reference to how you did the simulations. My
assumption is that this was custom script in R or python. If so you should
upload your scripts and reference this in the manuscript.
Code now available as Supplementary material
Line 228. Within these rather than within the.
Within the seems correct. Retained
Line 277. Ne of 50, How would pregnant females affect this Ne?
This is a complexity that is seldom dealt with! If females are pregnant at the time of
sampling this would be equivalent to sampling the population slightly later in time (if
one counts the offspring) but should not impact the estimated size of the bottleneck.
Line 293. Structure works assuming hardy-weinberg equilibrium in each cluster.
If a population has gone through an extreme bottleneck, then the frequency of
alleles before and after the bottleneck will likely differ - hence samples
combined from before and after will no longer have loci in hardy-weinberg.
This may be the cause of your observed multiple groups on henderson. This
doesn't change the overall interpretation, just shows that this aspect of the
analysis is not really designed for this task. Pairwise assigment using
something like geneclass 2 would be a better way, as previously mentioned by a
reviewer. While I do think there are probably better ways to analyse this
question, given that STRUCTURE makes assumptions that are likely to be violated
in this scenario, I doubt that the results or interpretation would change. The
rats are survivors and all analyses show this.
We tend to agree with the reviewer that STRUCTURE performs adequately. The key
point is that the putative three clusters found on Henderson are extremely tenuous,
with weak and variable assignment of each rat to each cluster. The differences in
allele frequency before and after are slight (though significant). We feel that the
STRUCTURE analysis is certainly good enough to show what is needed and benefits
from being accessible to a wide audience. We would of course add the geneclass 2
analysis if the Editor feels this is necessary, but in our opinion it is not.
From reading the previous comments, it appears that in a previous iteration of
the manuscript you speculate that larger islands may have a similar percentage
of rats survive to smaller islands, but since the absolute number of survivors
larger. (though this section has been deleted). I do think this is a valid
speculation to include, as we scale up island eradications this is a point that
will need to be addressed.
After earlier referee prompting, we thought it best to delete the speculation about
whether there is any threshold density below which the survivors are likely to fail to
meet each other, reproduce, and restore the population. Although this is an intriguing
line of thought, it depends critically on whether the survivors are spatially clustered or
uniformly distributed across an island.

Comments to the Author:
Your revision has been seen by the original reviewer who, while acknowledging
that the heterozygosity issue has been dealt with, remains sceptical about the
strength of the results you have obtained. They have asked for conventional
bottleneck tests to be applied and if you are able to do this, I think this
would strengthen your conclusions considerably.

While some of the main findings here are fairly clear (unlikely recolonization
from one of the alternate sources sampled, or the evolution or poison
resistance) I am unconvinced that the genetic data analysis shows how close to
success the treatment was. The data (heterozygosity and more notably number of
alleles per locus) do not suggest that the extermination caused an appreciable
population bottleneck, and to my thinking, the evidence that the attempt came
"within a whisker" is equivocal.
We apply the Ne estimator suggested. See new Table 2 in revised MS. It and the
simulation method we develop converge reassuringly on an Ne value around 50
survivors, representing very roughly 0.1 percent of the starting population. It doesn’t
seem outrageous to describe the project as within a whisker of success.
I would perhaps be more convinced by the use
of well-established two-sample Ne estimators (e.g. the Waples temporal method)
as well as more recent bottleneck tests, which are considerably improved. The
method developed and applied here has not been validated or independently
tested, and I also note that the estimate it produces does not have an upper
confidence interval –
The estimated average change in individual microsatellite allele frequency between
rats sampled before and after the eradication program, shown in Fig 3, DOES have
standard errors shown above and below the estimate.
in fact the observed allele frequency perturbation is
within one standard error of the mean (and considerably within a 95% confidence
interval) for the weakest bottleneck (100 rats) simulated.
The parametric 95% CI for the NeEstimator estimates are reasonably tight (new Table
2) while both our simulated CIs and those of the jackknife are somewhat broader.
Despite this variation between methods in the size of the confidence intervals, the
strong agreement between methods in the point estimate leads us to believe that the
true bottleneck was of the order of Ne=50.
I could be more
estimation analyses, and there are numerous and improved, accessible and
validated ways to do this (e.g. see Do et al. Mol Ecol Res 2014) .

reassuringly similar to those generated by simulation (Fig 3).
