Very nice work that presents a comprehensive view of the HCV epidemic in Pakistan. Please
address the following comments:
There is no mention whatsoever of HCV RNA prevalence vs HCV antibody prevalence. Did
none of the studies look at RNA? Please provide some information and include this as a
limitation
The data range for the review spans almost 30 years. The quality of the testing changed
significantly during that time as may have incidence. Since >70% of the studies did not specify
the type of test used, and we know that earlier tests have poor specificity, please provide some
analysis on the time-dependent aspect of the prevalence estimates. Are earlier estimates higher
than more recent ones?
The discussion seems to be off the mark. Most of it deals with the role of health-care risk of
infection yet you do not present any data on this other than stating how many studies assessed
risk factors. Thus, presenting information on the Pakistan surveillance system is interesting but it
has little bearing on your analysis. It seems to me that your results are of interest to health
planners to estimate the treatment needs of the various populations. This could be interesting to
discuss.
The bibliography is a mess with inappropriate citations (e.g. refs 1-8) and incomplete citations
(e.g ref 17, 26 “INVALID CITATION!!!”). Please spend some time on this as it does not reflect

well.
Small points:
Introduction: Page 3, line 50: ref 1 is not appropriate, rather than a fact sheet for ref 2, please use a
peer-reviewed journal article. Ref 5, please provide something more recent than 2003,
furthermore, neither ref 5 or 6 are appropriate for treatment as prevention. Neither ref 7 or 8 deal
with WHO targets
Methods: please specify the languages that were searched. If only English, please make a
statement as to whether this has an impact on the comprehensiveness of your review.
Line 103: I don’t understand the difference between report and study. Please rephrase.
Discussion: Lines 279-285. Please provide substantiation for this conclusion. Although you
looked at risk factors for infection, you did not provide any data on risk factors.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr John Dalton):

quality of the Discussion. One reviewer also require information of how the data gathered over
30 years was handled statistically.
Comment: We thank the Associate Editor for these valuable comments and suggestions. We
have now attended to the bibliography, improved the discussion, and examined the variation of
HCV prevalence with time as delineated below in our responses to the reviewers’ comments.

one reviewer is positive but offers no substantive comments; on the basis of the second reviewer
and the AE's comments, I agree that there are serious problems to address in this manuscript, so

Answer: We thank the Subject Editor for these valuable comments. We have now attended to all
issues outlined by the reviewers below. We would be pleased to accommodate any other, should
the editors or reviewers have any further suggestions.
Reviewers' comments to the author:
Reviewer #1
Comments to the Author(s)
Very interesting work
Comment: We thank the reviewer for assessing our work and for the constructive feedback on
our manuscript.
Reviewer #2
Very nice work that presents a comprehensive view of the HCV epidemic in Pakistan.
Comment: We thank the reviewer for assessing our work and for the constructive feedback on
our manuscript that enriched the article and improved its readability.
Please address the following comments:
1. There is no mention whatsoever of HCV RNA prevalence vs HCV antibody prevalence.
Did none of the studies look at RNA? Please provide some information and include this
as a limitation
Answer: We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. We apologize for not including
HCV RNA prevalence information, which was in fact a variable included in our extractions. We
have now added an additional table including identified HCV RNA prevalence measures (in
HCV antibody positive individuals) in this systematic review—this can be found in the
supplementary material (Table S6). We have also described these data in the results section
(Results, page 11, last paragraph). We have further conducted and provided the results of a meta-
analysis on HCV RNA data (Results, page 13, last paragraph). The methods and discussion have
also changed to accommodate the inclusion of this analysis (Methods, page 6, second paragraph;
Methods, page 8, second paragraph; Discussion, page 17, third paragraph).
2. The data range for the review spans almost 30 years. The quality of the testing changed
significantly during that time as may have incidence. Since <70% of the studies did not
specify the type of test used, and we know that earlier tests have poor specificity, please
provide some analysis on the time-dependent aspect of the prevalence estimates. Are
earlier estimated higher than more recent ones?
Answer: We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. We have now included a sensitivity
analysis to address this suggestion. Specifically, meta-analyses were performed on the general
population prevalence measures prior to and after 2005, since after this year the vast majority of
studies were likely to have been conducted using 3rd or 4th generation assays (Methods, page 8,
third paragraph). The confidence intervals of the estimated pooled mean HCV prevalence prior
to and after 2010 overlapped, indicating HCV prevalence was not significantly different between
these two time durations (Results, page 13, second paragraph).
3. The discussion seems to be off the mark. Most of it deals with the role of health-care risk
of infection yet you do not present any data on this other than stating how many studies
assessed risk factors. Thus, presenting information on the Pakistan surveillance system is
interesting but it has little bearing on your analysis.
Answer: We thank the reviewer for this useful comment and we apologize for the confusion on
this point. In truth, our discussion of the role of healthcare in HCV transmission is not based
solely on our compilation of risk factors, but on the prevalence patterns seen in our results, where
clinical populations consistently had high HCV prevalence. We agree with the reviewer that our
discussion missed highlighting the results of our analyses that point to the role of healthcare.
To address the reviewer’s concerns, we have now added a paragraph to the discussion, in which
we summarize all evidence strictly from our results that point to a role for healthcare exposures
in the epidemic (Discussion, page 15, second paragraph). We believe that it is critical to
highlight the role of healthcare in the discussion and to stress its significance including the recent
surveillance work in Pakistan. The reason for this is that evidence so far suggests that HCV
incidence continues to be ongoing at high levels [1], and this incidence appears driven mostly by
healthcare, thus it is a national priority to address this driver of incidence.
4. It seems to me that your results are of interest to health planners to estimate the
treatment needs of the various populations. This could be interesting to discuss.
Answer: We thank the reviewer for the useful suggestion. We agree with the reviewer that these
results are of interest to health planners and this needs to be elaborated further. To address the
reviewer’s suggestion, we have now added a paragraph elaborating on this issue (Discussion,
page 17, third paragraph).
5. The bibliography is a mess with inappropriate citations (e.g. refs 1-8) and incomplete
citations (e.g ref 17, 26 “INVALID CITATION!!!”). Please spend some time on this as it
does not reflect well.
Answer: We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s attention and careful review in identifying these
issues with the references. We sincerely apologize for so many errors that escaped our attention.
This has been caused by the last run of Endnote on this manuscript before submission, which
was linked accidently to the wrong database. All references have now been fixed and carefully
reviewed to ensure correctness (References, page 22-31).
Small points:
1. Introduction: Page 3, line 50: ref 1 is not appropriate, rather than a fact sheet for ref 2,
please use a peer-reviewed journal article. Ref 5, please provide something more recent
than 2003, furthermore, neither ref 5 or 6 are appropriate for treatment as prevention.
Neither ref 7 or 8 deal with WHO targets
Answer: We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s attention and careful review in identifying these
issues with the references. We sincerely apologize for so many errors that escaped our attention.
As indicated above, this has been caused by the last run of Endnote on this manuscript before
submission, which was linked accidently to the wrong database. All references have now been
fixed and carefully reviewed to ensure correctness (References, page 22-31).
2. Methods: please specify the languages that were searched. If only English, please make a
statement as to whether this has an impact on the comprehensiveness of your review.
Answer: We thank the reviewer for the useful suggestion. No language restrictions were imposed
in our study (Methods, page 4, third paragraph). We have now added a statement clarifying
further on this issue and indicating that only English language studies were identified in our
search (Results, page 9, second paragraph).
3. Line 103: I don’t understand the difference between report and study. Please rephrase.
Answer: We thank the reviewer for this useful comment and we apologize for the confusion. We
have now rephrased this paragraph to improve readability and clarify it with examples (Method,
page 5, third paragraph).
4. Discussion: Lines 279-285. Please provide substantiation for this conclusion. Although
you looked at risk factors for infection, you did not provide any data on risk factors.
Answer: We thank the reviewer for this useful suggestion. In addition to the subsection in the
results section focused on our systematic compilation of risk factors (Results, page 13, second
paragraph), we have now added considerable further discussion and citations in relation to risk
factors and healthcare exposures in the discussion section to address the reviewer’s suggestion
(Discussion, page 15, third paragraph).
5. Much of the discussion discusses results that were not part of the analysis. This includes
hepatitis surveillance system; likewise, the data discussed in 298-309 is external data
that is only relevant to include if it substantiates your findings. However, you did not
present any risk factor data, so it is not clear why this is being included here.
Answer: We thank the reviewer for this useful comment. We apologize for the issues in the flow
of the discussion, as the link to these data and other work was not clear. As noted in our
responses above, we have now expanded and restructured parts of the discussion to avoid these
issues and to streamline the flow of the discussion and evidence (Discussion, page 15, second
and third paragraph). These additions provide now the context and links to the discussion of both
hepatitis surveillance and healthcare data.
6. What is the substantiation for the statement in lines 313-315. Did you look at this?
Answer: We thank the reviewer for the useful comment and we apologize for this confusion. To
address the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now expanded this paragraph by adding the number
of people who inject drugs in Pakistan (which is a small number relative to the total infected
population in Pakistan) to provide substantiation of this statement (Discussion, page 17, second
paragraph).

31 Abstract
32 Objectives: To characterize hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemiology in Pakistan and estimate the
33 pooled mean HCV antibody prevalence in different risk populations.
34 Methods: The systematic review was conducted as informed by the Cochrane Collaboration
35 Handbook, and was reported following the PRISMA guidelines. Populations were classified into
36 six categories based on risk of exposure to HCV infection. Meta-analyses were performed using
37 DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models with inverse variance weighting.
38 Results: The search identified one HCV incidence study and 341 prevalence measures/strata.
39 Meta-analyses estimated the pooled mean HCV prevalence at 6.2% among the general
40 population, 34.5% among high risk clinical populations, 12.8% among populations at
41 intermediate risk, 16.9% among special clinical populations, 55.9% among populations with
42 liver-related conditions, and 53.6% among people who inject drugs. Most reported risk factors in
43 analytical epidemiologic studies related to healthcare procedures.
44 Conclusions: Pakistan is enduring an HCV epidemic of historical proportions—one in every 20
45 Pakistanis is infected. HCV plays a major role in liver disease burden in this country, and HCV
46 prevalence is high in all risk populations. Most transmission appears to be driven by healthcare
47 procedures. HCV treatment and prevention must become a national priority.
48 Keywords: HCV, Epidemiology, Prevalence, Incidence, Middle East and North Africa.

49 Introduction
50 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a blood-borne pathogen and a significant global health concern [1].
51 Following acquisition of the virus, acute HCV infection can progress to chronic infection [2],
52 which is associated with several morbidities, such as liver cirrhosis and cancer [3-5]. HCV-
53 related morbidity strains healthcare systems worldwide, with approximately 71 million people
54 chronically infected globally [6]. Direct-acting antivirals (DAA), a highly efficacious HCV
55 treatment, can clear HCV infection and may substantially reduce HCV disease burden and
56 onward transmission [7]. As such, global targets have been set by the World Health Organization
57 (WHO) to eliminate HCV infection by 2030 [8, 9].
58 The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is the most affected region by HCV infection,
59 with approximately 15 million individuals chronically-infected [4].[6]. HCV is highly endemic
60 in Pakistan, where a national survey, conducted in 2007-2008, estimated HCV prevalence at
61 4.8% [910]. Ongoing transmission appears to be widespread, occurring in both healthcare and
62 community settings [910]. Understanding HCV epidemiology in Pakistan is critical in
63 developing and targeting cost-effective prevention and treatment interventions against HCV, in
64 order to meet the global target of HCV elimination.
65 The objective of this systematic review is to characterize HCV epidemiology in Pakistan by: 1)
66 systematically reviewing and synthesizing available published data of HCV incidence and
67 prevalence in six population categories defined according to risk of exposure, and 2) pooling
68 available HCV prevalence measures in each of the six pre-defined risk population categories to
69 estimate population–specific pooled mean HCV prevalence.
3
70 This work was conducted as part of the MENA HCV Epidemiology Synthesis Project, which
71 aims to characterize HCV epidemiology in MENA to inform key public health research, policy,
72 programming, and resource allocation priorities [6, 10-2111-24].
73
74 Methods
75 The methodology used in this study follows that used in previous systematic reviews of the
76 MENA HCV Epidemiology Synthesis Project [10-1611-17]. The subsequent subsections
77 summarize this methodology. Further details are available in previous publications [10-1611-17].
78 Data sources and search strategy
79 All available records reporting HCV incidence and/or prevalence measures in Pakistan were
80 systematically reviewed, as informed by the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook [22].[25].
81 Results were reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic and Meta-analyses
82 (PRISMA) guidelines (Table S1) [23].[26]. Our main data sources included PubMed and Embase
83 databases. A broad search criteria (S1 Fig) was used to retrieve articles and abstracts on PubMed
84 and Embase, from 1989 (the year in which HCV was first identified [24, 2527, 28]) up to April
85 19th, 2016, with no language restrictions.
86 Study selection
87 Similar to our previous systematic reviews [26][11-17], all records identified through our search
88 were imported into the reference manager Endnote, where duplicate publications were identified
89 and excluded. The remaining unique reports were subjected to a two-stage screening process,
90 performed by ZAK and SPK. In the first stage, titles and abstracts were screened for relevance.
4
91 Records marked as relevant or potentially relevant proceeded to the second stage of screening, in
92 which full-texts were obtained and assessed for eligibility based on predetermined
93 inclusion/exclusion criteria. Eligible reports were included in this study, and ineligible reports
94 were excluded with reasons specified in Figure 1. Additional records were identified by
95 screening references in full-text articles and literature reviews, as well as a country-level report.
96 Inclusion and exclusion criteria
97 The inclusion and exclusion criteria used in this study was adapted from our previous systematic
98 reviews [10-1611-17]. Briefly, any article reporting HCV antibody incidence and/or antibody
99 prevalence, based on primary data, qualified for inclusion in this review. An article was excluded
100 if it was a case report, case series, editorial, letter to editor(s), commentary, review, referred to
101 HCV as non-A non-B hepatitis, contained duplicate information, reported HCV prevalence based
102 on self-reporting, and if the study population was Pakistani nationals residing outside Pakistan.
103 In this work, for clarity, a “report” refers to a document (article, conference abstract, country-
104 level report, and others) including one or moreseveral outcome measures of interestthose
105 included in our systematic review, while a “study” refers to all information describing aany one
106 specific single outcome measure. One report may contribute multiple studies, and (say several
107 prevalence measures in different populations), and multiple reports of the same studyoutcome
108 measure (say same prevalence measure in the same specific sample) were identified as duplicates
109 and deemed as one study.
110 Data extraction and data synthesis
111 Data from relevant reports were extracted by ZAK, of which 20% were double extracted by SPK
112 to ensure consistency. Nature of extracted data followed our previous systematic reviews [10-
5
113 1611-17]. HCV prevalence measures were extracted and reported as per original reports. These
114 measures were rounded to one decimal place except for measures below 0.1%, which were
115 rounded to two decimal places.
116 Risk factors that were found to be significantly associated with HCV infection through
117 multivariable regression analyses were also extracted.extracted. HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA)
118 prevalence among HCV antibody positive individuals (that is HCV viremic rate [20]) was
119 extracted whenever available in reports including an HCV prevalence.
120 The extracted data was synthesized by risk population in six distinct categories defined
121 according to risk of exposure to HCV infection as follows:
122 1. General population (populations at low risk): these included blood donors, pregnant
123 women, children, refugees, household-based survey participants, and national army
124 recruits, among others.
125 2. High risk clinical populations: these included populations exposed to frequent medical
126 injections and/or blood transfusions, such as hemodialysis, thalassemia, hemophilia, and
127 multi-transfused patients, among others.
128 3. Populations at intermediate risk: these included populations whose risk of exposure is
129 higher than the general population but lower than populations at high risk, such as
130 healthcare workers (HCWs), household contacts of HCV infected patients, patients with
131 diabetes, and prisoners, among others.
132 4. Special clinical populations: these included clinical populations whose risk of exposure to
133 HCV infection is difficult to ascertain, such as patients with non-liver related
134 malignancies, dermatological manifestations, and rheumatological disorders, among
135 others.
6
136 5. Populations with liver-related conditions: these included patients with liver-related
137 conditions of an epidemiological significance to HCV infection such as patients with
138 chronic liver disease, acute viral hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver cirrhosis,
139 among others.
140 6. People who inject drugs (PWID).
141 Quantitative analysis
142 The quantitative analysis approach was similar to that in our previous HCV systematic reviews
143 [10-1611-17]. HCV prevalence measures were presented by risk-population in reports with a
144 sample size =50 in Tables 1, 2, 3, S2, S3, and S4. If no explicit HCV prevalence measure was
145 reported, it was calculated based on the sample size and number of events reported, if available.
146 HCV prevalence for the total sample was replaced with stratified measures, whenever the sample
147 size was =25 participants for each stratum. Stratified data was included using a pre-defined order
148 that prioritizes stratifications by population followed by sex, year, region, and age. Meta-
149 analyses were conducted for studies/strata with a minimum sample size of 25 participants. Only
150 one final stratification per study was included in the meta-analyses.
151 The variance of the prevalence measures was stabilized using the Freeman-Tukey type arcsine
152 square-root transformation [27].[29]. Estimates for HCV prevalence were weighted by the
153 inverse variance and pooled using a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model. This model
154 accounts for sampling variation (random chance) and expected heterogeneity in effect size across
155 studies [28].[30]. Heterogeneity was assessed and characterized using several statistical
156 measures.
7
157 With a recently identified potential issue with the Freeman-Tukey type arcsine square-root
158 transformation [29][31], we conducted sensitivity analyses by performing meta-analyses using
159 the generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) method to confirm validity of our results.
160 Meta-analyses were conducted in R 3.1.2. [30], using the package meta [31].
161 Quality assessment
162 Meta-analysis of RNA HCV prevalence measures among HCV antibody positive individuals
163 (that is HCV viremic rate) was also conducted to estimate the pooled mean of this prevalence
164 measure.
165 A sensitivity analysis was further performed to examine whether the advent of more specific and
166 sensitive diagnostic tools (3rd or 4th generation assays) could have affected the prevalence
167 estimates in the general population. Meta-analyses were performed on the general population
168 prior to and after 2005, since after this year the vast majority of studies were likely to have been
169 conducted using 3rd of 4th generation assays. The results of the meta-analyses were assessed to
170 determine whether the estimated pooled mean HCV prevalence was significantly different prior
171 to 2005.
172 Meta-analyses were conducted in R 3.1.2. [32], using the package meta [33].
173 Quality assessment
174 The quality of HCV prevalence measures was assessed for each study as informed by the risk of
175 bias (ROB) Cochrane approach [32][34], as well as by examining the precision of each reported
176 measure. The ROB assessment was based on three domains: type of HCV ascertainment
177 (biological assays versus unclear), the sampling methodology (probability-based versus
178 convenience sampling), and the response rate (=80% versus =80% of the target sample size).
8
179 Studies were considered as having high precision if the number of HCV tested individuals was at
180 least 100 participants, as informed by previous studies [10-1611-17].
181
182 Results
183 Search results
184 Figure 1 describes the process of study selection, adapted from the PRISMA flow diagram
185 [23].[26]. A total of 1,375 citations were identified: 480 through PubMed and 895 through
186 Embase. A total of 517 reports were identified as relevant or potentially relevant after removing
187 duplicates and screening the titles and abstracts. Out of these, 285 reports were excluded for
188 various reasons as summarized in Figure 1. An additional report was identified through screening
189 of articles’ references, and 11 HCV prevalence measures/strata were obtained from the Pakistan
190 National Survey [910]. Finally, 233 eligible reports were included in this systematic review,
191 yielding one incidence study and 248 prevalence measures. The 248 prevalence measures
192 contributed 341 prevalence measures/strata. Though no language restrictions were imposed, all
193 identified studies were in English.
194 HCV incidence overview
195 Our search identified one HCV incidence study, which reported seroconversion risk. This study
196 included (as its baseline) HCV negative HCWs who reported a needle stick injury from
197 documented HCV positive patients. After six weeks follow-up, investigators reported a
198 seroconversion risk of 4.8% [3335].
199 HCV prevalence overview
200 1) General population
9
201 Among the general population (Table 1), our search identified 148 prevalence measures/strata,
202 ranging from 0.4% to 44.0%, with a median of 5.3%. Among blood donors (number of studies;
203 n=57), HCV prevalence ranged from 0.4% to 20.8%, with a median of 3.5%. Among pregnant
204 women (n=12), HCV prevalence ranged from 0.7% to 20.7%, with a median of 6.0%. Among
205 outpatients (n=9), HCV prevalence ranged from 4.4% to 51.0%, with a median of 9.0%. Among

211 patients (n=12), HCV prevalence ranged from 7.7% to 60.0%, with a median of 42.2%. Among
212 hemodialysis patients (n=7), HCV prevalence ranged from 16.4% to 68.0%, with a median of
213 28.0%. Only one study was conducted for each of hemophilia patients (prevalence of 51.4%) and
214 multi-transfused patients (prevalence of 54.2%).
215 3) Intermediate risk populations
216 Among intermediate risk populations (Table S2), our search identified 64 prevalence
217 measures/strata, ranging from 0.0% to 70.9%, with a median of 12.9%. Among hospitalized
218 populations (n=25), HCV prevalence ranged from 2.5% to 71.0%, with a median of 13.2%.
219 Among HCWs (n=11), HCV prevalence ranged from 0.0% to 5.6%, with a median of 3.2%.
220 Among prisoners and/or volunteer prisoner blood donors (n=9), HCV prevalence ranged from
221 8.7% to 18.2%, with a median of 13.1%. Among diabetics (n=6), HCV prevalence ranged from
222 5.1% to 43.0%, with a median of 15.5%. Among household contacts of HCV index patients
10
223 (n=4), HCV prevalence ranged from 4.4% to 38.0%, with a median of 18.3%. A study conducted
224 in Karachi among men who use roadside barbers measured HCV prevalence at 38.0% [3436].
225 4) Special clinical populations
226 Among special clinical populations (Table S3), our search identified 18 prevalence
227 measures/strata, ranging from 1.0% to 81.0%, with a median of 15.5%. Among patients with skin
228 disorders (n=4), HCV prevalence ranged from 3.0% to 23.4%, with a median of 7.7%. Among
229 patients with urological conditions (n=4), HCV prevalence ranged from 1.0% to 25.9%, with a
230 median of 9.6%.
231 5) Populations with liver-related conditions
232 Among populations with liver-related conditions (Table S4), our search identified 73 prevalence
233 measures/strata, ranging from 3.0% to 100.0%, with a median of 63.5%. Among chronic liver
234 disease patients (n=20), HCV prevalence ranged from 4.9% to 78.4%, with a median of 41.1%.
235 Among cirrhosis patients (n=21), HCV prevalence ranged from 28.0% to 100.0%, with a median
236 of 68.0%. Among hepatocellular carcinoma patients (n=18), HCV prevalence ranged from
237 33.3% to 92.0%, with a median of 70.1%. Among acute viral hepatitis patients (n=6), HCV
238 prevalence ranged from 6.4% to 57.1%, with a median of 20.9%.
239 6) People who inject drugs
240 Among PWID (Table 3), our search identified 15 prevalence measures/strata, ranging from 8.0%
241 to 94.3%, with a median of 44.7%.
242 Overview of HCV RNA prevalence among HCV antibody positive individuals
11
243 Our search identified a total of 12 HCV RNA prevalence measures among HCV antibody
244 positive individuals (HCV viremic rate). The details of these measures can be found in Table S6.
245 HCV viremic rate ranged from 44.4% to 98.0%, with a median of 74.2%.
246 Pooled mean HCV prevalence estimates
247 Pooled mean estimates for HCV prevalence for the six risk populations are summarized in Table
248 4. The pooled mean prevalence for the general population (populations at low risk) was
249 estimated at 6.2% (95% CI: 5.7-6.7%). Meanwhile, the pooled mean HCV prevalence was
250 estimated at 34.5% (95% CI: 27.0-42.3%) for high risk clinical populations, 12.8% (95% CI:
251 10.8-15.1%) for intermediate risk populations, 16.9% (95% CI: 6.2-31.3%) for special clinical
252 populations, 55.9% (95% CI: 49.2-62.5%) for populations with liver-related conditions, and
253 53.6% (95% CI: 36.2-70.6) for PWID.
254 Of note, the GLMM meta-analyses produced similar pooled mean estimates for all risk
255 populations. For example, the pooled mean HCV prevalence for special clinical populations, that
256 showed the largest difference between the fixed effects result and the random-effects result, was
257 13.1% (95% CI: 6.9-31.3) using the GLMM method versus 16.9% (95% CI: 6.2-31.3%) using
258 the Freeman-Tukey type arcsine square-root transformation method.
259 Statistically significant heterogeneity in effect size (that is HCV prevalence) was observed in all
260 meta-analyses (Cochrane’s Q statistic’s p-value was always <0.0001; Table 4). Most of the
261 variation across pooled studies was due to true difference in effect size rather than chance (I2
262 >93.7%). The prediction intervals were generally very wide. The totality of these heterogeneity
263 measures indicate high heterogeneity in HCV prevalence measures in each risk population
264 category.
12
265 The pooled mean HCV RNA prevalence among HCV antibody positive individuals (HCV
266 viremic rate) was estimated at 74.1% (95% CI: 59.5-86.5%).
267 The meta-analyses performed prior to and after 2005 among the general population, as part of
268 our sensitivity analysis, estimated a pooled mean HCV prevalence of 5.0% (95% CI: 4.0-6.0%),
269 and 6.5% (95% CI: 5.9-7.0%), respectively.
270 Risk factors for HCV infection
271 Risk factors for HCV seropositivity were assessed in 11 studies using multivariable regression
272 analyses. Healthcare-related risk factors were most commonly reported, including history of
273 blood transfusions [35-37-39], dental work [36, 38, 3940, 41], surgery [35-37-39], medical
274 injections [40], and being a HCW , medical injections [40-42], and being a HCW [4143].
275 Injecting drug use related risk factors were also commonly reported, including history of
276 injecting drug use [35, 37, 41-39, 43-45], duration of injecting drug use [4446], sharing of
277 needles or syringes [3537], source of needles or syringes [4547], and ‘jerking’ (drawing blood
278 into a syringe while injecting) [4446]. Sexual risk factors were also reported, including sex work
279 (females and males), and sex for drugs [3739].
280 Quality assessment of HCV incidence and prevalence measures
281 Findings of the quality assessment are summarized in Table S5. Only one study was identified
282 for HCV incidence [3335] (not shown in Table S5), in which there were =100 participants, and
283 was therefore classified as having high precision. As it was based on convenience sampling, it
284 had high ROB for this domain. Meanwhile, it had low ROB in HCV ascertainment and in the
285 response rate domains.
13
286 The majority of HCV prevalence studies (86.7%) were based on samples with =100 participants,
287 and were therefore classified as having high precision. Most studies (67.7%) reported specific
288 details about HCV ascertainment, but nearly 70% did not report the assay generation. When
289 information was provided, 94.2% of studies reported use of 3rd or 4th generation assays.
290 A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess whether HCV prevalence in the general
291 population differed prior to and after 2005, since the vast majority of studies after this year were
292 likely to have been conducted using 3rd or 4th generation assays. The confidence intervals of the
293 estimated pooled mean HCV prevalence prior to and after 2010 overlapped, indicating HCV
294 prevalence was not significantly different between these two time durations.
295 The majority of HCV prevalence studies (92.3%) used convenience, non-probability based
296 sampling approach. Nearly half of studies had low ROB in the response rate domain and 48.8%
297 had missing information—only 1.6% of studies had high ROB in this domain.
298 To summarize, 78.6% of studies had low ROB based on at least one domain, and 41.1% had low
299 ROB based on at least two domains. Furthermore, 1.2% of studies had high ROB based on two
300 domains, and no study had high ROB based on three domains. The totality of the quality
301 assessment measures indicate reasonable study quality.
302
303 Discussion
304 We presented a systematic review and synthesis of HCV incidence and prevalence in Pakistan.
305 Our results affirm that Pakistan has one of the highest HCV infection levels in both MENA [10-
306 1611-17] and worldwide [46-48-50]. HCV prevalence in the population at large is at about 5%—
307 one in every 20 Pakistanis has been already exposed to HCV infection. HCV prevalence was also
14
308 found to be high in all risk populations, testifying to the scale of the epidemic in this country.
309 Our results further supported a major role for HCV infection in liver disease burden in
310 Pakistan—over half of the populations with liver-related conditions were found HCV antibody
311 positive.
312 Our results collectively indicate a major role for healthcare in HCV transmission. High HCV
313 prevalence was observed in the populations exposed to healthcare in one form or another. In high
314 risk clinical populations, the pooled mean HCV prevalence was high at 34.5% (95% CI: 27.0-
315 42.3%) (Table 4), with HCV prevalence ranging across studies from 7.8% to 68.0% (Table 2)—
316 much higher than that found in the general population. In special clinical populations, the pooled
317 mean HCV prevalence was also suggestedhigh at 16.9% (95% CI: 6.2-31.3%) (Table 4), with
318 HCV prevalence ranging across studies from 1.0% to 81.0% (Table S3). In all identified reports
319 on hospitalized populations, HCV prevalence ranged from 2.5% to 71.0%, with a median of
320 13.2% (Table S2).
321 Our assessment of HCV risk factors further indicate that HCV transmission appears to be
322 primarily driven by healthcare-related exposures, such as therapeutic injections, intravenous
323 infusions, and poor sterilization of medical equipment. Injection [37, 38, 40, 42, 43]. Injecting
324 drug use and other community-based exposures appear also to play a role, but their relative (as
325 opposed to absolute) role is probably small compared to healthcare procedures. [51]. These
326 findings demonstrate the urgency of addressing the HCV epidemic in Pakistan, one of the
327 world’s largest, and where 10% of the global number of chronically-infected people are living [4,
328 20][6, 21].
329 The apparent major role for healthcare in HCV transmission distinguishes Pakistan from most
330 other countries. Though healthcare plays a role in both developing and developed countries [10-
15
331 16, 49-51][11-17, 52-54], healthcare practices appear to have driven HCV prevalence to
332 atypically high levels in this country, a pattern seen only in limited number of countries globally
333 such as Egypt [6, 12, 2113, 22, 23] and former Soviet republics [52]. This role for healthcare is
334 manifested in the high HCV prevalence in the different clinical populations (Table 4),[55]. This
335 role for healthcare is not only manifested in the high HCV prevalence in the different clinical
336 populations (Table 4) and in the reported risk factors in analytical epidemiologic studies [35,
337 3637, 38, 41, 5340, 42, 43], andbut also in the outcomes of viral hepatitis surveillance [54].[56].
338 For example, the recently established viral hepatitis surveillance system in Pakistan indicated
339 that healthcare-related exposures appear to be behind most newly-reported HCV viral hepatitis
340 cases [54].[56]. Importantly, the surveillance demonstrated also that HCV accounted for over
341 half of reported viral hepatitis cases [54][56], highlighting the special role of HCV infection in
342 viral hepatitis disease burden in this country.
343 Of healthcare exposures, unnecessary therapeutic injections and reuse of syringes and needles
344 were highlighted often as key factors [54, 55].[56, 57]. Pakistan has one of the highest rates of
345 therapeutic injections worldwide [56, 57][58, 59]—with widespread perception that injectable
346 medications are more effective than oral medications [58-60].[60-62]. Financial incentives
347 appear also to sustain this preference for injectable medications, as healthcare providers can
348 charge more for medications when they are administered by injections [60].[62]. Though
349 Pakistan has attempted to enhance provision and use of disposable injections and passed
350 regulations for the management of disposable medical devices [61][63], implementation has been
351 challenging in a country where the private sector accounts for 70% of healthcare services [54,
352 59, 62].[56, 61, 64]. It bears notice that despite a possible key role for therapeutic injections, the
16
353 totality of the evidence synthesized in the present study suggests that HCV healthcare exposures
354 occur through multiple and diverse healthcare procedures.
355 The regional context of Pakistan and drug trafficking routes [65] support a conducive
356 environment for injecting drug use. Our results indicated a high HCV prevalence among PWID
357 (Table 4), and evidence for injecting drug use as a mode of HCV exposure [37, 43, 46, 56].
358 However, with an estimate of only 104,804 active PWID in Pakistan [66-68], the relative
359 contribution of injecting drug use to HCV incidence is probably substantially smaller than that of
360 healthcare, although the exact quantitative contribution remains uncertain.
361 Our results highlight the urgent and immediate need for expansion of HCV treatment and
362 prevention programs in Pakistan. High HCV prevalence was observed among all risk populations
363 (Table 4), with about 1 in every 20 Pakistanis being infected. Furthermore, three-quarters of all
364 HCV antibody positive individuals in Pakistan, per the meta-analysis of HCV viremic rate
365 (Section: Pooled mean HCV prevalence estimates), are chronically infected with HCV and can
366 transmit the infection further. In spite of heavily discounted prices for DAAs in Pakistan [69],
367 treatment scale-up has been limited, with only 311,000 chronic infections treated since 2013
368 [70]. To reach the WHO global target of reducing incidence by 80% by 2030, a recent modeling
369 study indicated that the annual number of treatments must reach 490,000 and be sustained at this
370 level for at least a decade [24]. To address the alarmingly high burden of HCV and achieve
371 WHO global targets by 2030, Pakistan has recently developed the first National Hepatitis
372 Strategic Framework, emphasizing the scale up of interventions in healthcare settings and of
373 HCV screening and treatment as well as harm reduction services [71].
374 Our study has identified key gaps and weaknesses in HCV epidemiological evidence in Pakistan.
375 Despite the large epidemic, only one (now outdated) nationally-representative and probability-
17
376 based population-based survey was conducted in this country [910]. Repeating and enhancing
377 this survey is critical to assess trends in prevalence and risk factors, as well as potential changes
378 in the epidemiology. Such surveys have played an instrumental role in elucidating our
379 knowledge of HCV transmission and in informing HCV response in other countries, such as in
380 Egypt [66-72][72-78] and USA [73].[79].
381 Despite the major role for healthcare, a relatively small number of studies have been conducted
382 among clinical populations, or investigated healthcare-related exposures. This is to be contrasted,
383 for example, with Iran where a large number of studies investigated the role of healthcare—
384 despite the relatively small role of this mode of exposure in this country [16]. Hardly any
385 analytical cohort studies been conducted in Pakistan despite the large epidemic, in contrast to
386 Egypt [13, 22], another MENA country with a large HCV epidemic [23]. Despite some
387 suggestive evidence for community-based exposures [51], such as visiting roadside barbers [60],
388 this mode of exposures remains to be clarified with concrete analytical studies. Though HCV
389 vertical transmission appears to account for a quarter of HCV infections among children under 5-
390 years of age in Pakistan [80], only one study appears to have investigated this mode of exposure
391 in this country [81].
392 Our study is limited by the quantity and quality of reviewed studies, as well as their
393 representativeness of the different risk populations—most studies used convenience sampling as
394 opposed to probability-based population-based sampling. Only PubMed and Embase databases
395 were searched, but other HCV data may exist in unpublished (grey literature) form, or are
396 published in non-indexed journals. There was extensive heterogeneity in HCV prevalence
397 measures in each risk population—possibly because of variability within the specific studied
18
398 subpopulation, geographic location, sex and age-group representation in the sample, sampling
399 technique and participant recruitment, year of study, and study quality.
400 Despite these limitations, the main strength of our study is that we identified a large number of
401 studies that covered different risk populations, and that facilitated a comprehensive synthesis of
402 evidence and identification of gaps and weaknesses that preclude a satisfactory understanding of
403 HCV epidemiology in Pakistan.
404
405 Conclusions
406 Pakistan is enduring an HCV epidemic of historical proportions—one in every 20 Pakistanis has
407 been already infected with this infection playing a major role in liver disease burden in this
408 country. HCV prevalence is high in all risk populations with most transmission apparently driven
409 by healthcare procedures. Though our knowledge of the specific modes of exposure that drive
410 transmission is improving, our understanding is still hampered by key gaps and weaknesses in
411 available evidence. Conduct of repeated and comprehensive nationally-representative and
412 probability-based population-based surveys is critical to assess HCV prevalence and trends,
413 identify risk factors and modes of exposure, examine the spatial variability in prevalence, and
414 assess HCV knowledge and attitudes.
415 HCV treatment and prevention must become a national priority in Pakistan. Although Pakistan
416 has made efforts to increase coverage of safe injection and blood screening and to improve
417 infection control [61, 76-78][63, 82-84], commitment to prevention in all segments of the
418 healthcare system, including the private sector, should be secured for this country to accomplish
419 the HCV elimination target by 2030. Major expansion of infection control in healthcare facilities,
19
420 and of harm reduction services for PWID, are warranted, as well as adoption of the WHO
421 guidelines for the use of safety-engineered syringes [79-81].[85, 86].

Editorial board comments to the author:
Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr John Dalton):
The reviewer had a comment to improve the Abstract as they felt the methods section of this
requires further information.
Comment: We thank the Associate Editor for this valuable comment. We have now attended to
the Abstract as delineated below in our response to the reviewers’ comment.
Reviewers' comments to the author:
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
Thank you for addressing my comments.
Comment: We thank the reviewer for assessing our work and for the constructive feedback on
our manuscript that enriched the article and improved its readability.
The only remaining issue is that the methods section of the abstract is not very informative.
Rather than mentioning Cochrane collaboration and PRISMA, which are not critical pieces of
information, it would be useful to mention that you conducted a systematic review of studies
published from 1989-2016 and conducted a systematic review etc.
Comment: We thank the reviewer for this useful suggestion. To address the reviewer’s
suggestion, we have now expanded the Methods section of the Abstract to elaborate on the
systematic review conducted (Abstract, page 2, second paragraph).

31 Abstract
32 Objectives: To characterize hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemiology in Pakistan and estimate the
33 pooled mean HCV antibody prevalence in different risk populations.
34 Methods: The systematic review was conductedWe systematically reviewed all available
35 records of HCV incidence and/or prevalence from 1989 to 2016, as informed by the Cochrane
36 Collaboration Handbook, and. This systematic review was reported following the PRISMA
37 guidelines. Populations were classified into six categories based on risk of exposure to HCV
38 infection. Meta-analyses were performed using DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models
39 with inverse variance weighting.
40 Results: The search identified one HCV incidence study and 341 prevalence measures/strata.
41 Meta-analyses estimated the pooled mean HCV prevalence at 6.2% among the general
42 population, 34.5% among high risk clinical populations, 12.8% among populations at
43 intermediate risk, 16.9% among special clinical populations, 55.9% among populations with
44 liver-related conditions, and 53.6% among people who inject drugs. Most reported risk factors in
45 analytical epidemiologic studies related to healthcare procedures.
46 Conclusions: Pakistan is enduring an HCV epidemic of historical proportions—one in every 20
47 Pakistanis is infected. HCV plays a major role in liver disease burden in this country, and HCV
48 prevalence is high in all risk populations. Most transmission appears to be driven by healthcare
49 procedures. HCV treatment and prevention must become a national priority.
50 Keywords: HCV, Epidemiology, Prevalence, Incidence, Middle East and North Africa.

52 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a blood-borne pathogen and a significant global health concern [1].
53 Following acquisition of the virus, acute HCV infection can progress to chronic infection [2],
54 which is associated with several morbidities, such as liver cirrhosis and cancer [3-5]. HCV-
55 related morbidity strains healthcare systems worldwide, with approximately 71 million people
56 chronically infected globally [6]. Direct-acting antivirals (DAA), a highly efficacious HCV
57 treatment, can clear HCV infection and may substantially reduce HCV disease burden and
58 onward transmission [7]. As such, global targets have been set by the World Health Organization
59 (WHO) to eliminate HCV infection by 2030 [8, 9].
60 The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is the most affected region by HCV infection,
61 with approximately 15 million individuals chronically-infected [6]. HCV is highly endemic in
62 Pakistan, where a national survey, conducted in 2007-2008, estimated HCV prevalence at 4.8%
63 [10]. Ongoing transmission appears to be widespread, occurring in both healthcare and
64 community settings [10]. Understanding HCV epidemiology in Pakistan is critical in developing
65 and targeting cost-effective prevention and treatment interventions against HCV, in order to meet
66 the global target of HCV elimination.
67 The objective of this systematic review is to characterize HCV epidemiology in Pakistan by: 1)
68 systematically reviewing and synthesizing available published data of HCV incidence and
69 prevalence in six population categories defined according to risk of exposure, and 2) pooling
70 available HCV prevalence measures in each of the six pre-defined risk population categories to
71 estimate population–specific pooled mean HCV prevalence.

72 This work was conducted as part of the MENA HCV Epidemiology Synthesis Project, which
73 aims to characterize HCV epidemiology in MENA to inform key public health research, policy,
74 programming, and resource allocation priorities [11-24].
75
76 Methods
77 The methodology used in this study follows that used in previous systematic reviews of the
78 MENA HCV Epidemiology Synthesis Project [11-17]. The subsequent subsections summarize
79 this methodology. Further details are available in previous publications [11-17].
80 Data sources and search strategy
81 All available records reporting HCV incidence and/or prevalence measures in Pakistan were
82 systematically reviewed, as informed by the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook [25]. Results
83 were reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic and Meta-analyses (PRISMA)
84 guidelines (Table S1) [26]. Our main data sources included PubMed and Embase databases. A
85 broad search criteria (S1 Fig) was used to retrieve articles and abstracts on PubMed and Embase,
86 from 1989 (the year in which HCV was first identified [27, 28]) up to April 19th, 2016, with no
87 language restrictions.
88 Study selection
89 Similar to our previous systematic reviews [11-17], all records identified through our search
90 were imported into the reference manager Endnote, where duplicate publications were identified
91 and excluded. The remaining unique reports were subjected to a two-stage screening process,
92 performed by ZAK and SPK. In the first stage, titles and abstracts were screened for relevance.
4
93 Records marked as relevant or potentially relevant proceeded to the second stage of screening, in
94 which full-texts were obtained and assessed for eligibility based on predetermined
95 inclusion/exclusion criteria. Eligible reports were included in this study, and ineligible reports
96 were excluded with reasons specified in Figure 1. Additional records were identified by
97 screening references in full-text articles and literature reviews, as well as a country-level report.
98 Inclusion and exclusion criteria
99 The inclusion and exclusion criteria used in this study was adapted from our previous systematic
100 reviews [11-17]. Briefly, any article reporting HCV antibody incidence and/or antibody
101 prevalence, based on primary data, qualified for inclusion in this review. An article was excluded
102 if it was a case report, case series, editorial, letter to editor(s), commentary, review, referred to
103 HCV as non-A non-B hepatitis, contained duplicate information, reported HCV prevalence based
104 on self-reporting, and if the study population was Pakistani nationals residing outside Pakistan.
105 In this work, for clarity, a “report” refers to a document (article, conference abstract, country-
106 level report, and others) including one or several outcome measures of those included in our
107 systematic review, while a “study” refers to any one specific single outcome measure. One report
108 may contribute multiple studies (say several prevalence measures in different populations), and
109 multiple reports of the same outcome measure (say same prevalence measure in the same
110 specific sample) were identified as duplicates and deemed as one study.
111 Data extraction and data synthesis
112 Data from relevant reports were extracted by ZAK, of which 20% were double extracted by SPK
113 to ensure consistency. Nature of extracted data followed our previous systematic reviews [11-
114 17]. HCV prevalence measures were extracted and reported as per original reports. These
5
115 measures were rounded to one decimal place except for measures below 0.1%, which were
116 rounded to two decimal places.
117 Risk factors that were found to be significantly associated with HCV infection through
118 multivariable regression analyses were extracted. HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) prevalence
119 among HCV antibody positive individuals (that is HCV viremic rate [20]) was extracted
120 whenever available in reports including an HCV prevalence.
121 The extracted data was synthesized by risk population in six distinct categories defined
122 according to risk of exposure to HCV infection as follows:
123 1. General population (populations at low risk): these included blood donors, pregnant
124 women, children, refugees, household-based survey participants, and national army
125 recruits, among others.
126 2. High risk clinical populations: these included populations exposed to frequent medical
127 injections and/or blood transfusions, such as hemodialysis, thalassemia, hemophilia, and
128 multi-transfused patients, among others.
129 3. Populations at intermediate risk: these included populations whose risk of exposure is
130 higher than the general population but lower than populations at high risk, such as
131 healthcare workers (HCWs), household contacts of HCV infected patients, patients with
132 diabetes, and prisoners, among others.
133 4. Special clinical populations: these included clinical populations whose risk of exposure to
134 HCV infection is difficult to ascertain, such as patients with non-liver related
135 malignancies, dermatological manifestations, and rheumatological disorders, among
136 others.
6
137 5. Populations with liver-related conditions: these included patients with liver-related
138 conditions of an epidemiological significance to HCV infection such as patients with
139 chronic liver disease, acute viral hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver cirrhosis,
140 among others.
141 6. People who inject drugs (PWID).
142 Quantitative analysis
143 The quantitative analysis approach was similar to that in our previous HCV systematic reviews
144 [11-17]. HCV prevalence measures were presented by risk-population in reports with a sample
145 size =50 in Tables 1, 2, 3, S2, S3, and S4. If no explicit HCV prevalence measure was reported,
146 it was calculated based on the sample size and number of events reported, if available. HCV
147 prevalence for the total sample was replaced with stratified measures, whenever the sample size
148 was =25 participants for each stratum. Stratified data was included using a pre-defined order that
149 prioritizes stratifications by population followed by sex, year, region, and age. Meta-analyses
150 were conducted for studies/strata with a minimum sample size of 25 participants. Only one final
151 stratification per study was included in the meta-analyses.
152 The variance of the prevalence measures was stabilized using the Freeman-Tukey type arcsine
153 square-root transformation [29]. Estimates for HCV prevalence were weighted by the inverse
154 variance and pooled using a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model. This model accounts for
155 sampling variation (random chance) and expected heterogeneity in effect size across studies [30].
156 Heterogeneity was assessed and characterized using several statistical measures.
157 With a recently identified potential issue with the Freeman-Tukey type arcsine square-root
158 transformation [31], we conducted sensitivity analyses by performing meta-analyses using the
159 generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) method to confirm validity of our results.
7
160 Meta-analysis of RNA HCV prevalence measures among HCV antibody positive individuals
161 (that is HCV viremic rate) was also conducted to estimate the pooled mean of this prevalence
162 measure.
163 A sensitivity analysis was further performed to examine whether the advent of more specific and
164 sensitive diagnostic tools (3rd or 4th generation assays) could have affected the prevalence
165 estimates in the general population. Meta-analyses were performed on the general population
166 prior to and after 2005, since after this year the vast majority of studies were likely to have been
167 conducted using 3rd of 4th generation assays. The results of the meta-analyses were assessed to
168 determine whether the estimated pooled mean HCV prevalence was significantly different prior
169 to 2005.
170 Meta-analyses were conducted in R 3.1.2. [32], using the package meta [33].
171 Quality assessment
172 The quality of HCV prevalence measures was assessed for each study as informed by the risk of
173 bias (ROB) Cochrane approach [34], as well as by examining the precision of each reported
174 measure. The ROB assessment was based on three domains: type of HCV ascertainment
175 (biological assays versus unclear), the sampling methodology (probability-based versus
176 convenience sampling), and the response rate (=80% versus =80% of the target sample size).
177 Studies were considered as having high precision if the number of HCV tested individuals was at
178 least 100 participants, as informed by previous studies [11-17].
179
180 Results
181 Search results
8
182 Figure 1 describes the process of study selection, adapted from the PRISMA flow diagram [26].
183 A total of 1,375 citations were identified: 480 through PubMed and 895 through Embase. A total
184 of 517 reports were identified as relevant or potentially relevant after removing duplicates and
185 screening the titles and abstracts. Out of these, 285 reports were excluded for various reasons as
186 summarized in Figure 1. An additional report was identified through screening of articles’
187 references, and 11 HCV prevalence measures/strata were obtained from the Pakistan National
188 Survey [10]. Finally, 233 eligible reports were included in this systematic review, yielding one
189 incidence study and 248 prevalence measures. The 248 prevalence measures contributed 341
190 prevalence measures/strata. Though no language restrictions were imposed, all identified studies
191 were in English.
192 HCV incidence overview
193 Our search identified one HCV incidence study, which reported seroconversion risk. This study
194 included (as its baseline) HCV negative HCWs who reported a needle stick injury from
195 documented HCV positive patients. After six weeks follow-up, investigators reported a
196 seroconversion risk of 4.8% [35].
197 HCV prevalence overview
198 1) General population
199 Among the general population (Table 1), our search identified 148 prevalence measures/strata,
200 ranging from 0.4% to 44.0%, with a median of 5.3%. Among blood donors (number of studies;
201 n=57), HCV prevalence ranged from 0.4% to 20.8%, with a median of 3.5%. Among pregnant
202 women (n=12), HCV prevalence ranged from 0.7% to 20.7%, with a median of 6.0%. Among
203 outpatients (n=9), HCV prevalence ranged from 4.4% to 51.0%, with a median of 9.0%. Among
9
204 other general populations (n=65), HCV prevalence ranged from 0.4% to 35.9%, with a median of
205 6.8%.
206 2) High risk clinical populations
207 Among high risk clinical populations (Table 2), our search identified 21 prevalence
208 measures/strata, ranging from 7.8% to 68.0%, with a median of 34.5%. Among thalassemia
209 patients (n=12), HCV prevalence ranged from 7.7% to 60.0%, with a median of 42.2%. Among
210 hemodialysis patients (n=7), HCV prevalence ranged from 16.4% to 68.0%, with a median of
211 28.0%. Only one study was conducted for each of hemophilia patients (prevalence of 51.4%) and
212 multi-transfused patients (prevalence of 54.2%).
213 3) Intermediate risk populations
214 Among intermediate risk populations (Table S2), our search identified 64 prevalence
215 measures/strata, ranging from 0.0% to 70.9%, with a median of 12.9%. Among hospitalized
216 populations (n=25), HCV prevalence ranged from 2.5% to 71.0%, with a median of 13.2%.
217 Among HCWs (n=11), HCV prevalence ranged from 0.0% to 5.6%, with a median of 3.2%.
218 Among prisoners and/or volunteer prisoner blood donors (n=9), HCV prevalence ranged from
219 8.7% to 18.2%, with a median of 13.1%. Among diabetics (n=6), HCV prevalence ranged from
220 5.1% to 43.0%, with a median of 15.5%. Among household contacts of HCV index patients
221 (n=4), HCV prevalence ranged from 4.4% to 38.0%, with a median of 18.3%. A study conducted
222 in Karachi among men who use roadside barbers measured HCV prevalence at 38.0% [36].
223 4) Special clinical populations
224 Among special clinical populations (Table S3), our search identified 18 prevalence
225 measures/strata, ranging from 1.0% to 81.0%, with a median of 15.5%. Among patients with skin
10
226 disorders (n=4), HCV prevalence ranged from 3.0% to 23.4%, with a median of 7.7%. Among
227 patients with urological conditions (n=4), HCV prevalence ranged from 1.0% to 25.9%, with a
228 median of 9.6%.
229 5) Populations with liver-related conditions
230 Among populations with liver-related conditions (Table S4), our search identified 73 prevalence
231 measures/strata, ranging from 3.0% to 100.0%, with a median of 63.5%. Among chronic liver
232 disease patients (n=20), HCV prevalence ranged from 4.9% to 78.4%, with a median of 41.1%.
233 Among cirrhosis patients (n=21), HCV prevalence ranged from 28.0% to 100.0%, with a median
234 of 68.0%. Among hepatocellular carcinoma patients (n=18), HCV prevalence ranged from
235 33.3% to 92.0%, with a median of 70.1%. Among acute viral hepatitis patients (n=6), HCV
236 prevalence ranged from 6.4% to 57.1%, with a median of 20.9%.
237 6) People who inject drugs
238 Among PWID (Table 3), our search identified 15 prevalence measures/strata, ranging from 8.0%
239 to 94.3%, with a median of 44.7%.
240 Overview of HCV RNA prevalence among HCV antibody positive individuals
241 Our search identified a total of 12 HCV RNA prevalence measures among HCV antibody
242 positive individuals (HCV viremic rate). The details of these measures can be found in Table S6.
243 HCV viremic rate ranged from 44.4% to 98.0%, with a median of 74.2%.
244 Pooled mean HCV prevalence estimates
245 Pooled mean estimates for HCV prevalence for the six risk populations are summarized in Table
246 4. The pooled mean prevalence for the general population (populations at low risk) was
247 estimated at 6.2% (95% CI: 5.7-6.7%). Meanwhile, the pooled mean HCV prevalence was
11
248 estimated at 34.5% (95% CI: 27.0-42.3%) for high risk clinical populations, 12.8% (95% CI:
249 10.8-15.1%) for intermediate risk populations, 16.9% (95% CI: 6.2-31.3%) for special clinical
250 populations, 55.9% (95% CI: 49.2-62.5%) for populations with liver-related conditions, and
251 53.6% (95% CI: 36.2-70.6) for PWID.
252 Of note, the GLMM meta-analyses produced similar pooled mean estimates for all risk
253 populations. For example, the pooled mean HCV prevalence for special clinical populations, that
254 showed the largest difference between the fixed effects result and the random-effects result, was
255 13.1% (95% CI: 6.9-31.3) using the GLMM method versus 16.9% (95% CI: 6.2-31.3%) using
256 the Freeman-Tukey type arcsine square-root transformation method.
257 Statistically significant heterogeneity in effect size (that is HCV prevalence) was observed in all
258 meta-analyses (Cochrane’s Q statistic’s p-value was always <0.0001; Table 4). Most of the
259 variation across pooled studies was due to true difference in effect size rather than chance (I2
260 >93.7%). The prediction intervals were generally very wide. The totality of these heterogeneity
261 measures indicate high heterogeneity in HCV prevalence measures in each risk population
262 category.
263 The pooled mean HCV RNA prevalence among HCV antibody positive individuals (HCV
264 viremic rate) was estimated at 74.1% (95% CI: 59.5-86.5%).
265 The meta-analyses performed prior to and after 2005 among the general population, as part of
266 our sensitivity analysis, estimated a pooled mean HCV prevalence of 5.0% (95% CI: 4.0-6.0%),
267 and 6.5% (95% CI: 5.9-7.0%), respectively.
268 Risk factors for HCV infection
12
269 Risk factors for HCV seropositivity were assessed in 11 studies using multivariable regression
270 analyses. Healthcare-related risk factors were most commonly reported, including history of
271 blood transfusions [37-39], dental work [38, 40, 41], surgery [37-39], medical injections [40-42],
272 and being a HCW [43].
273 Injecting drug use related risk factors were also commonly reported, including history of
274 injecting drug use [37, 39, 43-45], duration of injecting drug use [46], sharing of needles or
275 syringes [37], source of needles or syringes [47], and ‘jerking’ (drawing blood into a syringe
276 while injecting) [46]. Sexual risk factors were also reported, including sex work (females and
277 males), and sex for drugs [39].
278 Quality assessment of HCV incidence and prevalence measures
279 Findings of the quality assessment are summarized in Table S5. Only one study was identified
280 for HCV incidence [35] (not shown in Table S5), in which there were =100 participants, and was
281 therefore classified as having high precision. As it was based on convenience sampling, it had
282 high ROB for this domain. Meanwhile, it had low ROB in HCV ascertainment and in the
283 response rate domains.
284 The majority of HCV prevalence studies (86.7%) were based on samples with =100 participants,
285 and were therefore classified as having high precision. Most studies (67.7%) reported specific
286 details about HCV ascertainment, but nearly 70% did not report the assay generation. When
287 information was provided, 94.2% of studies reported use of 3rd or 4th generation assays.
288 A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess whether HCV prevalence in the general
289 population differed prior to and after 2005, since the vast majority of studies after this year were
290 likely to have been conducted using 3rd or 4th generation assays. The confidence intervals of the
13
291 estimated pooled mean HCV prevalence prior to and after 2010 overlapped, indicating HCV
292 prevalence was not significantly different between these two time durations.
293 The majority of HCV prevalence studies (92.3%) used convenience, non-probability based
294 sampling approach. Nearly half of studies had low ROB in the response rate domain and 48.8%
295 had missing information—only 1.6% of studies had high ROB in this domain.
296 To summarize, 78.6% of studies had low ROB based on at least one domain, and 41.1% had low
297 ROB based on at least two domains. Furthermore, 1.2% of studies had high ROB based on two
298 domains, and no study had high ROB based on three domains. The totality of the quality
299 assessment measures indicate reasonable study quality.

301 Discussion
302 We presented a systematic review and synthesis of HCV incidence and prevalence in Pakistan.
303 Our results affirm that Pakistan has one of the highest HCV infection levels in both MENA [11-
304 17] and worldwide [48-50]. HCV prevalence in the population at large is at about 5%—one in
305 every 20 Pakistanis has been already exposed to HCV infection. HCV prevalence was also found
306 to be high in all risk populations, testifying to the scale of the epidemic in this country. Our
307 results further supported a major role for HCV infection in liver disease burden in Pakistan—
308 over half of the populations with liver-related conditions were found HCV antibody positive.
309 Our results collectively indicate a major role for healthcare in HCV transmission. High HCV
310 prevalence was observed in the populations exposed to healthcare in one form or another. In high
311 risk clinical populations, the pooled mean HCV prevalence was high at 34.5% (95% CI: 27.0-
312 42.3%) (Table 4), with HCV prevalence ranging across studies from 7.8% to 68.0% (Table 2)—
14
313 much higher than that found in the general population. In special clinical populations, the pooled
314 mean HCV prevalence was also high at 16.9% (95% CI: 6.2-31.3%) (Table 4), with HCV
315 prevalence ranging across studies from 1.0% to 81.0% (Table S3). In all identified reports on
316 hospitalized populations, HCV prevalence ranged from 2.5% to 71.0%, with a median of 13.2%
317 (Table S2).
318 Our assessment of HCV risk factors further indicate that HCV transmission appears to be
319 primarily driven by healthcare-related exposures, such as therapeutic injections, intravenous
320 infusions, and poor sterilization of medical equipment [37, 38, 40, 42, 43]. Injecting drug use and
321 other community-based exposures appear also to play a role, but their relative (as opposed to
322 absolute) role is probably small compared to healthcare procedures [51]. These findings
323 demonstrate the urgency of addressing the HCV epidemic in Pakistan, one of the world’s largest,
324 and where 10% of the global number of chronically-infected people are living [6, 21].
325 The apparent major role for healthcare in HCV transmission distinguishes Pakistan from most
326 other countries. Though healthcare plays a role in both developing and developed countries [11-
327 17, 52-54], healthcare practices appear to have driven HCV prevalence to atypically high levels
328 in this country, a pattern seen only in limited number of countries globally such as Egypt [13, 22,
329 23] and former Soviet republics [55]. This role for healthcare is not only manifested in the high
330 HCV prevalence in the different clinical populations (Table 4) and in the reported risk factors in
331 analytical epidemiologic studies [37, 38, 40, 42, 43], but also in the outcomes of viral hepatitis
332 surveillance [56]. For example, the recently established viral hepatitis surveillance system in
333 Pakistan indicated that healthcare-related exposures appear to be behind most newly-reported
334 HCV viral hepatitis cases [56]. Importantly, the surveillance demonstrated also that HCV
15
335 accounted for over half of reported viral hepatitis cases [56], highlighting the special role of
336 HCV infection in viral hepatitis disease burden in this country.
337 Of healthcare exposures, unnecessary therapeutic injections and reuse of syringes and needles
338 were highlighted often as key factors [56, 57]. Pakistan has one of the highest rates of therapeutic
339 injections worldwide [58, 59]—with widespread perception that injectable medications are more
340 effective than oral medications [60-62]. Financial incentives appear also to sustain this
341 preference for injectable medications, as healthcare providers can charge more for medications
342 when they are administered by injections [62]. Though Pakistan has attempted to enhance
343 provision and use of disposable injections and passed regulations for the management of
344 disposable medical devices [63], implementation has been challenging in a country where the
345 private sector accounts for 70% of healthcare services [56, 61, 64]. It bears notice that despite a
346 possible key role for therapeutic injections, the totality of the evidence synthesized in the present
347 study suggests that HCV healthcare exposures occur through multiple and diverse healthcare
348 procedures.
349 The regional context of Pakistan and drug trafficking routes [65] support a conducive
350 environment for injecting drug use. Our results indicated a high HCV prevalence among PWID
351 (Table 4), and evidence for injecting drug use as a mode of HCV exposure [37, 43, 46, 56].
352 However, with an estimate of only 104,804 active PWID in Pakistan [66-68], the relative
353 contribution of injecting drug use to HCV incidence is probably substantially smaller than that of
354 healthcare, although the exact quantitative contribution remains uncertain.
355 Our results highlight the urgent and immediate need for expansion of HCV treatment and
356 prevention programs in Pakistan. High HCV prevalence was observed among all risk populations
357 (Table 4), with about 1 in every 20 Pakistanis being infected. Furthermore, three-quarters of all
16
358 HCV antibody positive individuals in Pakistan, per the meta-analysis of HCV viremic rate
359 (Section: Pooled mean HCV prevalence estimates), are chronically infected with HCV and can
360 transmit the infection further. In spite of heavily discounted prices for DAAs in Pakistan [69],
361 treatment scale-up has been limited, with only 311,000 chronic infections treated since 2013
362 [70]. To reach the WHO global target of reducing incidence by 80% by 2030, a recent modeling
363 study indicated that the annual number of treatments must reach 490,000 and be sustained at this
364 level for at least a decade [24]. To address the alarmingly high burden of HCV and achieve
365 WHO global targets by 2030, Pakistan has recently developed the first National Hepatitis
366 Strategic Framework, emphasizing the scale up of interventions in healthcare settings and of
367 HCV screening and treatment as well as harm reduction services [71].
368 Our study has identified key gaps and weaknesses in HCV epidemiological evidence in Pakistan.
369 Despite the large epidemic, only one (now outdated) nationally-representative and probability-
370 based population-based survey was conducted in this country [10]. Repeating and enhancing this
371 survey is critical to assess trends in prevalence and risk factors, as well as potential changes in
372 the epidemiology. Such surveys have played an instrumental role in elucidating our knowledge
373 of HCV transmission and in informing HCV response in other countries, such as in Egypt [72-
374 78] and USA [79].
375 Despite the major role for healthcare, a relatively small number of studies have been conducted
376 among clinical populations, or investigated healthcare-related exposures. This is to be contrasted,
377 for example, with Iran where a large number of studies investigated the role of healthcare—
378 despite the relatively small role of this mode of exposure in this country [16]. Hardly any
379 analytical cohort studies been conducted in Pakistan despite the large epidemic, in contrast to
380 Egypt [13, 22], another MENA country with a large HCV epidemic [23]. Despite some
17
381 suggestive evidence for community-based exposures [51], such as visiting roadside barbers [60],
382 this mode of exposures remains to be clarified with concrete analytical studies. Though HCV
383 vertical transmission appears to account for a quarter of HCV infections among children under 5-
384 years of age in Pakistan [80], only one study appears to have investigated this mode of exposure
385 in this country [81].
386 Our study is limited by the quantity and quality of reviewed studies, as well as their
387 representativeness of the different risk populations—most studies used convenience sampling as
388 opposed to probability-based population-based sampling. Only PubMed and Embase databases
389 were searched, but other HCV data may exist in unpublished (grey literature) form, or are
390 published in non-indexed journals. There was extensive heterogeneity in HCV prevalence
391 measures in each risk population—possibly because of variability within the specific studied
392 subpopulation, geographic location, sex and age-group representation in the sample, sampling
393 technique and participant recruitment, year of study, and study quality.
394 Despite these limitations, the main strength of our study is that we identified a large number of
395 studies that covered different risk populations, and that facilitated a comprehensive synthesis of
396 evidence and identification of gaps and weaknesses that preclude a satisfactory understanding of
397 HCV epidemiology in Pakistan.

399 Conclusions
400 Pakistan is enduring an HCV epidemic of historical proportions—one in every 20 Pakistanis has
401 been already infected with this infection playing a major role in liver disease burden in this
402 country. HCV prevalence is high in all risk populations with most transmission apparently driven
18
403 by healthcare procedures. Though our knowledge of the specific modes of exposure that drive
404 transmission is improving, our understanding is still hampered by key gaps and weaknesses in
405 available evidence. Conduct of repeated and comprehensive nationally-representative and
406 probability-based population-based surveys is critical to assess HCV prevalence and trends,
407 identify risk factors and modes of exposure, examine the spatial variability in prevalence, and
408 assess HCV knowledge and attitudes.
409 HCV treatment and prevention must become a national priority in Pakistan. Although Pakistan
410 has made efforts to increase coverage of safe injection and blood screening and to improve
411 infection control [63, 82-84], commitment to prevention in all segments of the healthcare system,
412 including the private sector, should be secured for this country to accomplish the HCV
413 elimination target by 2030. Major expansion of infection control in healthcare facilities, and of
414 harm reduction services for PWID, are warranted, as well as adoption of the WHO guidelines for
415 the use of safety-engineered syringes [85, 86].
