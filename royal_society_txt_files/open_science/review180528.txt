In this manuscript, Ma et al developed a microfluidic device that could be used to establish a co-
culture system, loading FLS (fibroblast-like synoviocytes) with pro-osteoclastic RAW264.7 and
BMSC, to mimic a synovium and bone organ microenvironment in vitro. The authors show that
the interaction of FLS with RAW264.7 and BMSC, as well as the migration and invasion of FLS
towards bone cells can be observed and assessed through the microchannel of the device. The
results of BMSC and osteoclastic RAW264.7 cells were consistent with previous studies.
Furthermore, this device can be used to screen drugs for inhibiting FLS-mediated bone erosion.
The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of this microfluidic model in drug screening.
However, if this device was initially designed to aim to perform a high throughput drug-
screening, it is needed a further improvement, since the liquid preparation would diffuse from
different chambers or microchannels and interfere each other.
In a conclusion, this device shows a potential to build a physiological or pathological
microenvironment, which supplied an important alternative to animal models.
Minor points:
1 All the information or data or conclusions which are not obtained by the authors in this
manuscript should be referred.
2 Scalar bars and magnification should be indicated in all microscopy images and corresponding
figure legends.
3 The significant difference in the images of the figure 4 and figure 5C should be indicated as

This manuscript described a microfluidic cell co-cultured model to study the migration behaviors
of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) into the bone erosion microenvironment of rheumatoid
arthritis (RA). The authors found that migration of FLS was enhanced in the presence of RANKL-
stimulated RAW264.7 cells and OS-stimulated BMSC and applied the cell culture model to test
the activity of celastrol in preventing FLS migration. This microfluidic model may be leveraged to
screen potential drugs targeting RA. However, the following issues may be addressed before the
study justifies a publication in Royal Society Open Science.
1. The writing of the manuscript can be improved with the aid of a native speaker. Some typos
are found, like ‘un-imgrated’ in the sentence of “The expression of cadherin-11 in both migrated
and un-imgrated FLS was reduced after the co-culture was treated with celastrol (Fig.5B).”
2. The authors should give a full expression of the scientific terms first before using the acronyms,
like TRAP and ALP.
3. Are there bubbles in microfluidic chip in Figure 2A? Will it affect the migration assay?
4. The authors should give scale bars to all the images.
5. What is the culture condition for the migration assay? Is the infiltration of FLS due to its
migration or proliferation?
6. The quantification of the migration distance and number of FLS is missing in Figure 5.
7. What is the reason for using 500 ng/ml celastrol in the drug testing assay?

Dear Emilie Aime:
Thanks for the good suggestion of two reviewers. We have revised the
manuscript entitled “A microfluidic chip-based co-culture of
fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) with osteoblast and osteoclast to
test bone erosion and drug evaluation for treatment of RA”
(RSOS-180528) according to their comments. The detailed answers
are as follows:
Reviewer #1:
1 All the information or data or conclusions which are not obtained by
the authors in this manuscript should be referred.

Reviewer: 2
We revised the manuscript for the following issues.
1. The writing of the manuscript can be improved with the aid of a
native speaker. Some typos are found, like ‘un-imgrated’ in the
sentence of “The expression of cadherin-11 in both migrated and
un-imgrated FLS was reduced after the co-culture was treated with
celastrol (Fig.5B).”
The writing of the manuscript was improved with the aid of a native
speaker. Some typos were revised.
2. The authors should give a full expression of the scientific terms first

We have given the full expression of the scientific terms first before
using the acronyms.
3. Are there bubbles in microfluidic chip in Figure 2A? Will it affect
the migration assay?
The relevant discription was added that “The bubbles in microfluidic
chip in Figure 2A were formed at sealing the PDMS layer with clean
glass substrate. It did not affect the migration assay” in page 8, line 19.
4. The authors should give scale bars to all the images.
Scale bars were given in all the images.
5. What is the culture condition for the migration assay? Is the
infiltration of FLS due to its migration or proliferation?
The culture condition for the migration assay was according to the
method of cell co-culture in the microfluidic device in part 2.5, page 5,
line30.
The infiltration of FLS due to its migration or proliferation. This part
was discussed that “The infiltration of FLS might be caused by FLS
migration and proliferation. The mobility of FLS was different under
different conditions of cell co-culture in the microfluidic device. FLS
and bone cells including osteoblasts and osteoclast can interact with
each other to influence their activities and function.... Cytokines and
chemokines could influence cell-cell interaction, resulting in alteration
of cell migration and functional activities27-29” in page 10, line 30.
“Celastrol was able to inhibit SW982 cell migration even SW982 cells
were co-cultured with RAW264.7 cells and BMSC in the microfluidic
device. Previous studies showed that celastrol inhibited FLS through
suppressing HIF-1a/CXCR4 signaling pathway 37
or
TLR4/NF-<U+03BA>B-mediated matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression.38”, in
page 12, line 21.
6. The quantification of the migration distance and number of FLS is
missing in Figure 5.
The quantification of the migration distance and number of FLS was
indicated in Figure 5.
7. What is the reason for using 500 ng/ml celastrol in the drug testing
assay?
The reason for using 500 ng/ml celastrol was discussed that “Different
doses of celastrol in FLS migration were screened. We found that 500
ng/ml celastrol obviously inhibited FLS migration. This result was
similar to previous studies23,24” in page 10, line 11.
Thank you for your advices. Your further handling this
manuscript would be greatly appreciated.
