The paper under review discusses the effects exemplified by stochastic Hopf bifurcation
experimentally as well as in a toy model. The experimental results in thermoacoustics are very
nice and certainly support the point that it is worthwhile looking into the aspects of stochastic
bifurcations a lot more in various experimental settings. The toy model is analysed to understand
the experimental results in a very simplified setting. This analysis shows that one can have
situations, where all three factors (bifurcation, noise level, and rate of parameter change) interact.
Although the theoretical results are essentially well known in the community, it is helpful to
directly compare a basic model to experiments, and to point out the relevant points again. I have
only three corrections, which should be carried out:
1) I find some of the figures quite poorly formatted, at least they appear very small and I always
had to zoom in the electronic version to even see the precise details. The figures are also a bit
overloaded with colors and labels; maybe simplified versions might actually be better to convey
the results. Furthermore, the writing style of the paper reads a bit like a long string of text instead
of a cross-linked paper with clearly highlighted results. I think the authors might want to
improve the figures and also the focus more on main results vs basic steps.
2) The literature on stochastic Hopf bifurcation is actually a lot bigger than shown in the paper.
This could lead to the impression that the authors are among the first considering such a case.
This is definitely not true so there should be a lot added in this direction. Here are just a few
recent papers from the last two years to support my point:
Tantet, A., Chekroun, M. D., Dijkstra, H. A., & Neelin, J. D. (2017). Mixing Spectrum in Reduced
Phase Spaces of Stochastic Differential Equations. Part II: Stochastic Hopf Bifurcation. arXiv
preprint arXiv:1705.07573.

A. Vol. 473. No. 2200., 2017.
Engel, M., Lamb, J. S., & Rasmussen, M. (2016). Bifurcation analysis of a stochastically driven
limit cycle. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01137.
In addition to being a very active area recently, there is roughly a 25 year history of the problem
as well in various application disciplines. This is not really clear from the paper under review and
should be made a lot more clear in the revision.
3) It would be useful to motivate more, why the toy model the authors use can really be linked to
thermoacustics. I am aware that it is a standard model in the area but this might not be evident
for the general reader. A bit more detailed derivation of the model from first principles and/or a
true full fluid-acoustic model would definitely be useful.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The manuscript reports on numerical analysis of a slow passage through subcritical Hopf
bifurcation (increasing parameter) and, subsequently, through saddle-node of a limit cycle
bifurcation (decreasing parameter) in a model of a nonlinearly damped oscillator with white
noise. The analysis is motivated by a thermoacoustic instability in a combustion chamber that
exhibits similar behavior to the simple oscillator model, and checks numerically if tipping can be
avoided. The work appears to be sound and I recommend publication provided that the authors
address the following points:
1. In the language of tipping points, the system has two tipping mechanisms namely B-tipping
(bifurcation-induced tipping) and N-tipping (noise-induced tipping). I am afraid that the authors
misunderstood what is referred to as R-tipping (rate-induced or rate-dependent tipping) in the
literature [11]. R-tipping requires that the stable state exists continuously for all parameter values
(no bifurcations in the quasi-static system) and the critical transition occurs only above some
critical rate, neither of which is true in this report. In fact, R-tipping cannot occur if this system is
started near A = 0. What can occur is ``preconditioned R-tipping” [14] .Thus, the discussion in
Section 1 and Figure 1 need to be revised accordingly. For example, this work has nothing to do
with Ref. [13], while Ref. [17] does not discuss R-tipping.
2. The title needs to be changed entirely because it is misleading, much too generic, and does not
capture the results obtained. Specifically, the report does not study rate-dependent critical
transitions, and does not contain any results that contribute to the theory of stochastic
bifurcations.
3. Minor comments:
Some readers may find the description of bifurcation delay confusing. For example, compare ``…
the faster the ramping rate is, the later the tipping happens …” with ``the state transitions are
delayed with respect to the bifurcation point, but not time delayed”.
How come the instability is due to the change in the sign of the imaginary part of the mode
eigenvalue?

transition delay in a stochastic subcritical bifurcation”.

Dear Editor,
We would first like to thank you and the referees for the precious inputs. We addressed all the
comments as follows.
Comments of First Referee
1. To improve the readability of figures we reworked all of them. We increased the font size and update
the layouts.
We rearranged the sectioning of the paper and we added paragraphs highlighting the main results of
each section and cross-referencing the parts of the work.
2. The introduction section was modified to include a more exhaustive literature review on the research
area and specify better the particular direction of the current work.
3. We included a new part in section 3.2 to show the derivation of the low-order model starting from the
wave equation. All the assumptions are now explicitly stated.
Comments of Second Referee
1. We agree with the referee that the definition of R-tipping was not rigorous. We rewrote completely
the introduction and update Figure 1. We now refer to the rate-dependent bifurcation delay as “Rate-
delayed tipping”.
2. We changed the title as suggested.
3. We implemented the two minor comments. The sentence in the abstract was modified, and the mode
instability condition changed to avoid any confusion with the adopted convention of signs.
We thank you again, as well as the referees, and we hope that the manuscript is now suitable for
publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Best regards,
