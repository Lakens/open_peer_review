Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
I appreciate the authors response to the reviewer comments. I still have comments on the
manuscript in its current form.
1. In the introduction, you reference a number of modelling papers, but do so to justify the
numbers you present for the crypt, e.g. total number of cells, and the current hypotheses of what
determines cell type in the crypt. It would be more appropriate to cite the biological literature for
this information, not other modelling efforts.
2. You are missing the umlaut over the ‘u’ in ‘Lieberkuhn’ (note that I cannot add an
umlaut in the online form that the reviewers are required to submit comments through).
3. Page 7, line 46: You write, “This model focused on calibrating…” but it is not clear to
which model you are referring.
4. It is good that you have included reference to the model proposed by Dunn et al., who
included anoikis in their investigations. However, you conclude that their additional rule for cell
death at the crypt mouth is non-biological, yet discuss the possibility of such additional causes of
cell death in the discussion. This is inconsistent.
5. It is also worth noting that Dunn et al. used a ‘harsher’ model of anoikis, which was
dependent on the underlying topology of connected cell centres, not simply distance from the
membrane. It is arguable that even in your model, you would observe anoikis occurring
throughout the crypt if you applied the same rule, rather than a distance metric.
6. I labour this point because you stress throughout your manuscript that including anoikis
in your model is novel (abstract, start of discussion, conclusions – e.g. “Anoikis within the colon
crypt has not previously been a focus of computational modelling efforts” is an untrue
statement), yet contradict yourself by describing this work, and the result is text that is
inconsistent. It would be better to describe your model as presenting a more biologically realistic
model of anoikis – should you be able to justify this. Note that anoikis events also “occur
emergently as a response to local conditions within the crypt” in their earlier model, and the
distinction in your work is that they *only* localise at the crypt mouth (see your last paragraph).
7. Reference Table 2 when you describe how cell types are determined by location in the
crypt, and refer to the cell colours in the text.
8. Your description of the attachment force is unclear – at present it reads as though you do
not explain the form of the attachment force, but say that the boundary force is spring based. In
general, the explanation of the set of models could be refined to be clearer and to provide all the
details that the reader would need up front.
9. You should provide evidence of the sensitivity tests on the anoikis threshold, given you
have set it to an arbitrary value.
10. You are missing a label for box 5.
11. Boxes 6 and 7 seem are referenced the wrong way round in the text compared to the
boxes themselves – please correct.
12. You do not reference Fig. 2A in the text.
13. Page 13, line 32, I think you mean Fig. 3Bi?
14. Paragraph starting page 14, line 23: you have added “which causes the model to reach
equilibrium and is a non-enforced emergent phenomenon” but this is simply repeating what is
said in the final sentence of this paragraph, so it is an unnecessary additional that does not
provide further justification.
15. The supplementary online information you refer to has not been provided with this
submission, so I could not evaluate it.
16. A key demonstration of the usefulness of your model, and that you have achieved a
stable, realistic equilibrium behaviour is to provide plots of cell migration, to show that cells
move upwards at a realistic speed, and within a realistic timeframe. These plots are common to
3
other models of the crypt, and by only discussing a matching of birth and death rates, you are not
demonstrating fully whether your model is accurate.
17. I wonder why you chose only to include the Eisenhoffer reference out of those I
suggested in my last comments? In particular, the Buske et al. paper is a very sophisticated model
of the crypt, and you should demonstrate an awareness of what has been done in the field. This
manuscript would benefit from a clear survey of what has been achieved through modelling the
crypt in the past, and precisely what biological question you have set out to answer with your
specific model. This explanation would justify, for example, why you have not felt the need to
model the crypt in three dimensions (as Buske has) or to include more sophisticated models that
determine a cell’s proliferative state. My reading of the manuscript in its current form is that you
have chosen your wording very carefully to position your manuscript as novel, but you need not
do this if you position its purpose within the context of the literature.
18. Please tidy up the references – some of them are capitalised, others are not.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
This work has been revised and my concerns have been clarified.
I have two minor suggestions for the authors consideration:
-I find it slightly unclear in some parts of the discussion, that the authors claim the fact that the
anoikis rate balances the proliferation rate is an emergent non-enforced phenomenon. In my
opinion, equilibrium is expected (for some parameter space), because this is a dynamic system,
i.e. a system with an input (proliferation) and an output (anoikis) flow, which may be passive, in
a confined geometry. Attachment forces determine the crypt cellularity at equilibrium as pointed
out by the authors later.
-In my opinion, the second paragraph in page 16 is confusing. It should be stated that the
proliferation rate used here refers to the absolute population rate (total number of newly
generated cells per unit time). The specific proliferation rate of the population (day -1) would be
more suitable for this comparison, ie. to study the relationship between the single cell division
cycle and the population (specific) growth rate. While the former relationship is tractable, the
analysis of the relationship between the absolute population growth rate and the single cell
division cycle may not be a well-defined problem when the number of cells of the population is
not constant (as claimed to be the case here). On the other hand, I do not understand the
explanation that the increase in the absolute birth rate is due to increased crypt cellularity. Was
the birth rate not compensated by the anoikis rate resulting in constant crypt cellularity?

Associate Editor's comments:
Dear Authors
Your article has been peer reviewed by three reviewers and it appears that to accept it for
publication, you still need to improve the presentation of your model with respect to the
literature, in particular by making more clear what has been achieved through modelling the
crypt with/without anoikis so far, and what biological question you have set out to answer with
your specific model. Answering the latter question should help justifying your modelling choices
for the reader.

The manuscript is improved following this round of revision, and benefits from the additional
text. In particular, I find the result that the localisation of anoikis is dependent on the cell
geometry to be very interesting, and think that you should draw this out in the paper. In
particular, you can refer to this in the abstract as it will draw the attention of the modelling
community who study crypt dynamics. It is relevant as overlapping spheres / voronoi
tessellations are the most commonly used cell geometries, and you here demonstrate that a more
realistic behaviour emerges from a different cell geometry, which shows that the models require
this extra complexity. If you wanted to, Panel I from supplementary could be moved to the main
figures to emphasise this point.
One specific suggestion: refer to the model of Bravo and Axelrod (2013) by name not just by the
reference number on line 46 of the Computational Modelling section, as it is 'this model' that you
are referring to.

Thank you for accepting for publication our manuscript “An agent-based model of anoikis in the
colon crypt displays novel emergent behaviour consistent with biological observations” reference
label_version_3
RSOS-160858.R1.
The reviewer suggested some minor edits. We have addressed these as follows:
Comment: The localization of anoikis is dependent on cell geometry…… you should refer to this in
the abstract. If you wanted to, Panel I could be moved from the supplement to emphasize this result.
Response: We have added a sentence to the abstract (highlighted in blue) to help to make the result
more findable as suggested. As we have a manuscript on this topic in development, we have been
cautious about over-stating this case (by moving figures to the main body) in a paper focussed on
crypt biology.
Comment: The model of Bravo & Axelrod should be referred to by name.
Response: Agreed, this has been done and helps the sense of the paragraph.
We hope these changes are agreeable, but please do not hesitate to contact us. We thank the
reviewers and editorial team for constructive and supportive interactions through the course of this
process.
Sincerely,
