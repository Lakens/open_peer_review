This manuscript aims to interpret the locomotor mode of early Macropodiformes from pedal
morphology through morphometric comparisons with modern species. The authors examine
some of the best preserved materials for stem macropodoids and use both traditional linear
metrics as well as 2D geometric morphometrics of bones.
The analyses are clearly set out, and often do not give a clear answer to the questions asked. This
may be because these earlier forms are less derived or more generalised than the majority of
modern macropodoids. The key result is the BLR summary (Figure 5) that gives the mean
position of both fossils at ~0.70-0.95 along the locomotor gradient towards the terrestrial/bipedal
saltating end. However, the main conclusions in the text do not follow this finding, and suggest
that arboreal/scansorial is more likely (L304, L331) and represents a convergent adaptation to
arboreality (L37; Figure 6). The results and conclusions should more closely align to allow
sufficient support. Statements such as ‘archetypal gait versatility’ (L35) seem to indicate that no
firm conclusion can be drawn, and that they fit somewhere in between the extremes, and so the
conclusion of convergent evolution is not warranted.
L32: ‘distinct amongst’ – ‘distinct from’ is clearer.
L77: change ‘inferring’ to ‘implying’.
L136: does ‘photographed from the right-hand side’ refer to lateral or medial direction, as this
depends on whether the bone is from the right or left side of the animal?
L157: the wording ‘data became insufficient’ is unclear given that you are increasing the number
of PCs included in the analysis.
L183: references to figures would help here in describing the anatomical details.
L254: ML is nearly parallel to WTS in the figure, but is listed separately here. LLTC and LMTC
fall intermediate to the other groups.
L257: does ‘dimensionally compatible’ mean approximately the same size?
L271: the latter part of this paragraph is more Discussion than Results.
L301: correct spelling of ‘Hypsiprymnodon’. Also L303, L399.
L304: ‘far more advanced scansorial … QM’ – the end of the Results, and data in Table 1, show
that these fossils were as much ‘terrestrial/bipedal saltating’ than ‘arboreal/scansorial’, which
calls into question this line of conclusions of arboreality, either primitively or independently
evolved. Likewise L331 ‘advanced scansorial morphologies’.

Overall I believe this is a rigorous analysis and the manuscript is clear and well written. I have
only a few relatively minor comments that I feel should be clarified.
1 - Many of the conclusions drawn from this study are supported by data in the supplementary

2 - In figure 1, LTC is not defined.
3 - In figures 2-4, I was confused by the outlines of macropods adjacent to the figure legends.

We would like to thank both the editors and reviewers for their assistance in improving our

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript aims to interpret the locomotor mode of early Macropodiformes from pedal
morphology through morphometric comparisons with modern species. The authors examine
some of the best preserved materials for stem macropodoids and use both traditional linear
metrics as well as 2D geometric morphometrics of bones.
We again thank Reviewer 1 for highlighting both the quality of our fossil material, and the
multiple cross-referencing analyses that we have used to assess our data.
The analyses are clearly set out, and often do not give a clear answer to the questions asked.
We set out to determine the possible range of balbarid (and other basally branching fossil
macropodoid) locomotion using the best available fossils, and to “test the potential for hopping”
(L94-95). Our analyses produced contrasting results, but as we explain, this is entirely consistent
with the morphological variability observed in our fossils, and across the spectrum of extant
macropodoids.
This may be because these earlier forms are less derived or more generalised than the majority
of modern macropodoids.
We would point out that our fossils represent two quite distinct tarsal and pedal morphotypes
that are by no means ‘generalised’ or ‘less derived’ than those of extant macropodoids. Rather as
our results show, these fossils manifest character states, morphologies and proportions that are
highly derived amongst macropodoids generally (discussed in detail on L191-208), and are as
different from each other in many respects (described on L199-206), as they are from living rat-
kangaroos, wallabies and kangaroos. Indeed, this is one of the key findings of our study, and is
repeatedly emphasised in the Abstract (L32-34), Results (L199-208, L226-229, L231-232,
L256-261, L262-271), and at length in the Discussion (L308-325). We also explicitly explain
that these features are independently elaborated relative to more basally branching
macropodoids, such as Hypsiprymnodon moschatus (which is terrestrial but able to climb over
uneven terrain: Burk et al. 1998. Syst. Biol. 47, 457–474.), and thus demonstrate an
unambiguous example of character state convergence compared to modern macropodine tree-
kangaroos (L297-306).
The key result is the BLR summary (Figure 5) that gives the mean position of both fossils at
~0.70-0.95 along the locomotor gradient towards the terrestrial/bipedal saltating end. However,
the main conclusions in the text do not follow this finding, and suggest that arboreal/scansorial
is more likely (L304, L331) and represents a convergent adaptation to arboreality (L37; Figure
6).
Nowhere do we conclude that our BLR results “suggest that arboreal/scansorial is more likely”.
On the contrary, our BLR predictions as summarised in the previous figure 5 depict the “range
of predicted values for the fossils” (previous L530-531), which although skewed towards the
“terrestrial/bipedal saltating” bin, reveal a spectrum of results from the astragalar (~0.1-0.99),
and pedal digit IV ungual datasets (~0.4-0.98). This is clearly evident in the BLR results from
each separate dataset shown in the previous ESM figures S2, S3 (now figures 5 and 6). Our
“main conclusions” are explicitly stated as being “morphological categorisation of QM F59022,
QM F59025, and N. gillespieae with terrestrial/bipedal saltating macropodoids” (L275-276). We
also note that some of our datasets “indicated arboreal/scansorial habits, especially for QM
F59022 and QM F59025” (L279-280), and that this “demonstrates ambiguity in our ability to
precisely estimate ecological and locomotory capabilities, but also highlights the considerable
novel anatomical variation exhibited by these ancient stem macropodoids, even within single
bones” (L281-283).
Furthermore, based on comparisons with extant macropodoids, we conclude that our results are
suggestive of gait variability, and NOT an exclusive indicator of “arboreal/scansorial” habits
(L308-325). In fact, we have been very careful to avoid any overreaching claims of
“arboreality”, and repeatedly emphasise this by our use of the alternative term “scansoriality”
(see previous L37, L304, L331, and elsewhere). Scansoriality describes the ability to climb,
NOT arboreality per se, which in our fossils is evidenced by tarsal and pedal character states that
resemble those of modern tree kangaroos, but are undoubtedly independently derived.
The results and conclusions should more closely align to allow sufficient support. Statements
such as ‘archetypal gait versatility’ (L35) seem to indicate that no firm conclusion can be drawn,
and that they fit somewhere in between the extremes, and so the conclusion of convergent
evolution is not warranted.
Reviewer 1 has misinterpreted our results and conclusions. The phrase “archetypal gait
versatility” (L35) explains that morphological characteristics consistent with versatile gaits are
observable even in the most ancient fossils. “Convergent evolution” IS evident in the numerous
character states shared by our fossils and modern macropodine tree-kangaroos, which constitute
a separate evolutionary lineage stratigraphically segregated by up to 10 Ma. We have
deliberately avoided any suggestion that ancient macropodoids habitually lived in trees (vis-a-
vis “arboreality”), as implied by Reviewer 1. Rather, we make the point that their independent
acquisition of morphologically similar tarsal and pedal traits is consistent with climbing (=
scansoriality), and probably evinces one amongst several non-mutually exclusive gait modes
(L35-37, L239-251, L308-325).
We have modified the following lines to clarify our interpretations: L35-37 “probably integrated
higher-speed hopping with slower-speed quadrupedal progression, and varying degrees of
scansoriality as independent specialisations for life in woodland and forest settings”; L103-104
“novel evidence of independently specialised morphologies”; L338-339 “Specialisation towards
scansorial lifestyles could therefore have proven similarly detrimental”.
L32: ‘distinct amongst’ – ‘distinct from’ is clearer.
Changed.
L77: change ‘inferring’ to ‘implying’.
Changed.
L136: does ‘photographed from the right-hand side’ refer to lateral or medial direction, as this
depends on whether the bone is from the right or left side of the animal?
Rewritten to: “all left pedal digit IV unguals were photographed from the right-hand (medial)
side”.
L157: the wording ‘data became insufficient’ is unclear given that you are increasing the
number of PCs included in the analysis.
Rewritten to: “data failed to produce a reliable BLR result”
L183: references to figures would help here in describing the anatomical details.
Added.
L254: ML is nearly parallel to WTS in the figure, but is listed separately here. LLTC and LMTC
fall intermediate to the other groups.
Rewritten to: “WTS and ML versus HD and HNF, and WNF versus MW, LMTC and LLTC”.
L257: does ‘dimensionally compatible’ mean approximately the same size?
No. We are describing correlated variable loadings in PC2 and PC3, and thus exclude the size-
related vector PC1. Rewritten to: “compatible with Dendrolagus”.
L271: the latter part of this paragraph is more Discussion than Results.
See previous comment. This paragraph is retained to avoid miss-interpretation of our results.
L301: correct spelling of ‘Hypsiprymnodon’. Also L303, L399.
Corrected.
L304: ‘far more advanced scansorial … QM’ – the end of the Results, and data in Table 1, show
that these fossils were as much ‘terrestrial/bipedal saltating’ than ‘arboreal/scansorial’, which
calls into question this line of conclusions of arboreality, either primitively or independently
evolved. Likewise L331 ‘advanced scansorial morphologies’.
Again, we would point out that “arboreal” (=living in trees) and “scansorial” (=adapted for
climbing) have different meanings. We use “scansorial” to describe the ability to climb without
any implication of predominantly arboreal lifestyles.
L518: change to ‘dependent’.
Corrected.

Comments to the Author(s)
Overall I believe this is a rigorous analysis and the manuscript is clear and well written. I have
only a few relatively minor comments that I feel should be clarified.
We thank Reviewer 2 for their positive summary of our analysis and manuscript.
1 - Many of the conclusions drawn from this study are supported by data in the supplementary
files. Why were these figures/tables not included in the main manuscript?
We have replaced the previous figure 5 with the supplemental figures S2 and S3 (now figures 5
and 6), which depict the same results but more clearly demonstrate the variation in our BLRs.
2 - In figure 1, LTC is not defined.
Corrected.
3 - In figures 2-4, I was confused by the outlines of macropods adjacent to the figure legends.
What is the significance of these?
These were included to provide graphical representations of the different macropodoid body-
forms, and thus visually depict a generalised balbarid (figure 1), tree-kangaroo (figure 2), and
terrestrial hopping kangaroo (figure 3). This has now been mentioned in the figure captions to
clarify.
4 - I expect that it will not be an issue in publication, but in my printed copy, the symbols in
figures 2-4 were difficult to distinguish.
These have been enlarged in the final versions of the figures.
