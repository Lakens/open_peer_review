In my view, the article needs substantial rearrangement before it can be considered for
publication in the Journal. There is just too much information, which is difficult to follow in the
current format. The authors should focus on the main aspects of their contribution and provide
insightful discussions.
For instance, it is not clear what the authors' scientific contribution to the field is. The
contribution should be clearly stated in the Introduction section. Currently, it appears as though
the authors' are just comparing experimental results with numerical calculations. Authors should
convey the important points of their work.
There are too many figures, which in most cases are difficult to read (i.e., the font and symbols
are too small). Some of them may be omitted, for instance, Figures 6 and 7. Although, Figure 1
depicts the authors' experimental system, it is not accurately described in the manuscript. Also,
the figure should be somehow larger to be readable. Similarly, Figure 2 is not accurately
described in the manuscript. It should be explained in the main text to guide readers. Also,
Figures 1, 2 , and 3 in page 5 should be corrected to Figures 3, 4, and 5, respectively. And thus, the
3
label of the following figures should be modified. There are in total 14 figures, in my view, this
number is excessive.
What is the importance of Figures 1 and 2 in page 5? Authors' should go to the point and convey
their results succinctly. Furthermore, in page 7, Figures 6 and 7 indicate the same trend; maybe
authors should focus on one of them and explain clearly their results. In addition, authors should
keep an order when mentioning the figures in the manuscript (i.e., Figure 6b should be
mentioned earlier than 6c and not the opposite, as it is now).
The Conclusions sections appears to be a summary of the work and does not provide the main
findings of the work.

Comment 1
In my view, the article needs substantial rearrangement before it can be considered for
publication in the Journal. There is just too much information, which is difficult to follow
in the current format. The authors should focus on the main aspects of their contribution
and provide insightful discussions.For instance, it is not clear what the authors' scientific
contribution to the field is. The contribution should be clearly stated in the Introduction
section. Currently, it appears as though the authors' are just comparing experimental results
with numerical calculations. Authors should convey the important points of their work.

Reply:
The reviewer’s advice is very valuable for our paper. We modifed the Introduction
section in the revisiedMS to highlight the contribution.
Action Taken:
“In the present work, we used the PIV and V3V techniques to quantify the 2D and 3D
flow structures in a cold model of a gas-evolving vertical-electrode system. Furthermore,
the corresponding 2D and 3D mathematical models were studied using an Eulerian-
Eulerian approach of COMSOL. The objective of this work was comparing the
experimental measurements obtained using PIV and V3V with the results of an Eulerian-
Eulerian model, and to carry out the hydrodynamic characteristics of the two-phase flow
field at gas-evolving electrodes, including the three orthogonal velocity components and
the turbulent intensity distribution on the basis of the instantaneous and time-averaged
velocity fields.”
Comment 2
There are too many figures, which in most cases are difficult to read (i.e., the font and
symbols are too small). Some of them may be omitted, for instance, Figures 6 and 7.
Although, Figure 1 depicts the authors' experimental system, it is not accurately described
in the manuscript. Also, the figure should be somehow larger to be readable. Similarly,
Figure 2 is not accurately described in the manuscript. It should be explained in the main
text to guide readers. Also, Figures 1, 2 , and 3 in page 5 should be corrected to Figures 3,
4, and 5, respectively. And thus, the label of the following figures should be modified.
There are in total 14 figures, in my view, this number is excessive.
Reply:
Thanks for reminding us these incorrect review of the existing visualization techniques.
We modified the figures,including the font and symbols, in the revisiedMS for the
readability. In page 2-3, we added more description about the experimental apparatus and
the methods in the Experimental and Mathematical Methods section. In page 5, the
incorrect serial number was caused by the no update of the automatic number and has been
corrected in the revised MS. And the number of figures were cut to 12.

Action Taken:
In page 2, “ Two organic polymethylmethacrylate plates were placed vertically on two
sides of the cell as the anodes, and a plastic plate was placed in the centre to represent the
cathode. Two vertical working areas, which were made of 110 × 100 mm2 porous glass
plates with a pore size of approximately 50 µm were embedded in the vertical working area
of the two anodes and submerged in liquid.”, “ As shown in Fig. 1, Cameras were also
positioned in front of the cell, and their distance was approximately 700 mm.”, and “ Two
beam blocks were placed at the edge of the cell to limit the beam thickness (100 mm) to
illuminate only the measurement volume.”
In page 3, “ Instantaneous velocity fields were determined in four steps: identification of
2D particle locations from each of three apertures, determination of 3D particle locations
in space, tracking individual particles in the volume, and interpolating the resulting
randomly-spaced vectors onto a Cartesian coordinates.”
In page 3, we modified the Fig. 1.

In page 6, we merged the Fig. 3 and Fig. 4.

Comment 3
What is the importance of Figures 1 and 2 in page 5? Authors' should go to the point and
convey their results succinctly. Furthermore, in page 7, Figures 6 and 7 indicate the same
trend; maybe authors should focus on one of them and explain clearly their results. In
addition, authors should keep an order when mentioning the figures in the manuscript (i.e.,
Figure 6b should be mentioned earlier than 6c and not the opposite, as it is now).
Reply:
Figure 1 was used to directly and clearly describe the experimental apparatus of PIV and
V3V. Figure 2 was used to introduce the experimental procedure of the V3V measurement.
The suggestion has been taken seriously and we modify related text in the revisiedMS.
We highly appreciate the reviewer’s reminders. Figures 8 and 9 indicate the same trend
but with the different experimental conditions. These results were used to verify the
accuracy of the mathematical models. In the description of Figure 7 in the revisiedMS, we
reorganize the paragraph.
Action Taken:
In page 9, “Fig. 7a shows the variation of the time-averaged x-component of velocity u
7
along the horizontal line y = 0.105 m. The profile of u was antisymmetrical: the left half
was a positive hump, and the right side was a negative hump. Fig. 7b shows that the profiles
of the y-component v of the velocity along the two lines were symmetrical with respect to
the central geometrical plane of the cell. Near the left and right walls, because of the drag
effects, the velocity reached its maximum value. Near the cathode, the flow was primarily
in the downward direction and the velocity was negative. The trend of u along y = 0.035
m was reversed and formed an s-shape, as shown in Fig. 7c. Moreover, the maximum
velocity occurred in the middle of the channel, and the velocity magnitude decreased to
zero near the left and right anodes, where the liquid was primarily vertical. As shown in
Fig. 7d, the magnitude of the y-component v of the velocity substantially changed near the
anode. The liquid velocity v along y = 0.105 m in Fig. 7b was larger than that along y =
0.035 m in Fig. 7d. This velocity component in the two channels was in the counter-
clockwise and clockwise directions. The PIV and V3V measurements of the velocity near
the anode were inaccurate because of the disturbance of the bubbles.”
In page 10, “Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 show that the velocity profiles obtained using the PIV and
V3V techniques exhibited identical trends. The velocity magnitudes obtained from the PIV
measurement were slightly different from those obtained using the V3V method under
identical experimental conditions. The liquid motion predictions were consistent with the
experimental data. However, some precision errors remained, particularly with the 2D
model, and the velocities profiles appeared more smoothed. The motion in the region with
high velocity was not accurately captured in the 2D simulation. The 3D model could
capture more details of the flow behavior, and both velocity components were accurately
predicted by the simulations along the two horizontal lines.”
Comment 4
The Conclusions sections appears to be a summary of the work and does not provide the
main findings of the work.
Reply:
We accept the referee’s suggestion. The Conclusions section and related paragraph has
8
been rewritten in the revised manuscript.
Action Taken:
In page 14, “A gas-evolving vertical electrodes was used to investigate the hydrodynamic
characteristics of PIV and V3V techniques. Moreover, corresponding 2D and 3D CFD
simulations were carried out using a two-fluid Euler-Euler model. Comparative analysis of
the time-averaged flow field, three velocity components in the simulation data and
experimental results showed that the mathematical model is reliable. The liquid velocity
vectors were in the form of closed curves. The results of the V3V and 3D model also
confirmed that the fluid flow in this channel of the gas-evolving electrodes system is three-
dimensional in nature. V3V can be considered as a set of velocity vector multi-planes
obtained using PIV and can accurately acquire the z-component of the velocity data in a
three-dimensional space. The z-component velocity in the V3V results was consistent with
that in the 3D model prediction.
The instantaneous velocity in a time series at a point was considered and used to calculate
the turbulent intensity, and the magnitude obtained by the PIV technique was consistent
with that obtained by the V3V technique. However, the 2D predictions could not capture
the fluctuation in the instantaneous velocity at the point and had a much lower turbulent
dynamic viscosity than the 3D model. Hence, 3D model predictions are more suitable for
investigating the gas-evolving vertical-electrode system. “
Finally, we appreciate very much for your time in editing our manuscript and the referees
for their valuable suggestions and comments. I am looking forward to hearing your final
decision when it is made.
