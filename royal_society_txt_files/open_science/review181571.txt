The article (Manuscript ID RSOS-181571) on “Protein content and amino acids profile in ten
cultivars of ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.) nut from China” is relevant to publication in Royal Society
Open Science after minor correction.
Submitted for review work on “Protein content and amino acids profile in ten cultivars of ginkgo
(Ginkgo biloba L.) nut from China” in an interesting and substantively as well as statistically
correct way describes the amino acid composition of ginkgo biloba nuts, their nutritional value
and compares the content of individual amino acids as well as amino acid groups in the amino
acid profile of nuts of 10 tested ginkgo biloba varieties. The research material, the methodology of
the conducted research and the presentation of the results do not raise objections of the reviewer.
However, in the Introduction part of the article there is a lack of broader information regarding
the research conducted so far by other authors in the analysis of the amino acid composition of
ginkgo biloba nuts and their nutritional value. Also, some more details in a discussion should be
added. The work has a high cognitive value.

This manuscript describes protein content and amino acids profile in ten cultivars of ginkgo
(Ginkgo biloba L.) nut from China. The manuscript will be acceptable after minor revision.
Page 1, Summary and throughout the whole manuscript, including Table 2, all the analytical data
should be given the three significant figures, e.g. 22.13 should be 22.1.
Page 2, section 3.1. Samples and sample preparation
How many fruits and/or what amounts of fruits were sampled from how many plants of each
cultivar should be given.
Page 3, section 4. Results and Discussion
The authors have not given any explanation/discussion as to why there is difference in the amino
acid and protein contents of different cultivars of the plant? It will be useful to correlate the
variations in amino acids with soil parameters (composition), climatic conditions, rain fall,
temperature, pH, fertilizers used and so on.

highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);

5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article

We thank the editor and reviewers for their time and comments. The comments
from reviewers are highly constructive, and we have acted on them to further
improve the manuscript. The detailed responses to the concerns from them are
provided as follows:
Reviewer 1
The article (Manuscript ID RSOS-181571) on “Protein content and amino acids
profile in ten cultivars of ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.) nut from China” is relevant
to publication in Royal Society Open Science after minor correction.
Submitted for review work on “Protein content and amino acids profile in ten

Detailed comments:
Title: Probably a sentence of “Insert the title of your article here” is not
necessary?
Author response:
We thank reviewer for the careful work. It has been deleted.
Page 2, line 44: “amino acids” is repeated
Author response:
It has been deleted.
Page 3, line 2: there is a mistake in a word “degradation”
Author response:
It has been corrected.
Results and Discussion
Page 4 line 36: what was CP content reported by Deng [18]? It needs better
information.
Author response:
It has been rewritten as follows:
The CP content of ginkgo nut, on average 19.7% of dry matter, was higher than
that reported by Deng et al. [18], who found that the protein content was 11.6%
in defatted ginkgo flour.
Page 4 lines 7-8: a discussion needs deeper explanation
Author response:
We think the reviewer wanted to refer to “Page 4 lines 37-8”.
The reason for the difference on protein content in ginkgo seed might be due to
the differences in analytical procedure and data expression. In the study by Deng
et al., protein content was obtained by an alkaline dissolving and acid
precipitating method, determined by the Bradford method, and the data was
reported on defatted ginkgo flour. In our study, the crude protein content was
determined by a Perkin-Elmer 2400 automatic element analyzer with conversion
factor of 6.25, and the protein content was reported on a dry weight basis.

We are very ashamed of these stupid mistakes. All have been corrected.

Author response:
We thank reviewer for reminding this detail, and have corrected.
Page 2, section 3.1. Samples and sample preparation
How many fruits and/or what amounts of fruits were sampled from how many
plants of each cultivar should be given.
Author response:
Approximate eighty fruits were harvested randomly from three plants of each
cultivar. It has been added in Materials and Methods
Page 3, section 4. Results and Discussion
The authors have not given any explanation/discussion as to why there is
difference in the amino acid and protein contents of different cultivars of the
plant? It will be useful to correlate the variations in amino acids with soil
parameters (composition), climatic conditions, rain fall, temperature, pH,
fertilizers used and so on.
Author response:
In this paper, the ten cultivars analyzed were cultivated in Pizhou Ginkgo biloba
Seedling Base under the same agronomic conditions. The only difference is the
cultivar, genetic background. Indeed, there are various factors causing the
difference in the amino acid and protein contents. In the next study, we plan to
compare the same cultivar from different planting regions, where the correlation
of the variations in protein and amino acids of ginkgo nuts with soil parameters
and climatic conditions will be discussed.
