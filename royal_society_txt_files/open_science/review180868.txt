label_comment_1
The authors report a study of convenient preparation of a polymer conjugated semiconductor
nanotubes. And their application in organic electronics is also investigated. The content is novel.
The experimental data can support the main conclusions.
1, In the Introduction part, some recent advances in conjugated semiconductor nanotubes such as
PEDOT (J. Mater. Chem. A, 2015, 3, 20896) can be added.
2, In the Experimental section, some detailed information including the acceleration voltages of
the SEM and TEM measurements, needs to be provided.
3, In Fig. 4(c), the text of "1 um" is too small to be recognized.
4, In the Reference section, some references do NOT follow the journal style. For example, in Ref.
1, the journal name should be abbreviated. Check all of the References.
On the basis of the above comments, I recommend acceptation after minor revisions.
