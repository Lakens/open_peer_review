The manuscript reports a very exciting study in producing surface-imprinted sol-gel monoliths
for laser holography applications, in particular, for humidity sensing. The work is very well
performed and beautifully described. The topic is definitely novel and worth investigation. I have
just a couple of points, where minor additional effort may be beneficial:
1) In the Fig.3 the scale of the image in AFM and in SEM differ rather much (about 1 um vs 50
nm). It would be beneficial to make an AFM of the same resolution as SEM.
2) It is rather intriguing that the micro scale pattern on the gel surface is restored after drying
while it was destroyed in humid air. I would encourage the authors to provide some explanation
for this.

The manuscript presents an interesting and well documented analysis of development of sol-gel
monoliths and the modification of their optical properties by the addition of multi-walled carbon
nanotubes. Authors demonstrate the use of developed materials for qualitative reversible
humidity sensors.
The methodology for the development has a certain scientific values and the findings could be
useful for the scientific community. However the use and applicability of the developed materials
is rather limited as does not provide a more efficient way to humidity detection compared to
other qualitative or low cost quantitative methods.
Authors should provide a more extended reference list on other detection methods and discuss in
3
a critical view the importance of their findings in terms of applicability.
Also I would suggest to examine or discuss the sensitivity or cross sensitivity of the developed
materials to other measurands like ammonia by providing also relevant references, like
["Diffractive Ammonia Sensors Based on Sol–Gel Nanocomposites Materials", Sensor Letters 11
(8), 1415-1419Sensor Letters 11 (8), 1415-1419].
I would suggest also to Authors to comment on the repeatability of the sensing behavior of the
materials. How many reversible cycles the material can withstand and how this affects surface's
properties? Did they observe any material degradation?

Holographic sol-gel monoliths: optical properties and application for humidity sensing
Dear Editor,
Thank you for your email of February 21, 2018, and for the two referee reports. We have carefully considered the
comments and corrected the manuscript as follows.
Reviewer #1
The manuscript reports a very exciting study in producing surface-imprinted sol-gel monoliths for laser holography
applications, in particular, for humidity sensing. The work is very well performed and beautifully described. The topic
is definitely novel and worth investigation. I have just a couple of points, where minor additional effort may be
beneficial:
1) In the Fig.3 the scale of the image in AFM and in SEM differ rather much (about 1 um vs 50 nm). It would be
beneficial to make an AFM of the same resolution as SEM.In the Fig.3 the scale of the image in AFM and in SEM differ
rather much (about 1 um vs 50 nm). It would be beneficial to make an AFM of the same resolution as SEM.
We gratitude the Reviewer #1 for the pointing, how to improve perception of visual material. We have made the
corresponding editing of the Fig.3. As 50 nm is rather small resolution for our AFM, we have made both images with
100 nm scale.
2) It is rather intriguing that the micro scale pattern on the gel surface is restored after drying while it was destroyed in
humid air. I would encourage the authors to provide some explanation for this.
We are agree with referee, that the question of repeatability and reversibility was not explained enough. Hence, we
described processes happening in humid environment and during drying step, as well as discussed the conditions, when
swelling process is irreversible (see text p. 7, 1st paragraph).
Reviewer #2
The manuscript presents an interesting and well documented analysis of development of sol-gel monoliths and the
modification of their optical properties by the addition of multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Authors demonstrate the use
of developed materials for qualitative reversible humidity sensors.
The methodology for the development has a certain scientific values and the findings could be useful for the scientific
community. However the use and applicability of the developed materials is rather limited as does not provide a more
efficient way to humidity detection compared to other qualitative or low cost quantitative methods.
Authors should provide a more extended reference list on other detection methods and discuss in a critical view the
importance of their findings in terms of applicability.
We appreciate a comment of Reviewer #2 for these designations. The number of references was enlarged right after the
thorough study of the newest investigations and trends of last couple of years in the sphere of qualitative and quantitive
humidity sensors. These were also compared with our sensor from the point of view of applicability. The results can be
found on p. 2, paragraphs 3-4.
Also I would suggest to examine or discuss the sensitivity or cross sensitivity of the developed materials to other
measurands like ammonia by providing also relevant references, like ["Diffractive Ammonia Sensors Based on Sol–
Gel Nanocomposites Materials", Sensor Letters 11 (8), 1415-1419].
The mentioned work ["Diffractive Ammonia Sensors Based on Sol–Gel Nanocomposites Materials", Sensor Letters 11
(8), 1415-1419] was studied and we have found, that the nature of processes of the sensor described there is different.
As detection in this work is based on interaction between ammonia and nanoparticles of NiCl2 and CuCl2 dispersed in
SiO2 matrix (in our case, there is no entrapment by these particles takes place), our sensor cannot be applied for NH3
recognition (see text p. 2, 3rd paragraph).
I would suggest also to Authors to comment on the repeatability of the sensing behavior of the materials. How many
reversible cycles the material can withstand and how this affects surface's properties? Did they observe any material
degradation?
The question of reversibility was mentioned, while we have answered the second question of Reviewer#1 (see text p. 7,
1st paragraph). Moreover, the results of cyclic load by humidity are added at p.8, end of the 1st paragraph. It is stated, that
the strength of treatment, which was made previously, allows sensor to be fully reversible and to avoid degradation a
couple of times. However, if the time of treatment 10 hours or more, the diffraction effect becomes irreversible because
of dramatic level of resuspension of nanoparticles of material (see text p. 7, 1st paragraph for clarifications).
Please find attached the corrected manuscript. We hope you will find our response to the comments of the Reviewers
and Editor satisfactory.
Sincerely,
Alexander Vinogradov
