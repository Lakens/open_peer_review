The authors aim to evaluate two hypotheses about the basis of knowledge about third-party kin
relationships in macaques. One hypothesis is that knowledge of kinship is based on observations
of social behavior, with some algorithm for transforming these observations into some estimate of
relatedness or relationship quality. Another hypothesis is that knowledge of kinship relies on
observation of early contacts between mothers and infants. To test these hypotheses, they ask
whether current levels of association or exposure to mother-offspring contact predicts patterns of
redirected aggression.
I do not understand why it is important to show that animals were more likely to initiate
aggression to a third party after receiving aggression than at a control point. The existence of
redirected aggression does not depend on this being the case. I think this part of the analysis
should be deleted.
The analysis shows that animals have an increased likelihood of redirecting aggression toward
close companions of the original aggressor and argue that this is evidence for knowledge of
relationship quality. However, these analyses do not control for availability of potential victims.
Animals with strong social bonds spend much of their time together, and this means that they are
more likely to be nearby when an aggressive attack occurs. In order to show that monkeys use
their knowledge of others’ social connections, don’t you need to control for immediate
availability?
The authors also show that observation of mothers’ contact with infants is not necessary to assess
relationship quality. This seems to be a logical corollary of the finding that females don’t
distinguish between true kin and nonkin with strong social bonds. However, it is not clear to me
that the authors are able to disentangle the two hypotheses about the basis of classification of
third party relationships with their data because of the ongoing nepotistic bias in patterns of
association. There are some dyads that subjects never observed in the early mother-infant phase,
and some dyads that subjects did observe in this phase. But all of these dyads presumably have
close social bonds now. So, couldn’t the monkeys have two criteria that contribute to
classification: (a) saw mother and infant together early on, (b) see them together often now. To
argue that monkeys DON’T rely on (a), you would have to show that monkeys respond
differently to those that they saw together early in life that now have weak relationships and
those that now have strong social bonds.
I was unsatisfied by the evidence that redirection against kin was more effective in reducing
aggression than redirection against nonkin ‘friends’. This occurs to me because the direction of
the effects is the same. I cannot think of a theoretical reason that redirected aggression against kin
would have a stronger impact on group members than redirected aggression against friends, if
animals are equally like to redirect against kin and friends.
Why do the authors think it is cognitively less demanding to categorize dyads on basis of current
patterns of association than on memories of early contact? I am not convinced.

3.47. Dasser et al’s early match to sample experiments on categorizing kin showed that females
did not require early knowledge of mother-infant relationships to identify close kin. I think this
work could be cited here.

This is a timely paper on a well conceived and run study. I congratulate the authors about
reusing a dataset collected for other purposes in order to test predictions on the acquisition and
functional consequences of social knowledge with a novel approach. I believe it is a solid study
and a well-structured and well-written paper. I have only a few observations.
- Given the broad scope of the journal, it is important to report what is known on a variety
of taxa, and not only primate species as the authors do in the majority of the Introduction. If
evidence is only available for primates, it should be clearly stated and explained if this is due to
lack of studies on non-primate species or failure to find evidence in studies on non-primate
species.
- On line 25, p. 7 it is unclear what “that expected on the basis of control points” means.
Although it is explained in the Methods, it would be better to use an expression that fully
conveys how this expected degree of kinship was calculated.
- It is a pity that the testing of the two hypotheses resulted in nonsignificant results, which
are problematic to interpret as they mainly mean “failure to find support”, and NOT “no
support”. It would be more convincing if the authors could find ways to test the hypotheses in
which they find in support (based on a significant result) for one of the hypotheses.
- Lines 5-14, p. 10: I am not sure about the meaning of this analysis. Redirection against the
victim’s kin? Why was this tested? Possibly the confusion is due to the writing. Please clarify it.

The authors present an analysis of a large corpus of behavioral data on captive Japanese
macaques to examine the factors that influence development of knowledge about the kinship
relationships of others , by examining patterns of kin recognition. They also examine the benefits
animals may gain by redirecting aggression against others.
The authors aim to test two different hypotheses about the basis of kin recognition. First, animals
learn who is related by observing mothers’ interactions with infants. Second, animals learn who
is related by observing current patterns of interactions. It seems likely that both mechanisms are
important. If animals relied only on the first mechanism they would know nothing about kinship
relationships among those older than themselves (or at least those weaned before their own
birth). So, a priori it seems reasonable to suppose that both mechanisms are used.
A major finding of the paper is that current relationship quality has a stronger impact on the
likelihood of redirected aggression than kinship. The authors argue that this implies that animals
rely on current ties not observations of mother-infant interactions to assess kinship. I have some
concerns with this conclusion. First, the measure of kinship is based solely on maternal kinship
(and it is not clear how maternal kinship was parameterized in the analysis). In rhesus macaques
and baboons, paternal kinship also influences behavior. It seems possible that CSI is a better
8
predictor of behavior than kinship because kinship is not accurately measured. This factor ought
to be discussed in the paper.
The authors explore the consequences of redirected aggression and find that those that redirect
aggression more receive less aggression. I think the authors should explore these results more,
particularly because there is an odd pattern of the consequences of redirecting against kin vs
those with high CSI. I also would like the authors to examine attributes of individuals (such as
sex, age, and rank) which might jointly affect tendency to perform redirected aggression and
likelihood of receiving aggression.
Line 151: How are kin defined here?
Line 165-167. Both kinship and CSI are included in the same model. I presume that this means
that collinearity was not a problem. It would be useful to provide information about this in the
paper. If they are strongly correlated, then it is problematic to include them in the same model.
Line 241-6: I don’t understand the ‘spatial constraints’ argument. It seems to me that the tendency
for kin to cluster will occur regardless of spatial constraints --- and availability of kin or close
companions (high DSI) may contribute to the observed pattern. While the tendency NOT to
recruit animals against their own relatives does suggest kin recognition abilities, it does not by
itself mean that the results on redirected aggression are not biased by availability.

The authors have clarified their analyses as requested by reviewers, and I find the data
interesting. The evidence about the pattern of redirected aggression fit with previous work. The
analyses of benefits are novel, and potentially the most important part of the work. It is always
very difficult to assess the benefits (short-term or long-term) of behavior with observational data.
And, here, the benefits are not clear. Decisions about who to redirect aggression to and how this
behavior benefits individuals do not match, and it's not clear why this should be the case. There
is a significant result, but it is an unexpected pattern and I wonder whether it is due to power (do
animals have fewer close friends than kin, making patterns harder to detect?) or some other
artifact in the data.
There is one bit of reasoning that I think should be corrected. In Lines 122-4. The authors suggest
that by examining whether “aggression to the kin of the aggressor is associated (either in the
short- or long-term) with a reduction in received aggression, one can also test whether variation
in the ability to identify kin is related to variation in the benefit of reduced received aggression.
Observational data can be used to determine whether animals behave differently toward partenrs
in different categories, such as maternal and paternal siblings. The behavioral differentiation
implies that animals can distinguish between these categories (as long as other factors, such as
age difference, have been controlled.)
However, you cannot use the data the other way – animals may recognize a distinction between
two categories, but not differentiate between them. For example, animals might be aware of the
difference between may maternal and paternal sibs, but treat them in exactly the same way.
Negative data are uninformative about the underlying cognition.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have clarified their analyses as requested by reviewers, and I find the data
interesting. The evidence about the pattern of redirected aggression fit with previous work. The
analyses of benefits are novel, and potentially the most important part of the work. It is always
very difficult to assess the benefits (short-term or long-term) of behavior with observational data.
And, here, the benefits are not clear. Decisions about who to redirect aggression to and how this
behavior benefits individuals do not match, and it's not clear why this should be the case. There
is a significant result, but it is an unexpected pattern and I wonder whether it is due to power (do
animals have fewer close friends than kin, making patterns harder to detect?) or some other
artifact in the data.
There is one bit of reasoning that I think should be corrected. In Lines 122-4. The authors suggest
that by examining whether “aggression to the kin of the aggressor is associated (either in the
short- or long-term) with a reduction in received aggression, one can also test whether variation
in the ability to identify kin is related to variation in the benefit of reduced received aggression.
Observational data can be used to determine whether animals behave differently toward partenrs
in different categories, such as maternal and paternal siblings. The behavioral differentiation
implies that animals can distinguish between these categories (as long as other factors, such as
age difference, have been controlled.)
However, you cannot use the data the other way – animals may recognize a distinction between
two categories, but not differentiate between them. For example, animals might be aware of the
difference between may maternal and paternal sibs, but treat them in exactly the same way.
Negative data are uninformative about the underlying cognition.

“Acquisition and functional consequences of social knowledge in macaques”.
Reviewers’ comments in italics.
Reviewer: 1
I do not understand why it is important to show that animals were more likely to
initiate aggression to a third party after receiving aggression than at a control point.
The existence of redirected aggression does not depend on this being the case. I think
this part of the analysis should be deleted.
We believe it was important as first step to show that our subjects did redirect
aggression against a third party (otherwise, it would be obviously meaningless to test
for kin oriented redirection). In order to test redirection, one has to show that the
probability of aggression following the receipt of aggression is higher than the
baseline value. This is what was tested in our analyses.
The analysis shows that animals have an increased likelihood of redirecting
aggression toward close companions of the original aggressor and argue that this is
evidence for knowledge of relationship quality. However, these analyses do not
control for availability of potential victims. Animals with strong social bonds spend
much of their time together, and this means that they are more likely to be nearby
when an aggressive attack occurs. In order to show that monkeys use their knowledge
of others’ social connections, don’t you need to control for immediate availability?
We agree that this is a potential shortcoming of our study. Unfortunately, our data do
not allow controlling for immediate availability. This point is now acknowledged and
discussed on page 11 lines 238-249.
The authors also show that observation of mothers’ contact with infants is not
necessary to assess relationship quality. This seems to be a logical corollary of the
finding that females don’t distinguish between true kin and nonkin with strong social
bonds. However, it is not clear to me that the authors are able to disentangle the two
hypotheses about the basis of classification of third party relationships with their data
because of the ongoing nepotistic bias in patterns of association. There are some
dyads that subjects never observed in the early mother-infant phase, and some dyads
that subjects did observe in this phase. But all of these dyads presumably have close
social bonds now. So, couldn’t the monkeys have two criteria that contribute to
classification: (a) saw mother and infant together early on, (b) see them together
often now. To argue that monkeys DON’T rely on (a), you would have to show that
monkeys respond differently to those that they saw together early in life that now have
weak relationships and those that now have strong social bonds.
If monkeys were relying on having observed early mother-infant associations
(criterion a), they should be able to distinguish kin from nonkin - even when the
strength of social bond (including weak and strong bonds) is controlled for. Our
results show this is not the case.
I was unsatisfied by the evidence that redirection against kin was more effective in
because the direction of the effects is the same. I cannot think of a theoretical reason
that redirected aggression against kin would have a stronger impact on group
members than redirected aggression against friends, if animals are equally like to
redirect against kin and friends.
According to kin selection theory, one can expect redirection on kin to have a stronger
impact on aggressors than redirection on friends because the former has indirect
fitness cost while the latter does not. Our results show that aggressors did respond
differently to redirection against kin and against friends.
On the other hand, victims did not appear to distinguish the aggressor's kin from the
aggressor's friends, and thus behaved suboptimally. It is possible then that a cognitive
constraint (i.e., recognizing the kin of third parties is more complex than recognizing
one's own kin) prevented victims from behaving optimally.
Why do the authors think it is cognitively less demanding to categorize dyads on basis
of current patterns of association than on memories of early contact? I am not
convinced.
Ongoing associations are relatively stable and currently available, thus providing a
cue that can be accessed at any time). Recognizing kin on the basis of early mother-
infant association would require categorizing dyads and then retaining this
categorization for years.

Reviewer: 2
This is a timely paper on a well conceived and run study. I congratulate the authors
about reusing a dataset collected for other purposes in order to test predictions on the
acquisition and functional consequences of social knowledge with a novel approach. I
believe it is a solid study and a well-structured and well-written paper. I have only a
few observations.
We thank the reviewer for her/his positive feedback.
Given the broad scope of the journal, it is important to report what is known on a
Introduction. If evidence is only available for primates, it should be clearly stated and
explained if this is due to lack of studies on non-primate species or failure to find
evidence in studies on non-primate species.
We added a few references and noted the absence of information about multiple
classification in nonprimates (page 3, line 40; references 5 and 6 in the list).
On line 25, p. 7 it is unclear what “that expected on the basis of control points”
means. Although it is explained in the Methods, it would be better to use an
expression that fully conveys how this expected degree of kinship was calculated.
We added a brief explanation at the end of the Introduction so as to facilitate the
reader (page 6, lines 126-132).
It is a pity that the testing of the two hypotheses resulted in nonsignificant results,
which are problematic to interpret as they mainly mean “failure to find support”, and
NOT “no support”. It would be more convincing if the authors could find ways to test
the hypotheses in which they find in support (based on a significant result) for one of
the hypotheses.
We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion. We added analyses that compared directly
the coefficients of the comparison between post-aggression and control data in
analyses that controlled and did not control for CSI. These analyses show that
controlling for CSI resulted in statistically significant decreases in the relevant
coefficients (page 8-9, lines 166-168, 178-180, 184-186 in the Results; page 17, lines
395-397 in the Material and methods).
Lines 5-14, p. 10: I am not sure about the meaning of this analysis. Redirection
against the victim’s kin? Why was this tested? Possibly the confusion is due to the
writing. Please clarify it.
The sentence was indeed misleading. We clarified it (page 10, line 221).

REVIEWERS’ COMMENTS IN UPPERCASE.
Reviewer: 1
THE AUTHORS PRESENT AN ANALYSIS OF A LARGE CORPUS OF
BEHAVIORAL DATA ON CAPTIVE JAPANESE MACAQUES TO EXAMINE THE
FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE DEVELOPMENT OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE
KINSHIP RELATIONSHIPS OF OTHERS , BY EXAMINING PATTERNS OF KIN
RECOGNITION. THEY ALSO EXAMINE THE BENEFITS ANIMALS MAY GAIN BY
REDIRECTING AGGRESSION AGAINST OTHERS.
THE AUTHORS AIM TO TEST TWO DIFFERENT HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE
BASIS OF KIN RECOGNITION. FIRST, ANIMALS LEARN WHO IS RELATED BY
OBSERVING MOTHERS’ INTERACTIONS WITH INFANTS. SECOND, ANIMALS
LEARN WHO IS RELATED BY OBSERVING CURRENT PATTERNS OF
INTERACTIONS. IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT BOTH MECHANISMS ARE
IMPORTANT. IF ANIMALS RELIED ONLY ON THE FIRST MECHANISM THEY
WOULD KNOW NOTHING ABOUT KINSHIP RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THOSE
OLDER THAN THEMSELVES (OR AT LEAST THOSE WEANED BEFORE THEIR
OWN BIRTH). SO, A PRIORI IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT BOTH
MECHANISMS ARE USED.
We agree that both mechanisms are in principle reasonable. That is why we tested
them. Our results suggest only the current pattern of interactions is actually used to
infer kinship.
A MAJOR FINDING OF THE PAPER IS THAT CURRENT RELATIONSHIP
QUALITY HAS A STRONGER IMPACT ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF REDIRECTED
AGGRESSION THAN KINSHIP. THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT THIS IMPLIES
THAT ANIMALS RELY ON CURRENT TIES NOT OBSERVATIONS OF MOTHER-
INFANT INTERACTIONS TO ASSESS KINSHIP. I HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH
THIS CONCLUSION. FIRST, THE MEASURE OF KINSHIP IS BASED SOLELY ON
MATERNAL KINSHIP (AND IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW MATERNAL KINSHIP WAS
PARAMETERIZED IN THE ANALYSIS). IN RHESUS MACAQUES AND BABOONS,
PATERNAL KINSHIP ALSO INFLUENCES BEHAVIOR. IT SEEMS POSSIBLE
THAT CSI IS A BETTER PREDICTOR OF BEHAVIOR THAN KINSHIP BECAUSE
KINSHIP IS NOT ACCURATELY MEASURED. THIS FACTOR OUGHT TO BE
DISCUSSED IN THE PAPER.
We agree with the reviewer, social behavior is influenced by both paternal and
maternal kinship. However, studies on primate species with female philopatry
indicate that the effect of paternal kinship on behaviour appears to be weaker than the
effect of maternal kinship (e.g., Widdig et al 2001 PNAS 98:13769-13773;
Charpentier et al 2007 Anim Behav 73:37-45). In addition, it is important to notice
that, our second hypothesis (that macaques recognize the kin of third parties on the
basis of early mother-infant care) only applies to maternal kinship.
Overall, although paternal kinship could introduce some noise in our data, we hesitate
to believe that it could explain our results. We have, however added a note of caution
in the discussion (lines 255-256).
371).
THE AUTHORS EXPLORE THE CONSEQUENCES OF REDIRECTED
AGGRESSION AND FIND THAT THOSE THAT REDIRECT AGGRESSION MORE
RECEIVE LESS AGGRESSION. I THINK THE AUTHORS SHOULD EXPLORE
THESE RESULTS MORE, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THERE IS AN ODD
PATTERN OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF REDIRECTING AGAINST KIN VS
THOSE WITH HIGH CSI. I ALSO WOULD LIKE THE AUTHORS TO EXAMINE
ATTRIBUTES OF INDIVIDUALS (SUCH AS SEX, AGE, AND RANK) WHICH
MIGHT JOINTLY AFFECT TENDENCY TO PERFORM REDIRECTED
AGGRESSION AND LIKELIHOOD OF RECEIVING AGGRESSION.
We repeated these analyses controlling also for age and sex (rank was already
controlled for in the previous analyses). The results did not change (see lines 218-232,
and Tables S16 and S17 in the Supplementary Material).
Also, we do not see an odd pattern in our results, since they likely reflect the different
cognitive abilities needed for classifying group mates: egocentric and non-egocentric
perspectives. Based on an egocentric perspective, they are able to identify their own
kin and distinguish them from their own friends. In contrast, when dealing with the
non-egocentric perspective, they do not distinguish the kin and friends of third parties,
a more cognitively challenging task.
LINE 151: HOW ARE KIN DEFINED HERE?
We added in the Methods an explanation about how kinship was entered into analyses
(see also your point above) and how it was used to categorize dyads (lines 367-371).
LINE 165-167. BOTH KINSHIP AND CSI ARE INCLUDED IN THE SAME MODEL.
I PRESUME THAT THIS MEANS THAT COLLINEARITY WAS NOT A PROBLEM.
IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS IN THE
PAPER. IF THEY ARE STRONGLY CORRELATED, THEN IT IS PROBLEMATIC
TO INCLUDE THEM IN THE SAME MODEL.
The correlation between kinship and CSI was significant but not particularly strong.
This information is now reported in the Supplementary Material (see “Kinship and
Friendship”)
LINE 241-6: I DON’T UNDERSTAND THE ‘SPATIAL CONSTRAINTS’
ARGUMENT. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE TENDENCY FOR KIN TO CLUSTER
WILL OCCUR REGARDLESS OF SPATIAL CONSTRAINTS --- AND AVAILABILITY
OF KIN OR CLOSE COMPANIONS (HIGH DSI) MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE
OBSERVED PATTERN. WHILE THE TENDENCY NOT TO RECRUIT ANIMALS
AGAINST THEIR OWN RELATIVES DOES SUGGEST KIN RECOGNITION
ABILITIES, IT DOES NOT BY ITSELF MEAN THAT THE RESULTS ON
REDIRECTED AGGRESSION ARE NOT BIASED BY AVAILABILITY.
We agree. Our argument simply shows that spatial constraints do not generally
explain the ability of primates (including our own subjects in a previous study) to
248-250).

REVIEWERS’ COMMENTS IN UPPERCASE.
Reviewer: 1
THE AUTHORS HAVE CLARIFIED THEIR ANALYSES AS REQUESTED BY
REVIEWERS, AND I FIND THE DATA INTERESTING. THE EVIDENCE
ABOUT THE PATTERN OF REDIRECTED AGGRESSION FIT WITH
PREVIOUS WORK. THE ANALYSES OF BENEFITS ARE NOVEL, AND
POTENTIALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE WORK. IT IS
ALWAYS VERY DIFFICULT TO ASSESS THE BENEFITS (SHORT-TERM OR
LONG-TERM) OF BEHAVIOR WITH OBSERVATIONAL DATA. AND, HERE,
THE BENEFITS ARE NOT CLEAR. DECISIONS ABOUT WHO TO REDIRECT
AGGRESSION TO AND HOW THIS BEHAVIOR BENEFITS INDIVIDUALS DO
NOT MATCH, AND IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY THIS SHOULD BE THE CASE.
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT RESULT, BUT IT IS AN UNEXPECTED PATTERN
AND I WONDER WHETHER IT IS DUE TO POWER (DO ANIMALS HAVE
FEWER CLOSE FRIENDS THAN KIN, MAKING PATTERNS HARDER TO
DETECT?) OR SOME OTHER ARTIFACT IN THE DATA.
THERE IS ONE BIT OF REASONING THAT I THINK SHOULD BE
CORRECTED. IN LINES 122-4. THE AUTHORS SUGGEST THAT BY
EXAMINING WHETHER “AGGRESSION TO THE KIN OF THE AGGRESSOR
IS ASSOCIATED (EITHER IN THE SHORT- OR LONG-TERM) WITH A
REDUCTION IN RECEIVED AGGRESSION, ONE CAN ALSO TEST WHETHER
VARIATION IN THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY KIN IS RELATED TO
VARIATION IN THE BENEFIT OF REDUCED RECEIVED AGGRESSION.
OBSERVATIONAL DATA CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER
ANIMALS BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY TOWARD PARTENRS IN DIFFERENT
CATEGORIES, SUCH AS MATERNAL AND PATERNAL SIBLINGS. THE
BEHAVIORAL DIFFERENTIATION IMPLIES THAT ANIMALS CAN
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THESE CATEGORIES (AS LONG AS OTHER
FACTORS, SUCH AS AGE DIFFERENCE, HAVE BEEN CONTROLLED.)
HOWEVER, YOU CANNOT USE THE DATA THE OTHER WAY – ANIMALS
MAY RECOGNIZE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN TWO CATEGORIES, BUT
NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THEM. FOR EXAMPLE, ANIMALS MIGHT
BE AWARE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MAY MATERNAL AND
PATERNAL SIBS, BUT TREAT THEM IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY.
NEGATIVE DATA ARE UNINFORMATIVE ABOUT THE UNDERLYING
COGNITION.
We agree with Reviewer 1 about the inability to discern between the ability to
recognize and the occurrence of a differentiation, we thus changed the sentence to
reflect this point.
