I have reviewed this manuscript before, and I find that my main concerns have been addressed,
so I will keep this brief. This version contributes to your understanding of host-pathogen
interactions with the fungus-growing ant symbiosis. Unlike previous versions with which I had
concerns, this version accurately reflects current perspectives in the field and how these results
expand our knowledge. As always, I believe the taxonomic perspective that these authors
provide will move progress forward in studies using this model system of symbiosis.
Minor Comments

did you exclude regions where you were not confident about the alignment? This region can be a
mess to align, so it is an important consideration.

selected to have broad host ranges (might happen when vectoring between colonies is unlikely
because of low vector or colony density) while others have evolved to overcome specific defense

This manuscript describe important findings on the phylogeny of Escovopsis fungi and their
possible co-cladogenesis with the attine ant hosts. An important finding is that specificity of the
Escovopsis strains appears to be lower than previously thought, in that closely related strains are
able to infect nests of distantly related ant species. Based on the presented data I find this
conclusion justified, but would anyway prefer that the authors make this conclusion less strong.
My hesitation is based on the following:
1) As the authors acknowledge, cultivar switching between attine ants do occur, and given that
Escovopsis infect the fungus garden, the identity of the fungus cultivar should be more important
than the identity of the ant host. It would therefore have been nice if also the fungal cultivars had
been sequenced in order to test if co-cladogenesis exists between Escovopsis and the fungal
cultivars. This is probably not possible at this stage, but at least a more explicit discussion of this
issue would be appreciated.
2) In my hands the ITS marker is good for barcoding fungi, but sometimes gives a bit weird
results when used for phylogenetics. It would be good if the authors could make a statement
saying that phylogenies made from each of the two marker genes separately showed the same
trends as the presented phylogeny based on the concatenated markers.
3) The authors state that their results show that the Escovopsis they find are infecting the ant
colonies, but is this actually true? Just because spores are present in the fungus garden and can
germinate when moved to PDA plates, doesn't (in my opinion) nescessarily mean that the
parasite has the potential to infect the fungus garden. Couldn't it just be that the spores lie
dormant in the garden without any prospects of infecting the garden, because they accidentally
ended up at the wrong nest? A discussion of this possibility would be appreciated.
A minor comment: I believe reference 46 now can be written with issue and page numbers.

The manuscript "Shared Escovopsis infections between leaf-cutting and non-leaf-cutting ants in
the higher-attine fungus-growing ant symbiosis" by Meirelles et al. report the novel finding of
closely related Escovopsis strains infecting both leaf-cutting ant and higher-attine ant gardens.
The authors conclude that this likely reflects evidence of host-switching of these parasitic fungi,
which is here reported for the first time between the two major groups, higher-attine and leaf-
cutting ants within the higher-attine fungiculture. This adds to the current understanding of
frequent host-switching between species of leaf-cutting ants by showing that these fungi are able
to switch between phylogenetic more distant hosts, and that Escovopsis contain strains that are
less geographically widespread and perhaps locally adapted to either particular hosts or
ecological niches.
The manuscript is well written and my major concern is that the rather lengthy discussion only
deal with fungus-growing ants. I suggest the authors also consider discussing their findings in
relation to the broader topic of pathogenic fungal host jumps and differences between specialist
and generalist fungal pathogens of for example plants and insects. In particular for plant
pathogenic fungi, evolution of host adaptation and documented host jumps is well known and
some placing the findings of this manuscript in this framework might be very rewarding. As the
authors point out the fungus-growing ant system is increasingly becoming better and better
characterized, why questions of specificity and host-range of Escovopsis should also be of interest
to a broader readership if incorporated in the text appropriately.
My other concern is that the authors have impressively obtained samples across a wide
geographical distance, but I wonder why no population genetic type analyses have been
performed on the obtained alignments. I suggest the authors consider analyzing possible
correlations between genetic and geographical distances and within and between host
species/genus genetic divergence of Escovopsis (i.e using AMOVA's).
Otherwise I only have a few minor comments to this interesting manuscript.
Minor comments:
Line 101: I think it would be useful for readers to split the 70 mentioned colonies into how many
higher attine colonies (i.e. Trachymyrmex and Sericomyrmex) and leaf-cutting colonies (I.e. Atta
and Acromyrmex).
Line 192: Please correct wording, for example to: "and the other for ITS..."
Line 330: restrict should be restricted
Line 338: Do you mean within different fungus garden chambers of the same colony, or that a
single clone is cultivated by all colonies of A. subterraneus molestans? Maybe change "colonies"
to "colony" to clarify?
Line 372: close should be closely
Line 408: Consider rewording the sentence "Our data support the first scenario less strongly...",
which may be confusing to readers.

Line 40. For the ITS alignment, did you use the entire alignment in your phylogenetic analysis or
did you exclude regions where you were not confident about the alignment? This region can be a
mess to align, so it is an important consideration.
R. Thank you for this comment. We used the entire ITS alignment because the variation within
the genus Escovopsis is not sufficient to cause critical problems to the alignment software.
Therefore, differently from what usually we have when comparing ITS phylogenies for fungi of
unrelated genera (i.e. causing a really mess within the ITS1 and ITS2 regions), the alignment
considering only Escovopsis sequences is good and ITS1 and ITS2 regions are important because
there is almost no variation within the 5.8S rDNA.
However, for precaution, we reran the analysis excluding the few suspected problematic sites and
we obtained a final tree with the same topology, which indicates that our complete alignment is
robust. The entire alignment will be available on TreeBase for readers.
Line 213. It would be helpful to start this section with a brief explanation of the two vesicle types
and what is know about them. While not a method, it would put this section into context for the
reader.
R. Thank you for the suggestion. We added this explanation (see now lines 223-229).
Line 235. well-supported clades?
R. Most of them are well-supported clades, but some are not (low bootstrap or pp values). This
might be caused by the slight differences between tef and ITS phylogenies. Both individual
phylogenies have similar topologies, but as expected, they contain a few differences due to the
nature of those markers. We included a discussion on this topic (see lines 201-208) and we
believe despite the low values of bootstrap/posterior probabilities for some clades, the similarity
of the final tree pattern compared to previous studies (such as Taerum et al. 2007 and 2010)
support our conclusions.

issue would be appreciated.
R. Thanks for this comment. We also agree that a cultivar phylogeny would add a lot for the
study, but unfortunately as the reviewer supposed, this is not possible at this stage (we do not
have the cultivar strains for the colonies tested). However, we included a discussion about this
issue as suggested (see lines 349-353).
2) In my hands the ITS marker is good for barcoding fungi, but sometimes gives a bit weird
results when used for phylogenetics. It would be good if the authors could make a statement
saying that phylogenies made from each of the two marker genes separately showed the same
trends as the presented phylogeny based on the concatenated markers.
R. We agree. In fact, reviewer #1 raised the same issue during the first round of reviews before
we transferred our manuscript to RSOS. To make this clear to readers, we now added a discussion
on this, which we preferred to include in the Methods section (see lines 201-208). The
independent phylogenies for both markers show the same trends, but there are some differences
in specific clades. We already expected this, since ITS and tef are two very distinct markers. Our
intention using ITS was to test it as a new phylogenetic marker for future studies on Escovopsis
systematics. This was initially suggested by Augustin et al. (2013) and our results indicate it
apparently has a good potential, at least for Escovopsis from higher attines. Future studies will
certainly evaluate the same potential of ITS for Escovopsis from lower attine ants and perhaps
this marker will be another option for phylogenies of the genus. Since Escovopsis systematics is
now being established with recent description of new species, tests for new molecular markers
might gain attention over the next years.
3) The authors state that their results show that the Escovopsis they find are infecting the ant
colonies, but is this actually true? Just because spores are present in the fungus garden and can
germinate when moved to PDA plates, doesn't (in my opinion) necessarily mean that the parasite

has the potential to infect the fungus garden. Couldn't it just be that the spores lie dormant in the
garden without any prospects of infecting the garden, because they accidentally ended up at the
wrong nest? A discussion of this possibility would be appreciated.
R. Thank you for this observation. As far as the fungus-growing ant system becomes more
understood, new questions arise regarding Escovopsis pathogenic potential. We agree with the
reviewer in the context that we cannot claim that the shared Escovopsis are truly causing
infections. The dormant state has been suggested for Escovopsis even for strains constantly
isolated from a specific ant species, as an explanation for isolating Escovopsis from apparently
healthy colonies (Meirelles et al. 2015 Plos One). We also know that different higher attine ants
can switch the cultivar (Mueller et al. in prep; Schultz et al. 2015), and this might have an impact
on Escovopsis sharing. We think it is unlikely that all shared Escovopsis strains were accidentally
transmitted to colonies they cannot infect, especially after Augustin et al. (2013) reporting E.
moelleri from many colonies of the leafcutter Acromyrmex subterraneus. However, we agree
about being precautious regarding this issue. To accommodate your suggestion, we included a
topic on the discussion (see lines 396-410) and changed the word infections to parasites in
the title of our paper.
A minor comment: I believe reference 46 now can be written with issue and page numbers.
R. Done. See now ref. 51 (lines 665-668). The change in reference numbering (from 46 to 51)
was due to the inclusion of new references on cultivar switch which were lacking in the previous
version of the manuscript.

some placing the findings of this manuscript in this framework might be very rewarding. As the
authors point out the fungus-growing ant system is increasingly becoming better and better
characterized, why questions of specificity and host-range of Escovopsis should also be of interest
to a broader readership if incorporated in the text appropriately.
R. We would like to thank the reviewer for this comment. In fact, putting Escovopsis into a
broader discussion of specificity and host-range is interesting for a broad audience. We included a
discussion about this topic in the main text to accommodate the reviewers suggestions (see lines
421-433). We made our point brief due to the length of the discussion section.
My other concern is that the authors have impressively obtained samples across a wide
geographical distance, but I wonder why no population genetic type analyses have been
performed on the obtained alignments. I suggest the authors consider analyzing possible
correlations between genetic and geographical distances and within and between host
species/genus genetic divergence of Escovopsis (i.e using AMOVA's).
R. We agree with the reviewer that a population genetic analysis could add to the discussion.
However, we have concerns about our data fitting well such analysis, and we believe it would
result in potential bias. First, our isolations and sampling was not exhaustive for different
regions/ant species. Basically, the number of Escovopsis strains isolated from each of the 31
locations is different; from some locations (e.g. Gamboa  PAN or Rio Claro  BRA) we have
several Escovopsis strains derived from many colonies. However, for other locations (e.g. Faz.
Pau Brazil or Parauapebas - BRA) only one colony with only one Escovopsis strain was analyzed.
In addition, our sampling is also unbalanced across higher attine ant genera and species. Such
differences over the sampling could bias a population genetic analysis, indicating more diversity
in regions oversampled. So, we prefer to make only a generic comparison between Escovopsis
found in Camacan-BA (site #9) and in the South of Brazil (lines 443-446).
Moreover, there are other problems linked with such analysis caused by our lack of
knowledge about Escovopsis: (i) we do not know species boundaries for many Escovopsis fungi;
(ii) we also do not quite know how much sex/recombination vs asexuality there is in Escovopsis.
Therefore, despite agreeing that a genetic population analysis for Escovopsis from higher attines
is something missing in the current literature, after considering your concerns we preferred to do
not include such analysis in the manuscript. We hope the reviewer understand our points.
Otherwise I only have a few minor comments to this interesting manuscript.
