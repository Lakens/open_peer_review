This article attempts to find the neural correlates of laryngeal control. The operation of the
structure being discussed (the larynx) needs to be improved in order to make this article
accessible to readers of an open science journal. I would suggest that the authors provide a
diagram to indicate the manoeuvres that the larynx makes, A description of what is happening is
very difficult to get over clearly in text form.
Another concern is the heterogeneity of the sample tested. Whilst it is correct (in my opinion) to
include people with diverse backgrounds, the differences need to be described in full (e.g. native
language). It is not sufficient in a study on laryngeal control to say participants were fluent in
English. The heterogeneity extends beyond native language. For instance, there are gender and
handedness differences too. These could conceivably have affected the results and explained why
patterns of activity varied across the participants. This should be discussed under 'limitations'.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The study by Belyk et al. examined the pitch representation in the larynx motor cortex in healthy
young singers. This is an interesting study, however, I have a number of comments and
recommendations as follows.
Introduction
The title should explicitly mention the singers as pitch was assessed during singing in this group
3
but not speaking. While mechanisms of singing and speaking are similar, it is a stretch to
generalize the finding when only one laryngeal behavior is studied.
The Introduction should be more concise for the description of the function for each laryngeal
muscles. It currently spins 1.5 pages. Overall, the paper should be shortened by third.
On the other hand, more information should be provided about the model of control rules.
The purpose for the insertion of the paragraph on evolutionary aspects of the larynx motor cortex
on p 4 is unclear. It does not seem to be relevant here or to this study.
P 6 Regarding reason (4), the authors can't assert with high confidence that fMRI due to its
resolution (3 mm in this study) would provide more superior and accurate spatial organization
for small laryngeal muscles within a small area of laryngeal motor cortex than electrical
stimulation studies.
It needs to be acknowledged and taken into consideration during discussion of findings, that
trained choral singers are professional musicians. As it is the case with any trained musicians,
their motor cortex is enlarged, in this case the LMC, and the topographic organization of separate
laryngeal muscle may be organized differently from those without training.
The last sentence of the Introduction is not clear. What replication studies are referred to? And
why there should be a spatial overlap between CT and TA if several studies have already showed
there is none.
Methods
The authors should comment how left-handedness may have influenced their data. The best
approach would be to conduct the separate analyses with and without this subject.
The authors should include a limitation of a block design fMRI for sound production
experiments. They should provide information on motion artifacts and explain how these were
accounted for and corrected and how the false positives were dealt with.
No spatial smoothing at the resolution of 3mm is not very helpful as it reduces group-wide
comparability while not really helping with precise topographic localization.
End of p 10. There is no need to repeat the hypothesis and the overall study design here.
Why do you think that the location of LMC would change at different pitches? It's not a fluid
region. If you meant that LMC would be activated differently at different pitches, that is a
completely different notion from what is stated currently. Please clarify. Also, at this resolution
I'm skeptical these differences in activation can be meaningfully captured.
What's the reason for choosing a liberal threshold? The LMC is localizable with stringent
thresholds.
The need to perform the searchlight analysis should be better explained and justified. Moreover,
I'm skeptical the classifier can reach stable accuracy with only 12 subjects. How many
subjects/runs were included in each training and data sets.
Results
Please explain how you separate two peaks of LMC, which are only 3 mm apart with 3-mm voxel
size of acquired sequence.
4
Provide the activation maps that include all regions observed.
Explain the findings of Table 2 in the Results.
Explain why the double peak, if it's real, is observed on the left side only.
The first sentence in section 4.4 is unclear. Perhaps the authors meant 'In contrast' instead of
'Consistent'?
Discussion
It should be acknowledged up front that fMRI lacks high spatial resolution compared to direct
electrical stimulation studies in auditory cortex.
The authors should keep in mind and acknowledge as a limitation in the paper that fMRI during
different pitch production still activates all laryngeal muscles (perhaps one more than the other)
while TMS, especially navigation controlled and EMG controlled, assure the activity of single
muscles.
P 17, second paragraph, first sentence Without further evidence, this sentence should be toned
down. It would be also helpful to compare with other studies that employed nasal behaviors. The
statement that other studies exclusively employed oral vocalizations is incorrect.
The section on the analogy from hand motor cortex is not supported by these data and is purely
speculative. I suggest merging some parts of this section with the other sections, and removing
the rest.
Similarly, the direct relevance of section 5.4 to the study is unclear. No neuroanatomical work has
been done here.
Explain better the relevance of a songbird sentence p 21. They have a very different both
anatomically and functionally vocal apparatus, which is not comparable with human larynx.
Limb muscles are much larger than larynx muscles; limb representations in the motor cortex are
much larger than LMC. Hence the last sentence should be of Limitations deleted.

Two experts have the reviewed the manuscript and, while both were generally positive, they
made suggestions for revisions ranging from minor to fairly major changes to the text. These
suggestions are clearly stated and all seem reasonable to me. Reviewer 1’s suggestion to include a
diagram showing the operation of the larynx would alleviate Reviewer 2’s concern about lengthy
text description in the Introduction.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
This is a revised version of the paper by Belyk et al where the authors examined the role of the
laryngeal motor cortex - LMC - in the control of pitch during singing in professionally trained
singers. Based on the previous comments, the study is now much clearly presented, however,
there are still several issues remaining.
Authors' response
- In my previous review, the point about the title revision was to specify that the pitch control
was studied in singers, not during singing. It is an important distinction because you have
selected a very narrow and highly vocally trained group of people, whose laryngeal motor
control may be significantly enhanced compared to normal population. It is misleading to not
include 'singers' in the title.
10
- Please note that TA and CT muscles have been mapped in a few studies using TMS and
vocal/orofacial muscles have been mapped with direct electrical stimulation in another set of
studies, also in humans. I'm not aware of specific published studies that targeted but explicitly
failed to map pitch. This studies may have simply not been conducted yet. Thus, this paragraph
on p 6 needs further revisions to state accurately what was done and what was not, to date. If you
used fMRI to map pitch in the LMC, that's great but other literature should also be cited properly.
Also, I still doubt the resolution of fMRI for detecting separate and relatively tiny laryngeal
muscles without substantiating the results with concurrent EMG.
- The fact that trained choral singers were used in the study should be stated up front in the
Introduction and not tucked in the limitation at the end of the manuscript.
- Regarding the choice of a liberal threshold, I disagree with the authors' explanation that they
were not testing a hypothesis but just localizing a region with their liberal threshold. It is even
more important to use stringent safeguards in localizing the region, especially the separate
muscle they claim to have identified. How should the reader trust your findings when your
voxelwise statistics is so relaxed and doesn't adhere to established standards? How this would
impact the reproducibility of your findings?
- The same point above is directly relevant to separating clusters, with the threshold not properly
set.
- Information about the double peaks should be expanded. The authors argued that it is beyond
the data but it's not a valid point. Double peaks are important because they are in the area you
focus on, yet the reader does not get any specific explanations of their significance.
- To clarify my previous comment, fMRI lacks the resolution, both spatial and temporal, of direct
brain stimulation and recordings during open brain surgery. So when making analogies and
comparisons with stimulation studies, this disadvantage of fMRI should be acknowledged.
Manuscript
- p. 4, line 41, sentence starting with Hence,... is a repetition of the previous.
- p. 4 Consider including other TMS studies of LMC, not only Rodel's
- p. 5 - As I mentioned earlier, your selected cohort of trained singers may have a very different
and expanded LMC representation. The fact that other fMRI studies did not separate LMC
muscles may simply depend on the cohorts studied. This needs to be included as one of the
possibilities. In other words, decoupling vocal-pitch production from vertical movements of the
larynx is not a simple task typically used by untrained singers.
- p. 10 - Again, application of such liberal thresholds has led to negativity and distrust of fMRI
findings, lately highlighted in press. Why should I believe your uncorrected findings? What are
your corrected results? How can I be sure that your two tiny clusters are not false positive? How
the threshold of k>25 was chosen?
- As I stated earlier, the Discussion should be more concise and to the point. It is too long and
spread out in its current form.

Comments to the Author:
The revised manuscript and responses to reviewer comments do an excellent job at addressing
the reviewer's final set of concerns. I congratulate the authors on a fine study.
I found one possible typo on p. 13, line 15: "Centroid coordinate" > "Centroid coordinates".

Comments to the Author:
Two experts have the reviewed the manuscript and, while both were
generally positive, they made suggestions for revisions ranging from minor to
fairly major changes to the text. These suggestions are clearly stated and all
seem reasonable to me. Reviewer 1’s suggestion to include a diagram
showing the operation of the larynx would alleviate Reviewer 2’s concern
about lengthy text description in the Introduction.

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This article attempts to find the neural correlates of laryngeal control. The
operation of the structure being discussed (the larynx) needs to be improved
in order to make this article accessible to readers of an open science journal.
I would suggest that the authors provide a diagram to indicate the
manoeuvres that the larynx makes, A description of what is happening is very
difficult to get over clearly in text form.
Reply: Thank you for the excellent suggestion! We have added a new
figure (now Figure 1) depicting the anatomy of the larynx and
highlighting the relevant musculature.
Another concern is the heterogeneity of the sample tested. Whilst it is correct
(in my opinion) to include people with diverse backgrounds, the differences
need to be described in full (e.g. native language). It is not sufficient in a
study on laryngeal control to say participants were fluent in English. The
heterogeneity extends beyond native language. For instance, there are
gender and handedness differences too. These could conceivably have
affected the results and explained why patterns of activity varied across the
participants. This should be discussed under 'limitations'.
Reply: We now report the native language of all participants in the revised
manuscript (11 native speakers of English, 1 of Japanese). We are glad to
hear that the reviewer sees the value of participant diversity. We would
also like to point out that while we do agree in general that recruiting a
heterogeneous sample could lead to more-variable observations, this
does not seem likely for the present study. Even within individual
participants, there was markedly little variation in neural activation as a
function of vocal-pitch. In other words, while the participants were
heterogeneous their responses were homogeneous in showing the
2
same neural profile across conditions. We now discuss this point in the
limitations section (p.20).
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
The study by Belyk et al. examined the pitch representation in the larynx
motor cortex in healthy young singers. This is an interesting study, however, I
have a number of comments and recommendations as follows.
Introduction
The title should explicitly mention the singers as pitch was assessed during
singing in this group but not speaking. While mechanisms of singing and
speaking are similar, it is a stretch to generalize the finding when only one
laryngeal behavior is studied.
Reply: We would like to discuss this matter further with the reviewer. We
would point out that our experimental task only nominally involved
singing in that it involved the production of a monotone pitch across a
single carrier vowel. The only element that makes this production task
more strongly linked to song than speech is that the monotone pitch
changed across blocks whereas the vowel was constant. This design
was chosen as a highly controlled motor task intended to probe the
laryngeal muscles.
We appreciate that the reviewer’s intention is to narrow the meaning of
the title to avoid implying a link to language that is not supportable.
However, we worry that explicitly pointing to song suggests a link to
music that we would also not wish to support. Hence, if the reviewer
agrees, we prefer to leave the title agnostic with respect to speech or
song to avoid implying unwarranted inferences about either language or
music. This is consistent with several previous studies that have looked
at either level-pitch production or pitch sweeps, that are not
conceptualized as singing studies, but rather as vocalization studies.
The Introduction should be more concise for the description of the function for
each laryngeal muscles. It currently spins 1.5 pages. Overall, the paper
should be shortened by third.
Reply: We have shortened the introduction and have simplified the
description of laryngeal anatomy (p.4). On the recommendation of
Reviewer 1, we have also added a figure depicting the muscular anatomy
of the larynx (now Figure 1) to make the description of laryngeal anatomy
more accessible to a general audience. The revised manuscript has been
somewhat shortened, though we do not think that we can achieve the
suggested length without substantially compromising the quality of the
manuscript.
3
On the other hand, more information should be provided about the model of
control rules.
Reply: We now describe this mathematical model in slightly more detail,
while attempting to be brief (p.4).
“The dynamics of vocal pitch have been described by a mathematical
model of “control rules” mapping combinations of laryngeal-muscle
movements onto their influence over vocal pitch [7]. This model predicts
the oscillations of the vocal folds as a function of a low-dimensional set of
parameters describing the configuration of the vocal folds, such as their
compressional stiffness, length, thickness, and depth. In turn, it predicts
the configuration of the vocal folds from the degree of contraction of
certain laryngeal muscles, most notably the CT and TA muscles. In
combination, these control rules map combinations of CT and TA
contraction onto vocal pitch modulations. How these control rules are
implemented in the central nervous system as it modulates vocal pitch
during speech, song, and expressions of emotion is presently unknown.”
The purpose for the insertion of the paragraph on evolutionary aspects of the
larynx motor cortex on p 4 is unclear. It does not seem to be relevant here or
to this study.
Reply: We now omit this paragraph.
P 6 Regarding reason (4), the authors can't assert with high confidence that
fMRI due to its resolution (3 mm in this study) would provide more superior
and accurate spatial organization for small laryngeal muscles within a small
area of laryngeal motor cortex than electrical stimulation studies.
Reply: We completely agree and would not wish to claim that fMRI could
provide an assessment at a finer resolution than electrical stimulation.
We do, however, wish to point out that electrical stimulation experiments
that segregate the TA and CT muscles have only been conducted in
animal models. Since we know that the human larynx area has a different
cellular composition and different function than the primate LMC, we
should be wary of making inferences about the human LMC from animal
models. We have reworded reason 4 in order to more clearly state this
view (p.5).
“Possible reasons for the inability of these studies to detect pitch-dependent
modulation of the LMC include 1) the tendency of untrained singers to
couple pitch modulation with vertical movements of the larynx that engage
a complex of extrinsic laryngeal muscles, which may obscure activity
4
related to the muscles with the strongest influence on vocal pitch, 2) the
insensitivity of standard general linear model (GLM) analyses to adjacent
or overlapping activations, 3) the non-linear relationship between the
profile of activation of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles (CT and TA) and
vocal pitch, and 4) that the neural representations of the various laryngeal
muscles in the human brain might be more overlapping than predicted from
animal models.”
It needs to be acknowledged and taken into consideration during discussion
of findings, that trained choral singers are professional musicians. As it is the
case with any trained musicians, their motor cortex is enlarged, in this case
the LMC, and the topographic organization of separate laryngeal muscle may
be organized differently from those without training.
Reply: We now address this possibility in the limitations section (p.20).
The last sentence of the Introduction is not clear. What replication studies are
referred to? And why there should be a spatial overlap between CT and TA if
several studies have already showed there is none.
Reply: This sentence has been removed as part of the shortening of the
introduction.
Methods
The authors should comment how left-handedness may have influenced their
data. The best approach would be to conduct the separate analyses with and
without this subject.
Reply: We have repeated the analyses excluding the one participant
who was left handed. We now note in the text that this did not change
the results (p.13).
The authors should include a limitation of a block design fMRI for sound
production experiments. They should provide information on motion artifacts
and explain how these were accounted for and corrected and how the false
positives were dealt with.
Reply: We now discuss the issue of artefacts and the steps taken in our
experimental design and recruitment strategy to mitigate these
concerns (p.8).
No spatial smoothing at the resolution of 3mm is not very helpful as it reduces
group-wide comparability while not really helping with precise topographic
localization.
5
Reply: We would respectfully note that MVPA is best performed without
spatial smoothing in order to guard against blurring the fine-grained patterns
amongst voxels. Likewise, our centroid-based analysis was performed at
the level of individual participants and would not benefit from spatial
smoothing. In light of our null spatial findings, we believe that readers
would rightly wonder whether spatial smoothing obscured differences in
spatial location had we applied it.
End of p 10. There is no need to repeat the hypothesis and the overall study
design here.
Reply: This statement has been removed.
Why do you think that the location of LMC would change at different pitches?
It's not a fluid region. If you meant that LMC would be activated differently at
different pitches, that is a completely different notion from what is stated
currently. Please clarify. Also, at this resolution I'm skeptical these differences
in activation can be meaningfully captured.
Reply: We now end the introduction with a clearer statement of our
hypothesis (p.6). From the electromyographical research that we review
in the introduction, it is clear that producing different vocal pitches
differentially engages the CT and TA muscles. Hence, we use different
pitch levels to differentially engage the CT and TA muscles in the
absence techniques for directly stimulating these muscles within the MR
environment.
With the benefit of hindsight, we acknowledge that the reviewer may be
correct in thinking that our spatial resolution was insufficient to capture
these differences. However, we would point out that the little information
that is currently available in the published literature suggests that this
was at least plausible. From the electrical stimulation studies of Hast et
al. (1974) in Macaques, we estimate a separation of approximately 5 mm
in the smaller brains of that species. The TMS study of Rödel et al. (2004)
observed differences on the order of 3 cm at the scalp, although, as we
have mentioned in the text, it is not possible to convert this to distance
on the cortical surface without further information. We would also note
that studies with either equal or worse spatial resolution than ours have
successfully used MVPA to decode small and adjacent muscles of the
hand. So, while we do not deny the possibility that our resolution was too
coarse to separate the representations of the CT and TA muscles, we
hope that the reviewer will agree that finding such a separation with the
spatial resolution of our study was not implausible.

What's the reason for choosing a liberal threshold? The LMC is localizable
with stringent thresholds.
Reply: We instructed participants to vocalize in a soft and controlled
manner (p.7) in an attempt to isolate the muscles most canonically
related to pitch control. This was also done to circumvent the tendency
to produce high pitches more loudly than low pitches, which risked
causing either respiratory or gross-movement differences between
pitch-levels. In light of the weaker than usual BOLD signal change that
we observed for phonation, we suspect that these precautions may
have reduced the signal level. Since the objective of our phonation>rest
contrast was not to test a hypothesis but to localize the LMC and then
test hypotheses within that area, we believe that the lower statistical
threshold was justified.
The need to perform the searchlight analysis should be better explained and
justified. Moreover, I'm skeptical the classifier can reach stable accuracy with
only 12 subjects. How many subjects/runs were included in each training and
data sets.
Reply: Thank you for the thoughtful comment. We attempted to analyze
the same data using the searchlight to see if differences in vocal pitches
could be instantiated by overlapping though differential patterns of
activity within a set of voxels in the larynx motor cortex. Although this
lack of significance could be due to the relatively small sample size, there
are several MVPA studies with comparable or even smaller sample sizes
(Y. S. Lee, Peelle, Kraemer, Lloyd, & Granger, 2015; Y.-S. Lee, Janata,
Frost, Hanke, & Granger, 2011; Y.-S. Lee, Turkeltaub, Granger, & Raizada,
2012; Raizada, Tsao, Liu, & Kuhl, 2010; Staeren, Renvall, De Martino,
Goebel, & Formisano, 2009). Moreover, our classification scheme was
not different from these other MPVA studies in that we employed leave-
one-run out for each fold of cross-validation. Although we fully
7
acknowledge that n=12 may not have been sufficient in our case, it is
conceivable that the difference in vocal pitch can be registered within
much smaller neural populations, i.e., the intra-voxel scale. Future
studies are warranted with higher-resolution imaging to revisit this
question.

Results
Please explain how you separate two peaks of LMC, which are only 3 mm
apart with 3-mm voxel size of acquired sequence.
Reply: As reported in Table 1, the group-level analysis showed that the
two peaks were separated by 8mm, 3mm, and 8mm in the x, y, and z
dimensions, respectively. This corresponds to a Euclidean distance of
6-7 voxels between cluster centroids. While this gap is small, it does
oblige us to report separate non-contiguous clusters.
Provide the activation maps that include all regions observed.
Reply: Figure 2 now shows each cluster reported in Table 1.
Explain the findings of Table 2 in the Results.
Reply: We now cover the contents of this table in the results section (p.
12).
8
Explain why the double peak, if it's real, is observed on the left side only.
Reply: We think that it would step too far beyond our data to make any
claims about differences between the two hemispheres. Although the
random effects analysis observed the doublet in the right hemisphere
only, we observed this doublet in the right hemisphere as well in half of
the participants.
The first sentence in section 4.4 is unclear. Perhaps the authors meant 'In
contrast' instead of 'Consistent'?
Reply: We have clarified this to “Consistent with the individual centroid
and magnitude of activation analyses…”. (p.13)
Discussion
It should be acknowledged up front that fMRI lacks high spatial resolution
compared to direct electrical stimulation studies in auditory cortex.
Reply: With all due respect to the reviewer, we do not entirely
understand his/her comment. We have endeavored to address it and
hope that the reviewer will kindly clarify further if we have missed the
mark.
We do of course agree that fMRI lacks the spatial resolution of electrical
stimulation studies in auditory cortex. We suspect that the reviewer has
made this comment because our introductory paragraph framed the
search for a pitch map in motor cortex as a corollary to the pitch map in
auditory cortex. As part of our attempt to shorten the introduction, this
part of the framing is reduced in the revised manuscript. Instead we
have streamlined the introduction to provide a clearer focus on the
muscles of vocal pitch control.
The authors should keep in mind and acknowledge as a limitation in the
paper that fMRI during different pitch production still activates all laryngeal
muscles (perhaps one more than the other) while TMS, especially navigation
controlled and EMG controlled, assure the activity of single muscles.
Reply: In addressing one of the reviewer’s later points, we have
highlighted this difficulty in using vocal pitch as a proxy for laryngeal
muscle activation, and call for further studies using electromyography.
(pp.19-20)
P 17, second paragraph, first sentence Without further evidence, this
sentence should be toned down. It would be also helpful to compare with
other studies that employed nasal behaviors. The statement that other
studies exclusively employed oral vocalizations is incorrect.
Reply: We have omitted the statement.
9
The section on the analogy from hand motor cortex is not supported by these
data and is purely speculative. I suggest merging some parts of this section
with the other sections, and removing the rest.
Reply: We have considerably reduced the length of this section so that
it now reviews studies that had positive findings using similar
methodologies, but targeting the limb muscles. We do think that it is
important to retain this section to highlight the plausibility of our
approach and to point out the possibility that the representation of the
laryngeal muscles that we sought to study may occur on a smaller
spatial scale. (p.17)
Similarly, the direct relevance of section 5.4 to the study is unclear. No
neuroanatomical work has been done here.
Reply: This section was not intended to make conclusions about
anatomy, but rather to draw on neuroanatomical knowledge to inform
the interpretation of the present data. Together with the subsequent
section (formerly section 5.5, now section 5.4.2), we attempt to point out
that the LMC controls many muscles and that several combinations of
these muscles can produce the same vocal pitch. Together, these
observations create obstacles to addressing our research question. As
the reviewer points out above, electromyography will be an important
future step to partially overcome these difficulties.
We have restructured this part of the introduction to first point out
these paired obstacles (section 5.4), then to discuss each in turn
(sections 5.4.1 & 5.4.2; pp.18-19).
Explain better the relevance of a songbird sentence p 21. They have a very
different both anatomically and functionally vocal apparatus, which is not
comparable with human larynx.
Reply: In light of the reviewer’s earlier suggestion to shorten the
manuscript, we have chosen to remove this source rather than to
expand and justify it.
Limb muscles are much larger than larynx muscles; limb representations in
the motor cortex are much larger than LMC. Hence the last sentence should
be of Limitations deleted.
Reply: This sentence has been deleted.

Comments to the Author:
Your revised manuscript was sent to Reviewer 2, who still had concerns requiring
revision. The main issues relate to (1) the generality of claims, given the use of
trained singers, and (2) statistical analyses, particularly the use of liberal
thresholding. In addition to addressing these issues, please resubmit the data
originally included as electronic supplementary material, as the reviewer may not be
able to access the original files with the revision.
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
This is a revised version of the paper by Belyk et al where the authors examined the
role of the laryngeal motor cortex - LMC - in the control of pitch during singing in
professionally trained singers. Based on the previous comments, the study is now
much clearly presented, however, there are still several issues remaining.
Authors' response
- In my previous review, the point about the title revision was to specify that the pitch
control was studied in singers, not during singing. It is an important distinction
because you have selected a very narrow and highly vocally trained group of people,
whose laryngeal motor control may be significantly enhanced compared to normal
population. It is misleading to not include 'singers' in the title.
Reply: We have added “in singers” to the title.
- Please note that TA and CT muscles have been mapped in a few studies using
TMS and vocal/orofacial muscles have been mapped with direct electrical stimulation
in another set of studies, also in humans. I'm not aware of specific published studies
that targeted but explicitly failed to map pitch. This studies may have simply not been
conducted yet. Thus, this paragraph on p 6 needs further revisions to state accurately
what was done and what was not, to date. If you used fMRI to map pitch in the LMC,
that's great but other literature should also be cited properly. Also, I still doubt the
resolution of fMRI for detecting separate and relatively tiny laryngeal muscles without
substantiating the results with concurrent EMG.
Reply: We now briefly discuss a wider selection of TMS studies, with a focus
on Khedr et al. (2002) contradicting the findings of the Rödel study (p.4, lines
41-55).
-The fact that trained choral singers were used in the study should be stated up front
in the Introduction and not tucked in the limitation at the end of the manuscript.
Reply: This statement can be found in the Introduction (p.5, line 48), Methods
section (p.6, line 37), and Discussion (p.14 line 36, p.18 line 18).
- Regarding the choice of a liberal threshold, I disagree with the authors' explanation
that they were not testing a hypothesis but just localizing a region with their liberal
threshold. It is even more important to use stringent safeguards in localizing the
region, especially the separate muscle they claim to have identified. How should the
reader trust your findings when your voxelwise statistics is so relaxed and doesn't
adhere to established standards? How this would impact the reproducibility of your
findings?
- The same point above is directly relevant to separating clusters, with the threshold
not properly set.
Reply: We now take the more principled approach of applying permutation-
based cluster-wise thresholding for all contrasts (p.10, line 28-37).
- Information about the double peaks should be expanded. The authors argued that it
is beyond the data but it's not a valid point. Double peaks are important because they
are in the area you focus on, yet the reader does not get any specific explanations of
their significance.
Reply: In our updated analysis, the omnibus phonation>rest contrast no longer
reveals this doublet though it is still observed at some pitch levels. We have
retained our analyses that explore these two peaks by looking for variation in
the position of the peaks (figure 3) and magnitudes of activation at each peak
(figure 4) to determine whether this doublet is related to our vocal-pitch
hypotheses. Neither analysis demonstrated a relationship between these peaks
and vocal-pitch. Since this doublet is not observed in the random effects
analysis and does not show evidence of being related to our hypotheses, we
hope that the reviewer will agree that readers would not benefit from further
speculation.
- To clarify my previous comment, fMRI lacks the resolution, both spatial and
temporal, of direct brain stimulation and recordings during open brain surgery. So
when making analogies and comparisons with stimulation studies, this disadvantage
of fMRI should be acknowledged.
Reply: We now point to these advantages of neurostimulation in our call for
further research (p.18, line 39)
Manuscript
- p. 4, line 41, sentence starting with Hence,... is a repetition of the previous.
Reply: We have deleted this sentence and instead clarify our claim that these
differences between species highlight a need for research in humans (p.4, line
41).
- p. 4 Consider including other TMS studies of LMC, not only Rodel's
Reply: We now discuss several other TMS studies of the LMC in this section
(p.4, lines 41-55).
- p. 5 - As I mentioned earlier, your selected cohort of trained singers may have a
very different and expanded LMC representation. The fact that other fMRI studies did
not separate LMC muscles may simply depend on the cohorts studied. This needs to
be included as one of the possibilities. In other words, decoupling vocal-pitch
production from vertical movements of the larynx is not a simple task typically used
by untrained singers.
Reply: We state that participants were chorally-trained singers in the final
paragraph of the Introduction. “We examined trained choral singers who were
able to decouple vocal-pitch production from vertical movements of the
larynx.” (p.5, line 47)
- p. 10 - Again, application of such liberal thresholds has led to negativity and distrust
of fMRI findings, lately highlighted in press. Why should I believe your uncorrected
findings? What are your corrected results? How can I be sure that your two tiny
clusters are not false positive? How the threshold of k>25 was chosen?
Reply: We now take a more principled approach by applying permutation-
based cluster-wise thresholding (p.10, lines 28-37). This has had the effect of
raising our cluster-size thresholds from the arbitrary k>25 that we previously
applied to k>39 to 47, depending on the contrast. Computed cluster-size
thresholds are reported in table legends. Notable changes to the results are:
1) The broad phonation> rest contrast no longer shows two separate M1 peaks
(Table 1), although in some contrasts of individual pitches > rest, the two
peaks are still observed as before (Table 2).
This separation is no longer highlighted in Figure 2, where the phonation > rest
contrast is shown. Since the second peak does still appear at some pitch-
levels, we hope that the reviewer will agree that it is still necessary for us to
describe the spatial distribution of these peaks (Figure 3) in order to assess
their separability, and to describe their level of activation at different pitch-
levels (Figure 4) to assess their association with different pitch-levels. These
analyses continue to show an absence of evidence for a greater association of
either peak with any pitch-level.
In light of the reduced focus on the two peaks based on the change to Figure 2
and based on the reviewer’s concerns about the length of the Discussion, the
section speculating on the possible roles of the two peaks has been
considerably reduced (section 5.1) in favour of preserving sections that
discuss the factors that may obscure any relationship between pitch and the
LMC, if one exists, and that future studies would need to overcome.
2) Some smaller clusters outside of M1 with little bearing on our hypothesis are
no longer significant and are no longer reported in Table 2.
- As I stated earlier, the Discussion should be more concise and to the point. It is too
long and spread out in its current form.
Reply: We have reduced the length of the Discussion by two pages.
