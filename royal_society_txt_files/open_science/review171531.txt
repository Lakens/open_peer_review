In the paper by Dmitri V. Alexandrov, Irina A. Bashkirtseva and Lev B. Ryashko, named “Noise-
induced transitions and shifts in a climate-vegetation feedback model”, the stochastic variability
of a simple climate-vegetation system is studied. The authors are examining the deterministic
dynamics, when the system has one stable equilibrium and limit cycle or two stable equilibria
corresponding to two opposite (cold and warm) climate-vegetation states and show that the
phenomenon of climate-vegetation system fluctuation occurs in some critical range of noise
intensities. They consider a simple climate-vegetation model consisting of a land surface covered
by some vegetation and ocean. The temperature changes induce the growth of vegetation and
alter the Earth’s surface albedo, which in turn modifies the energy balance and, thus, induces the
temperature changes. The article is written, using good language, well-illustrated and its results
essentially contribute in climate dynamics studies, in particular regarding to substantial climate
changes, e.g. the fact that the climate-vegetation system undergoes a noise-induced shift into the
range of smaller global average temperatures where it fluctuates with a broad range of possible
land fractions covered by vegetation. I would suggest the paper to be published „as it is“.

This is a very interesting, high level and useful modeling paper about the teoretical approach of
climate-ecosystem feedbacks. The main text basically is sufficiently comprehensive and critical,
but the introduction and discussion part are very short. I strongly suggest to complete them. I
suggest a much deeper discussion of your results based on comparison with international
literature.

Review on
D.V. Alexandrov, I.A. bashkirtseva, and L.B. Ryashko,
“Noise-induced transitions and shifts
in a climate-vegetation feedback model”
submitted to Royal Society Open Science, Oct 2017
Manuscript ID: RSOS-171531.
February 1, 2018
The submitted paper further investigates a two dimensional ODE model invented and
analyzed by Rombouts and Ghil (2015) that mimicks the coupled global climate-seaice-
vegetation dynamics. The new aspect is the analysis of system behaviour for added
noise.
The paper should be rejected for the following reasons:
1) The addition of noise is a really minor thing since it is pretty clear from the
bifurcation structure what will happen when noise is added. And indeed, the authours
find what could be expected, namely that when starting simulations from a state in the
basin of attraction of the attractor with non-zero vegetation cover, the system fluctuates
for small noise around that attractor, while for large noise it can reach the ”snowball
Earth” attractor. That in this latter case the temperature drops (pointed out as a major
result by the authors!) is trivial.
2) It is not made clear why the model should be analyzed with added noise. Moreover,
it is not made clear why the noise is added to the growth rate of vegetation (and not e.g.
to the temperature variable). I find it very counter-intuitive that in this way climate (as
represented by temperature) fluctuates only because vegetation growth fluctuates.
3) Without reading Rombouts and Ghil (2015), large parts of the paper are not un-
derstandable because basic information on the solutions structure of the model is missing.
E.g. only after reading Rombouts and Ghil (2015) I realized that Fig. 1 shows transients
starting from initial conditions close to the separatrix of the two attractors – neither this
is explained in the paper nor why these particular intial conditions have been chosen.
The same is the case for Figs. 4 and 5: Since these Figs. are claimed to contain the main
results of the paper, the dependence of these results on particular initial conditions is a
major lack of transparency in this paper. Why not starting simulations in the basin of
attraction of the ’snowball Earth attractor’ ?
4) I am pretty sure that part of the results presented in Figs. 3, 4 and 5 are an artefact
of the numerics: In the simulation results presented, for sufficienly large noise the system
gets trapped in a state without vegetation (i.e. vegetation fraction A is getting zero). That
A remains zero once it got zero is no surprise because the system is constructed such that
even the noise cannot bring the system out of the state A=0. But that numerically,
1
when starting with a non-zero A value, from some time on the system stays to be zero
is very probably an artefact of the numerics: I guess that the trapping at A=0 happens
when A gets smaller than the numerical accuracy of the calculations. Considering the
real solutions of the ODE system, starting from a non-zero value of A this A can never
get zero: In the absence of noise it needs infinite time for the exponential shrinking of A
to reach A=0, so that in the presence of noise there must be always periods of growth
that keep A positive in the limit of t to infinity.
5) Noting that the considered Rombouts and Ghil model is rather conceptual, and in
view of the rather minor scientific advance presented in this paper, it is really inappropri-
ate to advise the whole research community that ”climate-vegetation interactions .. must
be taken into account in more precise and more complex models of climate variability”
(see last sentence Abstract and last sentence Conclusions).
6) Finally, I find it rather annoying that the authors do not give due credit to Rom-
bouts and Ghil who invented and thoroughly analyzed this model. The authors properly
refer to Rombouts and Ghil (2015) when introducing the model, but do not summarize
their results on the system behaviour. In this way they leave the impression to the reader
that the presented results reveal new insight not only for the new noisy variant of the
model, but also for the original deterministic model. In the ’conclusion’ section, lines
29-37, they even claim basic results of Rombouts and Ghil (2015) explicitely as their own
new insights! This unethical behaviour cannot be tolerated.

Dear Editors and Reviewers, please find below our answers to comments.

1) The addition of noise is a really minor thing since it is pretty clear from the bifurcation
structure what will happen when noise is added. And indeed, the authours find what could be
expected, namely that when starting simulations from a state in the basin of attraction of the
attractor with non-zero vegetation cover, the system fluctuates for small noise around that
attractor, while for large noise it can reach the "snowball Earth" attractor. That in this latter
case the temperature drops (pointed out as a major result by the authors!) is trivial.
A demonstration of the phenomenon of the noise-induced transformation from
“non-zero vegetation cover” to "snowball Earth" is not the only and major result of
our paper as the reviewer claims. In our paper, we analyze how this transformation
which occurs under small noise is connected with the peculiarities of the
deterministic phase portrait. Note that it is impossible to see this mechanism from
the bifurcation structure as the reviewer states. Moreover, a new unexpected
phenomenon of the noise-induced shift of the probabilistic distribution shown in
figure 5 went unnoticed by the reviewer.
2) It is not made clear why the model should be analyzed with added noise. Moreover, it is not
made clear why the noise is added to the growth rate of vegetation (and not e.g. to the
temperature variable). I find it very counter-intuitive that in this way climate (as represented by
temperature) fluctuates only because vegetation growth fluctuates.
Of course, one can consider climate changes under the influence of noise on other
system parameters. Here, we intentionally restricted to the non-trivial case where
the fluctuations of biological parameter (vegetation growth) result in the climate
shifts. By this we would like to emphasize the importance of the interplay of the
climate shifts and vegetation.
3) Without reading Rombouts and Ghil (2015), large parts of the paper are not understandable
because basic information on the solutions structure of the model is missing. E.g. only after
reading Rombouts and Ghil (2015) I realized that Fig. 1 shows transients starting from initial
conditions close to the separatrix of the two attractors - neither this is explained in the paper nor
why these particular initial conditions have been chosen. The same is the case for Figs. 4 and 5:
Since these Figs. are claimed to contain the main results of the paper, the dependence of these
results on particular initial conditions is a major lack of transparency in this paper. Why not
starting simulations in the basin of attraction of the 'snowball Earth attractor'?
We have added at the beginning of the Section 3:
“A bifurcation analysis of the deterministic climate-vegetation model (2.1)-(2.5)
was carried out in Rombouts and Ghil (2015). The important details of the phase
portraits for this nonlinear feedback model are demonstrated in figure 1.”
We also added the explanation why we show trajectories starting from initial
conditions close to the separatrix of the two attractors:
“An interesting feature of the deterministic system is its behavior near the
separatrix dividing basins of attraction of "warm" and "cold" attractors. As can be
seen from figure 1, the trajectories starting near the separatrix move along it for
some time before approaching the attractors.”
4) I am pretty sure that part of the results presented in Figs. 3, 4 and 5 are an artefact
of the numerics: In the simulation results presented, for sufficienly large noise the system
gets trapped in a state without vegetation (i.e. vegetation fraction A is getting zero). That
A remains zero once it got zero is no surprise because the system is constructed such that
even the noise cannot bring the system out of the state A=0. But that numerically,
when starting with a non-zero A value, from some time on the system stays to be zero
is very probably an artefact of the numerics: I guess that the trapping at A=0 happens
when A gets smaller than the numerical accuracy of the calculations. Considering the
real solutions of the ODE system, starting from a non-zero value of A this A can never
get zero: In the absence of noise it needs in finite time for the exponential shrinking of A
to reach A=0, so that in the presence of noise there must be always periods of growth
that keep A positive in the limit of t to infinity.
The noise-induced transition to the snowball Earth attractor does not mean that
A=0 in finite time. Indeed, A exponentially tends to zero. To avoid
misunderstanding, we have changed:
“The level of vegetation cover A in the course of this transition tends to zero as is
demonstrated in the lower panel of figure 3.”
“If the noise intensity exceeds this interval, the climate-vegetation system
inevitably tends to the Earth's snowball state.”
5) Noting that the considered Rombouts and Ghil model is rather conceptual, and in
view of the rather minor scientific advance presented in this paper, it is really inappropriate to
advise the whole research community that "climate-vegetation interactions .. must
be taken into account in more precise and more complex models of climate variability"
(see last sentence Abstract and last sentence Conclusions).
The last sentences in Abstract and Conclusion are corrected: “must” is replaced by
“should”. These sentences represent our viewpoint and conclusions.
6) Finally, I find it rather annoying that the authors do not give due credit to Rom-
bouts and Ghil who invented and thoroughly analyzed this model. The authors properly
refer to Rombouts and Ghil (2015) when introducing the model, but do not summarize
their results on the system behaviour. In this way they leave the impression to the reader
that the presented results reveal new insight not only for the new noisy variant of the
model, but also for the original deterministic model. In the 'conclusion' section, lines
29-37, they even claim basic results of Rombouts and Ghil (2015) explicitely as their own
new insights! This unethical behaviour cannot be tolerated.
In the lines 29-37, we have written:
“Note that deterministic phase trajectories going to two opposite climate-
vegetation states can be located very close to each other. As a result, even small
external stochastic forcing can throw the system across the separatrix, and two
opposite stable climate-vegetation states (having the warm and cold climate)
become stochastically interconnected. What is more, this transition between system
attractors becomes steeper when the vegetation death rate increases. In addition,
increasing this rate gives the greater noise intensities leading to the snowball state.
An important outcome of our stochastic analysis lies in the fact that the climate-
vegetation system undergoes a noise-induced shift into the range of smaller global
average temperatures where it fluctuates with a broad range of possible land
fractions covered by vegetation.”
This text deals with resume of our paper devoted to stochastic effects. In
[Rombouts and Ghil (2015)], there is no any stochastic content. We considered
this conceptual model as the deterministic skeleton in our stochastic studies, and
cited it accordingly to commonly used standards.
As reviewer requires, we have added one more citation of the Rombouts and Ghil
(2015) to Conclusion:
“Let us summarize below the main features of the initial deterministic climate-
vegetation model [35].”
