1. Though it is a valid reference (Di Menna ME. 1966 Yeasts in Antarctic soil. Antonie van
Leeuwenhoek 32, 29–38;(doi: 10.1007/BF02097443).), it is not current, methodologies have
significantly advanced that were not available 60 years ago when the paper was published, and
therefore, it is not a good reference to support the statement "However, basidiomycetous yeasts
have been widely reported to represent the dominant fungi in polar regions". In a revision,
suggest the sentence to be rewritten to the effect that 'basidiomycetes were initially reported in
early papers' and then the present sentence could be referenced to references 14 and 15.
2. The sentence "These reports suggest that Mrakia spp. are
the dominant culturable fungi in Antarctica and are well-adapted to the continental
Antarctic environment." does not take into account research from Blanchette et al. and Pointing's
group which has not cultured Mrakia spp. Broader referencing and mitigation of the sentence is
appropriate. Also, more substantiation is needed for page 15, for the sentence "and is the most
common genus in the continental Antarctic region."
3. The acronym CE-TOFMS is never defined in the manuscript and should be defined at its use in
the Introduction, page 4.
4. The manuscript/study would be strengthened considerably if the author offered an
explanation for the differing biochemical properties of the two strains, of which this is the second
concerning publication e.g. "However, I previously
reported that both strains exhibit distinct glucose-consumption characteristics and
cell-growth abilities under low-temperature conditions [27]. Here, SK-4 and TKG1-2
were monitored for these two abilities under subzero conditions and then examined for
their cellular metabolite responses."

Dear Author,
This manuscript is probably first report of metabolic response of Antarctic basidiomyceous yeast
and has important scientific impact for Polar biology and mycology. However, I did not
recommend this version of manuscript published in this journal. Because, I think that this
manuscript has several weak points.
1. Author suggested that Mrakia spp were the dominate culturable fungi in Antarctica (p.
4), however, there is no reason why author chose this species of Mrakia blollopis in your study.
2. Author compared metabolic responses of M. blollopis at -3 and 10C. Probably I think
that 10C is optimal thermal cell growth temperature of M. blollopis. However, I did not
understand that -3C was cold stress condition for M. blollopis. How author decide the cold stress
temperature for M. blollopis ? Physiological or ecological ?
3. Figure 1 included that cell growth of two strains of M. blollopis at -3 and 10C. Author
compared metabolic response of M. blollopis under initial to full cell growth. I think that some of
cells were destroyed for 72-120 hrs. I recommend that author check living cell numbers during
the cultivation periods and recalculate metabolic response based on living cell numbers.

Response to Reviewer
Dear Editor May 25, 2016
Royal Society Open Science
Thank you very much for your email of May 18, 2015, with regard to my manuscript,
“Cold-stress responses in the Antarctic basidiomycetous yeast Mrakia blollopis”, and the
valuable advice of the two reviewers. I attach here my new revised manuscript, as well as a
point-by-point response to the reviewers’ comments.
Reviewer#1
We wish to express our appreciation to the reviewers for their insightful comments on our
paper.
1. According to Reviewer’s comment, the sentence has been changed as suggested.
“Basidiomycetes were initially reported in early papers [13] and basidiomycetous yeasts have
been widely reported to represent the dominant fungi in polar regions [14-15],”
2. We appreciate the reviewer's concerns on this point and I thought that that is probably a
little exaggeration. Therefore, the sentence has been modified:
“My reports suggest that Mrakia spp. are the dominant culturable fungi near Syowa station, East
Antarctica. Among this genus, Mrakia blollopis is the most frequently isolated species from the
region and is well adapted to the environment”.
3. Accordingly, we have added an official name of CE-TOFMS in the new text.
4. In accordance with the Reviewer’s comment, I have added one my publication as the
reference.
Reviewer#2
We wish to express our appreciation to the reviewers for their insightful comments on my
paper. The comments have helped us significantly improve the paper.
1. In accordance with the reviewer 1 and 2 comment, I have changed the sentence
following:
Antarctica. Among of this genus, Mrakia blollopis is a most frequently isolated from the
region and are well-adapted to the environment.”
2. -3 °C is a lowest temperature to maintain unfrozen condition of YPD liquid medium without
additional of anti-freezing agent such as glycerol. Therefore, I choose this temperature to
determine cold stress response of M. blollopis.
3. I have never seen metabolic response calculated by living cell number in any article. But, I
agree with reviewer's comment that some of cells were destroyed for 72-120 hrs and it is
necessary that metabolic concentration calculated by living cell number.
Regrettably, however, because of did not measure the living cell number of two strains, I am
unable to recalculate the metabolic response.
In the future, I will study more detail cold stress response of Antarctic fungi. In that case, I will
check living cell number and would like to completely elucidate cold stress response of the fungi
under subzero condition in accordance with your suggestion.
I believe the manuscript has been improved satisfactorily and hope it will be accepted for
publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Best regards
Sincerely yours,
