The manuscript (RSOS-170943) describes the fluorescent methods for the determination of
atomoxetine (ATM) and fluvoxamine (FXM), utilizing the native fluorescence quenching of eosin
3
Y due to the formation of binary complex. The manuscript is not prepared with typos and
grammar errors.
Major points:
Page 5 Lines 32-37 and Page 12 Figure 5: The Job’s results could not be corrected, e.g., the molar
ratios of between eosin Y to ATO and FXM were 1:1 and 2:1, respectively. It should be using the
same molar concentrations of the two drugs instead of mass concentrations.
Page 28 Table 4: The result of the proposed methods should be compared those of the same batch
products by standard accepted methods, or just compared the labelled values.
It would be easier to understand the optimal conditions by using the concentrations of buffers
and eosin Y instead of the solution volumes.

The original research article by Derayea et al. describes a novel spectrofluorimetric for assessment
of concentrations of drugs atomoxetine and fluvoxaminein. The manuscript is concise, and the
authors provide sufficient information regarding the methods and results. The manuscript is well

suited for the journal, however, there are certain corrections that need to be made before
publication.
There are minor grammatical errors and typos that need to be reviewed and corrected.

Major points:
Page 7 Lines 9-19 and Lines 21-3): As described in the two paragraph of FXM and ATO dosage
sample preparations, the final concentrations of the two drugs were 0.5 mg/mL (500 µg/mL),
which beyond the linear calibration ranges (0.2 or 0.3 to 2.2 µg/mL). In additional, the buffer
solution was used in the standard solution preparations of FXM and ATO, but was not used in
the drug dosage form sample preparation. Please make an explanation.
It would be easier for readers to understand the optimal conditions by using the concentrations of
buffers and eosin Y instead of the volumes of these solutions. For examples, as shown in Figure 4,
it is hard for readers to know the working buffer concentration ranges without knowing the
initial buffer concentration and final preparation volume and then making calculations. Similarly,
in Fig. 5, the initial concentration of eosin Y is provided, but readers also need to find the final
preparation volume in the method section. The authors could provide discussion and plots to
clearly show the optimized concentrations.

The appropriate citations were inserted.
4. Page 5, line 50: in the subtitle "Linearity range" should be inserted instead of
"Linearity and range".

5. Page 6, Sensitivity: this subtitle is not correct. The sensitivity of a method is
the gradient of the calibration function, and generally it is not used in
validation. This subtitle should be changed into "Limits of detection and

The unites were inserted in both figures
Besides, the manuscript contains many grammatical and stylistic language
errors, so a review for language is highly recommended.
The manuscript was re-checked for grammatical errors and typos and the
suitable corrections were made and marked with red color within the text.

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript (RSOS-170943) describes the fluorescent methods for the
determination of atomoxetine (ATM) and fluvoxamine (FXM), utilizing the
native fluorescence quenching of eosin Y due to the formation of binary
complex. The manuscript is not prepared with typos and grammar errors.
Major points:
Page 5 Lines 32-37 and Page 12 Figure 5: The Job’s results could not be
corrected, e.g., the molar ratios of between eosin Y to ATO and FXM were 1:1
and 2:1, respectively. It should be using the same molar concentrations of the
two drugs instead of mass concentrations.
The molar ratio was studied again and the old figure is replaced by the new one
(Fig. 6). The final ratio was 1:1 for both drugs. Details about the construction
of Job`s plots were added and the mechanism of the ion pair formation is
explained. A new figure (Fig. 7) is inserted which shows the chemical
composition of the formed complex.
Page 28 Table 4: The result of the proposed methods should be compared those
of the same batch products by standard accepted methods, or just compared the
labelled values.
The results were compared with the labeled value (1.2 µg ml-1 for both drugs)
It would be easier to understand the optimal conditions by using the
concentrations of buffers and eosin Y instead of the solution volumes.
From the practically point of view, we think that, it is easier to prepare a single
reagent solution having a fixed concentration then different volumes of the
reagent solution were used in the assay. This will give However, the volume
could be easily converted to concentration.

Comments to the Author(s)
The original research article by Derayea et al. describes a novel
spectrofluorimetric for assessment of concentrations of drugs atomoxetine and
fluvoxaminein. The manuscript is concise, and the authors provide sufficient
information regarding the methods and results. The manuscript is well suited
for the journal, however, there are certain corrections that need to be made
before publication.
There are minor grammatical errors and typos that need to be reviewed and
corrected. Additionally, it may be important to comment on how this novel
analytical method compares with current analytical method for determination
of drug concentration/state-of-the-art.
The manuscript was re-checked for grammatical errors and typos and the
suitable corrections were made and marked with red color within the text.
The comparison was extended to other reported spectrofluorimetric methods.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors responded most of the review’s comments, but not all of them. Besides,
there are still some questions and concerns besides grammar errors and typos.
Major points:
Page 7 Lines 9-19 and Lines 21-3): As described in the two paragraph of FXM and
ATO dosage sample preparations, the final concentrations of the two drugs were 0.5
mg/mL (500 µg/mL), which beyond the linear calibration ranges (0.2 or 0.3 to 2.2
µg/mL).
Reply:
The concentration of the filtrate was 500 µg/mL and it was further diluted with water
to give the required concentration as mentioned in "Preparation of standard solutions"
and "Analysis of dosage forms"
In additional, the buffer solution was used in the standard solution preparations of
FXM and ATO, but was not used in the drug dosage form sample preparation. Please
make an explanation.
Reply:
Both the standard and sample solutions were prepared in distilled water alone but not
in buffer solution. The buffer solutions was mixed with the reagent and the drug
solutions (standard or sample) in the general analytical procedure.
It would be easier for readers to understand the optimal conditions by using the
concentrations of buffers and eosin Y instead of the volumes of these solutions. For
examples, as shown in Figure 4, it is hard for readers to know the working buffer
concentration ranges without knowing the initial buffer concentration and final
preparation volume and then making calculations. Similarly, in Fig. 5, the initial
concentration of eosin Y is provided, but readers also need to find the final
preparation volume in the method section. The authors could provide discussion and
plots to clearly show the optimized concentrations.
Reply:
The volume of the reagent and buffer were converted to its corresponding
concentration in the figures (4 and 5) and inside the manuscript.

The results of the proposed methods for the analysis of each pharmaceutical
formulation (Atomox APEX capsules and Faverin® tablets ) were compared with those
of the reported method reference 9 for fluvoxamine and reference 10 for atomoxetine.
In addition, the results were compared to the labeled claimed values

[The word " Sensitive " was changed to " The sensitive ", However, " method was "
could not be changed to "methods were " because only one method was developed.
Although there is a small variation in the method parameters for each drug it is very
little and therefore could not be considered as two methods.]
