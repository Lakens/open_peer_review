In this paper the authors develop a game theoretical model of ebola transmission, where
individuals choose whether to be vaccinated strategically, based upon an existing non-game
theoretical model. This is a good idea for a paper, and the authors have developed the model in a
sensible way to focus on the core issues; when is it optimal to vaccinate, and can optimal
vaccination choice lead to eradication of the disease?
The authors find that the optimal vaccination rate almost achieves the herd immunity level, due
to the high costs of catching the disease, in contrast to other infections. This makes perfect sense,
and is an encouraging result for the fight against the disease.
I generally like the paper, but have a number of points that I would like the authors to address,
given roughly in the order that they appear in the paper.
1) Page 4 lines 123-129 Would it be not better to allow for a lower probability of being effective
here, and so some (lower) disease transmission rate out of the V class, rather than make it
impossible? Could the authors comment on this.
2) On page 5 the authors presume reinfection is not possible. It should be noted that recurrence of
the disease is possible without reinfection, and so apparently healthy individuals who have had
ebola can develop it again. This may not have significant consequences for the model, but should
perhaps be mentioned.
3) In equation (2) and Figure 1, we have movement from class I to each of D and R both given as
gamma, because the ebola death rate is around 0.5. This is reasonable, but would it not be better
to give a more general solution with the possibility of different values here (or will this greatly
complicate the existing solutions)?
4) I would like to see some more working relating to some of the equations. I do not doubt the
correctness of the authors' solutions, but some indiciation of how they were reached would be
useful. In particular:
equation (4), I from equation (5), N from equation (5) (also there is no differential equation in the
paper given to show how to find N), equation (16).
5) The model assumes an effectively infinite population size here. Can the authors comment on
this, and potential finite population effects? Ebola cases tend to be relatively small in number, so
this may be significant.
Similarly the solutions are given as if the population is in steady state, whereas in reality ebola
occurs in outbreaks, and so the number of cases fluctuates a lot, as the authors make clear (this is
a common feature of many epidemic models, and is not a particular criticism of the current one).
The authors discuss the related issue of spatial factors in the Discussion.
The authors should discuss the potential differences either of these effects would have on their
model (they briefly raise the former in the Discussion).
6) In the model, can individuals be vaccinated again? In Figure 1 it looks like they can, since the
rates do not depend upon how many times a state has been visited. However, from equation (10)
it seems that they cannot, as the first term is just the probability that the next move from V is to S;
if S could then go back to V, then the overal pi probability would be less. This may be a matter of
presentation, or alternatively a reasonable approximation, but the authoors should justify it.
Under some circumstances, it would be beneficial to be vaccinated a second time, if it was still
effective (of course individuals may then need to know that their previous immunity had worn
off).
7) On page 13 and elsewhere the authors say that with the addition of additional educational
3
measures ebola could be eradicated. This seems potentially true, although a lot of the text in the
Introduction indicates that it will still be hard to overcome important cultural factors.
8) This is a very well-written paper, with few grammatical issues or typos. There a small number
of issues of presentation/ minor explanations, as well as the above.
a) Page 3 lines 79/80 the text does not flow very well here; can you link the paragraphs better?
b) Figue 1 caption - there should be more detail here. Figure captions should give enough detail
to make them understandable as a stand-alone item.
c) In Figure 3 caption line 5, it says ``C=0 (shown for the xi=4 graph)''. I do not follow what is
shown. This statement is repeated twice later in the figure where it is clear what is being shown,
but I do not understand it at this first mention.
d) Thue authors give two parameter values in their Table 2 which they assume; they justify w but
not mu (in fact this is very reasonable, but they should give a line in the text).
e) Page 10 lines 239-240 Please give a little more explanation on what the LHS method is
f) Finally, some small points:
abstract line 1 with an extremely
page 3 line 73/74 tenses are inconsistent
page 4 line 106 i.e., an extremely
line 128 immunity wanes
page 13 line 341 Firstly
line 352 Secondly
line 372 where
In the four of the last five references there are a number of entries with different fonts. I guess this
was done to make the web addresses more clear, but it does not look nice to me.
In summary, this is a good paper with a few issues that need to be addressed.

Associate Editor Comments to Author:
I fully agree with the referee in terms of the merits of this manuscript, and I will be happy to
consider a revised manuscript that follows up on the comments. In terms of related research at
the interface of vaccination of applied mathematics and statistical physics, I would like to note a
recent review titled Statistical physics of vaccination, Z. Wang et al., Physics Reports 664, 1-113
(2016), which I am sure would be of interest to the readers.
