A very interesting paper that represents a second important contribution to the evolution of
dentitions in Osteichthyes. Thanks to the work of Chen et al., we have a hugely improved
understanding of the evolution of teeth and resorption in stem-osteichthyans. I have some
comments and questions on the annotated manuscript, and I think the descriptive parts could be
revised, as they appear repetitive. (Appendix A.)
My main question concerns the identity of the tooth pads. They do seem very similar to those
covering the branchial arches, as the authors note. I think they need to strengthen their
arguments as to why the Lophosteus tooth pads are not part of the branchial arch dentition. For
example, they say these tooth pads are part of the inner marginal dentition, but these bones are
mostly flat, rather than concave? The strongest argument seems to be that teeth on the
Lophosteus tooth pad are organized into linear rows- can the authors provide a broader survey of
osteichthyans to show conclusively that this organization does not occur in the osteichthyan
branchial dentition? The references they provide are minimal- nothing by Anne Huysseune for
example. The bottom line is that to me, these tooth pads 'feel' very branchial.

This is a thorough description of toothed elements from Lophosteus of a late Silurian deposit in
Estonia, based on advanced imaging technology.
The main objective was to (1) infer the anatomical identity of these elements, and (2) to deduce
the way how the tooth files originate and are replaced. I much appreciate the schematic that
summarizes the establishment of the first dentition and the ensuing replacement of the teeth.

I have no major remarks, rather a number of smaller remarks that I would like the authors to
consider so as to improve the readability of the manuscript.
Results
One set of remarks pertains to the Results (description and associated figures) as detailed below:
several passages in the description are indeed not well understandable and should be rewritten.
It would also be helpful if the features that are described are explicitly indicated on the figures
(e.g. with arrows). The nanoscale annotations on Figures 3 and 4 are not helpful as those cannot
possibly be read (I could not even see them at first). Larger annotations should be provided at
any event.
- Page 3 “Dentine and bone can easily be distinguished” and “dentine tubule and fibre traces are
all clearly visible”: not with the magnifications and contrast provided. For example, on Fig 2j,
how to distinguish embedded dentine from bone? Please provide a detail at higher magnification.
- Page 4, section 3.1. “We believe that the tooth cushions represent….regionalization within this
arcade”: this is elaborated on in the Discussion – please remove.
- Page 5, section 3.2, second paragraph: “… including the space between…”: this is not
understandable; please indicate specifically on the figures. Also show a larger magnification of
the osteocyte lacunae.
- The term “semi-basal resorption” should be explained the first time it is used in the text.
- Page 5, section 3.2, third paragraph: provide a detail of the dentine/bone of attachment; the
grading between the two is unexpected and worth further discussion. In teleosts, e.g., even in
cases with no distinction between the odontogenic and osteogenic population of cells in the
dental papilla, there is still a very sharp boundary between both tissues.
- Page 6, section 3.3: In general this section is difficult to understand if not more indications on the
figures are provided. In particular:
1st par.: “There are at least two more layers of these radial basal canals…”: not understandable,
please indicate on figure
3rd par. “two separate sets of deep canals”: please indicate on figure
4th par.: “from a higher level if the pulp cavity”: in the pulp cavity?
“The superficial canals closely parallel the surface…..in a stack.”: please indicate on
figure
“Vasculature of the epithelium”: an epithelium is by default not vascularized.
5th par: “a neck is formed…”: indicate more clearly on the figure
“the column of the oldest and youngest pulp cavities…”: indicate more explicitly on the
figure
6th par.: “This creates a ring of openings..”: are these the same as described at the beginning of
the 4th par? If so, please remove and/or simplify
- Page 8: “in one go”: replace
- The term “root” is not commonly used for non-tetrapod teeth
- Page 8, 3rd par. “resorptive based”: does this indicate a process or an anatomical feature? Better
replace.
- Page 8: “The position of the new tooth usually deviates from its resorption base”: the resorption
base of the predecessor tooth? A new tooth cannot yet have a resorption base?!
- Page 8 line 8 from bottom: even with annotations and color codes, this is not understandable.
Please indicate with arrows on the figure.
Discussion
The second set of remarks pertains to the Discussion. While I have very much appreciated the
careful analysis to arrive at the conclusion that the tooth cushions must represent elements of the
inner dental arcade, I am less convinced about the rejection of a permanent dental lamina.
Although I am not a priori against the idea of an absence of a permanent dental lamina, I do not
see how the arguments listed can be used in favour of such a conclusion. Replacement “in situ” in
my view does not exclude the presence of a dental lamina (it is a question of position); neither
4
does the simultaneous initiation of teeth of different generations exclude a permanent dental
lamina (for example in modern chondrichthyans, the youngest tooth of adjacent tooth files is of a
different generation, yet all are connected by a single and permanent dental lamina). So, please
elaborate on your arguments. References 39 and 40 could be complemented by Huysseune 2005
(Int. J. Dev. Biol. 50: 637-643) and Huysseune & Witten 2008 (Evolution & Development 10:1, 6–
14) showing successional lamina or derivation directly from the outer dental epithelium of the
predecessor, in teleosts, and arguing in favour of a local control of replacement - as you do.
Further remarks:
Page 9, 1st par.: what are “organized” teeth?
Page 10: “may traveled”: may have traveled?
Page 10, lower par. “There is no post-functional position that the worn teeth can be moved to”.
Please explain, this is not understandable.

21 Abstract
22
23
The numerous cushion-shaped tooth-bearing plates attributed to the stem-group
24 osteichthyan Lophosteus superbus, which are argued here to represent the ancient
25 form of inner dental arcade, display a unique and presumably primitive way of tooth
26 shedding by basal hard tissue resorption. They carry regularly spaced, recumbent,
27 gently recurved teeth arranged in transverse tooth files that diverge towards the
28 lingual margin of the cushion. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from
29 propagation phase contrast synchrotron microtomography (PPC-SRµCT) reveals
30 remnants of the first-generation teeth embedded in the basal plate that have never
31
been discerned in any taxa. These teeth were shed by semi-basal resorption with the
32
33
periphery of their bases retained as dentine rings. The rings are highly overlapped,
34 which evidences tooth shedding prior to adding the next first-generation tooth. Later
35 teeth at the same sites underwent cyclical replacing and shedding through basal
36 resorption, producing stacks of buried resorption surfaces separated by bone of
37 attachment. The number and spatial arrangement of resorption surfaces elucidates that
38 basal resorption of replacement teeth had taken place at the older tooth sites before
39 the addition of the youngest first-generation teeth at the lingual margin. Thus the
40 replacement tooth buds cannot have been generated by a single permanent dental
41
lamina, but must have arisen either from successional dental laminae associated with
42
43 the predecessor teeth, or directly from the dental epithelium of these teeth. The virtual
44 histological dissection of these Late Silurian microfossils broadens our understanding
45 of the development of the gnathostome dental systems and the acquisition of the
46 osteichthyan-type of tooth replacement.

1. Introduction
50 Lophosteus superbus Pander from the Late Silurian (Pridoli) of Ohesaare cliff,
51 Saaremaa, Estonia, was described in 1856 and was thus among the first Silurian
52 vertebrates to be studied [1]. It is represented by a rich but disarticulated material of
53 scales, spines, dermal plates and tooth-bearing elements [2][3][4]. Lophosteus has
54 been documented worldwide during recent decades. However, teeth and tooth-bearing
55 bones are only known from the type locality material of L. superbus, while the other
56 new species are mainly based on scales, spines and head plates [4][5]. Despite its
57 fragmentary nature, Lophosteus has continued to attract the interest of researchers to

3 the present day, partly because of the superb histological preservation of the Ohesaare
4 material, and partly because of its distinctive character complement that suggests
5 membership of the osteichthyan stem group.
6 For many decades, the earliest and most basal osteichthyans (bony fishes plus
7
tetrapods) were interpreted as either actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes) or
8
9 sarcopterygians (lobe-finned fishes), leaving the osteichthyan stem group vacant [6].
10 However, in 2007 Botella and colleagues described marginal jawbones of the Silurian
11 fishes Andreolepis and Lophosteus, and interpreted them as potential members of this
12 stem group [7]. In 2010, Friedman and Brazeau established a synapomorphy scheme
13 for the osteichthyan stem, crown and total group, and placed several Silurian-
14 Devonian osteichthyans in the osteichthyan stem [6], but most of these are ‘scale taxa’
15 represented by very fragmentary material. Their scheme also proved controversial;
16 Schultze revised the scale characters of these taxa and argued that Lophosteus,
17
interpreted by Friedman and Brazeau as a possible (but not definite) stem
18
19 osteichthyan, is in fact the only known member of the osteichthyan stem group [8].
20 Besides scales and dermal plates, another common type of detached material
21 that carries phylogenetic significance is dental elements. Osteichthyans have a unique
22 mode of tooth replacement involving shedding through basal resorption of the dental
23 tissues [9]. Gross identified Lophosteus as an osteichthyan rather than an acanthodian
24 on the basis of detached teeth that showed traces of resorption and resembled crown
25 osteichthyan teeth in the shape of their pulp cavities and arrangement of dentine
26 tubules [2][3][10]. However, Friedman and Brazeau used almost no dental-
27
development characters in their synapomorphy scheme, except the presence of enamel
28
29 or acrodin [6], probably because of the dearth of data on the dental systems of stem
30 osteichthyans.
31 The study of early vertebrate dental systems has recently been revolutionized
32 by the application of propagation phase contrast synchrotron microtomography (PPC-
33 SRµCT), which allows the internal architecture of dental elements, including features
34 such as buried resorption-overgrowth surfaces, to be visualized in three dimensions
35 with micron-scale resolution without damaging the specimens [11][12]. Using this
36 technique, a dentition field showing cyclical tooth replacement by basal resorption
37
and shedding was discovered on a marginal jawbone of Andreolepis [13]. The teeth of
38
39 Andreolepis are only approximately arranged into (multiple) longitudinal rows, and
40 prior to the development of the shedding dentition a more labial set of non-shedding
41 odontodes seem to have been used for food capture. Linear shedding tooth rows and
42 repeated basal resorption of the shedding teeth are classically regarded as unique to
43 osteichthyans. The dental development of Andreolepis suggests that the shedding
44 cycle evolved before the emergence of the linear tooth row [13].
45 The Ohesaare material of Lophosteus superbus, which has been greatly
46 expanded by a recent collecting programme led by HB, includes marginal jaw bones
47
[7] and numerous small cushion-shaped tooth plates that Gross interpreted as ossicles

49 from the hyoid arch or branchial arches in the oral cavity [3]. Similar cushion-shaped
50 plates occur together with marginal jawbones in the material of Andreolepis as well
51 [14][10], but are much rarer. The significance of these elements has recently been
52 placed in a new light by the discovery of the so-called maxillate placoderm
53 Entelognathus from the Silurian of Yunnan, China, which combines an overall
54 placoderm-like morphology with marginal jaw bones similar to those of osteichthyans
55 [15]. Traditionally it has been argued that the gnathal plates of conventional
56 placoderms are homologous with the inner dental arcade (the coronoids,
57
dermopalatines, ectopterygoids and vomers) of osteichthyans. However,

3 Entelognathus and a second recently discovered form from the Silurian of Yunnan,
4 Qilinyu, which both have maxilla, premaxilla and dentary, have no inner dental arcade
5 at all [16]. This suggests that the gnathal plates are homologous with the outer dental
6 arcade of osteichthyans, and that the inner arcade may be an osteichthyan novelty.
7
The cushion-shaped plates of Lophosteus and Andreolepis, referred to below as "tooth
8
9 cushions", are certainly internal to the margins of the jaws and could thus in principle
10 represent either the inner dental arcade, that is to say the coronoid-dermopalatine
11 series, or still more internal elements such as branchial dental plates, or both. We
12 return to this question in the Discussion, where we argue that they are more likely to
13 belong to the inner dental arcade.
14 We present here the first investigation of the tooth cushions of Lophosteus by
15 PPC-SRµCT at submicron resolution. As already illustrated in Andreolepis [13], This
16 groundbreaking technique reveals an extremely complicated 3D histology, not
17
recognized in the previous histological study by Gross [3], which allows the sequence
18
19 of tooth addition and replacement to be inferred.
20
21 2. Material and methods
22 Fallen blocks of limestone totaling several hundred kilos were collected from the type
23 locality of Lophosteus, Ohesaare cliff, in Saaremaa Island, Estonia. Acetic acid
24
dissolution and extraction of the microremains were respectively carried out at the
25
26 Department of Earth Sciences of Lund University and the Department of Organismal
27 Biology of Uppsala University, Sweden. All specimens are registered to the
28 Geological Institute, Tallinn, Estonia under the designation GIT 760.
29 More than 130 tooth cushions were found among the microremains, displaying
30 variation in size and morphology. The specimens can be confidently assigned to
31 Lophosteus on the basis of a characteristic bone histology with very large osteocyte
32 lacunae that is shared with scales, spines and bones of Lophosteus from the same
33 locality [2][17]. The other gnathostomes in the fauna are acanthodians [18], which
34
can be distinguished from Lophosteus without difficulty.
35
36 Ohesaare cliff represents an open shoal environment with high energy [19],
37 and many of the Lophosteus tooth cushions show evidence of transportation and
38 abrasion. Most tooth cusps were broken, leaving a cluster of rings of the dentinal
39 bases, and thus the cushions acquired a honeycomb appearance (figures 1a-e and
40 2a,c). But this has no influence on the excellent preservation of histology, which
41 yields a wealth of details and allows the growth history to be reconstructed with
42 confidence. Dentine and bone can easily be distinguished and there is no visible
43 recrystallization of either tissue (figures 2j, 3, 4a-d and 5o). Vascular canals,
44
45
osteocyte lacunae, dentine tubule and fibre traces are all clearly visible and show no
46 evidence of distortion or enlargement by post-mortem erosion.
47
48 2.1. Focus-stack imaging
49 Selected specimens were photographed by dissection microscope each at 20-30 focus
50 points. These separate frames were combined by the Auto-Blend Layers command of
51 Photoshop to composite an image that the whole specimen is in focus (figure 1).
52
53
54 2.2. PPC-SRµCT
55 Three specimens were imaged at beamline ID19 of the European Synchrotron
56 Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France, using propagation phase-contrast
57 synchrotron radiation microtomography (PPC-SRµCT) adapted to fossil bone

3 histology [11][20] (table 1).
4 The scan that the 3D virtual dissection (figures 4 and 5) based on was done
5 with a voxel size of 0.678µm. It was obtained with an objective 10×, NA0.3 coupled
6 with a 2× eyepiece. The optics, associated to a gadolinium gallium garnet crystal of
7
10 µm thickness (GGG10) scintillator, is coupled to a FreLoN 2K14 detector (fast
8
9 readout low noise camera [21]). The sample was set up at the distance of 30mm from
10 the optics. The experiment was performed with a monochromatic beam obtained
11 thanks to the use of a single crystal 2.5nm period W/B4C multilayer monochromator
12 fixed to the energy of 30keV. The gap of the undulator of the insertion device (U32U)
13 was set to 12.38mm. During the scan, 2000 projections were done over 180 degrees
14 with a time of exposure of 0.3s. The scanning data was reconstructed using a classical
15 filtered back-projection algorithm (PyHST software, ESRF) adapted to local
16 tomography [22]. This was done in edge-detection mode, based on an assumption of
17
chemical homogeneity. Artefacts (e.g., rings, movements) were corrected based on
18
19 programmed filters.
20 Data for ontogenetic comparisons (figure 2 and 3) are from scans of two
21 specimens, with a voxel size of 0.696 µm (also obtained with an objective 10×, NA
22 0.3, coupled with a 2× eyepiece, a GGG10 scintillator, a FreLoN 2k14 detector and
23 0.3 s exposure time). The sample was set up 15 mm from the optics. The gap of the
24 undulator U17.6 was set to 20 mm and provided a pink beam (direct beam with a
25 single main narrow harmonic) at an energy of 19 keV. A total of 2499 projections
26 were taken over 360° for the smaller specimen, or 4998 projections over 360° by half-
27
acquisition 400 pixels for the larger one. Reconstruction was done with a modified
28
29 version [11] of a single-distance phase retrieval approach [23].
30 The virtual thin sections of the sample in the form of stacks of images were
31 segmented into 3D sub-volumes through the software VG Studio 2.2. Embedded
32 subtle structures, such as the surfaces of resorption and dentine, were traced manually.

3. Results
36 3.1. Morphological variations
37 The apex of the tooth cushion, surrounded by appositional growth increments (figures
38 1i-l and 2b,d), is believed to be the growth center of the bony plate. The apex is not
39 located at the center of the tooth cushion, which grows faster in the (assumed) lingual
40 direction. The labial edge of the tooth cushion is especially thin, free of vascular
41 openings and tooth covering (figures 1, 2a,c,f,h,i-l and 3c,f, lr). It seems the tooth
42
cushion is in contact with another bone (presumably a marginal jaw bone) labially by
43
44 a rim of basal bone, and the growth of bone in this direction is limited. We believe
45 that the tooth cushions represent the inner dental arcade, meaning that they
46 correspond in general terms to the coronoids, ectopterygoids, dermopalatines and
47 vomers of crown-group osteichthyans, and that the observed variation in shape and
48 size reflects regionalization within this arcade. The majority of the specimens are
49 ovoid in shape, with the labial rim at the narrow end and the thicker vascularized
50 edges at the broad end (figure 1a,e-f,i-j), but there are exceptions that are oriented the
51 other way around (figure 1b,d). Sometimes the narrow end is pointed, or the labial rim
52
is straightened (figure 1g,k); in some specimens all the edges are straightened, making
53
54 the tooth cushion approximately rhomboidal (figure 1h,l). Rarely, the tooth cushions
55 may be further elongated into a rectangular shape (figure 1c). Most cushions are
56 obviously (though not grossly) asymmetrical, but one specimen (figure 1f,j) is
57 bilaterally symmetrical and could represent a symphysial plate.

3 Interestingly, the pioneer teeth are not situated above the growth center of the
4 bony plate (figures 1e-l and 2a-d). The oldest tooth sites are aligned along the labial
5 rim (figures 1, short arrow and 2a,c). If the labial rim is at the narrow end of the tooth
6 cushion, the tooth files radiate lingually from there towards the thicker edges
7
symmetrically (figure 1f); but the labial rim is more commonly at one side of the
8
9 narrow end, and the tooth rows are arranged in an asymmetric pattern such that the
10 direction of the median tooth file is not parallel to the long axis of the tooth cushion
11 (figure 1a-e,g-h). Teeth are closely spaced and recurved towards the direction of
12 addition (mostly lingually). As the basal plate thickens and widens lingually, a new
13 tooth file may originate halfway towards the broad end of the tooth cushion to
14 increase the number of tooth files. New teeth become larger and larger as well. The
15 number of tooth sites varies a lot among specimens, but not necessarily depending on
16 size. The largest specimens can carry about 14 rows and 120 functional teeth (figure
17
1b), but both the tiniest (figures 1a and 2c) and medium ones (figures 1c-h and 2a)
18
19 can carry a wide range, between 40 and 60 teeth.
20
21 3.2. Tissue organization
22
The general organization of the tooth cushion is that of a domed basal plate of bone,
23
24 with a convex external surface and a concave internal surface, carrying on its external
25 surface a tissue layer containing a complex array of multi-layered resorption features,
26 sandwiched between two sets of teeth. The upper set comprises the functional teeth
27 protruding from the external surface; the lower set consists of the unresorbed bases of
28 the first-generation teeth, lying directly on the bony base. Both sets contain the same
29 number of tooth sites (figure 2j, pf1-6, tr1-6). The multi-layered resorption features
30 separating the tooth sets are the product of repeated tooth shedding and replacement at
31 these sites.
32
The bony base contains numerous osteocyte lacunae (figures 2j, ol, 3, 4a-c and
33
34 5n-o, in red). Osteocyte lacunae are also found in lower numbers scattered between
35 the resorption surfaces, including the space between the pulp cavity and semi-basal
36 resorption surface within the dentine ring of the first-generation teeth (see below).
37 They are mainly enclosed in the bone of attachment, a bone-like supportive tissue that
38 cements the teeth to the basal plate. The resorption process that initiated tooth
39 shedding did not remove all the bone of attachment, with the result that this tissue
40 accumulated and thickened the tooth cushion with each tooth replacement cycle
41 (figure 6h). The gaps between the functional teeth (figures 2j, ba, 3 and 5n-o), as well
42
as the tooth-free margin (figure 2f,i-j, ba) are actually filled by stacks of the bone of
43
44 attachment that surrounded preceding generations of shed teeth.
45 The teeth consist of orthodentine and lack enamel. The bone of attachment and
46 dentine grade into each other without any sharp boundaries (figures 3d and 4c, ba,
47 den), consistent with their probable derivation from the same odontogenic population
48 of mesenchyme cells within the dental papilla [24]. The dentine of the transition zone
49 was described as somewhat folded with fewer tubules by Gross [2].
50 After tooth addition and cyclical replacement, all the embedded old tissues,
51 dentine and bone of attachment of the preceding generations of teeth, are integrated
52
into the basal plate. The basal plate as a whole keeps growing wider and deeper,
53
54 which can be traced by the growth arrest lines. The distinction between adult and
55 juvenile is not the size, shape, or number of functional teeth, but more likely the
56 thickness of the tooth cushion and number of resorption surfaces in each stack
57 (figures 2 and 3). New bony tissue is added to the cushion margin and the internal
58 surface, but not the external surface after the start of tooth replacement. The bone-like
59
60

Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 6 of 20

2
3 tissue accumulated onto the external surface is bone of attachment, because its
4 addition always follows the course of tooth replacement, creating an uneven external
5 surface, and the basal resorption surfaces all reach the external surface of the bone, if
6 not encroached by others.
7
8
9 3.3. Three-dimensional architecture of vasculature
10 The imprint of large vascular canals can be found on the internal surface radiating
11 from the apex of the tooth cushion to the bone margin (figures 1i-l and 2b,d), where
12 they are truncated obliquely. There are at least two more layers of these radial basal
13 canals running parallel to the curvature of the bone, inside the bony base and between
14 the bony base and the tooth division (figure 5n-o). Similar to the longitudinal vascular
15
mesh through the osteocyte-rich layer of the basal bone of Andreolepis [13], they split
16
17
or unite uncommonly, but never cross perpendicularly. Their openings on the internal
18 surface are concentrated at bone margin and at the growth center of the bone or
19 somewhat lingual to it (figures 1j-l and 2b,d), with a scatter between these areas
20 (figure 1i). We interpret them as housing the arteries and veins that supply the
21 complex vascular system of the dental layer as well as the overlying epithelium. A
22 single pulp cavity (a tooth site) at the cushion margin can connect up to seven basal
23 canals of the bony base by its root canals, and all the oval-shaped pulp cavities are
24 elongated in the direction of the radial basal canals (figure 5k-l).
25
The pulp cavities of replacement teeth in function have a rounded bottom
26
27
sitting on top of the stack of resorption surfaces, whereas those of the first-generation
28 teeth are based on a complex network of root canals that radiates irregularly from the
29 center of the pulp cavity and join different tooth sites together. These canals represent
30 the vascular network that initially formed in mesenchymal tissue above and outside
31 the edge of the bony base plate, during the earliest stage of tooth development, and
32 provided the blood supply for the tooth buds. The deposition of bone of attachment
33 around and between these vessels during the later stages of tooth development caused
34 them to become embedded in the tooth cushion and thus preserved (figure 6a,b).
35
Occasional vertical canals rising from the root canals show that they remained
36
37
connected to the vasculature of the overlying epithelium.
38 Replacement teeth have a dual vascular supply with deep and superficial
39 components. The deep component normally came up through the (now open-topped)
40 pulp cavity of the predecessor tooth. However, one marginal replacement tooth,
41 which formed in a substantially more lingual position than its predecessor and only
42 partly overlaps it, shows two separate sets of deep canals - one arising out of the
43 predecessor pulp cavity and the other coming up through the marginal bone of the
44 base plate (figure 5n). In this instance it appears that the site of the replacement tooth
45
bud straddled the margin of the underlying base plate, such that it was able to attract
46
47
vessels both from the predecessor pulp cavity and from the soft tissue bordering the
48 base plate.
49 In addition to these deep components, each replacement tooth has a ring of
50 more superficial vessels, represented by radial canals emerging from a higher level if
51 the pulp cavity, which in life connected to the vasculature of the epithelium overlying
52 the tooth cushion. The openings of these canals lie within the bone of attachment and
53 form a characteristic ring round each standing tooth (figure 5k). The superficial canals
54 closely parallel the surface of the immediately underlying resorption cup, and very
55
few of them are entrapped in the remnant bone of attachment between resorption cups
56
57
in a stack. This implies that the osteoclast activity that loosened the predecessor tooth
58 from the cushion proceeded from these vessels. The tooth shedding process would
59
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 7 of 20 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 thus always end with the superficial vessels lying free in soft tissue above the
4 resorption cup, and irrespective of whether those actual vessels survived to be
5 reembedded by the bone of attachment of the successor tooth, or whether they were
6 broken down and replaced by new vessels at a slightly higher level, they would not be
7
captured between resorption surfaces (figure 6e-j). The few examples that were
8
9 captured in this way presumably represent vessels that failed to initiate osteoclast
10 activity.
11 Gross examined the shed teeth with resorption pits and described that the pulp
12 cavities are undivided and unfolded, wide open at the base and narrowing upwards to
13 a narrow channel [3], but he missed the resorption surfaces underneath the
14 replacement teeth and the first-generation teeth buried in the basal plate. Because the
15 first-generation teeth were shed semi-basally, the bases of their pulp cavities together
16 with the dentine became embedded by the bone of attachment of the following
17
generations of teeth. The pulp cavities of the next generations lay on the preexisting
18
19 ones, connecting to the vascular networks of the bony base by the old chambers. But
20 as all the younger generations of teeth were shed basally, their pulp cavities were not
21 preserved. After the replacement of several generations of teeth and the stacking of
22 bone of attachment, a neck is formed linking the pulp cavities of the first generation
23 and those of the functional teeth (figure 3, pn), which is more obvious in the older
24 tooth cushions that have undergone a greater number of tooth replacement cycles.
25 Along with the growth of the basal plate, the teeth become bigger and tend to move
26 towards the bone margin. Consequently, the column of the oldest and youngest pulp
27
cavities and the neck is inclined towards the margin (figures 2j, 4e and 5). The
28
29 youngest pulp cavities may have shifted far enough to become situated between two
30 neighbouring first-generation teeth of the same tooth file, and come into contact with
31 the more marginal column (figure 5f,j-m).
32 Each pulp cavity has a set of small radial vessels ascending through the bone of
33 attachment to the epithelium. This creates a ring of openings surrounding each tooth
34 (figures 2j, 3, rv, and 5k-o, in yellow), which also characterizes the shedding teeth on
35 the tooth cushion of Andreolepis, and the marginal jaw bones of Lophosteus and
36 Andreolepis [7; personal observation by DC, HB, PEA]. The openings are often
37
shared by the radial vessels of neighboring teeth. If the openings are covered by a new
38
39 tooth of its own or adjacent tooth site, the radial canals will join to the bottom of the
40 new pulp cavity (figure 1j, *rv). However, the radial vessels belonging to the older
41 generations of pulp cavities can still communicate with the epithelium in places where
42 there is no overgrowing of new teeth. The radial canals can also give off straight
43 branches that connect down to the root canal network directly.
44
45 3.4. Tooth addition, shedding and replacement
46
47
The overlapping relationship between the first-generation teeth shows that they are
48 added sequentially towards the growing margin of the tooth cushion in an alternate
49 pattern (figures 4 and 5). Although the origin of radial rows (figures 1 and 2a,c, short
50 arrow) does not coincide with the growth center (the apex) of the bone, tooth addition
51 correlates with the growth of the basal plate. Teeth are arranged so tightly that, in a
52 radial row, a younger larger tooth overlaps the preceding tooth for at least a quarter of
53 the tooth length, and even overlaps on two preceding teeth. As a result, the preceding
54 tooth has to be shed to make way for the next tooth, which allows the root canals of
55
the new tooth to join those of the preceding tooth from above (figure 5a,g,n-o).
56
57
However, the first-generation teeth are shed semi-basally, that is to say, only the
58 crown is lost (figure 6a-d). It leaves the periphery of the tooth base that, before
59
60
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 8 of 20
1
2
3 shedding, has probably been incorporated into the basal plate, embedded in the bony
4 tissue to some extent, as well as overlapped by a newly added tooth of the adjacent
5 row. The marginal first-generation teeth are the last to undergo semi-basal resorption.
6 After the addition of the first-generation teeth is finished, the tooth cushion
7
continues growing wider, however, the number of tooth sites does not increase. In situ
8
9 tooth replacement is thus required to produce new sharp teeth on the surface of the
10 tooth cushion. This has apparently already happened to the oldest tooth sites before
11 the addition of the last first-generation teeth to the bone margin, because the larger
12 number of resorption surfaces at the older tooth sites documents that they have been
13 replaced more times (figures 2j and 4). Among the four tooth sites modeled in
14 exhaustive detail, the functional tooth of the youngest tooth site is one generation
15 younger than the one of the oldest tooth site (figure 5c-d,k-l). The addition of the
16 replacement teeth follows the same sequence as the addition of the first-generation
17
teeth, judging by the number of resorption surfaces beneath them. A generation of
18
19 teeth is impossible to replace in one go, but the functional dentition of the tooth
20 cushion is at any one time composed of teeth of more than one generation. Therefore,
21 the whole tooth field maintains functional teeth all the time.
22 The semi-basal resorption surfaces cutting off the first-generation teeth are
23 fairly regular in shape (figure 5c). On top of the dentine ring the resorption surface
24 takes the form of a circular platform that hardly extends out of the tooth into the
25 surrounding bony tissue. Internally, it extends deeply into the root of the first-
26 generation tooth (figure 6d). Hence the following generations of teeth, along with
27
their bone of attachment can insert into the hollow, right at the same tooth site, and
28
29 even the basal resorption surfaces of replacement teeth extend into the hollow too,
30 like a funnel (figures 3, 4, 5g-h,n-o, and 6f-j). But since the tooth cushion has grown
31 larger, the replacement teeth do not overlap each other. The following generations of
32 teeth even have to become larger and shift marginally to fill up the increasing space
33 (figures 2j, 3a and 5).
34 All the replacement teeth are resorptive-based. At least three or four resorption
35 surfaces are stacked at each tooth site in the assumed lingual region of the thinner
36 specimens (figures 3d,e-f, 4 and 5) but more than twelve layers of resorption are
37
exhibited in the assumed labial region of the thick one (figures 2j and 3a,c). No
38
39 dentine remnant is found between these resorption surfaces, indicating that the
40 replacement teeth are shed completely by basal resorption. The resorption surface is
41 centered on the predecessor tooth that was shed by the resorption event. The position,
42 orientation and size of a resorption surface thus illuminates that of a shed tooth, and
43 the stack of resorption surfaces reflects the track of the cyclical shedding. The
44 position of the new tooth usually deviates from its resorption base, since it is larger
45 and located more marginally than its predecessor (figure 5l). Because both the semi-
46 basal and basal resorption surfaces are funnel-shaped (figures 3, 4e, 5n-o and 6), this
47
lateral displacement prevents them from "stacking" neatly; each new tooth will be
48
49 raised up, because it straddles the rim of the underlying resorption pit, and its bone of
50 attachment will thicken the bony plate. Accordingly, the basal resorption of the new
51 tooth (e.g. figure 5i, in dark turquoise on upper row and j, in royal blue on lower row)
52 will partially encroach the resorption surfaces the tooth rests upon, the resorption
53 surfaces at the next more marginal tooth site, and even the buried dentine rings of the
54 first-generation teeth (figure 5o, *den), producing a new wider resorption surface.
55 Since the teeth at the marginal tooth sites incline outward, the encroachment of the
56 resorption surface at the marginal side by the younger resorption surfaces is most
57
obvious (figures 4e and 5c-k), as the inclination of the younger resorption surfaces
58

2
3 towards the cushion margin is increasing. The bone of attachment sandwiched by the
4 resorption surfaces is thus broader at the labial side, and consists of the tissue between
5 tooth sites (figure 5n-o). However, the resorption surfaces never intersect between
6 tooth rows, no matter how tightly they are arranged (figure 5c-f). It may imply that the
7
developmental domain of tooth shedding of each tooth row is clearly demarcated.

10 4. Discussion
11 Before examining the significance of the cushions and their dentition in detail, we
12 need to consider their precise identification. In some extant actinopterygians such as
13 Amia [25] the entire oropharyngeal cavity internal to the marginal jaw bones is
14
covered with dermal bones bearing fields of teeth or denticles. Homologues of all
15
16 these elements can be identified in sarcopterygian fishes such as the Devonian
17 tetrapodomorph Eusthenopteron [25], indicating that the whole suite was present at
18 the osteichthyan crown group node. From external to internal, this suite comprises: 1)
19 the inner dental arcade, containing the vomer, dermopalatine, ectopterygoid and
20 coronoids, all moderately large bones with distinct individual morphologies, usually
21 carrying organized teeth; 2) the entopterygoid and prearticular, large flat bones on the
22 palatoquadrate and lower jaw covered with denticles; 3) the parasphenoid and (if
23 present) paraotic dental plates, moderately large flat or gently curved bones on the
24
ventral face of the braincase, covered with denticles; and 4) the branchial dental plates,
25
26 numerous small denticle-bearing elements on the gill arches. The tooth cushions of
27 Lophosteus have been identified in the past as branchial dental plates [3], but we
28 argue that this is based on superficial similarities and takes insufficient account of the
29 total evidence.
30 Even though the Lophosteus material from Ohesaare comprises hundreds of
31 specimens, all the non-marginal dental elements are tooth cushions of the type
32 described here. There is no trace of large flat denticle-bearing bones, either entire or
33 as fragments, or of any small elements that diverge from the stereotypic concavo-
34
convex tooth cushion morphology. We conclude that the tooth cushions are the only
35
36 dental elements in the oropharyngeal cavity of Lophosteus. The maxillate placoderms
37 Entelognathus [15] and Qilinyu [16], which constitute the best outgroup for
38 osteichthyans with regard to this problem because they have marginal jaw bones
39 homologous with those of osteichthyans, have no dental elements in the
40 oropharyngeal cavity at all. In Lophosteus, it is unlikely that tooth cushions occupied
41 all the areas covered by categories 1) - 4) in crown osteichthyans, because they do not
42 show a degree of morphological variation commensurate with this hypothesis.
43 Taken together, the evidence suggests that the tooth cushions of Lophosteus
44
45
covered only part of the oropharyngeal cavity. But which part? Clues are provided by
46 their morphology (figures 1 and 2). The cushions carry relatively large teeth,
47 organized in transverse files, rather than disorganized denticle fields. The growth
48 center of the cushion is always positioned asymmetrically, showing that it grew more
49 in one direction than the other. The teeth are strongly inclined and point towards the
50 direction of maximum growth. The edge of the cushion that shows least growth is
51 often somewhat flattened. The asymmetric growth pattern suggests that one edge of
52 the cushion was constrained, likely by proximity to another bone; if we assume that
53 the teeth pointed inwards and/or backwards in the oropharyngeal cavity, to facilitate
54
55
swallowing of prey, it follows that this constrained edge was external. This suggests
56 that the cushions were positioned immediately internal to the marginal tooth-bearing
57 bones [7] and formed an inner dental arcade. Further support for this hypothesis is
58 provided by the concave internal surfaces, which demonstrates that each cushion
59

3 rested on a projecting bump of endoskeleton. Palatoquadrates and Meckel's cartilages
4 of early gnathostomes frequently show different kinds of 'scalloping' or surface
5 undulation associated with attachment sites for the inner dental arcade or tooth whorls
6 [26] [27], but branchial arches do not. Furthermore, branchial dental plates do not
7
usually have recumbent teeth [25]. We conclude that the tooth cushions of Lophosteus
8
9 probably represent the inner dental arcade and are broadly homologous with the
10 coronoids, vomers, dermopalatines and ectopterygoids of crown-group osteichthyans.
11 Returning to the dentition, the tooth cushions of Lophosteus exhibit tooth
12 replacement by cyclic basal shedding, indicating that this osteichthyan autapomorphy
13 has been acquired by both Andreolepis and Lophosteus, not only on the marginal
14 jawbones but also on the inner dental elements. This unique osteichthyan trait
15 emerges earlier than the presence of enamel on the teeth, as tooth enamel is absent not
16 only in Andreolepis and Lophosteus, but also in the more derived stem osteichthyan
17
or basal crown osteichthyan Psarolepis [28][3][29][13].
18
19 The teeth on the tooth cushion are not randomly distributed in an irregular
20 tooth field, but neatly arranged in tooth files. Thus the tooth cushion could be
21 described as a multi-file tooth whorl or tooth plate. On the tooth whorls lining the jaw
22 or in the symphysis of acanthodians and early chondrichthyans, successive teeth of
23 increasing size are added lingually [30][31]. The post-functional teeth are rotated
24 labially [32], merging into the facial ornamentation [33] or incurving spirally. The
25 tooth plates of holocephalans form by fusion between crowns as well as bases of a
26 few tooth families [34], with the new teeth stacked up against the post-functional
27
teeth. In spite of retention of the compound teeth, new tooth material is added on one
28
29 side as the teeth are abraded on the other, and the tooth plate may traveled diagonally
30 for a substantial distance during the lifespan of the individual [35]. The mechanisms
31 of constant rotation and lingual addition of new teeth are also seen in the
32 parasymphysial tooth whorls of sarcopterygians, such as Onychodus and
33 porolepiforms, though here they are associated with shedding. Neither end of the
34 whorl is static. New teeth that are fully grown will be inserted by the extension of the
35 posterior (i.e. lingual) end of the whorl, and post-functional teeth will be lost by basal
36 resorption immediately before the resorption of the anterior end of the whorl itself
37
[36][37]. Shedding by basal resorption is lost in the tooth plates of lungfish. Sets of
38
39 teeth are added on nonalternate radiating rows from the initial tooth, but instead of
40 site-specific cyclic resorption, worn teeth may be removed by extensive resorption,
41 before replaced by denticles or sheet dentine [38]. All these tooth systems have been
42 interpreted as generated by a dental lamina.
43 However, a single dental lamina cannot explain the tooth addition and
44 replacement mechanism of the tooth cushion. On the tooth cushion of Lophosteus, all
45 the tooth sites are active throughout life. There is no post-functional position that the
46 worn teeth can be moved to. Although continued growth is observed at the active
47
margin of the tooth cushion even when the number tooth sites does not increase any
48
49 more, neither significant bone resorption or abrasion at the primary zone, nor
50 movement of the functional sites associated with the remodelling of the basal plate is
51 observed. The basal plate of the cushion is relatively static. Resorption only relates to
52 particular teeth and the teeth can only be renewed via in situ replacement.
53 Furthermore, the older tooth sites undergo more cycles of replacement than the
54 younger ones (figure 3), thus teeth initiated at the same time may be of different
55 generations at different tooth sites (figure 5l). If the tooth buds of one generation are
56 all generated by a single, lingually positioned dental lamina, a marginal functional
57
tooth will block the addition of the next generation of teeth to the preceding tooth
58

2
3 sites. This suggests that each tooth site has its own clock of replacement and the
4 cyclic shedding is autonomous. In addition, there is no space for a proper dental
5 lamina to situate deeply at the side of each tooth site, considering that the replacement
6 teeth are added superficially, similar to those on the jawbone of Andreolepis [13]. The
7
replacement tooth bud is more likely to form directly from the dental epithelium of
8
9 predecessor tooth, or from a small successional dental lamina associated with that
10 tooth, as in the teleosts [39][40]. All these data and inferences point to the same
11 conclusion that the dentition on the tooth cushion of Lophosteus does not depend on a
12 permanent dental lamina, and give further support to the emerging consensus that the
13 permanent dental laminae of chondrichthyans and tetrapods are convergent
14 [41][42][43][13].
15 What makes the tooth cushion of Lophosteus distinctive relative to all other
16 dental elements known so far is the combination of semi-basal and basal resorption.
17
While the post-functional teeth of other tooth whorls or tooth plates are either shed or
18
19 not, the first-generation teeth of Lophosteus tooth cushion are shed semi-basally. The
20 resorption actually extends deep down to the vascularized base of the tooth, in order
21 to allow the replacement teeth to insert into the ring of dentine remnant (figures 5n-o
22 and 6). The resorption resistance of the tooth base may be due to the inactivity of
23 osteoclasts, and the inability of the odontoclasts to resorb bone of attachment.
24 Another potential reason may be the embedding of the tooth base and bone of
25 attachment in the newly grown bony tissue, as the bony base has been thickened
26 during the addition of the first-generation teeth. Since the first-generation teeth would
27
be shed before the addition of the next tooth in the same radial tooth file, they could
28
29 only perform food processing for a relatively short time, after which the job would be
30 carried on by a cyclic shedding dentition with proper basal resorption at the same sites.
31 Therefore the principal function of the first-generation teeth was probably to establish
32 the fixed tooth sites for the following resorptive-based teeth, patterning the tooth
33 organization.
34 The semi-basal shedding nature of the first-generation teeth of the Lophosteus
35 tooth cushion is reminiscent of the non-shedding first-generation odontodes on the
36 marginal jaw bone of Andreolepis [13]. However, the latter are overgrown by gap-
37
filling denticles, in a manner reminiscent of the scale odontodes of Andreolepis [12],
38
39 with a shedding dentition established at the lingual margin of their distribution [13],
40 whereas on the tooth cushion of Lophosteus the first-generation teeth directly set up
41 the shedding dentition in situ. The addition of these first-generation teeth is similar to
42 other non-shedding dentitions, such as the jawbones of arthrodires and ischnacanthid
43 acanthodians [44], which may represent the primitive state. Therefore, the
44 combination of non-shedding or semi-shedding with shedding dental systems could
45 be a transistional feature distinctive for stem osteichthyans, even though it might not
46 be shared by all the stem members. The tooth cushion of Lophosteus provides a clue
47
about the evolutionary relationship between non-shedding tooth addition and
48
49 osteichthyan-type tooth replacement. Especially, it casts light on the origin and the
50 development of the tooth fields internal to the marginal jaw bones of osteichthyan fish.

Appendix B
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
A very interesting paper that represents a second important contribution to the
evolution of dentitions in Osteichthyes. Thanks to the work of Chen et al., we
have a hugely improved understanding of the evolution of teeth and resorption in
stem-osteichthyans. I have some comments and questions on the annotated
manuscript, and I think the descriptive parts could be revised, as they appear
repetitive.
Response: We thank the reviewer for this positive assessment. Here are our
responses to the queries on the annotated manuscript:
Page 1.
"unique and primitive? Primitive would suggest this is shared with other taxa?"
Response: We described the mode of tooth shedding as unique because it has
not been observed in any other gnathostome. As Lophosteus appears to be a
basal member of the osteichthyan stem group, it is reasonably likely that its
mode of tooth replacement is primitive relative to that of other osteichthyans.
Lophosteus-style tooth replacement may well have been shared by other stem
osteichthyans, but if so they have not yet been discovered.
"Not in Andreolepis?" Response: No. In Andreolepis, tooth replacement is truly
basal from the beginning, so you never get a remnant dentine ring.
"If it's the next tooth, can it still be described as first-generation?" Response: We
regard the first tooth at each site, which sits directly on the bony base of the
cushion and is eventually shed by semi-basal resorption (see previous point), as
belonging to the first generation. This of course makes the first generation
diachronous, but we feel the terminology is justified because these teeth are so
distinctive and because they establish the pattern for the dentition. We have
added a new text block to Materials and Methods where we explicitly explain our
terminology.
"How does this differ from a successional dental lamina associated with each
tooth?" Response: We think the reviewer has misunderstood us here: our
argument was that the observed pattern could not have been produced by a
single big shark-like dental lamina at the edge of the base plate. The text has
been rewritten to make this clearer.
Page 2.
"So you're implying here that Andreolepis is phylogenetically basal relative to
Lophosteus- you say above Lophosteus possesses transverse (linear?) rows of
teeth" Response: No, this is a misunderstanding. We believe Lophosteus is
basal to Andreolepis, because Lophosteus entirely lacks enamel. When we
speak of tooth rows, we are referring to longitudinal rows as in our own jaws;
linear transverse arrangements of teeth are referred to as tooth files. The text
has been rewritten to make this clearer.
Page 4.
"Except for the basal rim suggesting contact with another bone, this range of
morphologies sound like they could be for branchial plates, with the symmetrical
plate sitting on a midline branchial element?" "Again, this seems like a
morphology associated with a dental element sitting on a curved branchial
element." Response: See below for a detailed response to these comments.
Page 5.
"You said above that the labial edge lacks teeth?" Response: The labial edge
itself is like a little vertical cliff face. The teeth crowd up against the top of the
"cliff", but do not spill over onto the "cliff face". This suggests that the edge was in
contact with another bone.
Query ("?") relating to the sentence "As the basal plate thickens and widens
lingually, a new tooth file may originate halfway towards the broad end of the
tooth cushion to increase the number of tooth files." Response: As the tooth
cushion grows bigger, the distal ends of the radially arranged tooth files (which
are having new teeth added at the lingual margin of the cushion) become more
widely separated from each other. Eventually there may be enough space to
insert a new tooth file between two old ones. We have made the text clearer and
added a figure reference.
"Again, this seems like a morphology associated with a dental element sitting on
a curved branchial element." Response: See above, and below. Also, bear in
mind that the curvature is wrong: the anterior face of a ceratobranchial, which is
where we would expect to find a branchial tooth plate, is transversely convex but
longitudinally concave - but the tooth cushions are dome-shaped. They wouldn't
sit comfortably on a ceratobranchial, but match perfectly the "bumps" on the
lower jaw of Megamastax (see below).
"But how can this be if, as you say above, new tooth rows can be positioned
along the plate, between existing tooth rows?" Response: This comes back to
the point, raised above, that the first generation of teeth is diachronous. The first
tooth to be put down at any tooth position attaches directly to the underlying
basal plate and is eventually shed by semi-basal resorption, leaving a dentine
ring. We refer to the total set of all such teeth as "the first generation", even
though they did not all grow at the same time. All replacement teeth grow on
tooth sites originally established by the first-generation teeth (see Figure 6), so at
any time during the subsequent life of the plate the number of tooth sites on its
surface (standing teeth + empty sockets) will be equivalent to the number of
buried first-generation tooth remnants.
"but you say these bases are 'unresorbed' above?" Response: Well, yes. These
teeth have undergone semi-basal resorption, leaving a basal unresorbed bit (the
dentine ring) topped by a resorption surface.
"What's the transition zone?" Response: The zone of transition between dentine
and bone of attachment. We have modified the text to make this clearer.
Page 6.
“If you have cyclical replacement then new basal resorption surfaces will always
encroach on other surfaces?” Response: No, not necessarily. It depends on the
specific local geometry, especially on whether the tooth position is gradually
shifting in a lingual direction.
“what does 'in function' mean? Would 'functional replacement teeth' be better?”
Response: We have changed the wording to “functioning replacement teeth”,
which is better because “functional” could be interpreted as a qualifier of
“replacement”.
“Was this just said above?” Response: No; the first text section refers to the
basal canals (blue in figure 5 and 6), the second to the root canals of the pulp
cavities (bright green in figure 5 and 6). We have modified the text to make this
clearer.
“This sentence is incomplete?” Response: It looks that way because an “of” has
become “if” by mistake. This has now been corrected.
Page 7.
"To be fair, Gross didn't have the technology to see these?" Response: Not
really, they would certainly have been visible in thin sections. However, he could
not have seen their three-dimensional organization and would thus probably
have missed their significance.
"The lettering on Figure 3 is very small so I couldn't see where this is."
Response: The figure has been enlarged as a single column.
"From Figure 4, and the way the bases are presented, it looks like the newer,
overlapping teeth are the smaller ones towards the labial margin?" Response:
No, figure 4e shows the tooth bases in internal view, i.e. from underneath. You
are in effect looking up at them through the transparent base plate of the tooth
cushion. That's why they seem to stack the wrong way.
"do you mean the younger tooth will overlap the resorbed bases of the preceding
tooth? From this sentence it sounds like the younger larger tooth overlaps the
preceding tooth itself." Response: It overlaps the basal dentine remnant of the
resorbed preceding tooth. We have modified the text to make this clearer.
"Hmm. then how do you know that the successional lamina is not from one of
these other teeth, or a more continuous dental lamina?" Response: We don't
know that, and we aren't making any claim about it either. This looks like a
misunderstanding of our position: we argue that the replacement teeth of this
system cannot have been generated by a single dental lamina at the lingual
margin of the bone, but rather must have been generated at each tooth position
(either from a small successional lamina associated with the tooth position, or
directly from the epithelium). We do not make any specific claim for the growth
mode of the first generation teeth, because the observed distribution pattern of
these teeth is compatible with several alternative growth models including a
single dental lamina, successional dental laminae at individual tooth sites, and
tooth development straight from the epithelium.
"Add this definition to the first usage of the term at the beginning of the paper, or
even to the abstract" Response: Done.
Page 8.
"But you just said above that the new tooth can overlap 1-3 of the preceding
teeth?" Response: The first generation teeth overlap each other (or rather,
overlap the remnant bases of neighbouring-but-already-shed first generation
teeth). Replacement teeth do not overlap neighbouring positions, because the
tooth cushion has grown wider and thicker with a larger external surface.
"You don't mean towards the jaw margin, you mean lingually?" Response:
Correct. The text has been modified to make this clear.
"I think this paragraph is repeating much of what has been said in the paragraphs
above?" Response: No, we respectfully disagree. This is not a repetition of
previous points.
"can you standardize terms referring to direction?" Response: Done.
"But you say they are oriented lingually, above?" Response: Sorry, "outward"
here meant "away from the body of the tooth cushion", i.e. lingually (because we
are on the lingual margin of the cushion). The text has been modified to make
this clear.
Page 9.
"I thought these were thicker lingually? p. 5" Response: No, you are confused by
the phrase "the basal plate thickens and widens lingually" on p. 5, which was
referring to the growth of the plate as a whole (but has now been removed,
precisely because it was confusing). Here we are talking about a quite different
phenomenon, at a single tooth site, best explained through a thought experiment.
Imagine taking two small plates from the kitchen cupboard and stacking them,
one on top of the other, in the usual way. These are two consecutive resorption
surfaces at one tooth site, and the small space between them consists of bone of
attachment. Now, let's assume that lingual is to the right and labial to the left.
Push the top plate a little to the right, without moving the bottom plate; this
represents the lingualward displacement of the tooth site during one replacement
cycle. You will note that the upper plate rides up on the right-hand edge of the
lower plate. If you now look at the space between the plates you will see that it
gets progressively wider towards the left/labial edge - in other words, the bone of
attachment gets thicker in a labial direction.
"In Figure 4 you do show some slight degree of overlap of the bases between
tooth rows?" Response: Only for the first-generation teeth. We have discussed
this elsewhere in the text, on page 7.
"But the two representative taxa you describe are derived osteichthyans. Would a
more basal taxon like Lophosteus necessarily show this type of morphological
variation?" Response: That's precisely the point we are making. Amia and
Eusthenopteron represent the two branches of the osteichthyan crown group.
The dermoskeleton of the oropharyngeal cavity is substantially conserved
between them, indicating that we can securely attribute these characters (for
example, presence of a parasphenoid and a prearticular) to the osteichthyan
crown group node. Instead of these particular taxa, we could have chosen a wide
range of others: for example, Moythomasia and Latimeria would give exactly the
same result. But we can clearly see from the range of tooth-bearing elements in
the Ohesaare residues that Lophosteus did not have this full range of
oropharyngeal dermal bones. This makes sense in the context of it being a stem
osteichthyan, but it also means that we need to be very careful about identifying
the tooth cushions with one subset of the crown osteichthyan oropharyngeal
skeleton that happens to look a bit like them. Equally, their highly stereotypic
morphology makes it seem unlikely that they covered every surface of the
oropharynx: more likely they ocupied just one region. There are in fact strong
positive reasons for identifying these elements as an inner dental arcade (see
below).
“Except for the entopterygoid and prearticular, bones of the inner dental arcade
are flatter and do not correspond to the concave surface of the Lophosteus tooth
pads? As noted the curved bone, entopterygoid and prearticular are only covered
in small denticles, not teeth.” Response: See our discussion of Megamastax,
below.
Page 10.
“Um, but a concave tooth cushion surface would rest very nicely on a rounded
branchial arch?” Response: No it wouldn’t. A branchial arch is transversely
convex but longitudinally (gently) concave; a dome-shaped element won’t rest
nicely on it at all.
“I think it would also be interesting to look at how teeth are replaced on the
branchial arches- for example the work by Huysseune on the zebrafish. What
does resorption look like there?” Response: We agree, and have added a
section on this to the manuscript. For further discussion see our response to your
main question, below.
“You've chosen an older reference to provide evidence for your statement- can
you make reference to other papers as well, maybe those by Anne Huysseune,
and across a broader range of taxa?” Response: References have been added.
“Also Helodus?” Response: No, we were thinking of crown-group holocephalans.
The text has been modified.
""where?" Response: Well, as a physical object, the toothplate stays put - but
the material of the toothplate travels in a labial direction, being constantly added
on the lingual side and worn away on the labial side. The text has been modified
to make this clearer.
"are lungfish relevant here?" Response: Given that they are crown
osteichthyans and thus descended from forms with conventional shedding
dentitions, we think they are relevant to the discussion.
Page 11.
"'timing' rather than 'clock'?" Response: No, the shedding-replacement process
is cyclical, so 'clock' is better.
"Is this an 'emerging consensus'? Since they're not sister taxa, the lamina can't
be homologous." Response: We don't quite understand this comment. In the first
place, it isn't true that homologies are only shared between sister taxa: humans
and dogs have homologous noses even though they are not sister groups within
Mammalia. Secondly, it is a matter of record that the dental laminae of
chondrichthyans and tetrapods frequently have been considered as homologous,
even in the fairly recent literature. Until now, most of the known osteichthyans
without a single permanent dental lamina have been actinopterygians, meaning
that the parsimony argument against tetrapod-chondrichthyan homology has not
in fact been very strong. The argument is now strengthened by the discovery that
the stem osteichthyans Andreolepis and Lophosteus apparently lacked such a
lamina. We think "emerging consensus" is about right.
"I thought there was also widespread resorption of the first generation
odontodes?" Response: Correct, though this is apical resorption apparently
initiated from outside. We omitted this from the discussion because this
manuscript was originally submitted to Proceedings B, and we were struggling to
meet the length constraints. The discussion has now been expanded to explain
the pattern more fully.
My main question concerns the identity of the tooth pads. They do seem very
similar to those covering the branchial arches, as the authors note. I think they
need to strengthen their arguments as to why the Lophosteus tooth pads are not
part of the branchial arch dentition. For example, they say these tooth pads are
part of the inner marginal dentition, but these bones are mostly flat, rather than
concave? The strongest argument seems to be that teeth on the Lophosteus
tooth pad are organized into linear rows- can the authors provide a broader
survey of osteichthyans to show conclusively that this organization does not
occur in the osteichthyan branchial dentition? The references they provide are
minimal- nothing by Anne Huysseune for example. The bottom line is that to me,
these tooth pads 'feel' very branchial.
Response: Part of the problem we face with this question is that we have
privileged access to critically important but as yet unpublished information that
we cannot cite. It concerns the recently described Silurian osteichthyan
Megamastax from Yunnan (Choo et al. 2014: Scientific Reports. 4.
doi:10.1038/srep05242). The coronoid region of the lower jaw in this genus
carries a row of "bumps" that were interpreted by Choo et al. 2014 (fig. 2b,c,g,h)
as coronoid teeth. A recently discovered articulated specimen shows that this
interpretation is mistaken: the "bumps" are in fact part of the Meckelian bone,
and each "bump" carries a tooth cushion essentially identical to those of
Lophosteus. We have discussed with Min Zhu, who is the custodian of the
Megamastax material, whether we might be permitted to cite this information as a
"pers. comm." from him, but for quite understandable reasons he has declined.
We are thus forced to fall back on weaker and more circumstantial arguments to
support an identification that we know to be robust. These are unusual
circumstances, and we would ask the reviewer to bear this in mind when
evaluating our argumentation.
Among the circumstantial arguments, the most fundamental springs from
the fact that these abundant tooth cushions are the only elements in the residues
from Ohesaare that can be identified as coming from an osteichthyan
oropharyngeal cavity. There is not a single trace of anything like a conventional
coronoid bone, or a fragment of a large flat denticulated bone such as a
prearticular or entopterygoid. Given that the residues contain literally thousands
of vertebrate microremains, including hundreds of tooth cushions, we believe we
are justified in interpreting this as genuine evidence of anatomical absence. In
other words, internal to the marginal jaw bones the oropharyngeal cavity of
Lophosteus contained only tooth cushions with a stereotypic morphology. This
makes it profoundly different from a modern osteichthyan, and should caution
against too readily identifying the cushions with one similar-looking subset of
elements from a modern osteichthyan oropharynx. Modern osteichthyan
branchial arch dentitions almost always contain elements with a wider variety of
shapes and sizes, because the small tooth pads on the ceratobranchials are
matched against larger denticulated bones in the pharyngeal roof.
The dentitions on modern osteichthyan branchial pads can be organized
into rows, as seen for example in zebrafish and medaka (Huysseune et al. 1998
and Abduweli et al. 2014, both cited in the revised manuscript) but we are not
aware of any examples of radial tooth files. More importantly, there is a distinct
difference in the relationship between the teeth and the basal plate: in the extant
osteichthyans the basal plate is thin and the bone of attachment takes the form of
tall pedicles, whereas in Lophosteus there are no such pedicles and the basal
plate is thickened externally by numerous overlapping patches of bone of
attachment left behind by previous generations of teeth. This condition closely
resembles the marginal jaw bones of Andreolepis (Chen et al. 2016) and
Lophosteus (unpublished), providing further evidence in support of a close
association between the tooth cushions and the marginal jaw bones.

Comments to the Author(s)
This is a thorough description of toothed elements from Lophosteus of a late
Silurian deposit in Estonia, based on advanced imaging technology.
The main objective was to (1) infer the anatomical identity of these elements, and
(2) to deduce the way how the tooth files originate and are replaced. I much
appreciate the schematic that summarizes the establishment of the first dentition
and the ensuing replacement of the teeth.
Response: Thank you for this positive assessment.
I have no major remarks, rather a number of smaller remarks that I would like the
authors to consider so as to improve the readability of the manuscript.
Results
One set of remarks pertains to the Results (description and associated figures)
as detailed below: several passages in the description are indeed not well
understandable and should be rewritten. It would also be helpful if the features
that are described are explicitly indicated on the figures (e.g. with arrows). The
nanoscale annotations on Figures 3 and 4 are not helpful as those cannot
possibly be read (I could not even see them at first). Larger annotations should
be provided at any event. Response: Figures have been rearranged and
relabeled.
- Page 3 “Dentine and bone can easily be distinguished” and “dentine tubule and
fibre traces are all clearly visible”: not with the magnifications and contrast
provided. For example, on Fig 2j, how to distinguish embedded dentine from
bone? Please provide a detail at higher magnification. Response: The virtual
thin section images of the manuscript review copy already contain all the
available histological information. They have very high resolution and will
withstand substantial magnification: only at 500% and above do they become
noticeably pixellated. But as you will appreciate, the maximum resolution we can
achieve in these figures is dictated by the resolution of the original scan. The
histological details you see at 500% magnification are all that can be accessed.
We have no possibility to re-image the section at higher resolution, the way you
could do with a physical thin section under a conventional microscope. Because
most readers will read this paper on-screen, and will thus be able to magnify the
figures as required, we do not feel it is necessary to introduce higher-
magnification images that simply duplicate image information already present in
the figure material. However, we would be happy to let the editor adjudicate on
this point.
- Page 4, section 3.1. “We believe that the tooth cushions
represent….regionalization within this arcade”: this is elaborated on in the
Discussion – please remove. Response: Done.
- Page 5, section 3.2, second paragraph: “… including the space between…”:
this is not understandable; please indicate specifically on the figures. Also show
a larger magnification of the osteocyte lacunae. Response: This is an
unambiguous description: the osteocytes in question occur within a ring-shaped
tissue domain that is bounded dorsally by the first resorption surface, ventrally by
the bone of the base plate, circumferentially by the remnant dentine ring of the
tooth, and centrally (i.e. the hole in the middle of the ring) by the pulp cavity.
However, we have simplified the description to make it clearer. As regards higher
magnification figures, please see the discussion above.
- The term “semi-basal resorption” should be explained the first time it is used in
the text. Response: Done.
- Page 5, section 3.2, third paragraph: provide a detail of the dentine/bone of
attachment; the grading between the two is unexpected and worth further
discussion. In teleosts, e.g., even in cases with no distinction between the
odontogenic and osteogenic population of cells in the dental papilla, there is still
a very sharp boundary between both tissues. Response: Huysseune et al.
(1998) state, in relation to the pharyngeal teeth of Danio, that "Once the
attachment bone matrix is well mineralized, it is no longer distinguishable either
from the dentine on one side, or from the supporting bone on the other side and
its position can only be traced by the position of the cervical loop tip." This
suggests that the condition in Lophosteus isn't so unusual. Bear in mind that we
cannot observe the development of the tissue in Lophosteus, only its fully
mineralized adult state. As regards higher magnification figures, please see the
discussion above.
- Page 6, section 3.3: In general this section is difficult to understand if not more
indications on the figures are provided. In particular:
1st par.: “There are at least two more layers of these radial basal canals…”: not
understandable, please indicate on figure Response: They are already indicated
on the figure! If you look at the colour code of figure 5, you will find a sky-blue
box (second from bottom) with the label "radial canals of bone base". In figures 1
and 2 the vascular tracks of these canals are not labelled but are clearly visible -
and they are the only vascular features in these images, so there shouldn't be
any confusion. The verbal description is clear and unambiguous.
3rd par. “two separate sets of deep canals”: please indicate on figure Response:
Done.
4th par.: “from a higher level if the pulp cavity”: in the pulp cavity? Response: "if"
was a typing error for "of" (the two letters are adjacent on the keyboard) which
has now been corrected.
“The superficial canals closely parallel the surface…..in a stack.”: please
indicate on figure Response: The superficial canals are yellow in the figure, a
point that is now mentioned in the text to help guide the reader. The relationship
between these canals and the resorption surfaces (i.e. there's a ring of them on
top of the youngest resorption surface, but very few caught between earlier
resorption surfaces) is clearly visible in the figure. We prefer to keep labelling and
indicator lines to a minimum, as they inevitably obscure parts of the image.
However, we are happy to defer to the opinion of the editor on this matter.
“Vasculature of the epithelium”: an epithelium is by default not
vascularized. Response: True, we were actually referring to the thin layer of
mesenchyme underneath the epithelium, but did not express this clearly. The text
has been modified and a figure reference inserted.
5th par: “a neck is formed…”: indicate more clearly on the figure Response: This
is already labelled on the figure, and the label is referenced in the text.
“the column of the oldest and youngest pulp cavities…”: indicate more explicitly
on the figure Response: We have added labelling and explanatory figure legend
text where required.
6th par.: “This creates a ring of openings..”: are these the same as described at
the beginning of the 4th par? If so, please remove and/or simplify Response:
Done.
- Page 8: “in one go”: replace Response: Done.
- The term “root” is not commonly used for non-tetrapod teeth Response:
Replaced with "base".
- Page 8, 3rd par. “resorptive based”: does this indicate a process or an
anatomical feature? Better replace. Response: Replaced with "successor teeth",
a term that is explained (along with several others) in a new section at the end of
Materials & Methods.
- Page 8: “The position of the new tooth usually deviates from its resorption
base”: the resorption base of the predecessor tooth? A new tooth cannot yet
have a resorption base?! Response: Fair point. The text has been rewritten.
- Page 8 line 8 from bottom: even with annotations and color codes, this is not
understandable. Please indicate with arrows on the figure. Response: We have
added labelling and explanatory figure legend text where required.
Discussion
The second set of remarks pertains to the Discussion. While I have very much
appreciated the careful analysis to arrive at the conclusion that the tooth
cushions must represent elements of the inner dental arcade, I am less
convinced about the rejection of a permanent dental lamina.
Although I am not a priori against the idea of an absence of a permanent dental
lamina, I do not see how the arguments listed can be used in favour of such a
conclusion. Replacement “in situ” in my view does not exclude the presence of a
dental lamina (it is a question of position); neither does the simultaneous initiation
of teeth of different generations exclude a permanent dental lamina (for example
in modern chondrichthyans, the youngest tooth of adjacent tooth files is of a
different generation, yet all are connected by a single and permanent dental
lamina). So, please elaborate on your arguments. References 39 and 40 could
be complemented by Huysseune 2005 (Int. J. Dev. Biol. 50: 637-643) and
Huysseune & Witten 2008 (Evolution & Development 10:1, 6–14) showing
successional lamina or derivation directly from the outer dental epithelium of the
predecessor, in teleosts, and arguing in favour of a local control of replacement -
as you do. Response: This may just be a misunderstanding of our position. We
have a robust geometrical argument against the presence of a single shark-like
dental lamina at the lingual margin of the base plate: given that tooth
replacement is occurring at positions all over the cushion, even far from this
margin, it is simply impossible for all the replacement teeth to be generated at
that margin. How would they get to their final destinations? No, replacement
teeth must be produced in situ at each tooth position. However, the nature of
these replacement sites is not constrained by our data: we could be dealing with
small permanent dental laminae, temporary dental laminae, or development
straight from the epithelium. The text has been modified to make this clearer.
Further remarks:
Page 9, 1st par.: what are “organized” teeth? Response: Teeth that are
arranged in rows, files or similar, rather than in a random scatter. We have
changed the wording to "spatially organized" to make it clearer.
Page 10: “may traveled”: may have traveled? Response: Yes, but in any case
this text segment has been rewritten.
Page 10, lower par. “There is no post-functional position that the worn teeth can
be moved to”. Please explain, this is not understandable. Response: In an
acanthodian with tooth whorls, or in certain early chondrichthyans, worn-out teeth
are rotated out of the mouth and eventually buried in soft tissue. That's what we
mean by moving them to a post-functional position. Lophosteus doesn't have this
option. The term is in fact explained earlier in the Discussion.
Page 11: transistional: typo (transitional) Response: Whoops! Corrected.
Figures
Legend Fig. 2: please put all abbreviations in alphabetical order Response:
Done.
Legend Fig. 3: (c-f) includes (d) but this is a horizontal section?! Response: A
mistake on our part. The legend has been corrected to "(b-c, e-f)".
Legend Fig. 4: (c) “through the overlapping area of the two files” is not
understandable Response: This is a longitudinal section following the contact
line between the two tooth files, where tooth bases and resorption surfaces from
the two files repeatedly form small overlaps with each other. The text has been
reformulated to make this clear.
Legend Fig. 6: (b-d) should be (c-d)? Response: Yes. Corrected.
