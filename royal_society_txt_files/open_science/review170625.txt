This is a very interesting paper contributing to a fascinating emerging field: quantification of
cellular decision-making. It is also relevant to the important field of bioelectricity (with respect to
how cells respond to endogenous electric field-mediated microenvironmental cues). Here the
authors establish a new assay, which enables them to analyze the ability of wild-type and mutant
cells to integrate two separate signaling cues for orientation. They show that cells deficient in
Pax6 are unable to integrate substrate and electric field cues. This is a valuable contribution as-is,
and also sets the stage for a lot of further work (for example, high-throughput assays to identify
genetic and pharmacological modifiers of cellular information processing, comparison of
numerous cell types for integrative "IQ", etc.). The paper is well-written and clear - I recommend
its publication; this is a really nice finding that should be the basis for much interesting work. I
have a few suggestions for minor revision:
1) the authors might want to add a few sentences to the Intro or Discussion, putting this paper in
context of the emerging work probing the perception space of cells, for example
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28003330, to make it clear to readers that this goes
beyond studies of electrotaxis or Pax6 function, but represents a fundamental and simple way to
assay cell responses in a very quantitative manner.
2) panels 1E,1F are hard to see - I suggest enlarging these, so that the important features of the
microspheres can be seen.
3) Fig. 2A: the error bars on the grooved Pax6-/- bar are tiny - is it important that the variance on
those experiments appears to be so much smaller than for WT cells?
4) should the graphs of Fig. 4 and Fig. 6 be shown next to each other (on one figure) to make clear
the difference between them?
5) is there an equivalent to Fig. 5 for the Pax6-/- cells?
6) Pax6 is a transcription factor - it would be good for the authors to speculate a bit on how this
might be involved in cellular decisions which are made on a pretty rapid time-scale - what is
transcriptionally regulated about cells making migration/orientation cues? How might
something like this work? I think the paper can be published without a lengthy study of the
mechanisms; I am asking for some analysis of the literature as to how Pax6 and its related
processes could control the proximal events of decision-making and cell behavior (cytoskeleton?)

This is a novel idea. I don't know of any similar work on the function of Pax6 in allowing the
integration of mechanical and electrical cues. The experiments seem ingenious to me and they
have given quite clear results. It is good to be reminded of the importance of these types of cue in
the guidance of migrating cells.
I have two comments that the authors should consider.
1. The cells are referred to as progenitors and the authors discuss how progenitors migrate in
vivo to generate the layers of the cerebral cortex. I don't think this is a correct use of the term
progenitor. Post-mitotic neurons - that might be referred to by some as precursors - migrate to the
layers of the cortex; progenitors (which continue to divide in the ventricular and subventricular
zones) don't migrate to the cortical layers. The most they do is migrate to the subventricular zone
from the ventricular zone. This brings me to the second point.
2. There is no clear discussion/ speculation on the significance of the findings for development of
the brain. These are cortical cells and I would have welcomed some consideration of how the
findings might be interesting in a broader context. If the cells under study are the in vitro
equivalents of cortical progenitors, then what naturally-occurring process might we be learning
about here?

“Requirement of Pax6 for the integration of guidance cues in neural progenitor migration” – In
this manuscript, Arocena et al., deals with the role of pax6 on neural progenitor migration. The
authors have checked the effect of groves and electric fields on the migration of progenitors. The
results are interesting but needs more explanation with regards to the mechanism by which Pax6
exerts the migration of the cells. Moreover, the data provided is preliminary and needs more
confirmation to prove the point. It is unclear on how Pax6 possesses the impaired response to the
electric field. The authors did not provide any convincing evidences to state the molecules
regulated by Pax6 which could be responsible for the electrotaxis. Whether Pax6 independently
does this function or by regulating few molecules which are associated with the electrotaxis or
cell-cell interaction? Did the authors check whether there are any aberrations in the expression of
cytoskeletal proteins in the neural progenitors which lack Pax6?
Specific comments:
1. Fig 1 E,F – the morphology of neurospheres look dead, it should be replaced with the better
image.
2. Have the authors performed an experiment for gain of function in the Pax6-/- neural
progenitors by over-expressing Pax6 ?

ar editors,
are grateful for the reviewers comments, which have been very valuable for improving the
nuscript. Below are our responses to their comments, marked in red. We have also marked in red
relevant parts modified in the manuscript to address the reviewers comments.

he authors might want to add a few sentences to the Intro or Discussion, putting this paper in
text of the emerging work probing the perception space of cells, for example
s://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28003330, to make it clear to readers that this goes beyond
dies of electrotaxis or Pax6 function, but represents a fundamental and simple way to assay cell
ponses in a very quantitative manner.
hor response: we have added a paragraph in the Discussion addressing this point and citing the
vant reference
panels 1E,1F are hard to see - I suggest enlarging these, so that the important features of the
rospheres can be seen.
hor response: panels 1E, 1F have been enlarged
Fig. 2A: the error bars on the grooved Pax6-/- bar are tiny - is it important that the variance on
se experiments appears to be so much smaller than for WT cells?
hor response: We also note the small error bar. This reflects our observations of the cells in vitro,
ch behaved very reproducibly. It reinforces the data from immunohistochemistry and other
hniques from ours and other groups that the protocols we used have isolated a very homogeneous
reproducible population of primary cells
hould the graphs of Fig. 4 and Fig. 6 be shown next to each other (on one figure) to make clear
difference between them?
hor response: figures 4 and 6 have been combined into a larger figure 4
s there an equivalent to Fig. 5 for the Pax6-/- cells?
ure 5 is primarily a representative example to show how cells moved and how the measurements
e made, and the genotype of the cells shown is secondary for this figure. Detailed visual
rmation about cell trajectories that shows qualitatively how they differ by genotype is found in
ure 6, whereas the quantification of these differences is shown in Figure 4. There is therefore no
itional information to be gained by showing an equivalent to Figure 5 for Pax6 deficient cells.
Pax6 is a transcription factor - it would be good for the authors to speculate a bit on how this
ht be involved in cellular decisions which are made on a pretty rapid time-scale - what is
scriptionally regulated about cells making migration/orientation cues? How might something
this work? I think the paper can be published without a lengthy study of the mechanisms; I am
ing for some analysis of the literature as to how Pax6 and its related processes could control the
ximal events of decision-making and cell behavior (cytoskeleton?)
hor response: we have added a paragraph in the Discussion to address this point and integrate it
h our previous discussion of possible roles of Pax6 in the integration of migratory cues

he cells are referred to as progenitors and the authors discuss how progenitors migrate in vivo to
erate the layers of the cerebral cortex. I don't think this is a correct use of the term progenitor.
t-mitotic neurons - that might be referred to by some as precursors - migrate to the layers of the
tex; progenitors (which continue to divide in the ventricular and subventricular zones) don't
rate to the cortical layers. The most they do is migrate to the subventricular zone from the
tricular zone. This brings me to the second point.
There is no clear discussion/ speculation on the significance of the findings for development of
brain. These are cortical cells and I would have welcomed some consideration of how the
ings might be interesting in a broader context. If the cells under study are the in vitro
ivalents of cortical progenitors, then what naturally-occurring process might we be learning
ut here?
hor response: these are very important observations, which we have addressed in the following
ys: we have refrained from using the term progenitor throughout the text, and we have added a
section in the Discussion to consider the in vivo and broader significance of our findings as
nted by the reviewer.

sible ways in which Pax6 absence could impair the integration of guidance cues. At the same
