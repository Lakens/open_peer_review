This is an interesting paper and is well written. The Authors in this paper derived an expression
for the resistance distance between any two point of the hammock network by two different
methods. The formula for the resistance involves a double sum, however , using an identity of
F.Wu Ref(8), the double sum was reduced to a single sum.
I recommend immediate publication

In this paper two types of method have emerged. One is the Laplacian matrix approach, another
is the Recursion-Transform method,
The two methods are the main methods to study the resistance network.
Two types of methods are compared and used to determine the resistance
distances between any two nodes of a network with topology of a hammock.
This is an original research work.
The content of the article structure is reasonable, the derivation is correct, the language is fluent,
I recommend to publish

This paper contains an interesting comparison of two complementary methods of evaluating the
two point resistance in a "hammock" network topology - one based on the network Laplacian, the
other based on a recursion relation for the currents. The technical details of both approaches are
clearly laid out in the paper and the relative merits of both are discussed.
The paper is well written and the contents are likely to be useful in various fields where the
calculation of such resistances, or analogous quantities in other related problems, are of interest.
It is a worthwhile addition to the body of work already produced by the authors and their
collaborators on such problems.

The computation of two-point resistance (also known as resistance distance in graph theory), is a
classical problem in circuit theory, which has attracted more and more attention. However, it is
usually very difficult to determine two-point resistances in large complex networks. In this paper,
exact expression for two-point resistances in “hammock” networks is obtained via two different
methods, namely, Laplacian approach and Recursion-Transform method. It seems to me that the
result obtained in this paper is new, correct and quite interesting. Furthermore, the whole paper
is well written. So I would like to recommend its publication in Royal Society Open Science.
Some minor suggestions.

terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix associated with the network
was also introduced in the following reference:

On behalf of the Editor, I am pleased to inform you that your Manuscript RSOS-140420 entitled
"Comparison of methods to determine point-to-
point resistance in nearly rectangular networks
with application to a hammock network." has been accepted for publication in Royal Society
Open Science subject to minor revision in accordance with the referee suggestions. Please find
the referees' comments at the end of this email.
The reviewers and Subject Editor have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, I invite you to respond to the comments and revise your
manuscript.

• Data accessibility
It is a condition of publication that all supporting data are made available either as
supplementary information or preferably in a suitable permanent repository. The data
accessibility section should state where the article's supporting data can be accessed. This section
should also include details, where possible of where to access other relevant research materials
such as statistical tools, protocols, software etc can be accessed. If the data has been deposited in
an external repository this section should list the database, accession number and link to the DOI
for all data from the article that has been made publicly available. Data sets that have been
deposited in an external repository and have a DOI should also be appropriately cited in the
manuscript and included in the reference list.
• Competing interests
Please declare any financial or non-financial competing interests, or state that you have no
competing interests.
• Authors’ contributions
All submissions, other than those with a single author, must include an Authors’ Contributions
section which individually lists the specific contribution of each author. The list of Authors
should meet all of the following criteria; 1) substantial contributions to conception and design, or
acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article or revising it
critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the version to be published.
All contributors who do not meet all of these criteria should be included in the
acknowledgements.
We suggest the following format:
AB carried out the molecular lab work, participated in data analysis, carried out sequence
alignments, participated in the design of the study and drafted the manuscript; CD carried out
the statistical analyses; EF collected field data; GH conceived of the study, designed the study,
coordinated the study and helped draft the manuscript. All authors gave final approval for
publication.
• Acknowledgements
Please acknowledge anyone who contributed to the study but did not meet the authorship
criteria.
• Funding statement
Please list the source of funding for each author.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript within 7 days (i.e. by the 15-Mar-2015). If you do not think
you will be able to meet this date please let me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.

When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) Included your supplementary files in a format you are happy with (no line numbers,
vancouver referencing, track changes removed etc) as these files will NOT be edited in
production
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science and I look
forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get
in touch.
Best wishes
