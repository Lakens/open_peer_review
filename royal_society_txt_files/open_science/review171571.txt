This is an interesting paper experimentally testing the responses of juvenile jackdaws to stuffed
predator (fox) and novel predator (toy elephant) associated with the playback of scolding or
contact calls of jackdaws from the same population. I think the results importantly contribute to
our knowledge of learning the predators and the threat they posses. I have a couple of
suggestions how to improve the manuscript, especially in the methods, which I believe make it
more readable and understandable to a non-specialist reader.
L44-48 – please cite some more recent, empirical studies (preferably with birds/corvids as focal
animals) to support these statements (e.g. Fallow et al. 2013 ProRoySocB 280:issue1754; Suzuki
2014 Animal Behaviour 87:59-65; Bílá et al. 2017 Animal Cognition 20: 43–51)
L96 – please make it clearer, why was the playback associated only with the second predator
presentation (not with the first already)
L136 – why there was a variability of the acclimatization period? Were there some defined marks
of the birds being calm that needed to be observed before the experiment started?
L170 – is the scolding call addressed to the researcher visiting the nest-box relevant signal of a
predator presence? Are there some differences in the scolding calls of jackdaws released when
various predators (human and fox namely) encountered?
L172 – are you sure, there were no relatives of tested juveniles? You mentioned that approx. one
half of tested birds were not marked and their date of hatching was not known, which suggests
their parents were also not known.
Ls181-183 - Please make it more clear, what would the particular playbacks sound like? Is it so
that each speaker played a set of four calls meaning literally just four calls or a set of four trios of
calls, referring to a single individual? In other words, altogether from all three speakers, you
played only the twelve calls of four individuals or three times twelve calls of four individuals?
L355 – please discuss also the possibility that the high inter-individual variability in responses
can be caused by difference in individual experience with predators. It seems that some
individuals were familiar with the fox, as their responses were higher than any others in any
other context (S2), but generally, any individual experience with dangerous animals or scolding
parents could lead to higher responses in your experiment.
Minor comments
L68 – remove „s“
L76 – add latin name for jackdaw

The aim of this experiment was to test the potential for conspecific vocalizations to elicit anti-
predator learning in juvenile jackdaws. This was tested both on a taxidermy fox and a toy
elephant. Results show that responses to the fox remain high throughout the testing, as is
expected from a recognized predator. On the other hand responses tend to decrease towards the
elephant, regardless of whether it is associated with contact or mobbing calls, suggesting that
jackdaws habituated to the stimulus and did not learn that it was dangerous following its
association with mobbing calls. While no evidence for social learning is found here, the authors
highlight two other interesting points of their results: firstly there seems to be a carry-over effect
from one trial to the next as mobbing calls tended to generate increased movement rates in
following presentations. Second, movement rates following stimulus presentations were mainly
explained by movement rates before the presentation (which the authors refer to as agitation).
This manuscript is interesting and well written. However there are a few points that I would like
clarified before I can recommend this manuscript for publication.
The main result (i.e. the lack of social learning) is certainly surprising, especially in the context of
a species often described as "very social" and "clever", making it an interesting result in itself.
While I applaud the attempt to shorten trial times to ensure ethical treatment of the birds, I would
like the authors to show that the acclimatization period was sufficient for the birds to somewhat
habituate to the setting. Without this, it is difficult for the reader to know whether the habituation
observed is towards the elephant, or towards the captive setting in general (where habituation
can be inhibited by the fox model). The authors mention that acclimatization periods vary from
10 to 32 minutes (L136). Was this variation dependent on reaching some kind of criterion? Did the
authors attempt to quantify flight rate during the acclimatization period? Did the authors check
for an effect of duration of acclimatization period on flight rate at the beginning of testing?
The second point I would like to mention is that of the main variable of interest (number of flights
in 60s). I would think that, from the start, individual birds are expected to vary in their flight rate
(regardless of what underlies it: fearfulness, energy levels...). For this reason, considering that
inter-individual variation in flight rates was not the main focus of the experiment, it seems more
intuitive to look at the difference between number of flights before and after the presentation (i.e.
how much the presentation increases the number of flights). Have the authors considered this
kind of analysis?
There is no mention of a difference in responses to the initial presentation of the novel predator
(elephant) and the known predator (fox). If one is expected to be recognized as a threat while not
the other, shouldn't differences in escape response be expected? Could the authors please explain
why they do not discuss this aspect?

- - - Minor comments - - -
L68 - extra "s",

L178 - I would prefer that the measured sound level was explicitly referred to rather than the
volume level.
There are a few issues with brackets, with several instances of extra brackets around references
(ex: L354) and some missing brackets (L136).
I could not find table titles and legends. I do not know if they were forgotten by the authors or
just missing from the manuscript version I was provided.
The analysis seems fine to me. Considering model selection method is fairly well explained, the
tables showing model selection could be moved to the supplementary materials if the editors or
authors wanted to shorten the main text. On the other hand I would have liked to see a table with
details of model p3.model4 included in the main text or in the supplementary materials as it
would be easier to read than the estimates presented one by one (L273, L275).

I have now received two reviews of the manuscript 'Testing social learning of anti-predator
responses in juvenile jackdaws: the importance of accounting for levels of agitation'. Both
reviewers find the presented work interesting, but raise a number of concerns which should be
addressed before publication of the manuscript. More specifically, the reviewers ask for
additional justification whether the acclimatisation period was sufficient, and for the choice of the
main variable.

This is an interesting paper experimentally testing the responses of juvenile jackdaws to stuffed predator
(fox) and novel predator (toy elephant) associated with the playback of scolding or contact calls of
ackdaws from the same population. I think the results importantly contribute to our knowledge of learning
the predators and the threat they posses. I have a couple of suggestions how to improve the manuscript,
especially in the methods, which I believe make it more readable and understandable to a non-specialist
reader.
L44-48 – please cite some more recent, empirical studies (preferably with birds/corvids as focal animals) to
support these statements (e.g. Fallow et al. 2013 ProRoySocB 280:issue1754; Suzuki 2014 Animal
Behaviour 87:59-65; Bílá et al. 2017 Animal Cognition 20: 43–51)
These references have been added, as suggested.
L96 – please make it clearer, why was the playback associated only with the second predator presentation
(not with the first already)
We have added an additional sentence here stating that the first presentation was made without
accompanying playbacks so that a baseline response could be measured.
L136 – why there was a variability of the acclimatization period? Were there some defined marks of the
birds being calm that needed to be observed before the experiment started?
Due to the need to limit the total length of time in captivity for ethical reasons, we aimed to start within 10 to
15 minutes after the bird was released, rather than waiting until a subjective level of behaviour was
reached. The start time was consistent within this range with the exception of 2 of the 48 trials – one that
started after 17 minutes, and one 32 minutes after release. In both cases the additional delay was due to
disturbance from machinery moving in a nearby part of the farm. We had stated the mean (SE) in addition
to the range in line 136 to indicate the consistency in most trials. To add further clarity, we have now
modified the text (L 137-144).
L170 – is the scolding call addressed to the researcher visiting the nest-box relevant signal of a predator
presence? Are there some differences in the scolding calls of jackdaws released when various predators
(human and fox namely) encountered?
There is no evidence in the literature that jackdaws produce predator-specific calls, and previous
experiments on our study populations show that playbacks of scolding calls recorded in response to
humans elicit collective anti-predator as if a predator were present (we now include this information, with a
citation, on L 175-178) . While we do not have recordings of scolds made towards different predators to
formally analyse, scold calls made towards researchers visiting the box sound identical to the calls made
by adult birds towards the fox model in experiments carried out in years prior to this one. There have
recently been a number of studies published that show evidence of birds encoding information about the
predator type and risk level into their calls (e.g. Suzuki, 2014; Carlson et al. 2017 125 77-92; Cunningham
& Magrath 2017 129, 171-179, all in Animal Behaviour), but while we believe that features such as call
duration and rate may be used to indicate the level of danger posed (as in American Crows - Yorzinski &
Vehrencamp 2009, Condor 111, 159-168), it is unlikely that the acoustic structure of scold calls themselves
can be varied to convey information about predator type. This is because they consist of a single drawn out
note, and lacks the spectrographic complexity that other species use to encode such information (e.g.
Suzuki 2014). An example of a spectrograph of three scold calls is provided below:
L172 – are you sure, there were no relatives of tested juveniles? You mentioned that approx. one half of
tested birds were not marked and their date of hatching was not known, which suggests their parents were
also not known.
As only the calls of marked box users were used for the playbacks, and as the juveniles that had fledged
from our boxes were colour ringed prior to fledging, we could be certain that the juveniles that had not
fledged from our boxes could not be the parents of the birds in the call. We have added an additional line to
the text that highlights that we checked the parentage of marked juveniles before the trial commenced to
ensure they did not hear the calls of one of their parents.
Ls181-183 - Please make it more clear, what would the particular playbacks sound like? Is it so that each
speaker played a set of four calls meaning literally just four calls or a set of four trios of calls, referring to a
single individual? In other words, altogether from all three speakers, you played only the twelve calls of four
ndividuals or three times twelve calls of four individuals?
We have modified the text to more clearly state that it is the former – we played 12 calls in total, from 3
ndividuals, with each individual contributing 4 separate calls.
L355 – please discuss also the possibility that the high inter-individual variability in responses can be
caused by difference in individual experience with predators. It seems that some individuals were familiar
with the fox, as their responses were higher than any others in any other context (S2), but generally, any
ndividual experience with dangerous animals or scolding parents could lead to higher responses in your
experiment.
We have added text to the this paragraph (Line 356-357) to acknowledge that prior experience with
predators can influence the responses of individuals in later encounters, citing two studies where varying
evels of generalization in predator recognition were reported.
Minor comments
L68 – remove „s“
Change made as suggested.
L76 – add latin name for jackdaw
Change made as suggested.
L78 – would there be a better reference to the jackdaw repertoire of calls?
The vocal repertoire of jackdaws is poorly described, with little additional work occurring since Franklin
Coombs described the postures and accompanying calls frequently used in his 1968 book ‘The Crows’. A
PhD student at Universität Konstanz recently carried out work on jackdaws that tested whether a backpack
recorder fitted to the birds could be successful at obtaining high quality recordings that could be linked to
the behaviour of observed birds, but at this point the focus of that work is still proving the potential of the
technology, rather than creating a detailed description of the call repertoire of the species.
L208 – I suggest to change the title to Statistical analyses or Data analyses or similar
We have now removed this subheading altogether as the previous subheading suitably describes the
section.

The aim of this experiment was to test the potential for conspecific vocalizations to elicit anti-predator
earning in juvenile jackdaws. This was tested both on a taxidermy fox and a toy elephant. Results show
that responses to the fox remain high throughout the testing, as is expected from a recognized predator.
On the other hand responses tend to decrease towards the elephant, regardless of whether it is associated
with contact or mobbing calls, suggesting that jackdaws habituated to the stimulus and did not learn that it
was dangerous following its association with mobbing calls. While no evidence for social learning is found
here, the authors highlight two other interesting points of their results: firstly there seems to be a carry-over
effect from one trial to the next as mobbing calls tended to generate increased movement rates in following
presentations. Second, movement rates following stimulus presentations were mainly explained by
movement rates before the presentation (which the authors refer to as agitation).
This manuscript is interesting and well written. However there are a few points that I would like clarified
before I can recommend this manuscript for publication.
The main result (i.e. the lack of social learning) is certainly surprising, especially in the context of a species
often described as "very social" and "clever", making it an interesting result in itself. While I applaud the
attempt to shorten trial times to ensure ethical treatment of the birds, I would like the authors to show that
the acclimatization period was sufficient for the birds to somewhat habituate to the setting. Without this, it is
difficult for the reader to know whether the habituation observed is towards the elephant, or towards the
captive setting in general (where habituation can be inhibited by the fox model). The authors mention that
acclimatization periods vary from 10 to 32 minutes (L136). Was this variation dependent on reaching some
kind of criterion? Did the authors attempt to quantify flight rate during the acclimatization period? Did the
authors check for an effect of duration of acclimatization period on flight rate at the beginning of testing?
As with the response to Reviewer 1: We aimed to start within 10 to 15 minutes after the bird was released,
rather than waiting until a subjective level of behaviour was reached. The start time was consistent within
this range with the exception of 2 of the 48 trials – one that started after 17 minutes, and one 32 minutes
after release. In both cases the additional delay due to disturbance from machinery moving in a nearby part
of the farm. In the original submission we provided the mean (SE) of the time between the release of the
bird in to the arena and the start of the trial (line 136) in an attempt to indicate the consistency in most
trials. To add further clarity, we have now modified the text (lines 137-144). Due to the lack of variation
outside of the two outlying cases we have not investigated the effect of the duration of the acclimatization
period on the flight rate at the beginning of testing.
The second point I would like to mention is that of the main variable of interest (number of flights in 60s). I
would think that, from the start, individual birds are expected to vary in their flight rate (regardless of what
underlies it: fearfulness, energy levels...). For this reason, considering that inter-individual variation in flight
rates was not the main focus of the experiment, it seems more intuitive to look at the difference between
number of flights before and after the presentation (i.e. how much the presentation increases the number of
flights). Have the authors considered this kind of analysis?
The reviewer raises a good point about the fact that other factors could influence flight rate than the
predator presentation alone. We chose to use the raw data, rather than calculated differences between the
before and after periods, as this makes full use of the data and avoids the risk of fitting models based on
calculated estimates (which themselves may introduce additional error) rather than raw data.
We note, however, that if we were to use the difference in the number of flights as the response variable
(n.post60-n.pre60) rather than n.post60 with n.pre60 as an explanatory variable, the model selection
procedure returns the same combination of variables and interaction in the best supported model (with the
exception of n.pre60 which is no longer included). However this approach generates a larger ‘top set’ of
candidate models, with reduced certainty as to which is the best supported. As the approach in our original
submission provides a far clearer picture for the reader, both graphically and in terms of the output of the
analyses, we prefer to continue to present the results as they are, rather than using the difference in
number of flights as the response variable.
There is no mention of a difference in responses to the initial presentation of the novel predator (elephant)
and the known predator (fox). If one is expected to be recognized as a threat while not the other, shouldn't
differences in escape response be expected? Could the authors please explain why they do not discuss
this aspect?
This is something that we had addressed in a paragraph of a previous versions of this manuscript, but had
removed in favour of allowing more space for the more general discussion of the issues that can be
encountered when captivity/handling induced agitation are not considered during experiments measuring
animal behaviour. We have added text to the 4th paragraph of the discussion (lines 349-350) to highlight
that this is likely to have been a result of the stress of being brought into captivity.

L68 - extra "s",
Change made as suggested.
L86 - missing word ?
Missing word added.
L178 - I would prefer that the measured sound level was explicitly referred to rather than the volume level.
We have added the typical sound level in decibels.
There are a few issues with brackets, with several instances of extra brackets around references (ex: L354)
and some missing brackets (L136).
These have been corrected.
I could not find table titles and legends. I do not know if they were forgotten by the authors or just missing
from the manuscript version I was provided.
We had issues uploading the tables for submission, and the table titles and legends to appear to have not
been included in the final submission. We apologise for failing to notice this at the time, these have now
been added to the resubmission file.
The analysis seems fine to me. Considering model selection method is fairly well explained, the tables
showing model selection could be moved to the supplementary materials if the editors or authors wanted to
shorten the main text. On the other hand I would have liked to see a table with details of model p3.model4
ncluded in the main text or in the supplementary materials as it would be easier to read than the estimates
presented one by one (L273, L275).
We are happy to have the model selection table moved to the supplementary materials should the editors
believe they would be more suitable there. We have added the model summary table for p3.model4 to the
supplementary material as the reviewer suggests.

Response to Associate Editor Comments
Manuscript: Testing social learning of anti-predator responses in juvenile jackdaws: the importance of
accounting for levels of agitation
Authors: Guillam E. McIvor, Victoria E. Lee, Alex Thornton
Thank you for approving our manuscript for publication. We have made the adjustment to the text
suggested by the Associate Editor as covered below.
Associate Editor's comments:
The authors have adequately addressed the concerns of the initial round of reviews. I have two additional
minor comments:
The additional information about the start of the experiment provided in the responses to the reviewers
"The start time was consistent within this range with the exception of 2 of the 48 trials" is very useful and
should be incorporated into the manuscript.
We have changed the text to include this text (Line 138).
Please ensure to submit descriptions of tables
Table descriptions were included with the uploaded files, but did not appear with the text in the
proofs. We have included these into the word document below the reference list (Lines 565 – 595).
