Summary:
In this work, the authors investigated the effect of using liquid additives on the selective non-
catalytic reduction process. The ethanol, Na2SO4, and methanol were evaluated respectively in
the urea-based SNCR process. The results are practically meaningful to guide the NOx reduction.
However, the paper will be more valuable after major revision.
Overall, I recommend a major revision before accepting for publication.
General comments:
1) The Introduction section is hard to follow. Please pay attention to the logic of the
INTRODUCTION part to make this section easy to understand. For example, the first sentence of
Paragraph 4 (Page 3, Line 9) should be placed in Paragraph 2 (Page 2, Line 38) to explain the
limitation of the gaseous additives. Moreover, the information presented cannot provide
sufficient justification of the experiments designed. Why did the author design the experiment as
presented in Table 1? What was the background information or previous experience that inspired
the author to study the effect of ethanol, Na2SO4, and methanol together?
2) The author should provide more information in the Experimental methods Section. For
example, how many flow reactors were used in the experiment? How to change the quantity of
ethanol and NSR? How to change the temperature? How long was each reactor operated? How to
sample the gas? What is the justification of selecting molar ratio of additives to NO? How to
simulate the mechanism of the NO reduction? What kind of software or platform was used for
the simulation? How to perform the sensitivity analysis?
3) Results and Discussion part. The results should be presented and discussed more
comprehensively and deeply. For example, please consider to combine Section 3.1 and Section 3.3
in order to present the impact of ethanol on the NO reduction process more clearly.
Moreover, please provide more justification of the two experiments relating to Section 3.1 and
Section 3.2. In these two sections, the impact of ethanol and urea to the NO reduction process.
From the introduction part, this paper was to investigate the impact of ethanol on the urea-based
SNCR. It meant that urea-based SNCR is a base and fixed process and the only variable was the
quantity of ethanol; so why did the author change the urea in the experiment?
4) It is highly recommended to polish the language to make the article more understandable.
Specific comments:
1) Page 2, Line 32-36, “CO can be used …, but CO would decrease the NOx removal efficiency”.
Please check this statement as it seems contradictory and hard to understand.
2) Page 2, Line 38, “Given some limitations of gas additives,…” Please present more words about
the limitations of gas additives.
3) Please keep the unit of temperature consistent through the whole article.
4) Page 2, Line 49-56, I am sure whether it is appropriate to present the equations in the sentences.
The common way is to present the Equation in a single row with clearly numbered orderly and
then cite the number (e.g. Eq. 1, Eq. 2…) in the sentences.
5) Page 3, Line 3, please revise the denotation of free radical. OH radical should be OH•.

Appendix A
Reviewer 1:
(1) Thank you for your advice. I’ve adjusted the logic of the
INTRODUCTION part and the revised sentence is in Paragraph
1(Page 2, Line 39), “Fortunately, this restricted narrow temperature
window could be widened and dropped to a lower temperature range
through the injection of effective additives together with reductants,
although gaseous additives cannot be transported and stored properly
because they have a risk of exploding.”.
I design the experiment as presented in Table 1 for two reasons.
One is that the promotion effect of CO on NOX reduction is confirmed
by many scientists such as I mentioned in Paragraph 2(Page 2,
Line45-51) and CO can be gained from decomposition of alcohols. CO
is hard to be stored or transported. Alcohols and Na additives are
found to have a certain promoting effect on NO removal as mentioned
in Paragraph 2(Page 2, Line 52-58). The synergistic effect of different
additives on NO reduction is hardly to be studied. The another reason is
that the price of ethanol, Na2SO4, and methanol is cheap, and the
experiment is related to a cooperative project with DONGFANG
BOILER GROUP CO., LTD. Taking the economic cost and demand of
company, I design the experiment as presented in Table 1.
(2) Thank you for your question. There is only one reactor in the
experiment mentioned in the Section 2.2(Page 3, Line90-92). The
quantity of ethanol and other additives are changed by the normalized
stoichiometric ratio of additives to NO, which is similar to definition
of normalized stoichiometric ratio of N-agent to NO (NSR). The
quantity of NO is constant and the quantity of additives and urea are
variate. The temperature is changed by an automatic temperature
controller mentioned in the Section 2.2(Page 3, Line94). The reactor
operates from the beginning to the end of the experiment and the
residence time of the simulated gas is 1.2s in the isothermal region
dependent of the temperature since the mass flow is held constant,
which can guarantee the SNCR reactions execute completely
mentioned in the Section 2.2(Page 3, Line97-99). Sample gas are
continuously measured by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) flue gas
analyzer (ProtIR 204M) mentioned in the Section 2.2(Page 4,
Line111-112). The molar ratio of additives to NO is chose on the basis
of previous experience and economic cost.
The mechanism of the NO reduction mainly comes from the AA
mechanism developed by Zabetta and Hupa [1] and an attempt is made
to modify and validate it to obtain reasonable simulation of SNCR
reaction performance with additives. CHEMKIN is used to simulate
the reaction and the sensitivity analysis comes with the software.
(3) Thank you for your advice. Although Section 3.1 and Section
3.3 are both related to presenting the impact of ethanol on the NO
reduction process, their experimental conditions (listed in the ESM)
are different. The quantity of ethanol in the two experiment is the same
but the quantity of urea is different. The urea/NO=1.0 in the Section
3.1 while the urea/NO=1.25 in the Section 3.3. The purpose of Section
3.1 is to optimize the best proportion of adding ethanol additive. The
experiment of Section 3.2 is to select reasonable value of NSR for
better NO removal efficiency on the basis of the best proportion of
adding ethanol additives. After all, the effect of NSR on the SNCR
process is great. Then, the goal of Section 3.3 is to deeply research the
effect of ethanol additive on the secondary pollutants on the basis of
the best proportion of adding ethanol additive and reasonable value of
NSR. All selection principles of the proportion are based on the
experience of predecessors and economic cost.
“Urea-based SNCR process” means that the reducing agent of
SNCR process is only urea in this paper. Because the reducing agent of
SNCR process can be NH3, NH4HCO3, hydrazine hydrate and some
other N-agents, I just want to stress the reducing agent is urea. The
quantity of urea, which is equal to NSR, has great impact on SNCR
process. Thus, after the experiment of Section 3.2, where reasonable
value of NSR is selected, the quantity of urea in all the experiments is
fixed.
(4) Thank you for your advice. The language of this paper had
been polished by ShineWrite.com before submission. The certificate
will be uploaded as a separate file.
1) Page 2, Line 47-48, “Similar results were obtained, but CO
would decrease the NOX removal efficiency” has been modified to
“Similar results were obtained for shifting the temperature window to
a lower range, but CO would decrease the NOX removal efficiency” as
mentioned in Page 2, Line 48-49.
2) Page 2, Line 51, “Given some limitations of gas additives,…”.
Actually, the limitations of gas additives have been listed in Page 2,
Line 39, “although gaseous additives cannot be transported and stored
properly because they have a risk of exploding.”
3) I’m confused about the advice “keep the unit of temperature
consistent through the whole article”. All my experiments are
conducted during the temperature range 650 °C–900 °C. If it means
the format, I have checked it again.
4) Thank you for your advice. I have modified the format as
mentioned in Page 6, Line 119 and 129.
5) All the denotation of free radical have been revised.
6) Page 5, Line 32-35, “When a=0.6, ….while the addition …of
N2O.” has been revised to “When a = 0.6, the maximum emission of
N2O reaches 33 ppm at 800 °C, while continuously adding ethanol has
little impact on the emission of N2O.” as mentioned in Page 6, Line
191-193.
7) Thank you for your advice. All the information of reference
has been completed.
8) Thank you for your advice. I have revised the format of
C2H5OH.

Reviewer 2:
(1) Thank you for your advice. The impact of ethanol on urea
based SNCR process is deeply exposed through experiment and
simulation. Meanwhile, a novel way of compound additives is found
and their synergistic effect on NO reduction is worth exploring.
(2) Thank you for your advice. Error bars have been added in
figures.
(3) Thank you for your advice. Every figure I submit is checked
to ensure that the format of them is tiff image file.
(4) Thank you for your advice. The proposed mechanism is based
on the AA mechanism developed by Zabetta and Hupa, which is
relatively mature mechanism. More reactions will need a lot of
computing time, which will influence the computational efficiency.

Reviewer 3:
Thank you for your advice. I’m sure that the quantity of each gas,
additives, and urea is calculated strictly and verified. The error bars are
added in figures. The residence time is mentioned in Section 2.2, Line
96. The tube of the reactor and the rate of flow is remained the same,
so the residence time is constant in the whole experiment.
