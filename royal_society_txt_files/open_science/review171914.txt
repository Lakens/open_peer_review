This is a fascinating paper using CT reconstructions of thylacine pouch young to construct
growth curves. The methods appear sound and the provision of the data will makes this a
valuable public resource. As the authors note, the thylacine was an amazing case of convergent
evolution, bearing many features like carnivorans. I don't find any faults with this well-written
manuscript. If anything, I would like to see a bit more discussion about allometric comparisons to
some of the extant carnivores mentioned in the last paragraph (lines 421-428). Although it is
necessarily speculative, what does positive allometric growth rates mean compared to isometric
or negative ones?

In this paper, Newman et al. describe for the first time a developmental series of Tasmanian
Tiger, painstakingly collected from specimens all over the globe. They assess the growth of the
species and correct the age estimates for some museum specimens, and trace the limb growth
from the early stages that are typical for a pouch-climbing marsupial to the adult form.
The paper has merit by covering the arguably most iconic of marspial species, which despite its
unusual morphology and known unusual cranial shape by all appearances develops like any
3
standard marsupial in most aspects. The low sample size of specimens (thirteen specimens from
six litters, six of which were CT scanned and used for allometry analyses) does not allow
particularly extensive conclusions, but this is the best coverage we will ever have of the enigmatic
Thylacine. However, I recommend major revisions to clarify some analyses, possibly re-do some,
and add some additional discussion as outlined below.
Introduction:
The introduction is comprehensive but quite verbose and could be cut down a bit (for example
the paragraph on CT might not need to be so extensive because it is by now a fairly standard
method of investigation).
Materials and Methods:
The scanning of these animals is a great effort given the age and difficulty of access. It is also
great that the 3D data have been made publicly available! I could not find the raw measurements
for the allometric analyses though, which should be shown somewhere to get a better feeling for
the accuracy of the results.
Results and Discussion:
CRL/Age: The age vs. CRL analysis appears to be based on two data points only (the youngest
and oldest specimen, with the other four specimens age-adjusted to provide an optimal linear fit.
It is true that other marsupials show a strong linear relationship between CRL and age, but I
think that this interpolation based on just two specimens is a bit of a stretch nevertheless. At the
very least there needs to be a more extended discussion of the confidence at which the age
interpolation is made; the studies cited as evidence of a linear fit tend to have confidence intervals
or at least some scatter plots which such a discussion can be based on. Fig. 3 should also show
which specimens have known ages and which are interpolated; as a smaller point, it is not clear
whether the length vs. age analysis presented in Fig. 3 is for all 13 specimens available or only for
the six scanned specimens.
Limb allometry: I suspect that this analysis overlooks the fact that the three earlier stages
investigated (up to 9.5 weeks) do not have long bone epiphyses ossified, whereas those
afterwards do. Epiphyses contribute substantially to overall bone length and but remain
cartilaginous until very late. As far as I can see, the specimen in Fig. 6 has no epiphyses and the
specimen in Fig. 7 has them. I therefore recommend that the long bone allometry data (six
datapoints, half of which without epiphyses as far as I can see) be flagged as needing a high
degree of caution. Or perhaps the analysis could be re-done with diaphysis-only measurements?
I also do not quite understand the analysis for intra-bone allometry – it seems that RMA was
done on bone length and mid-shaft circumference (presumably with circumference as the
dependent variable as in the Lentle paper?) and the slope was compared with Lentle et al.’s work
on possum and wallaby allometry. The authors in this paper use mid-shaft circumference, but the
Lentle paper seems to use simple width, which might be an issue of explanation but as it stands it
does not look like the allometry analyses in this and Lentle’s paper are equivalent.
Heterochrony: The discussion of the heterochrony between fore- and hind limb should be
adjusted. Heterochrony is change in developmental time or rate relative to an ancestral condition,
(or relative to a sister clade). “Early heterochrony” (l. 394) does not exist and it is also not
something that can be “overcome” (l. 398). As a smaller point, marsupial forelimbs are often
called “accelerated” but it is at least equally likely that it is the hind limb that is decelerated (e.g.
Sears 2009, doi:10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00690.x; Weisbecker 2008: 10.1111/j.1558-
5646.2008.00424.x).
With regards to the paragraph starting on l. 404, greater postnatal growth of the hind limb, and
the hind limb overtaking the forelimb, is normal for marsupials (if only because there are no hind
4
limbs to speak of at birth). This can also be inferred from the Lentle paper and Beiringer & Sears
(2014, 10.1002/jez.b.22556) provide a detailed discussion of this effect, so it is worth adding this
literature to the discussion of the results.
In the paragraph starting 421, I don’t think it is fair to say that thylacines are distinct among
marsupials based on a comparison of bone allometry with two other marsupial species which
happen to be both of very sturdy build. It is true that the allometry is consistent with that of
placental terrestrial cursors, but there are too few data to suggest that thylacines are truly distinct.
There are many marsupials with far more gracile skeletons than tammars and brushtails, which
might resemble the thylacine morphotype and development more (e.g. bilbies or gliders).

Thank you to both reviewers for their helpful comments on the paper. Given that the thylacine is
extinct, we are unable to increase our sample size, but as you will see from our responses to the
comments below, we have adjusted the language especially in the conclusions to better reflect our
confidence given the sample limitations. We believe these changes have resulted in a much

Thank you for your feedback. In response to this comment and those from Reviewer 2, we have
reworked the section on allometry, lines 419- 436, to better associate different allometric patterns
with body mass and locomotory characteristics in mammals based on published data. We have also
added new text describing how large-bodied carnivorans like felids and canids may have overcome
size-dependent allometric constraints by evolving specialized locomotory features, and suggest that
thylacines may have evolved similar adaptations.

some additional discussion as outlined below.
Introduction:
The introduction is comprehensive but quite verbose and could be cut down a bit (for example the
paragraph on CT might not need to be so extensive because it is by now a fairly standard method of
investigation).
Thank you for your feedback. We have reduced the paragraph on CT and merged it with the
following paragraph. Lines 103-115.
Materials and Methods:
The scanning of these animals is a great effort given the age and difficulty of access. It is also great
that the 3D data have been made publicly available! I could not find the raw measurements for the
allometric analyses though, which should be shown somewhere to get a better feeling for the
accuracy of the results.
The allometric length and circumference measurements for all pouch young, as well as the juvenile
and adult specimens, have been included in a new supplementary table 1.
Results and Discussion:
CRL/Age: The age vs. CRL analysis appears to be based on two data points only (the youngest and
oldest specimen, with the other four specimens age-adjusted to provide an optimal linear fit. It is
true that other marsupials show a strong linear relationship between CRL and age, but I think that
this interpolation based on just two specimens is a bit of a stretch nevertheless. At the very least
there needs to be a more extended discussion of the confidence at which the age interpolation is
made; the studies cited as evidence of a linear fit tend to have confidence intervals or at least some
scatter plots which such a discussion can be based on. Fig. 3 should also show which specimens
have known ages and which are interpolated; as a smaller point, it is not clear whether the length
vs. age analysis presented in Fig. 3 is for all 13 specimens available or only for the six scanned
specimens.
Thanks for the suggestions. We have amended lines 189-199 in the methods to clarify the
measurements and which individuals were included in the regression analyses, also now specified
as (n=10) in the text. We have fixed Figure 3b to show different markers for the specimens to
distinguish between ‘known’ and estimated ages, with corresponding text in the figure legend. We
have also amended results and discussion lines 241-255 to emphasize that the interpolated ages are
estimates and the confidence in the regression curve is limited due to the low sample size. However
given the strong relationship between CRL and age in marsupials, we feel the estimates are a
reasonable assumption.
Limb allometry: I suspect that this analysis overlooks the fact that the three earlier stages
investigated (up to 9.5 weeks) do not have long bone epiphyses ossified, whereas those afterwards
do. Epiphyses contribute substantially to overall bone length and but remain cartilaginous until
very late. As far as I can see, the specimen in Fig. 6 has no epiphyses and the specimen in Fig. 7
has them. I therefore recommend that the long bone allometry data (six datapoints, half of which
without epiphyses as far as I can see) be flagged as needing a high degree of caution. Or perhaps
the analysis could be re-done with diaphysis-only measurements?
The allometric analyses were calculated using length vs circumference measurements for 5 pouch
young and 8 juvenile to adult specimens (n=13). This is a very good point and could potentially
influence the results, however we found that running the RMA analyses excluding the 4 early pouch
young specimens without fully ossified epiphyses (1.5, 4.5, 5.25, 9.5 weeks; n=9) yields similar
positive allometric growth patterns for all long bones (but with a lower R2), as shown in the table
below. We have included a brief discussion of this in lines 416-418 in the text.

I also do not quite understand the analysis for intra-bone allometry – it seems that RMA was done
on bone length and mid-shaft circumference (presumably with circumference as the dependent
variable as in the Lentle paper?) and the slope was compared with Lentle et al.’s work on possum
and wallaby allometry. The authors in this paper use mid-shaft circumference, but the Lentle paper
seems to use simple width, which might be an issue of explanation but as it stands it does not look
like the allometry analyses in this and Lentle’s paper are equivalent.
We performed the allometry analyses following methods described in Kilbourne & Mackovicky
(2012) using long bone length vs midshaft circumference. Our data is therefore directly compatible
with their species coverage, however these only included placental mammals. Unfortunately few
studies have been performed looking at lone bone allometry in marsupials, with the only somewhat
comparable studies using long bone length vs midshaft diameter are by Lentle, as well as a new
reference we have added by Lammer & Germam 2002. Our results/discussion section has now been
reworked to clearly acknowledge this shortcoming in comparative data, and to suggest how further
sampling of other larger bodied and predatory marsupials may help to disentangle the effects of
body size, ecology, and phylogeny on thylacine development, lines 428-436.
Heterochrony: The discussion of the heterochrony between fore- and hind limb should be adjusted.
Heterochrony is change in developmental time or rate relative to an ancestral condition, (or
relative to a sister clade). “Early heterochrony” (l. 394) does not exist and it is also not something
that can be “overcome” (l. 398). As a smaller point, marsupial forelimbs are often called
“accelerated” but it is at least equally likely that it is the hind limb that is decelerated (e.g. Sears
2009, doi:10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00690.x; Weisbecker 2008: 10.1111/j.1558-
5646.2008.00424.x).
Thank you for clarifying this, the text has been amended to “Heterochrony” from ‘Early
heterochrony’ line 388, and from ‘heterochrony was overcome’ to: “the developmental lag of the
hindlimb was overcome after ~8 weeks of pouch development….” lines 392-393.
With regards to the paragraph starting on l. 404, greater postnatal growth of the hind limb, and the
hind limb overtaking the forelimb, is normal for marsupials (if only because there are no hind limbs
to speak of at birth). This can also be inferred from the Lentle paper and Beiringer & Sears (2014,
10.1002/jez.b.22556) provide a detailed discussion of this effect, so it is worth adding this literature
to the discussion of the results.
Thank you for the suggestion, we have added the sentence: “Therefore, despite its unique adult
morphology, the thylacine was subjected to the same conserved ontogenetic growth trajectories
between both sets of limbs to that observed in other marsupials.” line 397-399, including references
for Beringer & Sears (2014), Lentle (2006), Chew (2014) and Martin (2003).
In the paragraph starting 421, I don’t think it is fair to say that thylacines are distinct among
marsupials based on a comparison of bone allometry with two other marsupial species which
happen to be both of very sturdy build. It is true that the allometry is consistent with that of
placental terrestrial cursors, but there are too few data to suggest that thylacines are truly distinct.
There are many marsupials with far more gracile skeletons than tammars and brushtails, which
might resemble the thylacine morphotype and development more (e.g. bilbies or gliders).
