This report is one of many arising from the Stockholm Sleepy Brain Project. The strengths of the
program are that they have a good number of participants performing standardized tasks
designed to test specific cognitive or affective constructs. The authors pre-register their
expectations of the data. Data are processed with considerable care and finesse. The reporting of
results is of high quality.
In this installment, the authors examined emotional regulation of emotional face pictures and
either kept a neutral stance, enhanced or suppressed their emotional response to a given picture.
Young and old adults were studied. The condition of interest was restriction of sleep to 3h/night
for a single night. The authors collected subjective self-reports of ability to regulate emotion as
well as imaging data which examined both activation magnitude and functional connectivity
assessed using PPI methodology. Specific ROIs were targeted during analysis.
The documentation of the motivation for the work and the description of the experiment and the
result presentation were admirably clear. Although the study was a negative one especially with
respect to the age / sleep loss interaction, I believe that its strengths alluded to earlier merit
eventual publication of the findings.
Major comments:
1. The task may be one that is widely used, but I’m concerned by the absence of objective
behavioral and physiologic findings to back up their assertion of impaired regulation of
emotional response to pictures with sleep restriction. The behavioral limitation arises from a task
that only collects subjective ratings. The lack of physiological support was not for want of trying.
The authors collected HR and pupil diameter measures, but the error variance precluded finding
effects worthy of reporting in the main text. This should prompt the authors to soften their stance
on their interpretation of the neuroimaging findings and in casting the title. It seems as if they are
casting doubt on the validity of previous work by Yoo (2007), Motomura (2013) and Prather
(2013) in the title and discussion.
2. The imaging results showing the effects of the negative stimulus and the effects of regulation
but do not show the hypothesized effects of sleep restriction. I believe that contributing to this
finding is that previous work was based on stronger manipulation of sleep: a single night of total
sleep deprivation (Yoo 2007) or 5 nights of restriction to 4h/night TIB (Motomura) or multiple
nights of habitual (poorer) sleep quality (Prather). This point is related to #1 – a failure to
discover an effect found by others should not be taken as the mechanism proposed by earlier
work to be invalid. This rather than the low power (this is not the case!) of the study is likely to be
why this and a previous imaging study showed negative findings relative to prior literature. At
the very least, this possibility should be added to the list of limitations.

Tamm and colleagues have investigated the effects of sleep restriction on emotional regulation in
old and young participants. They found hemodynamic changes and behavioral results somewhat
consistent with the previous literature, yet no effect of sleep restriction on fMRI-measured
activations.
The article is presented in a concise but detailed and honest manner. I believe the result is
interesting for researchers in the field. My main comment concerns the misuh nderstanding of the
instructions and the possibility that this appeared reflected in the fMRI results. I’d like to ask the
authors to explain with more detail the nature of the misunderstanding by the older participants.
This has the benefit of warning future researchers of potential pitfalls that might have gone
unnoticed so far, especially considering that the rate of misunderstanding of the instructions
seems to be higher than in other previous publications. Also, I wonder if the self-assessed rating
of the success by the participants could be used to separate high vs. low success trials and run
fMRI covariates with each separate division. It would be interesting to see how the success relates
to the fMRI activations and whether sleep-related changes are contingent to one or the other
group.

Appendix A
We would like to thank the reviewers for their thorough review of our manuscript and
or the constructive comments and suggestions, which have helped improve the
manuscript. Our responses are stated below in italics. All changes are marked with
yellow in the manuscript.
Reviewer 1.
1. The task may be one that is widely used, but I’m concerned by the absence of
objective behavioral and physiologic findings to back up their assertion of impaired
egulation of emotional response to pictures with sleep restriction. The behavioral
imitation arises from a task that only collects subjective ratings. The lack of
physiological support was not for want of trying. The authors collected HR and pupil
diameter measures, but the error variance precluded finding effects worthy of
eporting in the main text. This should prompt the authors to soften their stance on
heir interpretation of the neuroimaging findings and in casting the title. It seems as if
hey are casting doubt on the validity of previous work by Yoo (2007), Motomura
2013) and Prather (2013) in the title and discussion.
We agree with the reviewer that the lack of effects on other behavioral and psychologic
measures apart from self-rated success is indeed a shortcoming of the present study. As
suggested, we have now slightly changed the wording in the discussion (lines 502-503,
508, 557, 561-563) and the conclusion (line 576).
2. The imaging results showing the effects of the negative stimulus and the effects
of regulation but do not show the hypothesized effects of sleep restriction. I believe
hat contributing to this finding is that previous work was based on stronger
manipulation of sleep: a single night of total sleep deprivation (Yoo 2007) or 5 nights
of restriction to 4h/night TIB (Motomura) or multiple nights of habitual (poorer) sleep
quality (Prather). This point is related to #1 – a failure to discover an effect found by
others should not be taken as the mechanism proposed by earlier work to be invalid.
This rather than the low power (this is not the case!) of the study is likely to be why
his and a previous imaging study showed negative findings relative to prior
iterature. At the very least, this possibility should be added to the list of limitations.
We agree with the reviewer that the difference in the type of sleep manipulation could
ndeed been an explanation behind the differences between this and previous studies.
This is now specifically commented on in the discussion (lines 500-501) and limitations
line 555). We have also made it clear in the abstract that this study used partial sleep
estriction.

The article is presented in a concise but detailed and honest manner. I believe the

esearchers of potential pitfalls that might have gone unnoticed so far, especially
considering that the rate of misunderstanding of the instructions seems to be higher
han in other previous publications.
This is indeed an important point and we have added a short explanation in the
method section (lines 165-167).
Also, I wonder if the self-assessed rating of the success by the participants could be
used to separate high vs. low success trials and run fMRI covariates with each
separate division. It would be interesting to see how the success relates to the fMRI
activations and whether sleep-related changes are contingent to one or the other
group.
We agree with the reviewer that it would be interesting to relate the self-rated success
o fMRI results. However, intra-individual variability for each type of instruction was
ow, limiting the scope for analyses of this kind.
