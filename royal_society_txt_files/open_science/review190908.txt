Thank you for an interesting piece of work.
I could not easily see how the data on which the models were based could be accessed although I
understand they are available.
General writing style is a little loose, with many sentences starting with dependent clauses or
unnecessary phrases such as ‘it is necessary to…’ ‘I also considered…’ ‘this is described by..’ In
almost all cases these can be removed and the sentence made more concise.
Check spelling of Fraxinus (not Fraxineus) throughout.

mountain pine beetle outbreaks really adds much. As species examples they might be mentioned
in the last sentence of the introductory paragraph and the rest cut.

The manuscript by M. Evans entitled „Can natural resistance save ash populations from ash
dieback disease?“ describes a study on the development of population sizes of ash trees under
3
ash dieback in the next 100 years in the UK by means of simulation models. Ash dieback is a
serious tree disease that causes a dramatic decline of economically and ecologically important ash
tree species in Europe. The question of future development of ash populations in Europe is of
importance and I think it is relevant for the readership of RSOS.
In my opinion, the study generated only two reliable results: (1) within the next 100 years (and
without breeding), the degree of susceptibility in the ash population has a larger impact on
population decline than the degree of heritability of the susceptibility (or resistance). (2) The tree
species that will benefit the most from ash decline in the UK is probably sycamore. Honestly, I
think these two results are somewhat trivial. The first, as the author admits in the discussion, is
not at all surprising when considering that 100 years correspond to only 2-3 generations of ash
trees. The second result is what probably every forester in the UK would have guessed without
any modelling, and only confirms what Needham et al. already reported in their paper in 2016.
Other results of the manuscript, such as the magnitude and speed of the population decline, are
in my opinion too dependent on unknown variables to be reliable, and the author seems to agree
with this.
However, I still enjoyed reading the manuscript. To be precise: rather than the results I found the
methods very interesting and informative. The strength of the manuscript is the description on
how presumptions and estimates for the model were made. While I do not agree with many
presumptions the author made (see specific comments directly in the manuscript in the attached
pdf file), reading the manuscript sharpened my eye for the significance and the
interdependencies of different aspects of ash dieback, such as mortality, growth reduction and
the degree of resistance, and I believe that it would have the same effect on other researchers. I
thus consider the manuscript generally worthy to be published, although the editor may have
another opinion.
In the introduction, very little information is given about SORTIE, which is a forest gap model
that was used as a basis for this study. I think it is necessary to provide some more information,
especially on how competition power of tree species is implemented in this model. It is not very
clear from the description in the manuscript, if or how loss of competition power due to disease-
induced weakening was taken into account in the model. In the estimation of mortality rates, I
think it is problematic that tree age was not taken into account (or only taken into account as the
time a tree has been exposed to the disease). In younger trees, ash dieback is much more likely to
cause mortality in a given time than in older trees. Mortality of the whole population thus
depends on the age distribution of the population, and will change as the age distribution
changes. In the estimation of offspring characteristics, random mating between all individuals
was assumed. However, when compared to healthy (resistant) individuals, diseased trees are less
likely to produce offspring. There are several recent papers by Semizer-Cuming et al. on gene
flow in ash, which should be considered here. If populations of ash become very small, infection
pressure will very likely decrease significantly (“dilution effect”). If these issues are too complex
to be implemented in the model, they should at least be explained in the method section and/or
discussion section. The limitations and weaknesses of the models should be presented more
clearly in the discussion.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
This is an excellent and timely study. The adaptation of the well established SORTIE model for
ash dieback is a very useful contribution to the growing literature predicting the impact of this
disease. It is highly relevant to the policy question of whether or not a breeding programme is
needed for ash, as the MS title suggests. It is also highly relevant for estimating the total economic
cost of ash dieback. Hill et al (2019, Current Biology) recently estimated the full economic cost of
ash dieback in Britain at £15bn. The author of the present MS might wish to comment on how the
predictions of his model would affect this estimate.
My comments below are mainly to do with clarity of presentation.
Terms like “save ash populations” and “ash populations may survive” are ambiguous. What
does salvation of a population mean? Zero reduction in size? Reduction to any viable population
size, however small that may be? I suggest that this could be more precisely framed.
The MS could emphasize more that the simulation is over the course of one century, in a
woodland where ash has to compete with other tree species. Thus, for example, the MS title
might better describe the paper if it were “How many ash trees will survive ash dieback in a
British woodland during the next century?”
The approach of the SORTIE model, its parameterization on Whytham woods, and the timeframe
used need to be described more fully in the MS. I suggest the abstract should mention that the
model is for Whytham woods in particular, and for a 97-year timeframe. The introduction should
contain a paragraph that briefly describes what the model seeks to do, how it works and what
parameters it needs. It should also briefly describe the size of Whytham woods and its tree
composition, and the size of the area simulated in the model.
I think that the current second and third paragraphs of the introduction could be omitted without
significant detriment to the MS, as they merely give other examples of forest pests and pathogens.
More relevant would be examples (if any exist) of other forest pests and pathogens for which
models of impacts have been made similar to the work of the present MS. If none exist, this could
be pointed out.
I suggest that Needham et al 2016 is discussed prior to the final paragraph of the introduction,
5
and the final paragraph of the introduction focuses more exclusively on the work reported in the
present MS.
Heritability of resistance is an important parameter for the MS. As far as I am aware, no one has
yet estimated heritability of mortality due to ash dieback. All the estimates of heritability are of
ash dieback damage scores such as crown dieback and lesion length, as far as I am aware. If this
is the case it would be worth noting. It is also worth noting that (as far as I am aware) all
estimates of heritability so far have been in plantations with fairly uniform environments. In
natural woodlands environmental variation is likely to be much greater, leading to lower
heritability of resistance traits.
Abstract line 20/21 “These observations have LED TO SUGGESTIONS that…”
Page 7 line 57. With a strict regard to its Latin origin, the term “decimated” means “reduced by
one in ten”.
Page 15 “One feature not considered in the model presented here is that the selection differential
is likely to change throughout the period considered. This is partly because intense selection will
reduce the genetic variance in the offspring population (51), and also because as susceptible
individuals die the proportion of the pollen in the air that originated from resistant fathers will
rise and so the probability of resistant offspring being produced will increase. It is likely that both
these effects will result in there being a higher population of resistant ash than suggested here.”
This is an important caveat, especially if we are interested in timeframes of over a century, which
deserves more emphasis.
Page 16 “The current hypothesis is that, probably in part, resistance is conferred by earlier spring
leaf flushing and earlier autumn leaf senescence (15, 26)” this is only one of several hypotheses. If
true, this phenology trend may simply allow escape of trees that flush and senesce earlier than
other trees – if the whole population shifts to earlier flushing and senescence, this advantage may
be lost.
Figure 1. A fuller first part of the legend would be helpful to the reader.
The MS could be clearer on how the reader can access the data and code used.
In future it would be useful if the author modelled the effects of management interventions like
the felling of diseased trees, or the planting of “replacement” species for ash.

The manuscript has significantly improved. Most of my comments and suggestions have been
taken into account by the author, although sometimes somewhat desultory, but I guess that is ok.
I still think that the presentation of Figure 1 needs improvement, i.e. increased font size, and
figure legends would make it much easier for the reader to understand and to extract the relevant
information.
I am still confused by the calculation described in page 11. The calculated mid-points are, as I
understand, the mid-points of the standard deviation range of percent damage scores of offspring
of susceptible and resistant trees. If this is correct, I would expect the mid-point of offspring of
resistant trees to be smaller than those of offspring of intermediate and susceptible trees.
Apparently, there is something that I did not understand, but I admit that this may be my
personal problem.
I could not find a statement in the discussion that a strong reduction of the host population and
the number of susceptible trees is likely to cause a decrease in infection pressure.

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript has significantly improved. Most of my comments and suggestions have been
taken into account by the author, although sometimes somewhat desultory, but I guess that is ok.
I still think that the presentation of Figure 1 needs improvement, i.e. increased font size, and
figure legends would make it much easier for the reader to understand and to extract the relevant
information.
I am still confused by the calculation described in page 11. The calculated mid-points are, as I
understand, the mid-points of the standard deviation range of percent damage scores of offspring
of susceptible and resistant trees. If this is correct, I would expect the mid-point of offspring of
resistant trees to be smaller than those of offspring of intermediate and susceptible trees.
Apparently, there is something that I did not understand, but I admit that this may be my
personal problem.
I could not find a statement in the discussion that a strong reduction of the host population and
the number of susceptible trees is likely to cause a decrease in infection pressure.

3 Abstract
4
5
6 Novel pests and diseases are becoming increasingly frequent, and often cause additional
7
8 mortality to host species in the newly contacted communities. This can alter the structure of
9
10
11 the community and/or the continued presence of impacted host species. In the last twenty
12
13 years ash dieback disease (ADB) has spread into Europe from East Asia. It has caused
14
15
16 substantial mortality in ash tree (Fraxineus excelsior, L.) populations. However, a proportion
17
18 of the individuals in most populations appears to be less susceptible to ADB and resistance
19
20
seems to have high heritability. These observations have suggested that ash populations
21
22
23 may survive the disease. In order to test this hypothesis, I modified an existing model of UK
24
25 woodland to take into account the impact of ADB, and allowed offspring to inherit
26
27
28 resistance traits from their parent. The results suggest that ash populations could be
29
30 sustainable but at lower levels than they are currently. For example, when the proportion of
31
32
33 resistant individuals is about 10% and heritability of resistance is 0.5 then the population of
34
35 ash falls to about one third of present levels. The influence of the proportion of individuals
36
37
38
initially resistant to ADB was larger than the heritability of resistance. The fact that the size
39
40 of the resistant population is important to achieving a high population size in the presence
41
42
of ADB suggests that a selective breeding programme with the intention of augmenting the
43
44
45 natural ash populations would be beneficial.

3 Introduction
4
5
6 Anthropogenically induced environmental changes; from climate change, to accessible long-
7
8 distance transport, to the trade in living organisms and natural products; are increasing the
9
10
11 frequency of introduced and native pests and pathogens (1-3). This increase in pests and
12
13 diseases is having major impacts on native species, causing additional mortality and/or
14
15
16 reduced vitality (4). It seems likely that long-lived, slow-reproducing species will be
17
18 particularly susceptible to novel pathogens. Forest trees, for example, have been shown to
19
20
be at increasing risk from pests and pathogens that are changing their distributions as a
21
22
23 result both of climate change, and being introduced to new areas via trade and transport (2,
24
25 5-8). The resultant additional mortality and morbidity can have substantial impacts on forest
26
27
28 structure (7, 8).
29
30
31 There are many examples of the individual and population-level impacts of
32
33
34 outbreaks of pests and pathogens in forests (6). A well-known one would be Dutch elm
35
36 disease which is caused by ascomycete fungi (Ophiostoma spp., Syd. & P. Syd, 1919) that
37
38
39 arrived in Europe and North America in the mid-20th Century, probably via imported timber
40
41 (9). The fungus is introduced into trees by bark beetles of the genus Scolytus (Geoffroy,
42
43
44 1762) and resulted in high mortality of several, once abundant, species of elm (Ulmus spp.,
45
46 L.) (10). Populations of affected elm species remain very low. The mountain pine beetle
47
48
49
(Dendroctonus ponderosae, Hopkins, 1902) is currently having a major impact. It is native to
50
51 the western pine forests of North America an ecosystem that is maintained by periodic fires,
52
53 which produce extensive stands of similarly aged trees within the forest (5). Changes in
54
55
56 climate, increased temperatures in both summer and winter along with reduced
57
58 precipitation, has allowed the mountain pine beetle to expand its range further north and to
59
60
3
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 5 of 24 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 higher elevations into new forest ecosystems (11). This expansion has resulted in changes
4
5
6 in forest structure and function; for example, it has resulted in the conversion of the forest
7
8 from a small net carbon sink into a large net carbon source (5, 12). Outbreaks of mountain
9
10
11 pine beetle in North America are contributing significantly to the almost 100 million
12
13 hectares of forest globally that were estimated to have been affected by pests and diseases
14
15
16 in 2015 (13).
17
18
19 Although for many novel pests and diseases an impacted host population might be
20
21
22 expected to have high susceptibility with few evolved mechanisms of resistance, not all
23
24 outbreaks result in the deaths of all affected individuals. Plants have immune mechanisms
25
26
27
that allow them to defend themselves against pathogens, for a recent review see (14). Some
28
29 individuals may also have traits which predispose them to be more or less susceptible to a
30
31 particular disease, for example early leaf senescence in the autumn seems to be associated
32
33
34 with reduced susceptibility to ash dieback disease (15). Similarly resistance to Dutch elm
35
36 disease seems to be associated with early bud burst in the spring (16). A critical question in
37
38
39 such a situation is whether there are sufficient numbers of resistant individuals, and a
40
41 sufficiently high probability of offspring inheriting traits that confer resistance, to allow
42
43
44 population persistence in the medium and long term.
45
46
47 Ash dieback (ADB) is caused by a fungus (Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, Baral et al.,
48
49
50 2014) which is native to East Asia, and has colonized Europe in the last twenty years (17,
51
52 18). Within Europe it was first reported from Poland in the early 1990s and has since spread
53
54
55
across the continent (19). ADB has been shown to cause significant mortality of ash trees
56
57 (Fraxineus excelsior, L.). A recent meta-analysis of the literature suggests that about 60% of
58
59
ash trees in natural woodlands will die as a result of ADB, with a higher figure in plantations
60
4
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 6 of 24
1
2
3 (20). The existence of a sub-set of the population which is apparently resistant or, at least,
4
5
6 less susceptible to ADB raises the possibility that some ash trees might survive the disease.
7
8 In addition, several studies have shown that resistance to ADB appears to be heritable (21-
9
10
11 30). This is potentially a route by which the ash tree population could survive this new
12
13 threat with dead susceptible trees being replaced by resistant individuals (25).
14
15
16
17 In this paper I use a well-established forest-gap model – SORTIE (31-38). This version
18
19 of the model has been parameterised for a lowland woodland in the UK (39, 40). By
20
21
22 incorporating the impacts of ADB on individual trees and allowing offspring to inherit
23
24 parental resistance traits; the impact of ADB on forest dynamics can be projected. There has
25
26
27
been a previous model of ADB, but the authors did not consider the possibility of
28
29 inheritance of resistance traits, and assumed that ADB would be a one-off mortality event
30
31 lasting a decade after which mortality rates would return to pre-ADB levels (41). Needham
32
33
34 et al. (2016) examined the impact of different levels of ash mortality on forest community
35
36 structure, and demonstrated that this was influenced by the different demographic
37
38
39 strategies and initial population sizes of the competing species. In contrast I assume that the
40
41 disease becomes an established feature of the ecosystem, and focus is on whether heritable
42
43
44 resistance to ADB can result in population persistence. In this respect ADB provides a good
45
46 model for likely future invasions of novel pests into ecosystems.
47
48
49
50 Methods
51
52 Modification of the forest model to include ash dieback
53
54
55
To describe the impact of the ash dieback on the forest it is necessary to understand the
56
57 way in which the disease affects individual trees. For any disease there is likely to be inter-
58
59
individual variation in susceptibility to the disease in other words some individuals in the
60
5
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 7 of 24 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 population are susceptible, while others are less so. Once an individual tree contracts a
4
5
6 disease its viability will be impaired – expressed here as an impact on growth and a
7
8 reduction in crown area; and it will suffer increased mortality.
9
10
11 Heritability of resistance is important, if offspring are highly likely to inherit their
12
13 parents’ ability to withstand the disease then resistant phenotypes are likely to increase in
14
15
16 frequency relatively rapidly. In this paper I have chosen to model susceptibility as a
17
18 category, so trees can be resistant, completely susceptible or have intermediate
19
20
susceptibility. This allows parent trees to give rise to offspring that stochastically either have
21
22
23 similar susceptibility to themselves, or vary in susceptibility from themselves with a certain
24
25 probability (42).
26
27
28 Estimation of disease parameters
29
30 Proportion of the ash population which is susceptible to ash dieback
31
32
33 All studies to date agree that the number of trees in the population which are resistant to
34
35 ash dieback is low. No study seems to have found individuals which are completely immune
36
37
38
to ash dieback. Kjaer et al. (2011) reported that 1% of the parent trees in their population
39
40 gave rise to offspring with <10% crown damage (43). McKinney et al. (2011) suggested that
41
42
between 2.5% of their ash clones could be regarded as resistant to ash dieback (i.e. with
43
44
45 <10% crown damage (26). In a trial conducted over eight years Pliura et al. (2011) reported
46
47 that 91.5% of the initial 27,000 seedlings died, 7.8% were severely to slightly damaged and
48
49
50 only 0.9% appeared healthy at the end of the trial (27). A recent review of the literature on
51
52 this subject suggested that in woodland situations mortality plateaued at 60%, while if
53
54
55 plantations were also included total mortality rose to 78% (20). This estimate is likely to be
56
57 sensitive to the fact that few observations have been made on forests exposed to ADB for
58
59
60
more than 15 years (the maximum being 19 years). For modelling purposes three scenarios
6
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 8 of 24
1
2
3 were examined in which there were high, medium and low proportions of the population
4
5
6 resistant to ADB (Table 1).
7
8 Impact of ash dieback on growth and crown size
9
10
11 When an ash tree is suffering from ash dieback it has reduced viability. This is most clearly
12
13 illustrated by the fact that infected ash trees grow more slowly than disease-free trees.
14
15
16 Growth in SORTIE is modelled as radial growth in the trunk of the tree – diameter at breast
17
18 height (DBH) then controls the size of the rest of the tree via allometric relationships. There
19
20
are relatively few assessments of changes in radial growth due to ash dieback. In a study of
21
22
23 adult trees Vacek et al. (2015) reported that the radial growth of diseased trees was 35% of
24
25 that of apparently disease-free trees (44). Enderle et al. (2013) reported that diseased ash
26
27
28 saplings had radial growth 61% of that of disease-free trees, an earlier study on the same
29
30 trees found that radial growth was reduced by up to 26% (22). In the model radial growth
31
32
33 was depressed by 50% for highly susceptible trees and by 20% for intermediately
34
35 susceptible trees.
36
37
38
I also considered that there would be reductions in the amount of foliage on trees
39
40 suffering from dieback. This is described by the majority of studies on the effects of the
41
42
disease, and is evident in illustrations of diseased trees (see for example Figure 3 of (45) or
43
44
45 figure 2 of (25)). However, quantitative data on this impact of the disease seem to be
46
47 unavailable. Therefore, relatively minor impacts were imposed in the model with crown
48
49
50 radius reduced by 20% for highly susceptible trees and by 5% for intermediately susceptible
51
52 trees.
53
54
55 Impact of ash dieback on mortality
56
57 Ash dieback clearly kills trees, with reports of stands being decimated. There are reports of
58
59
60
high seedling and sapling annual mortality rates, but mortality seems to be less severe for
7

2
3 older/larger trees (23, 25, 27, 46-48). Kowalski et al. (2005) reported one year mortality
4
5
6 rates of 5.5% for 2-5 year old trees, 8.0% for 6-10 year old, 14% of 11-20 year old and 0% of
7
8 trees older than 20 years (49). Timmerman et al. (2017) found annual mortality of 25% for
9
10
11 trees smaller than 50mm DBH, 8.7% for trees with DBH 50 – 110mm and 2.3% for larger
12
13 trees (46). While Marcais et al. (2017) reported mortality rates of 35% yr-1 for trees with
14
15
16 DBH < 50mm, 10-11% yr-1 for trees with DBH 50 – 250mm and 3.2% yr-1 for larger trees. In a
17
18 modelling exercise rates of mortality of 3%-50% a year were used for the first ten years of
19
20
an outbreak with zero additional dieback mortality thereafter (41). It is worth noting that
21
22
23 these figures are total mortality and do not distinguish between ash dieback induced
24
25 mortality and other causes, although the latter is typical very small (50). In this model I
26
27
28 increased mortality for susceptible and intermediately susceptible trees by adding an ADB
29
30 annual probability of death (<U+0001D443><U+0001D434><U+0001D437><U+0001D435>) such that:
31
32
33 <U+0001D44E>
<U+0001D443><U+0001D434><U+0001D437><U+0001D435> =
34 (1 + 10<U+0001D44F>(<U+0001D450> <U+2015> <U+0001D461>))
35
36
37 Where a is the total chance of death due to ADB, b is the slope of the curve and c is
38
39 the point of inflection and t is years since infection. Values of a, b and c were taken from
40
41
42
Coker et al. (2018). For susceptible trees a was given the value 1 (i.e. all susceptible
43
44 individuals will eventually die of ADB), b = 0.25 and c = 11 years (20). For intermediately
45
46
susceptible individuals a = 0.9, b = 0.1 and c = 22 as the disease was assumed to be less
47
48
49 severe in such individuals. The time parameter (t) was the age of the tree if the individual
50
51 was the result of reproduction during the model run (i.e. it was assumed to have been
52
53
54 infected when it was a seedling) or the time since the start of the simulation for trees that
55
56 were part of the population that started the simulation (i.e. individuals were assumed to
57
58
59 have become infected as the simulation started).

3 Heritability of resistance
4
5
6 The possibility of resistance traits being heritable has received much attention. Broad sense
7
8 heritability estimates (i.e. the proportion of the phenotypic variation that is due to genetic
9
10
11 effects, plus maternal effects etc) have been reported ranging from 0.1 – 0.65 (26, 28-30).
12
13 Narrow sense heritability (i.e. the proportion of the phenotypic variation that is due to
14
15
16 additive genetic variance, h2) estimates have been reported in the range 0.37 – 0.53 (23, 27,
17
18 43). For this paper we have assumed that h2 = 0.5. A high heritability does suggest that
19
20
offspring are likely to inherit resistance status.
21
22
23 Estimating offspring characteristics from parental characteristics
24
25 For modelling purposes it is desirable to determine the disease resistance characteristics of
26
27
28 offspring produced by parents in different disease resistance categories. We can approach
29
30 this via the response to selection (R) (i.e. the deviation of offspring phenotypes from the
31
32
33 population mean) in the offspring generation which is given by:
34
35 <U+0001D445> = h2<U+0001D446>
36
37
38
Where S is the selection differential (i.e. the deviation of the mean phenotypic value
39

6 the population that is breeding) and <U+0001D70E><U+0001D45D><U+0001D453> is the population phenotypic standard deviation
7
8
(51). If 1% of ash trees are resistant to ash dieback then <U+0001D456><U+0001D453> = 2.665 (51). The standard
9
10
11 deviation is 28.7 – 32.5, as the variance of percentage damage scores is reported as 826 –
12
13 1056 (26). Therefore, for resistant trees <U+0001D446><U+0001D453> = 79.95 (if we take the mid-point of standard
14
15
16 deviation range to be 30), and <U+0001D445> = 19.99. For the 10% most resistant trees, using the same
17
18 logic, <U+0001D446><U+0001D453> = 53.25, and <U+0001D445> = 13.31. Therefore for the intermediate susceptibility trees (which
19
20
21 are those between 10% and 1% most resistant) <U+0001D445> = 12.57. For the most susceptible 90% <U+0001D446><U+0001D453>
22
23
= <U+2015>5.91, and <U+0001D445> = <U+2015>1.48. This suggests that the mid-point of the offspring of resistant
24
25
26 trees would be 19.99 above the population mean, while that of intermediately susceptible
27
28 individuals would be 12.57 above, and susceptible trees 1.48 below the mean. The mean of
29
30
31 the percentage damage score in (26) ranges from 24 – 56. If we take the overall mean to be
32
33 40 then this suggests mid-points of 60 for the offspring of resistant trees, 52.6 for offspring
34
35
36 of intermediately susceptible trees and 38.5 for those of susceptible trees. If phenotypes are
37
38 follow a normal distribution, and the mean and variance are the same as those in (26) then
39
40
the most resistant 1% of trees will be those above 109.4 (>2.326 s.d. from the mean),
41
42
43 susceptible trees will be below 78.5 (i.e. >1.341 s.d. above the mean), and intermediately
44
45 susceptible trees will be between these boundaries. Therefore, if the offspring of resistant
46
47
48 trees have a mean (±sd) damage score of 60 ±30 then we should expect 5% of them to be
49
50 resistant, while 20% will be intermediately susceptible and the remaining 75% susceptible
51
52
53 (from the probability of a value exceeding one of these thresholds if drawn from a normal
54
55 distribution with the given mean and s.d). Similarly, for an intermediately susceptible parent
56
57
58
we should expect 3% resistant offspring, 15% intermediately susceptible and 82%
59
60 susceptible. While for a susceptible tree the figures would be 1% resistant, 7%

10
11 I ran experimental scenarios which had high, medium, and low proportions of ash trees
12
13 resistant to ADB; all of which assumed h2 = 0.5. In addition, the high proportion of ADB
14
15
16 resistant ash scenario was repeated using both h2= 0.3 and 0.7. The parameters used for
17
18 each scenario are shown in table 1. Each scenario was run ten times and the projected
19
20
number of individual trees recorded in each simulated year for 97 years. Models were
21
22
23 initiated with tree sizes and densities calculated from the Wytham Woods ForestGEO plot
24
25 (52). Ash trees were allocated to the three resistance categories at random in the
26
27
28 proportions required by the scenario at the start of each simulation. The simulated plot size
29
30 was 500 x 300m and contained 16986 trees at the start of each simulation. I also ran a
31
32
33 baseline scenario in which all parameters were identical except for those relating to ADB,
34
35 ash trees in the baseline scenario all had the characteristics of resistant ash in the
36
37
38
experimental models.
39
40 SORTIE has been parametrised for the eight commonest species at our study site
41
42
(Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK) – sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), European ash
43
44
45 (Fraxinus excelsior L.), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.), European beech (Fagus sylvatica
46
47 L.), common hazel (Corylus avellana L.), common hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna Jacq.),
48
49
50 field maple (Acer campestre L.) and birch (Betula L. spp.). The numbers of each of these
51
52 species is recorded at the end of each simulated year of a run.
53
54
55 In this paper, which is based on the results of model simulations, the results of
56
57 statistical tests have not been reported. This is because they would essentially be
58
59
60
meaningless. The size of a statistic and its p value depends on statistical power, which is
11
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 13 of 24 Royal Society Open Science: For review only

2
3 determined by replication. As replication is under the control of the experimenter then it
4
5
6 seems inappropriate to rely on it to inform conclusions. Instead I have relied on interpreting
7
8 differences between scenarios as suggested by (53).

11 Results
12
13 Impact on the ash population
14
15
16 The number of ash trees in the modelled forest is shown in figure 1. As would be expected
17
18 the size of the ash population drops rapidly as susceptible trees succumb to ADB. When
19
20
there is a relatively large proportion of the population resistant to ADB the ash population is
21
22
23 sustained at about a third of what it was at the beginning of the simulation. However, this is
24
25 small compared to what would be expected in the absence of ADB as the baseline
26
27
28 simulation suggests that a large increase in ash trees would have been expected. When the
29
30 proportion of resistant individuals is low the ash population as a whole becomes extremely
31
32
33 small – to the point where in some instances it is one of the rarest species of the eight
34
35 examined here. In the baseline scenarios ash is by far the most abundant species in the
36
37
38
forest.
39
40 The impact of heritability is similar to, but smaller than, that of the proportion of the
41
42
population resistant. When heritability of resistance is 0.3, the final number of ash trees is
43
44
45 about 15% lower than when heritability is 0.5, and 30% below the situation in which
46
47 heritability is a high 0.7. This contrasts with there being 60% fewer in the final population
48
49
50 when 5% of the initial population is ADB resistant compared to when there are 10%
51
52 resistant individuals at the start, and 90% fewer when there 1% resistant individuals at the
53
54
55 start.

3 The mean number of individuals at the end of the simulation runs of the all the species
4
5
6 considered here are shown in figure 2. The reduction in the number of ash trees is mitigated
7
8 to some extent by an increase in the number of sycamore, although counter-intuitively the
9
10
11 scenario with the greatest number of sycamore is the one in which there is ADB but the
12
13 highest number of ash trees remaining in the population. Both oak and hazel have higher
14
15
16 populations when ADB is impacting the ash population than under baseline conditions. The
17
18 size of the hazel population is noticeably more variable than those of other species and is
19
20
highest when the population of ash is lowest.
21
22
23 Discussion
24
25 The discovery that resistance to ADB was heritable has been frequently cited as a possible
26
27
28 long-term solution to the impact of the disease on European forests, with the prospect that
29
30 naturally resistant individuals would remain, and their offspring gradually recolonise the
31
32
33 forests (23-28, 43, 48). This is coupled by some authors with the suggestion of breeding
34
35 resistant lines of ash (19, 21, 24, 27-29, 54-57). My results suggest that natural resistance
36
37
38
can lead to population persistence, but unless the population of ash which is resistant to
39
40 ADB is reasonably high then the overall ash population becomes extremely small. This is
41
42
because even when there is high heritability it does not mean that offspring will be clones of
43
44
45 their mothers. In addition, ash are wind pollinated means that resistant mother trees will
46
47 receive pollen from a random selection of the reproductive trees in the forest. Therefore,
48
49
50 only a relatively low number of the offspring of resistant mothers are themselves resistant.
51
52 Therefore, ADB susceptible individuals are being produced even after most of the mortality
53
54
55 due to ADB has occurred, and a susceptible population of trees persists. This will contribute
56
57 to the continued persistence of the disease in the population.

2
3 One feature not considered in the model presented here is that the selection
4
5
6 differential is likely to change throughout the period considered. This is partly because
7
8 intense selection will reduce the genetic variance in the offspring population (51), and also
9
10
11 because as susceptible individuals die the proportion of the pollen in the air that originated
12
13 from resistant fathers will rise and so the probability of resistant offspring being produced
14
15
16 will increase. It is likely that both these effects will result in there being a higher population
17
18 of resistant ash than suggested here. However, the model considers a relatively short period
19
20
of time over which the number of ash generations is low. Ash grow at rates that mean they
21
22
23 only reach the size at which they would be considered capable of reproduction after at least
24
25 15 years, and usually much more. The model run therefore is a maximum of about six
26
27
28 generations, but more usually two or three. The total amount of ash pollen will also
29
30 decrease as susceptible trees die. A reduction in ash pollen was detected in Austria
31
32
33 following ADB appearing, falling ash seed harvests were also reported in the same study
34
35 (58). Whether a reduction in the amount of ash pollen in the air will affect the chances of a
36
37
38
viable ash producing seeds is unclear.
39
40 The overall conclusion from this study is that ADB will result in a substantial fall in
41
42
the number of ash in the forest. Whether the population of ash persists seems to depend
43
44
45 more on the proportion of the population which is resistant to ADB rather than resistance
46
47 having high heritability. As has been suggested by other authors (19, 21, 24, 27-29, 54-57) it
48
49
50 seems reasonable that selective breeding could play a role. Establishing a source of resistant
51
52 individuals that could be used to boost the numbers of naturally resistant trees in the
53
54
55 population would help increase the chances of population sustainability. However, it is
56
57 important to recognise that the pathogen is a biological agent and is itself subject to
58
59
60
selection. It is at least conceivable that the fungus that causes ADB could evolve in response
14
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Royal Society Open Science: For review only Page 16 of 24
1
2
3 to the population of ash becoming increasingly resistant. The current hypothesis is that,
4
5
6 probably in part, resistance is conferred by earlier spring leaf flushing and earlier autumn
7
8 leaf senescence (15, 26). If the fungus does develop means to overcome current resistance
9
10
11 mechanisms then the future of the ash would less clear. The fungus is likely to evolve
12
13 virulence mechanisms faster than the ash can evolve resistance mechanisms partly because
14
15
16 the generation time of the ADB fungus will be much shorter than that of the ash, which will
17
18 inevitably provide it with greater adaptive capacity (57).
19
20
While ADB is the most recent disease to affect the ash population, there are known
21
22
23 to be other threats. Selection pressure exerted by ADB will reduce the genetic variance of
24
25 the population and may therefore increase its vulnerability to other pests and diseases, for
26
27
28 example the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis, Fairmaire, 1888) which has already
29
30 reached Europe. It is not clear whether there are resistance mechanisms that would allow
31
32
33 ash to cope with this second novel pathogen. Even if there are, and with the reasonable
34
35 assumption that resistance to ADB is independent of resistance to emerald ash borer, then
36
37
38
the long-term future of ash in European forests looks very uncertain.
39
40 A secondary result of this paper is that there are projected impacts on the
41
42
community structure of the forest. The baseline conditions suggest that there should be a
43
44
45 large increase in ash in the forest, this obviously does not occur when ADB is present. The
46
47 main beneficiary appears to be sycamore which is currently the second most dominant tree
48
49
50 in this forest. All scenarios with ADB present show an increase in the number of sycamore.
51
52 Sycamore is known to be susceptible to dry conditions (59). The model used here did not
53
54
55 include any climate change effects, which in this part of the world is likely to result in an
56
57 increase in the frequency of droughts (60). Consideration of the interaction between climate
58
59
60
change and ADB may result in a different response from sycamore than seen here. Of the
15
https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos
Page 17 of 24 Royal Society Open Science: For review only
1
2
3 other species considered there were rather few patterns, although hazel seem to
4
5
6 sometimes show increased populations in response to a reduction in the ash population.
7
8 Trees may be peculiarly vulnerable to the effects of new pests and diseases. They are
9
10
11 large, long-lived organisms with some, but relatively limited, capacity to combat diseases
12
13 (14). In 2015 about 100m Ha of forest globally were impacted by pests and diseases, this
14
15
16 represents about 3% of the world’s forest cover (13). While ADB in European ash
17
18 populations is simply one example, it represents a well-studied test case of the effect of a
19
20
novel disease in a wild population and the ability of that population to sustain itself, the
21
22
23 goods and service that come from it, and the wider ecosystem of which it is part. The results
24
25 presented here do suggest that it the parameters we have used are correct and if about 10%
26
27
28 of the ash population is resistant to ADB then a reasonable sized population of ash can be
29
30 sustained into the next century. But the rapid reduction in the numbers of an abundant
31
32
33 species will have implications for the dynamics of the forest, and the remaining population
34
35 will be vulnerable to additional assaults from future pests and diseases and/or the evolution
36
37
38
of the current disease. In all likelihood a similar outcome would be seen if we were
39
40 considering any of the other common species in the forest, many of which are already facing
41
42
similar challenges (61). It seems reasonable in the face of these challenges that steps be
43
44
45 taken to develop programmes that will screen and select for resistance traits to new pests
46
47 and diseases in native species with a view to ensuring that the resistant population is as
48
49
50 large as possible (62).

Comments to the Author(s)
Thank you for an interesting piece of work.
I could not easily see how the data on which the models were based could be accessed
although I understand they are available.
An explicit statement referencing a previous paper has been added on page 11.
General writing style is a little loose, with many sentences starting with dependent
clauses or unnecessary phrases such as ‘it is necessary to…’ ‘I also considered…’ ‘this is
described by..’ In almost all cases these can be removed and the sentence made more
concise.
These phrases have been removed as far as possible
Check spelling of Fraxinus (not Fraxineus) throughout.
Apologies, I have done so. Although please note that the name of the fungus that
produces ash dieback disease is Hymenoscyphus fraxineus.
Page 4 Line 6. Punctuation wrong in the first sentence – should not be split up by semi-
colons
I have modified the sentence.
Page 4 line 31 to page 5 line 16. I do not think the detail about the Dutch elm disease
and mountain pine beetle outbreaks really adds much. As species examples they might
be mentioned in the last sentence of the introductory paragraph and the rest cut.
I have removed these sections as suggested.
Page 7. Some references are given in the text rather than as numbers?
These have been removed.
The discussion could be shortened by about 10%.
I have attempted to make the discussion more concise.

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript by M. Evans entitled „Can natural resistance save ash populations from
ash dieback disease?“ describes a study on the development of population sizes of ash
trees under ash dieback in the next 100 years in the UK by means of simulation models.
Ash dieback is a serious tree disease that causes a dramatic decline of economically and
ecologically important ash tree species in Europe. The question of future development
of ash populations in Europe is of importance and I think it is relevant for the
readership of RSOS.
In my opinion, the study generated only two reliable results: (1) within the next 100
years (and without breeding), the degree of susceptibility in the ash population has a
larger impact on population decline than the degree of heritability of the susceptibility
(or resistance). (2) The tree species that will benefit the most from ash decline in the UK
is probably sycamore. Honestly, I think these two results are somewhat trivial. The first,
as the author admits in the discussion, is not at all surprising when considering that 100
years correspond to only 2-3 generations of ash trees. The second result is what
probably every forester in the UK would have guessed without any modelling, and only
confirms what Needham et al. already reported in their paper in 2016. Other results of
the manuscript, such as the magnitude and speed of the population decline, are in my
opinion too dependent on unknown variables to be reliable, and the author seems to
agree with this.
However, I still enjoyed reading the manuscript. To be precise: rather than the results I
found the methods very interesting and informative. The strength of the manuscript is
the description on how presumptions and estimates for the model were made. While I
do not agree with many presumptions the author made (see specific comments directly
in the manuscript in the attached pdf file), reading the manuscript sharpened my eye for
the significance and the interdependencies of different aspects of ash dieback, such as
mortality, growth reduction and the degree of resistance, and I believe that it would
have the same effect on other researchers. I thus consider the manuscript generally
worthy to be published, although the editor may have another opinion.
In the introduction, very little information is given about SORTIE, which is a forest gap
model that was used as a basis for this study. I think it is necessary to provide some
more information, especially on how competition power of tree species is implemented
in this model.
A new section has been added to the last paragraph of the introduction to provide this
information
It is not very clear from the description in the manuscript, if or how loss of competition
power due to disease-induced weakening was taken into account in the model.
I have added a statement summarising the overall effect in the methods
In the estimation of mortality rates, I think it is problematic that tree age was not taken
into account (or only taken into account as the time a tree has been exposed to the
disease). In younger trees, ash dieback is much more likely to cause mortality in a given
time than in older trees. Mortality of the whole population thus depends on the age
distribution of the population, and will change as the age distribution changes.
The referees concerns are noted but no data exist on the impact of age on mortality, in
this model size is used a proxy for age. Size-based mortality is part of the underlying
model, although it is not part of the ADB-induced mortality. We have summarised the
evidence for age/size effects on mortality in the model parameterisation section. But I
opted to follow the analysis of Coker et al 2019.
In the estimation of offspring characteristics, random mating between all individuals
was assumed. However, when compared to healthy (resistant) individuals, diseased
trees are less likely to produce offspring. There are several recent papers by Semizer-
Cuming et al. on gene flow in ash, which should be considered here. If populations of ash
become very small, infection pressure will very likely decrease significantly (“dilution
effect”). If these issues are too complex to be implemented in the model, they should at
least be explained in the method section and/or discussion section. The limitations and
weaknesses of the models should be presented more clearly in the discussion.
I feel that these effects are already mentioned in the second paragraph of the discussion.
I have expanded this a little and added a reference to Semizer-Cuming.
49 specific comments can be found directly in the manuscript in the attached pdf file.
I thank the referee for the care taken in reviewing the article, I have modified the
manuscript as suggested in all cases except for the first comment which I felt could be
left in its more general form.
Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
This is an excellent and timely study. The adaptation of the well established SORTIE
model for ash dieback is a very useful contribution to the growing literature predicting
the impact of this disease. It is highly relevant to the policy question of whether or not a
breeding programme is needed for ash, as the MS title suggests. It is also highly relevant
for estimating the total economic cost of ash dieback. Hill et al (2019, Current Biology)
recently estimated the full economic cost of ash dieback in Britain at £15bn. The author
of the present MS might wish to comment on how the predictions of his model would
affect this estimate.
My comments below are mainly to do with clarity of presentation.
Terms like “save ash populations” and “ash populations may survive” are ambiguous.
What does salvation of a population mean? Zero reduction in size? Reduction to any
viable population size, however small that may be? I suggest that this could be more
precisely framed.
I have changed this in the text but have modified the title along the lines suggested.
The MS could emphasize more that the simulation is over the course of one century, in a
woodland where ash has to compete with other tree species. Thus, for example, the MS
title might better describe the paper if it were “How many ash trees will survive ash
dieback in a British woodland during the next century?”
Done as above
The approach of the SORTIE model, its parameterization on Whytham woods, and the
timeframe used need to be described more fully in the MS. I suggest the abstract should
mention that the model is for Whytham woods in particular, and for a 97-year
timeframe. The introduction should contain a paragraph that briefly describes what the
model seeks to do, how it works and what parameters it needs. It should also briefly
describe the size of Whytham woods and its tree composition, and the size of the area
simulated in the model.
This information now exists, there is a new paragraph in the introduction and further
detail on the model is included in the penultimate paragraph of the methods.
I think that the current second and third paragraphs of the introduction could be
omitted without significant detriment to the MS, as they merely give other examples of
forest pests and pathogens. More relevant would be examples (if any exist) of other
forest pests and pathogens for which models of impacts have been made similar to the
work of the present MS. If none exist, this could be pointed out.
These have been omitted, also suggested by referee 2.
I suggest that Needham et al 2016 is discussed prior to the final paragraph of the
introduction, and the final paragraph of the introduction focuses more exclusively on
the work reported in the present MS.
I have modified the last paragraph to emphasise the novelty of the present work.
Heritability of resistance is an important parameter for the MS. As far as I am aware, no
one has yet estimated heritability of mortality due to ash dieback. All the estimates of
heritability are of ash dieback damage scores such as crown dieback and lesion length,
as far as I am aware. If this is the case it would be worth noting. It is also worth noting
that (as far as I am aware) all estimates of heritability so far have been in plantations
with fairly uniform environments. In natural woodlands environmental variation is
likely to be much greater, leading to lower heritability of resistance traits.
The referee is correct that no estimates of mortality heritability have been done –
indeed it might be difficult to do so given that a tree either survives or dies, and if it dies
it obviously does not pass its genes on to the next generation. The most relevant
observation would be the heritability of resistance mechanisms, which have also not
been studied directly. This is why as the referee correctly points out we must use
heritability of damage scores.
Abstract line 20/21 “These observations have LED TO SUGGESTIONS that…”
Agreed
Page 7 line 57. With a strict regard to its Latin origin, the term “decimated” means
“reduced by one in ten”.
Changed to very severely reduced
Page 15 “One feature not considered in the model presented here is that the selection
differential is likely to change throughout the period considered. This is partly because
intense selection will reduce the genetic variance in the offspring population (51), and
also because as susceptible individuals die the proportion of the pollen in the air that
originated from resistant fathers will rise and so the probability of resistant offspring
being produced will increase. It is likely that both these effects will result in there being
a higher population of resistant ash than suggested here.” This is an important caveat,
especially if we are interested in timeframes of over a century, which deserves more
emphasis.
This paragraph has been expanded somewhat, but it is not clear how emphasise it much
further than has been done here.
Page 16 “The current hypothesis is that, probably in part, resistance is conferred by
earlier spring leaf flushing and earlier autumn leaf senescence (15, 26)” this is only one
of several hypotheses. If true, this phenology trend may simply allow escape of trees
that flush and senesce earlier than other trees – if the whole population shifts to earlier
flushing and senescence, this advantage may be lost.
An additional sentence has been added
Figure 1. A fuller first part of the legend would be helpful to the reader.
This has been expanded
The MS could be clearer on how the reader can access the data and code used.
There are no data in this paper, the code has been uploaded to dryad. The data used for
parameterisation have already been published (Evans et al 2015, ref 39).
In future it would be useful if the author modelled the effects of management
interventions like the felling of diseased trees, or the planting of “replacement” species
for ash.

Abstract: Novel pests and diseases are becoming increasingly frequent, and often cause
additional mortality to host species in the newly contacted communities. This can alter
the structure of the community and/or the continued presence of impacted host
species. In the last twenty years ash dieback disease (ADB) has spread into Europe from
East Asia. It has caused substantial mortality in ash tree (Fraxineus excelsior, L.)
populations. However, a proportion of the individuals in most populations appears to be
less susceptible to ADB and resistance seems to have high heritability. These
observations have suggested that ash populations may survive the disease. In order to
test this hypothesis, I modified an existing model of UK woodland to take into account
the impact of ADB, and allowed offspring to inherit resistance traits from their parent.
The results suggest that ash populations could be sustainable but at lower levels than
they are currently. For example, when the proportion of resistant individuals is about
10% and heritability of resistance is 0.5 then the population of ash falls to about one
third of present levels. The influence of the proportion of individuals initially resistant
to ADB was larger than the heritability of resistance. The fact that the size of the
resistant population is important to achieving a high population size in the presence of
ADB suggests that a selective breeding programme with the intention of augmenting the
natural ash populations would be beneficial.

Dear Sir,
Thank you for this good news concerning my manuscript. I have made the changes
recommended by the referees as shown below. I belive that I have already provided all the
other information required and the temporary dryad link provided previously is still live.
Yours truly, Matthew

The author has dealt satisfactorily with the reviewers comments. My only further
suggestion is that the word "initial" is inserted before the word "proportion" on line 31
of the abstract.
Done

The manuscript has significantly improved. Most of my comments and suggestions have
been taken into account by the author, although sometimes somewhat desultory, but I
guess that is ok. I still think that the presentation of Figure 1 needs improvement, i.e.
increased font size, and figure legends would make it much easier for the reader to
understand and to extract the relevant information.
I have increased the font size of the axis labels and scale
I am still confused by the calculation described in page 11. The calculated mid-points
are, as I understand, the mid-points of the standard deviation range of percent damage
scores of offspring of susceptible and resistant trees. If this is correct, I would expect the
mid-point of offspring of resistant trees to be smaller than those of offspring of
intermediate and susceptible trees. Apparently, there is something that I did not
understand, but I admit that this may be my personal problem.
I think that the referee is used to seeing damage scores but the calculation is framed in
terms of resistance. So high scores = high resistance which would equate to a low
damage score. In other words in terms of damage score the referee is correct, but we
are looking at resistance.
I could not find a statement in the discussion that a strong reduction of the host
population and the number of susceptible trees is likely to cause a decrease in infection
pressure.
I have added a new sentence to explain why I do not feel that it is simple to intuit an
answer to this question.
