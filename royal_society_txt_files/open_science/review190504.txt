In this manuscript, the authors presented work on designing and synthesizing the copolymer
containing salicylic acid (SA) motifs via polycondensation method. It seems that they successfully
obtained the copolymer and evaluated their basic properties. The data presented in the paper are
of relatively high quality. After evaluating the overall topic of the work, which seems to address
an important of the field, however, several issues need to be clarified before accepted in this
4
journal.
a) Please show the GPC traces in the manuscript.
b) Please polish your writing, for example, the sentence “The degradation rate of P(BS-co-SA) was
high in enzymatic solution” in the manuscript should be deleted.
c) The author stated that all samples were replicated thrice, please add error bar in the Tables and
Figure 5.
d) The author mentioned “spiral chain structure of PBS…”, please add relative references.
e) To intuitively grasp the properties difference of different samples, the author should used the
experimental data to state the properties change, for example, “The tensile strength of the
copolymers was less than pure PBS except for P(BS-co-0.5%SA)”; “Figure 3A and 3B exhibit the
DSC curves measured with pure PBS and P(BS-co-SA). P(BS-co-SA) copolymers were observed to
have similar Tm and a high Tc compared with pure PBS,” there are too many sentences should be
stated using the experimental data.
f) please explain this sentence “but their location is offset in the direction of the large angle. It
suggested that their crystal structures are similar. However, crystal behavior is not similar”.

1. The authors should clarify how to remove Ti(OBu)4 when purified P(BS-co-SA)
product.
Thank you for underlining this point. We did not remove Ti(OBu)4 when purified
P(BS-co-SA) product. Currently, Ti(OBu)4 is being used as a catalyst in PBS
synthesis, it cannot be removed. Therefore, we use other methods, such as organic
catalyst instead of inorganic catalyst, and keep the dose as low as possible to reduce
pollution.
2. The authors should give the detailed information for the BSB, SaBS, SaSB….
Thank you for the suggestion. We have detailed the information according to the
comment. (page 4)
BSB, SaBS, SaSB, SaSSa and BSaS represent different molecular fragments in the
polymer chain, respectively. Where B is 1, 4-butanediol, S is succinic acid, and Sa is
salicylic acid.
3. The authors should give the degradation mechanism of PBS and P(BS-co-SA) for
readers understanding.
Thank you for the suggestion. We have added the reference of degradation mechanism
to article according to the suggestion. (page 7)

1. The title should be improved; it should be more precise and represent to the
contents.
The title has been revised to Poly(butylene succinate-co-salicylic acid) Copolymers
and their Effect on Promoting Plant Growth.
2. In the abstract; “proved that the degradability of copolymers was more.” add
quantitative data.
Thank you for the suggestion. We have rewrote the sentence according to the
comment. (page 1)
By molecular docking simulations, it was proved that the degradability of copolymers
was more effective than that of pure PBS with binding energy of -5.77 kcal·mol-1.
3. The abstract should be re-written to summarize the work; the abstract should
state briefly the purpose of the research, the principal results and major conclusions.
An abstract is often presented separately from the article, so it must be able to stand
alone.
Thank you for the suggestion. We have rewrote the abstract according to the
suggestion. (page 1)
Biodegradable random copolymers was successfully synthesized by melt
polycondensation of poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) and salicylic acid (SA). The
obtained copolymers was characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy. The effect of different SA contents on the properties of copolymers was
investigated by universal testing machine, thermogravimetric analyzer, differential
scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction analysis. The results showed that the
copolymers with 0.5% SA contents exhibit excellent elastic modulus (1413.0 MPa)
and tensile strength (192.8 MPa), and the similar thermal decomposition temperature
(˜320 ºC) compared with pure PBS. By molecular docking simulations, it was proved
that the degradability of copolymers was more effective than that of pure PBS with
binding energy of -5.77 kcal·mol-1. PBS copolymers with a small amount of SA were
not only biodegradable but could stimulate the growth of green vegetables. So,
biodegradable polymers can be use in wide range as they are environmental friendly.
4. The Introduction should be focused and goes over the topic.
Thank you for the suggestion. We have revised the introduction according to the
suggestion. (page 2)
5. Introduction should increase scientific understanding sufficiently, to be of a very
high quality paper, what is the gab to cover.
Thank you for the suggestion. We have revised the introduction. (page 2)
For decades, traditional polymeric materials have been widely used in many fields.
Among them, packaging has a considerable market segment. As a result, millions of
tons of plastic packaging are landfilled every year [1] and cause environmental
pollution. This led to the research that focused on developing biodegradable materials
[2,3]. Other environmental friendly substances are now gradually replacing many
harmful chemical compounds, like petroleum hydrocarbons [4-7].
6. All abbreviations should be defined.
The new abbreviations are Salicylic acid (SA), Proton nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (1H NMR) and Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD). (page 3)
In agriculture, SA acts as an endogenous signal molecule in plants growth. (page 2)
7. Page 5 Section 2.2. Synthesis of copolymers, should be revised with more details
and steps are to be clear.
Thank you for the suggestion. We have revised the information with more details and
steps. (page 3)
PBS-based copolymers were prepared by the melt polycondensation method as
reported earlier [32], including two steps of esterfication and polycondensation.
Succinic acid, 1,4-butanediol and SA as raw material was added into the three-necked
flask at 1:1.1 (acid to alcohol), then 0.5 mol% of Ti(OBu)4 was added as the catalyst
for the reaction. The reactor was filled with nitrogen to protect the reaction from
oxidation. The reactants were heated to melt in the oil bath at 190 ºC, until the volume
of dehydrate and the theoretical amount of H2O become equal. The phenyl functional
groups from SA were added to the polymer chain during dehydration reaction. Then
the polycondensation process was carried out controlling the pressure to below 5.5
kPa (vacuum degree). It was continued to heat up until 220<U+2103> and reacted for
approximately 3 h to obtain desired products. Products were dissolved in CHCl3, and
purified several times with ethanol, and then vacuum dryed for 24 h.

Chloroform was used as the mobile phase at a 1.0 mL min-1 flow rate and the sample
solution was 1.0 w/v%. The column temperature was maintained at 40 ºC in all
analyses. (page 3)
About 3 mg of sample was heated from 25 ºC to 200 ºC at a rate of 30 ºC min-1 in
order to eliminate any previous thermal history. (page 4)
Polarized optical microscope (POM) was used with a DK-POL (Chongqing Optec,
China) in order to observe the crystalline morphologies of the copolymers. Samples
by dipping polymers in chloroform solution on the glass slide and the sample film was
obtained after evaporation of the solvent. The samples were heated until melt and then
temperature was maintained to 80 ºC for 3 h. (page 4)

Capacity of copolymers to improve plant growth was also investigated. (page 2)

13. Please improve the discussion of molecular docking.
Thank you for the suggestion. We have improved the discussion according to the
suggestion. (page 7)
The interactions between CALB lipase and ligands were explained at the molecular
level by molecular docking simulations. The binding free energy was calculated and
the relationship among all related energies is clearly shown in Table 4. Among them
the Etorsional only depends on the number of torsion bond and Eunbond is equal to
Etotal-internal. In accordance with the molecular docking results, the binding free energy
of compounds formed by substrates (SaBS, SaSB, SaSSa and BSaS) with CALB
lipase were -5.00, -5.48, -5.77 and -4.40 kcal·mol-1 respectively, which were lower
than that of BSB, -4.04 kcal mol-1. The lower the binding energy, the more stable the
substrate binding to the enzyme [45]. The binding free energy of SaSSa with CALB
lipase was the lowest, so SaSSa was the most stable with CALB lipase. Then the
substrate containing SaBS, SaSB and BSaS unit was relatively stable with CALB
lipase owing to the lower binding energy. It can be concluded from the above results
that the presence of Sa unit could significantly reduce binding energy and enhanced
the degradability of PBS in phosphate buffer solution. Therefore, the enzymatic
degradability of P(BS-co-SA) was more effective than that of PBS.
14. Effects on Vegetable Growth: please discuss it deeply as it is important section.
Thank you for the suggestion. We have improved the discussion according to the
suggestion. (page 8)
We investigated the effect of soil-incorporated copolymers’ residues on growth of
plants. The effect of different levels of soil incorporated P(BS-co-SA) copolymer on
vegetable growth was studied (Figure 6). Three levels (0g, 0.1g and 0.6g) of
P(BS-co-SA) were used during the study. Soil incorporated without P(BS-co-SA) was
used as control soil. It can seen from Figure 6 that no significant change in plant
growth was observed during the first 20 d. At day 30, number of leaves recorded in
A-2 were higher than in B-2 and C-2. But with the time, treatments containing
P(BS-co-SA) showed higher growth rate as compared to the treatments without
P(BS-co-SA) (control treatment). This was because P(BS-co-SA) undergo little or no
degradation in the early days because release of SA into the soil from the polymer
took time [36]. At day 60, it was found that the number of leaves in all treatments
were same but the plants on the soil treated with copolymers exhibited larger and
green leaves as compared to control. This became more obvious with the increase in
copolymer content. After a period of time, the P(BS-co-SA) hydrolyzes upon
exposure to aqueous conditions in soil, releasing SA while leaving the PBS backbone
fracture for degradation [47]. The vegetable growth for different SA content showed
that the polymer with the highest content of SA had a better relative growth rate.
P(BS-co-SA) stimulated plant growth and no toxicity was observed. It is well-known
that SA could induce vegetable growth. The results reported here agree with this
consensus.
15. There are many sentence that required to be clarified.
Thank you for the suggestion. We have revised the sentences.
The intensities of P(BS-co-SA) diffraction peaks are the same as that of pure PBS,
meanwhile, the locations of diffraction peaks are almost the same. It suggested that
their crystal structures are similar. (page 6)
The degradability of P(BS-co-SA) films in basic media was studied as shown in
Figure 5. It was found in enzymatic degradation that % weight loss of P(BS-co-SA)
was significantly higher as compared to pure PBS. At day 20, % weight loss of
P(BS-co-5SA) was recorded as 3.38% which is considerably higher than 1.53% of
pure PBS. It was because the spiral chain structure of PBS had been destroyed and the
crystallinity of PBS was changed in the presence of SA. (page 7)

compounds like petroleum hydrocarbons”please add [1] Ecological Engineering 120,

17. More emphasis on finding and its implication may be mentioned in the
conclusion section.
Thank you for the suggestion. We have rewrote the conclusion according to the

A series of P(BS-co-SA) copolymers were synthesized successfully by a two-step
melt polycondensation reaction, which has a superior ability to induce plant growth
compared to PBS. The effects of low, medium and high SA content on copolymers
performance were investigated. Tensile tests and thermal evaluation showed that
copolymers had good mechanical and thermal properties when a small amount of SA
was added. Thermal stability up to 300 ºC was confirmed by TGA. XRD indicated
that the copolymers with different SA contents had similar crystal structure. The
enzymatic degradation of P(BS-co-SA) was faster than that of PBS in phosphate
buffer solution. The enzymatic degradation fit well with the molecular docking results,
the presence of SA unit could significantly enhance the degradability of PBS due to
the lower free binding energy, indicating the favorability of adding SA. These results
suggested that adding a small amount of SA would not affect the comprehensive
performance of PBS, meanwhile, it could stimulate the growth of green vegetables
and can be used as environmental friendly material.

d) To intuitively grasp the properties difference of different samples, the author
should used the experimental data to state the properties change, for example, “The
tensile strength of the copolymers was less than pure PBS except for
P(BS-co-0.5%SA)”; “Figure 3A and 3B exhibit the DSC curves measured with pure PBS
and P(BS-co-SA). P(BS-co-SA) copolymers were observed to have similar Tm and a
high Tc compared with pure PBS,” there are too many sentences should be stated
using the experimental data.
1. An apparent increase in elastic modulus of the P (BS-co-SA) films from 779.6 MPa
to 1400 MPa was observed when SA was added, but there was significant reduction in
elongation at break from 13.2% to 2.7%. The tensile strength of the
P(BS-co-0.5%SA), 192.8 MPa, was more than that of pure PBS (180.5 MPa).
(in 3.2. Mechanical properties) (page 5)
2. It is observed that pure PBS displays a crystallization peak (Tc) at 79.4 ºC, a
endothermic peak (Tm) at 116.4 ºC and a glass transition temperature (Tg) at -28.5 ºC.
P(BS-co-0.5% SA) was observed to have a high Tc of 83.2 ºC compared with pure
PBS. The Tg (-28.2 ºC) and Tm (116.7 ºC) of P(BS-co-0.5%SA) were found similar to
pure PBS, but <U+0394>T (33.5 ºC) was lower than that of pure PBS. These results suggested
that the thermal stability of PBS was significantly enhanced when 0.5% SA was added.
However, Tm (115.2 ºC), Tc (77.0 ºC) and Tg (-29.0 ºC) of P(BS-co-10%SA) were less
as compared to PBS, which may be attributed to its lower molar mass.
(in 3.3. Thermal analysis) (page 6)
3. The degradability of P(BS-co-SA) films in basic media was studied as shown in
Figure 5. It was found in enzymatic degradation that % weight loss of P(BS-co-SA)
was significantly higher as compared to pure PBS. At day 20, % weight loss of
P(BS-co-5SA) was recorded as 3.38% which is considerably higher than 1.53% of
pure PBS. It was because the spiral chain structure of PBS had been destroyed and the
crystallinity of PBS was changed in the presence of SA. (in 3.5. Enzymatic
degradation) (page 7)
e) please explain this sentence “but their location is offset in the direction of the
large angle. It suggested that their crystal structures are similar. However, crystal
behavior is not similar”.
Thank you for underlining this confusion. Maybe the sentence was confusing, so I
rewrote it. (page 6)
The intensities of P(BS-co-SA) diffraction peaks are the same as that of pure PBS,
meanwhile, the locations of diffraction peaks are almost the same. It suggested that
their crystal structures are similar.
