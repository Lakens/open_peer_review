The present manuscript shows the evidence of pressure vibrations induced by cavitation by
experiments. The result that the pressure vibration at pump inlet is more sensitive to cavitation
development than that at volute casing seems interesting. Though the authors present the
vibration increase at critical cavitation number, they are expected to present some relationship
quantitatively between cavitation and pressure vibrations. However, the study is helpful for
understanding cavitation induced vibration in pumps.
I hope the authors consider the following questions:
1. Page No.3, after Equation (3). "blade outlet" should be "trailing edge of impeller blade". The
same expression is also found at Page No.7, Table 1. Besides, A should be amplitude of pressure

vibration, but not pressure amplitude.

Comments on the paper: Cavitating flow induced unsteady pressure pulsations in a low specific
speed centrifugal pump. RSOS-180408
This paper presents a methodology to detect cavitation in centrifugal pumps, and the detailed
pressure spectrum is analyzed, both for blade passing frequency and RMS value. The manuscript
describes the method and finally presents an application for a real pump in a laboratory
hydraulic set-up. The relation between pressure pulsation and cavitation developing process is
discussed in detail. The topic of the study is considered interesting from a scientific point of view,
and it is well written.
The paper could be accepted for publication after some minor revisions.
1. In the set-up used for these tests, it is very likely that partial closing of the valve at the suction
pipe produces cavitation at the valve itself before than in the pump. Please clarify.

Dear Editor and Reviewers:
Thank you very much for your comments and suggestions concerning our
manuscript entitled “Cavitating flow induced unsteady pressure pulsations in a low
specific speed centrifugal pump” (RSOS-180408). We have studied those comments
carefully and tried our best to revise the paper. The main corrections are highlighted
in the revised paper.
Reviewer1
Question1: Line 55-56 page 3. Since all information of Fig. 4 can be directly
obtained from Fig. 3, there is no need to show Fig. 4. Please consider to remove Fig. 4
and related words.
Response1: According to the reviewer, the fig.4 has been deleted in the revised paper.
Question2: Line 21-25, page 5. For the RMS calculation in Eq.(4), An represents
peaks at different frequencies. What is the criterion for selecting a peak? only the
values at frequencies of f/fBEP=1,2,3...n will be selected?
Response2: In the paper, we use RMS method to evaluate the total pressure pulsation
energy in particular frequency band. So, the An in the equation represents very peak in
pressure spectrum, not only fBPF and its harmonics. For instance, peak at 0.5fBPF is
also calculated in the equation.

Question3: Line 37-42, page 4. In Fig.8, why Cp increases firstly with decreasing
sigma, then decreasing? Normally, Cp is assumed to keep increasing with decreasing
sigma. Please explain it.
Response3: For the varying trend of pressure amplitude versus cavitation number, it
is considered that the varying trend is related to the corresponding cavitation
structures. It is thought that cavitating flow structures at different cavitation numbers
show significant difference. At particular cavitation number, the cavitation status is
considered as bubble cavitation. The bubble cavitation has a positive effect on
absorbing pressure energy emitted from the bubble collapsing. Thus, pressure
amplitude would show a decreasing trend in typical cavitation number range. With
cavitation number decreasing below the critical point, the cavitating flow structure
becomes incompressible. Finally, pressure pulsation amplitude increases again. Such
varying trend is also captured and analyzed in the published works even for the
turbine. In the work of Tomaž Rus, the varying trends of noise and vibration show the
identical change rule as described in fig.8. In our previous research, we also observe
the typical varying trend from cavitation induced vibration aspect.

Question4: Normally, the amplitude of pressure fluctuation is determined by peak to
peak or RMS of unsteady pressures at different time. However, the authors applied the
RMS of Cp after FFT analysis. I am not sure whether this method is appropriate or
not. Please explain it.
Response4: In the present paper, we use the RMS method to calculate pressure
energy in typical frequency band. This equation is borrowed from vibration signal
processing method. In the vibration field, it is very common to use this equation to
evaluate vibration energy in typical frequency band after FFT transform. Both in the
industrial application and academic categories, the RMS methods are all well
accepted. So, it is considered that the RMS method is appropriate to deal with
pressure spectrum in the present work.
Reviewer2
Question1: Page No.3, after Equation (3). "blade outlet" should be "trailing edge of
impeller blade". The same expression is also found at Page No.7, Table 1. Besides, A
should be amplitude of pressure vibration, but not pressure amplitude.
Response1: According to the reviewer, the expressions are revised in the paper.
Question2: Page No.4, RMS (root mean square) is defined in Equation (4), which is
not the ordinary definition. Then, why's RMS defined as Equation (4)?
Response2: In the paper, we introduce the RMS method to evaluate pressure energy
in particular frequency band. In fact, the equation is borrowed from the vibration field,
and the detailed explanation could be found in Questions2,4 of reviewer1.
Reviewer3
Question1: In the set-up used for these tests, it is very likely that partial closing of the
valve at the suction pipe produces cavitation at the valve itself before than in the
pump. Please clarify.
Response1: Thanks for the comment. In fact, during experiments, the valve at the
suction pipe is fully opened. To adjust the flow rate, the valve at the outlet pipe is used.
So, cavitation would not occur in the inlet gate valve.
Question2: The term “auto-power transform” requires some explanations.
Response2: To transform time-domain signals into frequency-domain signal, many
methods could be used, such as FFT analysis, wavelet transform. In the paper, we use
auto-power transform to obtain the pressure spectra at different cavitation stages. So,
it is just a signal processing technique.
Question3: Please present the mounting method of the pressure transducers. Were the
sensors flash-mounted on the internal surface of the casing?
Response3: The threaded holes are first drilled on the volute wall. Meanwhile, the
connectors are strictly manufactured according to the installation requirement of the
transducer. During the experiments, the pressure transducers are fixed in the
connectors which are mounted on the volute wall through the holes. Finally, the
pressure transducers are flash-mounted on the volute wall. So no cavity exists
between the tap and the volute surface. The measuring diameter of the tap is about
5.5mm. The detailed installation requirements are shown in figure.
Question4: “Pressure amplitude increases significantly due to cavitation bubble
collapsing and the volumetric change of cavitation cloud compared with
non-cavitation condition”. Please give some explanations.
Response4: Due to the bubble collapsing effect, high pressure wave would be emitted,
so pressure pulsation amplitude of the pump would be increased at full cavitation
stage. Besides, from the published researches, it is found that the cavitating flow
structure shows an unsteady characteristic. Due to the periodic developing process of
cavitating flow structure, such as bubble occurring, then moving, finally collapsing,
the cavitation region would change significantly at different moments. The
phenomenon is also found in the hydrofoil[Ji et al International Journal of Multiphase
Flow 2015]. Finally, pressure pulsation amplitude in the pump would increase due to
the two combined effects.
Question5: “Pressure amplitudes at the critical point NPSHc are much smaller than
the initial pressure amplitudes at non-cavitation condition due to the partial
compressible cavitation cloud”. Why?
Response5: At typical cavitation number, cavitation status is considered as bubble
cavitation. Due to the compressible effect of bubble cavitation, pressure energy
emitted from the bubble collapsing would be reduced. Thus, pressure pulsation energy
at the critical point NPSHc is smaller than the non-cavitation condition for some
measuring points. The explanation could also be found in Question3 of reviewer1.
Question6: Do you have any suggestion on how the flow affected by the cavitation at
different NPSHs. Maybe in the further study, flow structures could be investigated
from CFD method at cavitation status to discuss the internal relationship.
Response6: Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion. Cavitation is really a complex and
unsteady flow phenomenon. At different cavitation numbers, cavitating flow structure
may show significant difference. Besides, due to the impeller rotating effect,
cavitating flow structure would show unsteady characteristic. The periodic evolution
of cavitating flow structure would have an effect on the pressure pulsation of the
pump. Besides, it is not easy to capture and analyze the unsteady cavitating flow using
visualization method due to some limitations. So, in the future, CFD method could be
used to analyze the complex cavitation in the pump. Deeper analysis and discussion
could be carried out.
Reviewer4
Question1: During the cavitation bubble bursting, shock wave will be generated in an
extremely short time. Therefore, some high frequency noises will be emitted.
However, only the frequency band of 0-500Hz was discussed in this manuscript, so it
seems that the correlation between cavitation and pressure pulsation has not been truly
revealed.
Response1: Thanks for the reviewer’s comment. Just as the reviewer pointed, during
cavitation bubble collapsing, high frequency noise would be emitted, and this
phenomenon has be validated and captured in the published works. In the present
paper, the frequency band of pressure spectrum is set as 10240Hz during experiment.
Even so, we could not capture high frequency signals in pressure spectrum. This
phenomenon is also found in the work of Lu et al (Journal of Mechanical Science and
Technology 2017). The reason may be related to measuring position of the pressure
transducer. During experiments, the locations of pressure transducers are far away
from the cavitation developing region, and it may have a significant effect on the
detected high frequency signal. Due to the fast degradation of the emitted shock wave
energy, high frequency signals larger than 1000 Hz in pressure spectrum are not
captured in centrifugal pumps during the experiments. In the present work, the
frequency band of 0-500Hz was mainly discussed.
Question2: This manuscript tried to investigate the cavitating flow induced unsteady
pressure pulsations in a pump, thus the pressure pulsation characteristics in impeller
should be presented. If it is difficult to deploy pressure transducers in the impeller, the
corresponding simulation results should be presented to explain the correlation
between cavitation and pressure pulsation in the impeller.
Response2: Many thanks to the reviewer’s suggestion. During experiments, it is
difficult to mount pressure transducer in the impeller channel. So, we could not
analyze the correlation between cavitation and pressure pulsation in the impeller.
Maybe, in the impeller, the pressure spectrum is different from that at the volute
casing wall at cavitation status. Just as the reviewer recommended, the numerical
simulation could be used to obtain cavitating flow structures and pressure pulsation
characteristics in the impeller. However, as for cavitation simulation, it needs long
time to obtain the final results. Currently, it is almost for us to do the simulation and
add the results into the paper. In the further study, the simulation would be conducted
to discuss the relation between cavitation and pressure pulsation in the impeller.
Question3: In introduction, more literatures about the internal flow or pressure
pulsation characteristics in pumps under cavitation condition should be introduced
and discussed, not only the cavitating flows around the foils.
Response3: We have added more papers on cavitation investigation in the pumps in
the revised paper.
Question4: Correct “NPSHc” and “<U+F073>c” for the title of ordinate in Fig.4.
Response4: According to the reviewer1, fig.4 has been deleted in the revised paper.
Question5: Line 11, page 3, correct “t=0.0414s”.
Response5: The expression is corrected in the revised paper.
Question6: Lines 36-46, page 3, it is better to provide the pictures of cavitation
structure at different cavitation numbers.
Response6: we have added cavitation structures at some typical cavitation numbers in
the revised paper.
The corresponding cavitation flow structures at different cavitation numbers are
presented in fig.8. The detailed description of cavitation visualization experiment
could be found in our previous work for the model pump. It is observed that small
cavitation bubbles occur at the blade suction side near the trailing edge at cavitation
number s =0.150. At this status, the corresponding head drop in fig.3 is about 1.1%.
So, from the head drop, it is considered that cavitation does not develop in the
impeller channels. However, from cavitation visualization, it is apparent that
cavitation bubbles are captured long before the normal 3% head drop criteria. Due to
the developing of cavitation bubbles in the impeller, pressure pulsation is affected at
this status. With cavitation number decreasing to s =0.104 litter higher than the
critical cavitation number, cavitation region in the blade channel expands, which
occupies larger area of blade inlet. At this condition, the corresponding head drop is
2%. From fig.8, it is noted that pressure pulsation amplitude reaches to a minimum
point at s =0.104. When cavitation number decreasing below the critical point at s
=0.905, it is observed that almost half of the blade inlet area is occupied by cavitation
bubbles. At this stage, both the performance and pressure pulsation energy are
affected significantly.
Question7: Lines 7-8, page 4, please give more explanations why the cavitation cloud
becomes incompressible when the cavitation number is lower than the critical point.
Response7: As for cavitation number lower than the critical point, cavitation status is
considered as incompressible. At this cavitation stage, pressure pulsation increases
rapidly. So, it is inferred that the emitted pressure wave from the bubble collapsing
could not be reduced, which would lead to pressure amplitude increasing at this
condition. The reason is related to the corresponding cavitating flow structure. At the
cavitation number, we could observe that significant interface exist between the two
phase flows from cavitation visualization figures at different moments. Due to the
interfaces developing, the cavitation statue changes from bubble cavitation to the
incompressible stage, which has little effect on absorbing the pressure energy from the
bubble collapsing. Such deduction was also proposed by P. J. McNulty et al
[Cavitation Inception in Pumps- Journal of Fluids Engineering].
Question8: Lines 17-20, page 4, the RMS method should be illustrated, why the
equation (4) is used?
Response8: In the present paper, we use the RMS method to calculate pressure
energy in typical frequency band. The explanations could be found in Questions2,4 of
reviewer1.
Question9: Please give the explanation why the pressure pulsation is the smallest
when the critical cavitation number <U+F073> is equal to 0.091 at <U+F071> =90°? (Fig. 15).
Response9: Thanks for the reviewer’s comment. Honestly, it is not easy to give the
precise explanation for the smallest amplitude at <U+F071> =90°. In my opinion, the reason
may be related to the asymmetric flow distribution on periphery of the impeller. As
for centrifugal pump, flow structures in different blade-blade channels are not
identical due to the rotor-stator interaction effect, and flow structure may show
significant difference in different blade channels. So, it is inferred that even at
cavitation condition, flow distribution would also show some differences, and this
may have an effect on the induced pressure pulsations at different positions. Finally,
for the positon at <U+F071> =90°, the typical cavitation distribution may lead to pressure
pulsation reaching to smallest. In the further study, deeper investigation from CFD
method may help us to discuss the reason from flow distribution aspect. Anyway,
thanks to the comments.
The whole paper has been carefully revised to improve its quality, and we
sincerely expect it would be accepted for publication in the journal.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
