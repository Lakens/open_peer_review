I enjoyed reading this manuscript. It is well organized and well written. My major concern with
this study is the short temporal scale and the potential for confounding factors that might have
affected colonies before the study began or during the study. A temporal "replication" (longer
study of the same colonies) would help clarify many patterns, especially for organisms that are
long lived. This is a limitation in many studies of these modular, long lived organisms. A short
paragraph in the discussion stating the limitations of the study (sampling, spatial and temporal
scales, platform replication, etc. etc. would be informative and a nice complement to the work.
The higher disease prevalence near the unused platforms is similar to results and observations in
the Caribbean where, higher number of diseases and disease prevalence is often found in areas
away (better conditions) from human impacted areas.
A little more information on what sort of human activities are carried out in the platforms and
surroundings might be helpful.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Denise Greig):
This study brings together a lot of data in a natural setting with a Before After Control Impact
study design. I appreciate all the work that went into interpreting these data sources and the
interplay between environmental factors, mirobial communities, disease, and immunity. The
changes in bacterial diversity prior to disease development are fascinating. It is well written, but
can be tough to follow in places because there is so much disparate information to absorb.
Both reviewers had concerns about the coral monitoring sample sizes and I am wondering if you
can offer some justification/rationale for the number of quadrats you used at each site as well as
the distances between them (i.e. how independent were they? and how representative of that area
as a whole?).
Additionally, I think the terminology gets confusing in some places obscuring the results. One
example is on line 79 when you use the word “stochastic”. I think this is part of the “Anna
6
Karenina principle” that you mention in more detail in the discussion, but in this sentence it is
unclear if the perturbations are stochastic or the microbial community response is stochastic. If
the microbial community response is random, then to me, this implies that disease, immunity and
enironmental factors would not matter. Maybe the sentence at lines 453-456 should be moved up
to the introduction. At the very least, I would move the sentence at lines 453-456 to earlier in the
discussion when you first mention the “Anna Karenina principle” and clarify the meaning of the
sentence in the intro.
One of the reviewers had issues with the meanings for diversity versus heterogeneity. Alpha and
beta diversity, and the tests used for each, were nicely described in the methods, but it got
confusing in the results section. Specifically, I was confused about the interplay between diversity
and heterogeneity in lines 348-357. I don’t know if additional subheadings would help here,
maybe by season? Or if you just need to go through and make sure you are using the same terms
consistently.
Line 418-432. In this paragraph, I am confused about the immune finding described in the first
sentence and the way it is summed up at the end of this paragraph (and also in the abstract). The
sentence cites signficant reductions in immune function on platform v control corals, but looking
at Figure 5, the phenoloxidase activity is identical between apparently healthy coral at the
platform and control sites in Jan and Feb when the WS coral appears to mount a healthy immune
response (altough I guess the response was quite variable in Feb)…. what if the Jan and Feb
phenoloxidase activity levels are baseline for the control site and in November and June, the
control site corals were responding to some separate insult?
I like supplementary Figure 1 and because it is the first thing you refer to in the Results, I would
consider including it in the main portion of the manuscript.
For Figure 4, I don’t quite understand the y-axis label. The caption says it is within-category
distance…which categories are being referred to here?

. Raymundo
manuscript reports a study examining changes in microbial surface communities and immune
tion in diseased and healthy corals growing in areas exposed to tourism activity vs. those in an area
ote from tourism across two seasons. The authors noted a decrease in immune capacity associated
tourism sites, as well as increased community heterogeneity and reduced diversity among surface
erial communities.
work was carefully carried out and adds to the body of knowledge regarding the physiological basis
oral responses to disease and environmental stress. As such, it should be published. Specific
ments that the authors hopefully find useful are listed below:
63: there should be a comma between “disease” and “and” and outbreak should be plural.
115: considering what has already been published on this subject, the authors may wish to clarify
“concentrated visitor activity” involves both physical damage to corals and at least short-term
acts to water quality from both sunscreen and human waste. Also, I’m not quite sure how potential
off can result from offshore pontoons.
s 136 and 147: the sample period is stated twice and is a bit redundant. Best to choose to mention
ne section, but not both. It may also be informative to add some information on how visitor number
have varied within the sample period. Rain and temperature were discussed, but not visitor
centration.
142: Please clarify whether the control site was upstream or downstream of the pontoons, in terms
urrent patterns.
150: commas are needed around “and immediately preceding”
173: I suggest moving “at 2-3 m depth” to the beginning of the first sentence: “At 2-3 m depth
in each of the three locations monitored….”
s 180-182: I am not sure where this might fit best, but how did you control for-or at least consider-
potential response of corals to the physical injury resulting from branch removal for sampling?
ause immune responses are known to be triggered as a result of physical injury, you might want to
tion somewhere how you controlled for that (i.e., you treated all colonies the same way,
umably), and perhaps include a short reference to this in your discussion.
263: Change “perMANOVA” to “PERMANOVA”?
ults: My main issue here is the very small sample size (8 tagged colonies per site) and the small
ber of diseased colonies that were subsequently sampled. A single colony at the used platform
eloped WS, as compared to none in the control site. Four colonies developed WS in the unused
form, which is 50% of that tagged population, but still a very small sample size. If the colonies were
e together, and WS was caused by an infectious agent and transmitted by a vector (both are strong
ibilities), then that could explain the results independent of the presence or absence of the
form. While I appreciate the enormous amount of effort that went into this study, I think making
ements suggesting an effect of the platforms could be made stronger if there were monitoring or
ssment data of the larger population that could be cited here. I know that Lamb and Willis
onstrated significant differences in prevalence between platforms and control sites. Are there data
lable that were collected during this study of this larger population that could support these
ings?
wise, the discussion (Line 438 and on) would also benefit from a reference to this; “31% of all
form site corals” does not adequately represent the population of platform corals, when this
ement only considers 8 out of ? colonies of A. millepora.
ults Section on Anthropogenic Influences: This section (and subsequent mentions), I think, would
efit from a clarification of the differences between diversity and heterogeneity, as well as how
mple” is defined (i.e., one branch per colony? Or all branches from a single colony, with comparisons
being made between colonies?). Much of the critical fine-scaled results discussed make reference
hese differences. I’m assuming that sample heterogeneity means greater differences in abundance,
ell as the total number of taxa/OTUs counted, but it would help to have that more clearly spelled
paragraph of the Discussion: Have the authors considered the pulses of tourists on the used
form as being a short-term water quality and physical damage impact? Seabirds are mentioned, so
not tourists?

joyed reading this manuscript. It is well organized and well written. My major
cern with this study is the short temporal scale and the potential for confounding
tors that might have affected colonies before the study began or during the study. A
poral "replication" (longer study of the same colonies) would help clarify many
terns, especially for organisms that are long lived. This is a limitation in many studies
hese modular, long lived organisms. A short paragraph in the discussion stating the
tations of the study (sampling, spatial and temporal scales, platform replication, etc.
. would be informative and a nice complement to the work.
authors are grateful for the constructive feedback from Reviewer 1. We have added
umber of points within the discussion as suggested by the reviewer. We have not
ed a whole paragraph of limitations but incorporated these limitations in specific
vant points of the discussion and replicated below with corresponding line numbers
he final manuscript:
e 520: “Future work would benefit from higher resolution water quality sampling
mbined with longer-term monitoring of more colonies over time.”
e 584: “Importantly, corals have the potential for long life-spans, and thus the 7-
nth span of this study represents only a snapshot of disease dynamics. Hence
ulation level disease surveys should be combined with the methods used herein (i.e.
robial and immunity analyses) to better detail the dynamics of disease at reefs with
rist platforms.”
higher disease prevalence near the unused platforms is similar to results and
ervations in the Caribbean where, higher number of diseases and disease
valence is often found in areas away (better conditions) from human impacted areas.
ttle more information on what sort of human activities are carried out in the platforms
surroundings might be helpful.
re information has been added to detail the activities carried out at the platforms, as
ow from line 143:
nd provided tourists with snorkel and diving tours, air-conditioned lounges, and fresh
er showers and toilet facilities.”

perature were discussed, but not visitor concentration.
nk you for pointing out this redundancy. We have deleted the sentence from the
ond section (line 147).
ortunately we do not have access to visitor numbers to the Hardy Reef platform for
study period. Though monthly overall tourist visitation data to the entire Whitsundays
ion is available through GBRMPA, this data represents a region wide number not
cific numbers to the study site. While these data may reflect general trends in
tation, we are wary of incorporating these values as a covariate in the water quality
lysis as they would not be robust in any way.
have included the following text in the methods to acknowledge this limitation, line
:
ily visitor data were not available and thus visitor concentration was unable to be
uded as a water quality covariate.”

vised as suggested.
es 180-182: I am not sure where this might fit best, but how did you control for-or at
st consider the potential response of corals to the physical injury resulting from branch
oval for sampling?
cause immune responses are known to be triggered as a result of physical injury, you
ht want to mention somewhere how you controlled for that (i.e., you treated all colonies
same way, presumably), and perhaps include a short reference to this in your
cussion.
have added the below text to indicate we did consider this potential bias, and
mpted to control for it through rapid and consistent processing, line 191:
attempt to minimize bias resulting from triggering an immune response as a result of
sical injury from fragment removal [48] or bacterial proliferation, samples were
ected in the same order during each monthly time period and frozen within 15 minutes
ollection. Additionally, the lesion itself was not included in further sample processing
the initial PO response due to injury is local to the lesion [48].”
also added a reference, van de Water et al. 2015, The coral immune response
litates protection against microbes during tissue regeneration [48] which discusses in
ail the immune response as a result of physical injury.
e 263: Change “perMANOVA” to “PERMANOVA”?
ed as suggested.
sults: My main issue here is the very small sample size (8 tagged colonies per site)
the small number of diseased colonies that were subsequently sampled. A single
ony at the used platform developed WS, as compared to none in the control site. Four
onies developed WS in the unused platform, which is 50% of that tagged population,
still a very small sample size. If the colonies were close together, and WS was caused
an infectious agent and transmitted by a vector (both are strong possibilities), then that
ld explain the results independent of the presence or absence of the platform. While I
reciate the enormous amount of effort that went into this study, I think making
tements suggesting an effect of the platforms could be made stronger if there were
nitoring or assessment data of the larger population that could be cited here. I know
t Lamb and Willis demonstrated significant differences in prevalence between
tforms and control sites. Are there data available that were collected during this study
his larger population that could support these findings?
acknowledge the limitations of our sample size, and have attempted to frame the work
a case study to be used as a launching point for further work. We have added text to
ail that tagged colonies were collected from 5m apart to minimise the risk of vector
smission confounding our results, lines 179:
re was taken to select colonies separated by a minimum of 5m to minimize the risk of
foundment due to potential vector transmission of infectious disease agents.”
have also made the limitation of our sample size more explicit, line 586:
nce population level disease surveys should be combined with the methods used
ein (i.e. microbial and immunity analyses) to better detail the dynamics of disease at
fs with tourist platforms.”
ortunately, while Lamb and Willis did collect disease prevalence data from Hardy
ef, they did not monitor the same control site and therefore this data can not be
uded. However, our study aimed to determine the mechanism behind this finding,
er than to further demonstrate the difference in disease prevalence in the population,
line 486:
duced bacterial diversity and suppression of coral immune function in apparently
lthy corals adjacent to reef platforms reveals a potential mechanism contributing to
observed 15-fold increase in coral disease levels near reef platforms previously
orted by Lamb & Willis [55].”
ewise, the discussion (Line 438 and on) would also benefit from a reference to this;
% of all platform site corals” does not adequately represent the population of platform
als, when this statement only considers 8 out of ? colonies of A. millepora.
anged to “31% of tagged platform site corals”
sults Section on Anthropogenic Influences: This section (and subsequent mentions), I
k, would benefit from a clarification of the differences between diversity and
erogeneity, as well as how “sample” is defined (i.e., one branch per colony? Or all
nches from a single colony, with comparisons thus being made between colonies?).
ch of the critical fine-scaled results discussed make reference to these differences. I’m
uming that sample heterogeneity means greater differences in abundance, as well as
total number of taxa/OTUs counted, but it would help to have that more clearly spelled
.
ersity refers to within-coral bacterial community diversity (i.e. alpha diversity), whereas
ong-coral differences in community composition is referred to as heterogeneity (i.e.
a diversity). We have edited the text throughout to attempt to clarify this distinction,
have used the wording “more/less stable” in place of “heterogeneous,” and have been
re explicit that these comparisons are among individuals.
t paragraph of the Discussion: Have the authors considered the pulses of tourists on
used platform as being a short-term water quality and physical damage impact?
abirds are mentioned, so why not tourists?
s is an excellent point, and we have added this into the text, see line 558:
ditionally, pulses of high visitor concentrations could introduce short-term water quality
nges from human waste, or could cause stress to corals through physical damage.”
sociate Editor Comments to Author, Dr Denise Greig:
s study brings together a lot of data in a natural setting with a Before After Control
act study design. I appreciate all the work that went into interpreting these data
rces and the interplay between environmental factors, mirobial communities, disease,
immunity. The changes in bacterial diversity prior to disease development are
cinating. It is well written, but can be tough to follow in places because there is so
ch disparate information to absorb.
h reviewers had concerns about the coral monitoring sample sizes and I am wondering
ou can offer some justification/rationale for the number of quadrats you used at each
as well as the distances between them (i.e. how independent were they? and how
resentative of that area as a whole?).
have added text to indicate that the corals selected for tagging were separated by a
imum distance of 5 meters in order to minimise potential bias due to either sampling
he same genet or by being within the dispersal distance of potential infectious disease
tors.
ortunately, one determinant for sample size was project budget, as the sequencing
ts of greater than 24 samples across 4 time points would have been prohibitive.
tunately, sequencing costs continue to become more affordable, and thus future work
ld easily increase the sampling effort. Additionally, we were limited by the tourism
rator and GBRMPA as to the number of colonies that were allowed to be tagged. Eight
onies were permitted at the main tourist pontoon, and thus in the interest of consistency
tagged eight colonies at each of the three sites. We have not detailed the budget
tation nor the operator’s imposed limitation in the manuscript, although we are
enable to adding a sentence if the Editor suggests doing so.
ditionally, I think the terminology gets confusing in some places obscuring the results.
e example is on line 79 when you use the word “stochastic”. I think this is part of the
na Karenina principle” that you mention in more detail in the discussion, but in this
tence it is unclear if the perturbations are stochastic or the microbial community
ponse is stochastic. If the microbial community response is random, then to me, this
lies that disease, immunity and environmental factors would not matter. Maybe the
tence at lines 453-456 should be moved up to the introduction. At the very least, I
uld move the sentence at lines 453-456 to earlier in the discussion when you first
ntion the “Anna Karenina principle” and clarify the meaning of the sentence in the intro.
have attempted to clarify the sentence in the introduction, line 79:
rthermore, environmental perturbations can reduce the capacity of the host and/or the
robiome to regulate community composition, resulting in an unpredictable and
table microbial community state.”
have also moved the sentence in the discussion as suggested, see lines 439.
e of the reviewers had issues with the meanings for diversity versus heterogeneity.
ha and beta diversity, and the tests used for each, were nicely described in the
thods, but it got confusing in the results section. Specifically, I was confused about the
rplay between diversity and heterogeneity in lines 348-357. I don’t know if additional
headings would help here, maybe by season? Or if you just need to go through and
ke sure you are using the same terms consistently.
have edited the text throughout to be more explicit about alpha versus beta diversity,
ase see tracked changes from lines 344-410.
e 418-432. In this paragraph, I am confused about the immune finding described in the
t sentence and the way it is summed up at the end of this paragraph (and also in the
tract). The sentence cites signficant reductions in immune function on platform v
trol corals, but looking at Figure 5, the phenoloxidase activity is identical between
arently healthy coral at the platform and control sites in Jan and Feb when the WS
al appears to mount a healthy immune response (altough I guess the response was
te variable in Feb)…. what if the Jan and Feb phenoloxidase activity levels are baseline
the control site and in November and June, the control site corals were responding to
me separate insult?
have added in acknowledgement of this possibility, line 526:
seline levels of total potential phenoloxidase activity in control corals potentially
ferred disease resistance, but could also reflect a response to a separate insult, and
ger term data would be required to better establish baseline activity.”
all clarifications have also been made:
e 517: “…in these corals compared to those that remained visually healthy near the
tforms…”
e 520: “…corals responded to disease using TLR signaling and complement system
vation along with an increase in phenoloxidase activities.”
e 529: “However, not all platform site corals developed disease despite their relatively
tpPO activity levels…”
e 537: “However, the reduced levels of immune effectors, such as tpPO activity, could
gest that the antimicrobial defenses were negatively impacted, contributing to disease
elopment. In contrast, the baseline levels of tpPO activity in control site corals
entially conferred disease resistance.”
have also moved this entire block of text to a later section to better fit within the
nuscript framework.
e supplementary Figure 1 and because it is the first thing you refer to in the Results, I
uld consider including it in the main portion of the manuscript.
s figure has been moved to the main manuscript as suggested.
Figure 4, I don’t quite understand the y-axis label. The caption says it is within-
egory distance…which categories are being referred to here?
y-axis shows that lower scores indicate that microbial community composition is
ilar between samples of the same type (i.e. WS / healthy platform / healthy control).
figure has been clarified to show that part A is alpha diversity (mean Faith’s PD) and
t B is beta diversity (mean UniFrac distance). The caption has been updated to read:
ure 5: Comparisons of bacterial communities associated with A. millepora among
lthy corals at control sites (white bars, n = 4 colonies), healthy corals at platform sites
ht blue bars, n = 5 colonies), and colonies with WSs at platform sites (dark blue bars,
5 colonies) at four time points (November, January, February, and June) for (A) mean
ha diversity (measured as Faith’s phylogenetic distance); and (B) mean beta diversity
asured as UniFrac distance). A lower score in panel (B) indicates community
mposition is more similar between colonies, and conversely, a higher score indicates
mmunity composition is more dissimilar between colonies. Error bars: standard error
the mean. The asterisks denote a significant within-month difference in (A)
logenetic diversity using Tukey’s HSD; and (B) UniFrac distances using a t-test with
Monte Carlo permutations”
