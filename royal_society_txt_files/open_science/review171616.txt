The study provides a worthwhile contribution to the literature. Below are a few minor
comments/ suggestions on how to improve the study even further.
1. Page 4, Line 24 to 35 starting with "However, an alternative account based..." This section is
crucial for the general understanding of the paper yet lacks some clarity. Please clarify. Also, does
the alternative account propose that faces will not be rated equally attractive? If so please state
this clearly.
2. Page 5, line 14 "All key..." These are not all the factors that influence facial attractiveness. Other
factors such as facial adiposity, skin colour etc also plays a role. Maybe change "All" to "some"
3. Page 8, line 7. In what form was the original faces when they were rated for attractiveness?
Were they masked or unmasked?
4. Did you include male and female faces from the database?
5. Page 8, line 44. Include the term "attractiveness"
6. Page 10, Line 24 "must have been due to the differences in the external face region". This is not
the only plausible reason. It could also be because of the exclusion of external factors and
therefore the outline of the face. For example, the exclusion of the outline could hide the facial
adiposity or masculinity (in female faces), which would make them appear more attractive. Or
the exclusion could make the face appear more symmetrical. These points are mentioned at the
end of the manuscript but is also relevant here.

SUMMARY. Authors measured facial attractiveness of young female face models, using different
clipping masks for the inner face parts (internal features). Results showed same ratings for full
faces with all external features (hair, ears and face outline) and internal features shown through
regular elliptical masks. Clipping masks with tracing line close to face outline yielded reduced
attractiveness ratings. Reducing the window on internal features by scaling these masks
increased the attractiveness rating again. When an artificial headscarf was used to mimic the
shape of the outline clipping masks, elliptical form and outline form yielded same ratings when
they had same area. Larger areas yielded lower ratings. Authors concluded that mask shape and
internal features interact in determining facial attractiveness.
OVERALL. Generally, I have mixed feelings about the manuscript. As it is structured, one gets
the impression there is an “elliptical mask advantage”, which would be a nice effect. However,
when going from Exp I to Exp V one sees there is no real advantage of the elliptical mask form -
mostly only area matters. Further, I have reservations about the shape of the outline masks. I
wonder whether masks of this kind are really in use, since they are no true outline masks in the
heads’ upper part. Generally, I think that Exp. 4 (headscarf), and full face vs elliptical mask
condition of Exp. 5 are relevant, while I don’t think that the outline condition, as it is actually
realized, leads to relevant conclusions about facial attractiveness perception.
SPECIFIC
1\ Please cite literature where outline masks of this kind are used. No such references are given.
Cutting a face along the (accidental, arbitrary) hairline yields a spatially irregular tracing line,
which destroys overall face symmetry. Hairline is not the face outline border, which emerges
when hair is removed, but shape maintained. See Troje & Bülthoff, VisRes1996, and masking
principles outlined there for creating instances of the Tuebingen face database. Fig. 1 there shows
extracted face outline without hairs.
2\ Throughout the ms there are statements claiming that more external features are revealed
when enlarging the area of the clipping mask. I see only more skin area of the inner face parts
revealed, while external features remain concealed.
4
3\ Exp I and set B of Exp. II are identical (“purpose was to replicate, p.11 l. 36). However, the
results particularly for unattractive faces differ strongly (c. Fig. 2 and 3B). No explanation is
given.
4\ When reporting results of pairwise comparisons, effect sizes in terms of Cohen’s d should be
added. In Fig. 2 one can hardly believe that there is an Attract x Mask interaction. Looks rather
parallel.
5\ Since the same faces are used in the different mask conditions, authors could look at the rank
correlation of the 24 faces across the masking conditions within each experiment. This could give
a clue whether masking affects all faces in a similar way (high rank correlation) or differently for
different face identities (low rank correlation). Comparing same conditions across experiments
(different subjects) could indicate inter-rater reliability of attractiveness. Ranks of full faces in
Exp5 could be compared to the ratings of the 19 raters that acted prior to the study.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
1\ It is consensus in the literature that, concerning facial features, a distinction is made between
external (e.g., hair, ears, facial outline) and internal (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth) features (see Nachson
9
and Shechory, Acta Psy, 2002; Ellis, Shepherd, & Davies, 1979, see Fig. 1 there, which makes the
distiction quite clear). Please these use terms accordingly, and consistently within the ms, to
avoid confusion.
As a result of imprecise use of terms, the abstract contains contradicting statements. In 2nd
sentence one reads “This study investigated how this exclusion of the external features affects
the perception of attractiveness“ … and later on: “Further manipulation confirmed that the effect
was mainly due to the occlusion of a larger area of the external features rather than the regular
and symmetrical features of the oval shape“. How could this be if authors have already excluded
external features? Apparently, authors mean „occlusion of a larger area of the inner face parts“
here.
2\ Abstract. The abstract mentions different results for different timings, but gives no explanation
for this. Thus is confusing – authors should better avoid to report results in the abstract which are
unexplained. Further, the authors state that the oval mask advantage was merely due to reduced
inner face area rather than to its specific regular form, and that no advantage to an unmasked face
was found. The statement that there might be “interaction between the shape of a mask and the
internal features of the face“ is rather unspecific. Authors should end the abstract with a sentence
that tells the reader what the crucial and novel finding of this study is and what it tells us about
face attractiveness perception. The abstract, as it stands now, has no clear take-home message.
3\ Discussion of Exp. 4 and General Discussion. Exp. 4, p19 1st par: Authors interpret the
findings that “mask shape was treated as a part oft the face in holistic processing“. However, in
General Discussion, p. 22, they state „Participants were unlikely to treat the oval shape as the
boundary of a face. This should more clearly be the case in Experiment 4, where the oval-shaped
outline was likely to be seen as belonging to the headscarf.“ I think the latter interpretation is
correct, so the sentence on p. 19 should be changed.
4\ General Discussion. I do not get the logic behind “In other words, the edge of the occluding
object could be a part of the holistic face processing even though it is not a part of the face.“ Can
the authors give any plausible reasons why the headscarf should be included in holistic face
processing? I think it is not necessary to posulate this. It would be enough to show that external
object surround can modulate holistic processing of inner face parts. I think there are many
studies in the literature showing this, at least for for face identity perception.
5\ General Discussion. As I said for the abstract, a clear conlusion or take-home message is
lacking. Please try a good sumup that doesn‘t lack punsh. Please don’t leave the reader with
“unresolved mysteries“ (last sentence of GD).

Reviewer 1
The study provides a worthwhile contribution to the literature. Below are a few
minor comments/ suggestions on how to improve the study even further.
1. Page 4, Line 24 to 35 starting with "However, an alternative account based..."
This section is crucial for the general understanding of the paper yet lacks some
clarity. Please clarify. Also, does the alternative account propose that faces will not
be rated equally attractive? If so please state this clearly.
We have tried to clarify what we meant by “blind to the comprehension of edge
ownership”. We hope this is now clearer. If it is still unclear or if there is
something else that the reviewer would like us to clarify, we will be happy to try
more.
2. Page 5, line 14 "All key..." These are not all the factors that influence facial
attractiveness. Other factors such as facial adiposity, skin colour etc also plays a
role. Maybe change "All" to "some"
We agree with this and have changed “all” to “some”.
3. Page 8, line 7. In what form was the original faces when they were rated for
attractiveness?
Good question. They were rated for the outline mask version. We have added
this to the new version.
4. Did you include male and female faces from the database?
We included only female faces from the database. To make this more clearly, we
have now added “We only used female faces”.
5. Page 8, line 44. Include the term "attractiveness"
We have inserted the term “attractiveness”.
6. Page 10, Line 24 "must have been due to the differences in the external face
region". This is not the only plausible reason. It could also be because of the
exclusion of external factors and therefore the outline of the face. For example, the
exclusion of the outline could hide the facial adiposity or masculinity (in female
faces), which would make them appear more attractive. Or the exclusion could
make the face appear more symmetrical. These points are mentioned at the end of
the manuscript but is also relevant here.
We agree with the reviewer’s points here. We have added these points in the
discussion.
7. page 13, line 11. I think you are referring to figure 3B (i.e. long exposure) not 3A
here.
We thank the reviewer for spotting this error. We have corrected this in the new
version. To be consistent with the order of the figure, we have swapped the
order of two paragraphs on the simple effects analyses for the two duration
conditions.
8. page 13, line 31. I think you are referring to figure 3A (i.e. short exposure) not
3B here.
We have also corrected the error here.
9. Page 14, line 52. Consider including "such as the facial outline" after "low spatial
frequency information".
Good suggestion. We have now added this.
10 page 8, line 31. How was the oval masked placed? Was it scaled for the size of
the face? please provide more info in the method section.
Yes, it was adjusted for the size of the face. We have added this information.
11. General question. Please provide more details about the raters, such as where
they were recruited from, if they were caucasian etc?
It would be nice to include these details. The database does not contain
demographic information about the raters, but because the data were collected
at University St Andrews, we assume that most of them were Caucasian students.
However, because the database is old, it would be very difficult to retrieve the
details. As for our own participants, unfortunately we did not record their ethnic
background. However, we are certain over 90% of participants in all
experiments of this study were Caucasians. If the reviewer recommends that we
add this information, we are happy to do so.
12. Page 22, line 14. what were the pairwise comparisons of the mask shape?
Because there was a significant interaction, we thought it would be more
informative to report pairwise comparisons of the mask shape following the
simple main effects analyses. The details of pairwise comparison of the mask
shape for attractive and unattractive faces were given separately. However, if the
reviewer considers it important to also include the comparisons based on the
main effect of mask shape, we can add these as well.
13. Please provide full error bars, not just one sided ones.
We have now modified all the results figures to provide full error bars.

SUMMARY. Authors measured facial attractiveness of young female face models,
using different clipping masks for the inner face parts (internal features). Results
showed same ratings for full faces with all external features (hair, ears and face
outline) and internal features shown through regular elliptical masks. Clipping
masks with tracing line close to face outline yielded reduced attractiveness ratings.
Reducing the window on internal features by scaling these masks increased the
attractiveness rating again. When an artificial headscarf was used to mimic the
shape of the outline clipping masks, elliptical form and outline form yielded same
ratings when they had same area. Larger areas yielded lower ratings. Authors
concluded that mask shape and internal features interact in determining facial
attractiveness.
OVERALL. Generally, I have mixed feelings about the manuscript. As it is structured,
one gets the impression there is an “elliptical mask advantage”, which would be a
nice effect. However, when going from Exp I to Exp V one sees there is no real
advantage of the elliptical mask form - mostly only area matters. Further, I have
reservations about the shape of the outline masks. I wonder whether masks of this
kind are really in use, since they are no true outline masks in the heads’ upper part.
Generally, I think that Exp. 4 (headscarf), and full face vs elliptical mask condition
of Exp. 5 are relevant, while I don’t think that the outline condition, as it is actually
realized, leads to relevant conclusions about facial attractiveness perception.
This is a nice summary of what we felt during the study too. An elliptical mask
advantage was a tantalising possibility, but was rejected by alternative
explanations tested in Experiments 4 and 5. We think together the five
experiments offer new pieces of information that were unknown previously. In
particular, although it is more intuitive to predict an elliptical mask advantage
based on its symmetrical feature, our manipulation was able to rule out this
explanation. Had our results supported this prediction, we would have simply
produced another piece of supporting evidence for a theory that has been well
known for a long time. Instead, our results revealed a limitation of this theory
because the symmetrical feature of the mask in our study was a lot less
important compared to the size of masked external areas. The results
demonstrate the relative importance of these factors in our experiments.
Furthermore we were able to establish that the apparent gain of the elliptical
mask was in fact a loss of removing hair, which resulted in a perceived size
difference in the external region.
We agree with the reviewer that researchers usually try to avoid exact outline
masks in the heads’ upper part. When the outline of the whole face is taken into
account, however, we do find that research using outline masks seems to be
fairly common. Here are a few examples: Burriss et al., (2009, Figure 1);
Glassenberg et al., (2010, Figure 1); Little et al., (2011, Figure 2); Van Belle et al.,
(2010, Figure 1).
However, we think that the fact that researchers are using outline masks may be
less important than the finding that different degrees of masking can alter
perception of attractiveness even though the degrees of masking is a bit
analogous to watching a face though a key whole of different sizes and shapes.
The latter was what we demonstrated in Experiments 1-3. We think this alone is
an interesting phenomenon, and the final two experiments were used to further
identify the cause of the effect. The fact that Experiment 4 created a very similar
pattern of results to Experiment 3 seems to show that the masking effect
demonstrated in the first three experiments does lead to relevant information
about facial attractiveness perception. We hope the reviewer is convinced by our
explanation, and we are happy to try more in our manuscript to make our points
clearer if the reviewer recommends. We are also open to include additional
caveats in our discussion if the reviewer thinks it is necessary.

SPECIFIC
1\ Please cite literature where outline masks of this kind are used. No such
references are given. Cutting a face along the (accidental, arbitrary) hairline yields
a spatially irregular tracing line, which destroys overall face symmetry. Hairline is
not the face outline border, which emerges when hair is removed, but shape
maintained. See Troje & Bülthoff, VisRes1996, and masking principles outlined
there for creating instances of the Tuebingen face database. Fig. 1 there shows
extracted face outline without hairs.
We have now included the references cited above. We agree that cutting a face
along the hairline can create an irregular tracing line. As Experiments 3 and 4
demonstrated, however, the irregular line may not be the main reason for the
effect in our study.
The reviewer is correct that hairline is not the face outline border as far as the
shape is concerned. The example in Troje and Bülthoff (1996) is a good
illustration of this. We would like to point out that the cut at the top the 3D head
is also not the face outline border. The 3D head shape is a continuous curved
surface. Perhaps a more important point is that both face shape and reflectance
(sometime also called texture map in 3D graphics) play a role in perception of
attractiveness. A good example of this is the role of the eyebrows. The shape of
the eyebrows matters for attractiveness although the underlying shape can be
maintained when the eyebrows are removed. The hair has a similar effect as the
eyebrows in this sense. If our explanations have missed the reviewer’s point, we
would very much appreciate the reviewer’s further comments and advice. We
will try our best to understand. If the reviewer thinks we should make any
changes in our manuscript, we are willing to consider to the advice.
2\ Throughout the ms there are statements claiming that more external features
are revealed when enlarging the area of the clipping mask. I see only more skin
area of the inner face parts revealed, while external features remain concealed.
It is indeed also true to say that more skin area of the inner face parts is revealed.
We think this is likely a matter of semantics. The confusion may result from the
fact that there isn’t a clear border between internal and external features. We
hope it is intuitive to think that as the aperture becomes bigger/as masked
region becomes smaller, the viewers can see greater internal area / more
external area of the face. For example, the jaw line is the border of the external
area, but also is on a continuous surface extends to the internal area. If the
reviewer would like us to add this clarification in our manuscript, we are happy
to do so.
3\ Exp I and set B of Exp. II are identical (“purpose was to replicate, p.11 l. 36).
However, the results particularly for unattractive faces differ strongly (c. Fig. 2 and
3B). No explanation is given.
We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have added this point in the
manuscript. The mean ratings in the second experiment do look noticeably lower
than those in the first, even though they both created a similar pattern of results.
We do not have a clear explanation about this. The two student samples were
separated by one academic year, but it is difficult to say how this could be an
explanation. We have followed the reviewer’s suggestion and calculated the rank
correlations of the faces across the masking conditions between Experiment 1
and Set B of Experiment 2. The Spearman rho is 0.91 for oval mask, and 0.96 for
outline mask. The inter-rater reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient) is
0.983 for the oval mask condition and 0.978 for the outline mask condition. If
only consider the results of unattractive faces, the Spearman rho is 0.80 for oval
mask, and 0.88 for outline mask; and the inter-rater reliability is 0.956 for the
oval mask condition and 0.977 for the outline mask condition. Perhaps these
analyses suggest that the results were fairly consistent.
4\ When reporting results of pairwise comparisons, effect sizes in terms of Cohen’s
d should be added. In Fig. 2 one can hardly believe that there is an Attract x Mask
interaction. Looks rather parallel.
Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now included Cohen’s d when
reporting results of pairwise comparisons.
5\ Since the same faces are used in the different mask conditions, authors could
look at the rank correlation of the 24 faces across the masking conditions within
each experiment. This could give a clue whether masking affects all faces in a
similar way (high rank correlation) or differently for different face identities (low
rank correlation). Comparing same conditions across experiments (different
subjects) could indicate inter-rater reliability of attractiveness. Ranks of full faces
in Exp5 could be compared to the ratings of the 19 raters that acted prior to the
study.
We thank the reviewer for these thoughtful suggestions. Details of the suggested
analyses are now added to the result section of each experiment. The results
seem to be quite consistent, showing that masking affected all faces in a similar
way, and the attractiveness ratings were also similar across different samples.

THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 2
Abstract
Facial attractiveness is often studied on the basis of the internal facial features alone. This
study investigated how this exclusion of the external features affects the perception of
attractiveness. We studied the effects of two most commonly used methods of exclusion,
where the shape of an occluding mask was defined by either the facial outline or an oval.
Participants rated attractiveness of the same faces under these conditions. Results showed that
faces were consistently rated more attractive when they were masked by an oval shape rather
than by their outline (Experiment 1). Attractive faces were more strongly affected by this
effect than were less attractive faces when participants were able to control the viewing time.
However, unattractive faces benefited more from this effect when the same face stimuli were
presented briefly for only 20 ms (Experiment 2). Further manipulation confirmed that the
effect was mainly due to the occlusion of a larger area of the external features rather than the
regular and symmetrical features of the oval shape (Experiment 3) or lacks contextual cues
about the face boundary (Experiment 4). The effect was only relative to masked faces, with
no advantage over unmasked faces (Experiment 5), and is likely a result of the interaction
between the shape of a mask and the internal features of the face. This holistic effect in the
appraisal of facial attractiveness is striking because the oval shape of the mask is not a part of
the face but is the edge of an occluding object.

THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 3
The Boundary of Holistic Processing in the Appraisal of Facial Attractiveness
Research on face perception routinely divides the face into internal and external features.
Internal features consist of the eyes, nose, and mouth, whereas external features include the
hair, ears, and facial outline. The distinction was first made in early studies of face recognition
(Ellis, Shepherd, & Davies, 1979; Young 1984; Young, Hay, McWeeny, Flude, & Ellis, 1985)
and has been adopted in all areas of face research, including facial expression and facial
attractiveness. Unlike scalp hair and paraphernalia, which can be easily altered, internal
features are more stable aspects of a face. Research has focused on internal features by isolating
them from the external region. The two most common methods for this control are shown in
Figure 1. The external features in both examples are masked, but to different extents. The first
excludes the hair, whereas the second excludes a larger area, including the facial outline with
an oval window. Although both are frequently used, research has rarely compared whether they
produce the same effects. To understand whether these masking methods are comparable, we
compared their effects on female facial beauty in this study. Due to the holistic nature of face
perception, the absence/presence of certain features could differentially affect the overall
impression of a face. The shape of the jawline and hairline is hidden when an oval window is
used as a mask. Hence these features cannot be used in attractiveness discrimination. Perhaps
due to this consideration, numerous authors routinely include the shape of facial outline in their
research on facial attractiveness (e.g., see masked face stimuli in Burriss, Rowland, & Little,
2009; Glassenberg, Feinberg, Jones, Little, & DeBruine, 2010; Little, Jones, & DeBruine, 2011;
Van Belle, Ramon, Lefèvre, & Rossion, 2010). However, it is unknown how the
exclusion/inclusion of these features affect perceived attractiveness.
THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 4
Occlusion is fairly common in natural images of faces. Occluding objects, such as
headscarves and hijabs, can partially obscure the shape of the jawline and hairline. The hair
and dark shadows can also hide portions of the forehead, eyebrows, or cheekbones. Such
naturally occurring partial occlusion seems to create little obstacles for evaluating facial beauty.
The two masks in Figure 1 could be seen as keyholes of different shapes that obscure different
external regions of a face. Logically, because the occluding edge is not the same as the outline
shape of a face, it should not affect the attractiveness of a face. This is particularly relevant to
the oval mask in Figure 1B, where the circular occluding edge is not a part of the face. The
shape of the mask in Figure 1A, however, coincides with that of the facial outline. Because of
this, the shape is a relevant factor in the evaluation. If the shape of an occluding object does
not affect the attractiveness of the face, the assessments of the two mask conditions should be
equal because the rest of the two images are identical. However, an alternative account based
on holistic processing would predict an interaction between the internal and external regions
of face, which may be blind to the comprehension of edge ownership. That is, the edge around
a face can be treated as a part of the face in an attractiveness judgement even though the
observer can see whether it belongs to the face or an occluding object. If this is true, then even
when it is seemingly impossible to assign an occluding edge to the face, the shape of the edge
may automatically be included in holistic processing. A casual observation of the example in
Figure 1A and 1B appears to favour this hypothesis because it gives the impression that the
face masked by an oval window looks more attractive. This simple observation was the starting
point of this study. In a series of experiments, we measured the reliability and generality of this
effect. In addition, we assessed whether this predicted advantage equally benefits faces of
THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 5
different levels of attractiveness.
There is ample evidence that an evaluation of facial attractiveness is holistic. In a
composite paradigm, the attractiveness of the top half of the face is affected by the
attractiveness of the bottom half when the two halves are aligned (Abbas, & Duchaine, 2008).
This means the two halves are automatically processed as a whole, even though the task
requires judging only one half and ignoring the other. Although judging sexual appeal by a
mate-relevant other sex could be based on specific facial features, assessing the aesthetic
qualities of facial attractiveness relies heavily on holistic processing (Franklin & Adams, 2009).
As a result of holistic processing, the same eye could appear larger or smaller, depending on
its distance from the eyebrow (Morikawa, Matsushita, Tomita, & Yamanami, 2015). AllSome
key factors of facial attractiveness, such as averageness (Langlois & Roggman, 1990),
symmetry (Thornhill & Gangestad, 1993), and sexual dimorphism (Perrett et al., 1998), depend
on a holistic integration of facial features. These factors are defined by statistical properties.
The averageness hypothesis, for example, suggests that attractiveness depends on how close a
face is to the statistical mean of a population of faces. Evidence for most of these factors has
been created through the use of morphing techniques. For example, a face that has been
averaged by morphing is commonly perceived as more attractive than the individual faces in
the morph. However, research based on morphing techniques mainly reveals the contribution
of internal features. This is because the technique requires clear corresponding points on the
face images to be morphed. Although such points on the internal features are fairly easy to
define, it can be difficult to find on the hair. Thus, the morphs created in most studies do not
have aligned points for hair. Evidence based on morphing techniques for the contribution of
THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 6
symmetry and sexual dimorphism is also derived from internal features for the same reason.
Our study is different from these studies because we looked into how an occluding shape may
interact with the internal features in holistic professingprocessing.
The internal features of the face in this study remained constant in all experiments.
Certain physical attributes of these features, such as large eyes, full lips, prominent cheekbones,
and small nose and chin, are identified as the key contributors of facial beauty (Baudouin &
Tiberghien, 2004; Cunningham, 1986; Geldart et al., 1999; Keating, 1985), personality and
physical health (Kramer & Ward, 2010). However, external features also play a role in
attractiveness judgements. This is evident from early infancy. Newborn infants pay attention to
both internal and external features in their perception of attractiveness (Slater et al., 2000).
Adults also use both internal and external regions in attractiveness judgements (Santos &
Young, 2011). External features such as hair can have a clear influence on attractiveness
(Saegusa, Intoy, & Shimojo, 2015; Fink, Hufschmidt, Hirn, Will, McKelvey, & Lankhof, 2016;
Swami, Furnham, & Joshi, 2008). The shape and outline of a face can signal the person’s youth,
fertility, femininity and attractiveness (O’Toole, Price, Vetter, Bartlett, & Blanz, 1999; Penton-
Voak et al. 1999). In addition, skin texture plays an important role (Fink, Grammer, & Matts,
2006; Jones, Little, Burt, & Perrett, 2004). However, few studies have investigated how internal
and external features interact in holistic processing of facial beauty. A notable exception can
be found in Saegusa et al. (2015), whose participants rated the attractiveness of a face or hair
while ignoring task-irrelevant hair or faces. The results showed that task-irrelevant hair affected
rating of the face if the participants had not previously rated the hair. In contrast, a task-
irrelevant face always affected the attractiveness rating of hair regardless of whether the face
THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 7
had been rated before. This demonstrates an automatic interaction between face and hair in
holistic processing. We were also interested in the interaction between the internal and external
features. However, an important difference in our study is that the outline of the external
features could also be the edge of an occluding object. In other words, our study also
investigated the potential involvement of a surrounding non-face object in holistic face
processing. This goes beyond the traditional inquiry about internal-external feature interaction.
The main hypothesis of this study was that internal facial features alone cannot determine
perceived facial beauty. Rather, it is also determined by how the external region of a face is
concealed or revealed. Although masking or occlusion does not affect the underlying physical
shape of the face, the occluding edge of a mask or object could be automatically integrated
with the face in holistic face processing.
Experiment 1
The first experiment addressed a simple question: Does the shape of a mask affect
perceived attractiveness? We compared the effects of two masks (shown in Figure 1) on
attractiveness rating. One mask used the shape of a facial outline, whereas the other followed
an oval shape. To study whether the two masks have the same effects on attractive and
unattractive faces, we divided our stimuli into attractive and unattractive faces based on a prior
rating of the original images.
Whether attractive and unattractive faces are equally affected by masking manipulation
should depend on the extent to which external features or the shape of mask contributes equally
at different levels of attractiveness. If, relative to attractive faces, external features account
more for the perceived unattractiveness, then hiding these features with a mask should create a
THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 8
larger positive effect for unattractive faces than for attractive ones.
Method
Participants. A total of 42 undergraduate students (30 females) aged between 20 and 30
years, Mdn = 21.5, participated in this experiment. All had normal or corrected-to-normal
vision. The study was conducted in accordance with the APA's guidelines on the treatment of
human participants and was approved by the local ethics committee.
Materials. The face database was obtained from the University of St. Andrews. It has 702
frontal-view Caucasian faces pre-rated for facial attractiveness. Only the version of these faces
masked by their facial outline was given a rating. The ratings were based on the ratings of 19
raters on a 7-point scale. We only used female faces. To determine whether the masking
manipulation in this study affects attractive and unattractive faces to the same degree, we
selected the 24 most attractive and 24 least attractive female faces as our stimuli. The mean
ratings for the two groups of faces were 4.11 and 2.23, respectively. These were significantly
different from each other (p < .001).
Face width was normalized to 400 pixels, which subtended 16.6° of the visual angle. Each
face was edited with Photoshop to create two versions. This resulted in a total of 96 face images
(48 face identities × 2). The two versions were created via two mask shapes, as illustrated by
the examples in Figure 1. The ‘outline’ mask, which existed in the original face database,
occluded the external features beyond the facial outline of the face. The ‘oval’ mask, in contrast,
was a predefined oval window that occluded a greater area of external features, including the
jawline and the hairline. The ratio of oval width to oval height was 1:1.3. It was adjusted to fit
for the size of the face.
Design and procedure. There were two independent variables. The first was Mask Shape
(facial outline vs. oval), and the second was Level of Attractiveness (attractive vs. unattractive).
The dependent variable was the attractiveness rating scores on a 7-point scale.
Participants were tested individually. Instructions were given on a computer screen. The
face stimuli were displayed one at a time in the centre of the screen. A 1-7 scale was shown at
the bottom of the screen. Participants were instructed to rate the attractiveness of the face
THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 9
presented using the scale, where 1 represented very unattractive and 7 represented very
attractive. Participants used a computer mouse to click on the chosen point in the scale. The
two masking conditions of each face identity were shown in separate blocks, which were
separated by a one-minute break. Each face was randomly assigned to the first or the second
block, such that the two conditions were intermixed in each block. The 48 face identities were
randomised for each participant in the first block of trials. Thus, the attractive and unattractive
faces were intermixed in each block. The face identities in the second block followed the same
order of presentation as those in the first block such that the two versions of a face identity
were maximally separated from each other in the experiment. This was done to minimise the
potential influence of prior memory of the rating given to one version of a face and to encourage
a response based on perceived attractiveness of the specific version rather than the memory of
a previously given response.
Results
There was a significant main effect of Mask Shape, F (1, 41) = 56.68, p < .001, <U+03B7>2p = .580,
where the oval shape resulted in a higher attractiveness rating than the outline shape. There
was also a main effect of Attractiveness, F (1, 41) = 770.11, p < .001, <U+03B7>2p = .949, where
attractive faces were rated more attractive than unattractive ones. These main effects were
qualified by a significant interaction, F (1, 41) = 6.24, p = .017, <U+03B7>2p = .132. The interaction
effect can be seen in Figure 2, which shows a greater difference between the results obtained
for oval and outline shapes for attractive faces. To confirm this, we calculated the difference
between ratings of oval and outline conditions for each participant, and then compared the two
attractiveness conditions in a paired t-test. This showed that the attractive faces received a
greater benefit from the oval mask than unattractive faces, t(41) = 2.50, p = .017, Cohen’s d =
0.78.
To assess whether masking affected all faces in a similar way or differently for different
face identities, we performed an item-based rank correlation (Spearman's rho) analysis. This
produced fairly high correlations between the oval and outline mask conditions, rho = 0.612
and 0.814 (p’s <= .001) for attractive and unattractive faces, respectively, indicating that
masking affects all faces in a similar way.
Discussion
THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 10
There were two notable findings in this experiment. First, the oval shape created a higher
attractiveness rating for both attractive and unattractive faces. Second, this effect was stronger
for attractive than for unattractive faces.
Although the advantage of the oval mask over the outline mask was expected, the finding
that the effect was stronger for the more attractive faces was surprising. The interaction effect
means that the gap between attractive and unattractive faces was greater when more external
features of these faces were masked. Because the oval mask removed any difference between
the facial outlines of attractive and unattractive faces, the perceived gap of attractiveness
between these faces must have been mainly due to the differences in the internal face region.
However, it should be noted that the exclusion of the outline could hide the facial adiposity or
masculinity in these female faces, which would make them appear more attractive. The result
also means that when more external features were present in the outline condition, these
internal differences were less evident to the observers, whose attention might also be directed
to the overall shape of a face.
It is possible that facial attractiveness judgements rely on different spatial scales for
external and internal features. Discrimination of attractiveness among the facial outline may
use more low spatial frequency information, whereas discrimination among the oval version
may rely relatively more on high spatial frequency information. It is known that low-frequency
information is processed more quickly, which may contribute to the attractiveness judgement
after short exposure to the face (Bar, 2003; Bar et al., 2006). There is also evidence that low-
frequency information is important for the early stage of face processing, whereas high spatial
frequency information is processed at a later stage of visual cognition (Gao, & Bentin, 2011;
Goffaux, Peters, Haubrechts, Schiltz, Jansma, & Goebel, 2011). The results in this experiment
were likely to reflect a more advanced stage of processing because participants were given
unlimited viewing time. However, past research has demonstrated that attractiveness appraisal
can be made when images were exposed for one-tenth of a second or even less than 20 ms
(Olson, & Marshuetz, 2005; Willis & Todorov, 2006; Saegusa & Watanabe, 2016). Moreover,
unlike the eyes, which contribute to attractiveness judgements at a wide range of exposure
duration, certain internal features such as nose and mouth can contribute more to facial
attractiveness with an increasing level of exposure time (Saegusa & Watanabe, 2016). When
THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 11
exposure time is increased, all faces tend to be perceived as less attractive (Saegusa &
Watanabe, 2016; Willis & Todorov, 2006). This could be due to finer discrimination of
imperfection detected at a late processing stage. However, it is not yet known whether this
effect is associated with processing of fine spatial details of internal features. It is also unknown
whether external features play a different role under a brief exposure. We thus investigated
these questions in the next experiment.
Experiment 2
The purpose of this experiment was both to replicate the main findings of Experiment 1
and test the hypothesis that external facial features (the outline face shape) play a more
important role in determining the attractiveness of a face in a brief exposure. Internal features
in a brief exposure condition should play a relatively minor role in judging attractiveness
because these features are mainly carried by high spatial frequencies, which require a longer
exposure time to process. We therefore expected a reduced difference between ratings of
attractive and unattractive faces for the oval mask condition, where a judgement could only be
based on internal features. In contrast, because external features are mainly carried by low
spatial frequencies and processing of this information can occur quickly, we expected a
relatively larger difference between attractive and unattractive faces for the outline version of
the faces, where discrimination of attractiveness can rely more on external features.
Method
Participants. A total of 45 university students (Mdn age 21 years, range 18-42 years, 32
females) participated in this experiment. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
Materials. The face stimuli were identical to those used in Experiment 1.
Design and procedure. These were also identical to Experiment 1, except that exposure
time was added as a new independent variable. Each face image was rated in two exposure
conditions, once after a 20-ms presentation and once without a time limit, as in Experiment 1.
The two conditions were tested in separate blocks. The order of the two blocks was
counterbalanced across the participants.
Results
ANOVA showed significant main effects of Exposure Time, where the same faces
THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 12
presented in a brief exposure were rated more attractive than in a long exposure, F(1,41) =
101.43, p < .001, <U+03B7>2p = .712, Mask Shape, where faces with the oval mask were rated more
attractive relative to the outline mask, F(1,41) = 118.58, p < .001, <U+03B7>2p = .743, and Attractiveness,
F(1,41) = 906.15, p < .001, <U+03B7>2p = .957. These effects were qualified by a two-way interaction
between Exposure Time and Mask Shape, F(1, 41) = 12.37, p = .001, <U+03B7>2p = .232, and a three-
way interaction, F(1,41) = 11.72, p = .001, <U+03B7>2p = .222.
To identify the source of the three-way interaction, we conducted simple effects analyses
separately for the two exposure conditions. For the longbrief exposure condition, there was a
significant main effect of Mask Shape, F(1, 42) = 40.2241) = 101.80, p < .001, <U+03B7>2p = .489713,
where the oval mask shape created higher ratings. There was also a main effect of
Attractiveness, F(1, 42) = 848.6041) = 708.16, p < .001, <U+03B7>2p = .953945, where faces that were
pre-rated as being attractive were rated as more attractive. Furthermore, there was a Mask
Shape × Attractiveness interaction, F(1, 42) = 6.69, p = .013, <U+03B7>2p = .137. This interaction is
illustrated in Figure 3A. We calculated the difference between ratings of the two Masking
conditions and performed a paired t-test. This showed that the attractive faces received greater
benefit from the oval shape than unattractive faces, t(42) = 2.57, p = .014. The results replicated
the findings in Experiment 1.
Simple effects analyses for the brief exposure condition also showed similar main effects
of Mask Shape, F(1, 41) = 101.80, p < .001, <U+03B7>2p = .713, and Attractiveness, F(1, 41) = 708.16,
p < .001, <U+03B7>2p = .945. There was also a significant Mask Shape × Attractiveness interaction, F(1,
41) = 4.32, p = .044, <U+03B7>2p = .095. However, the interaction was due to a different pattern of
results from Experiment 1, which is illustrated in Figure 3B3A. To compare the size of the
effects for attractive and unattractive faces, we again analysed the two-way interaction by
computing the effect of Masking Shape followed a paired t-test. This showed that the attractive
faces received less benefit from the oval shape than unattractive faces, t(41) = -2.08, p = .044.,
Cohen’s d = 0.65. This result was the reverse of the effect of the long exposure condition and
THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 13
the effect of Experiment 1. It showed that in a brief 20-ms exposure, masking by an oval
window was more beneficial for unattractive faces.
Simple effects analyses for the long exposure condition also showed similar main effects
of Mask Shape, F(1, 42) = 40.22, p < .001, <U+03B7>2p = .489, and Attractiveness, F(1, 42) = 848.60, p
< .001, <U+03B7>2p = .953. There was also a Mask Shape × Attractiveness interaction, F(1, 42) = 6.69,
p = .013, <U+03B7>2p = .137. This interaction is illustrated in Figure 3B. To compare the size of the
effects for attractive and unattractive faces, we again analysed the two-way interaction by
computing the effect of Masking Shape followed by a paired t-test. This showed that the
attractive faces received greater benefit from the oval shape than unattractive faces, t(42) =
2.57, p = .014, Cohen’s d = 0.80. The results replicated the findings in Experiment 1. However,
we should note that although the overall pattern of results was consistent with Experiment 1,
the overall mean ratings in the long exposure condition were noticeably lower in this
experiment.
We also conducted simple effects analyses by separating the two mask conditions. For the
outline mask condition, there were significant main effects of Exposure Time and
Attractiveness, as revealed in the earlier analyses. The interaction between these factors was
not significant. For the oval mask condition, however, apart from the same main effects, there
was a significant interaction between these factors, F(1, 41) = 6.89, p = .012, <U+03B7>2p = .144.
Although a longer exposure reduced the attractiveness of both attractive and unattractive faces,
the degree of reduction was greater for unattractive faces than for attractive faces, t(41) = -2.63,
p = .012., Cohen’s d = 0.82.
Finally, to assess how different levels of attractiveness were affected by these variables,
we also conducted separate simple effects analyses for each attractiveness level. For the
attractive faces, both main effects of Exposure Time and Mask Shape were as significant as the
previous analyses. No interaction was found between the variables. For unattractive faces,
however, apart from the same main effects, there was also a significant interaction, F(1, 41) =
39.77, p < .001, <U+03B7>2p = .492. This was due to a larger difference between the oval and outline
mask conditions in the brief exposure relative to the long exposure, t(41) = -6.31, p < .001,
Cohen’s d = 1.97.
As in Experiment 1, we also conducted an item-based rank correlation analysis to assess
THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 14
whether masking affected all faces in a similar way. The results showed significant correlations
between oval and outline masks, rho = 0.722 and 0.797 (p’s < .01), respectively, for attractive
and unattractive faces in the long exposure conditions. In brief exposure conditions, the
correlations were 0.646 and 0.721 (p’s < .01), respectively, for attractive and unattractive faces.
Since the overall mean ratings in the long exposure condition appeared to be lower than
the comparable exposure condition in Experiment 1, we also calculated the rank correlations
of the faces across the conditions between the two experiments. The Spearman rho is 0.91 for
oval mask, and 0.96 for outline mask. The inter-rater reliability (Intraclass Correlation
Coefficient) for unattractive faces is 0.983 for the oval mask condition and 0.978 for the outline
mask condition. These analyses suggest that the results across the two conditions were fairly
consistent.
Discussion
Replicating Experiment 1, the oval mask condition again received a higher attractiveness
rating relative to the outline condition in this experiment. Although the effect was found in
both exposure conditions, the results confirm the hypothesis that attractive faces benefit more
from the effect when face stimuli were shown for a longer duration, whereas unattractive
faces receive more benefit from the effect when face stimuli were shown for a brief duration.
The experiment also replicated a previous finding that a longer exposure time decreases the
overall attractiveness rating (Saegusa & Watanabe, 2016; Willis & Todorov, 2006).
Attractiveness judgements may depend on collecting evidence from both low and high spatial
frequencies. Judgements in a brief exposure are likely to rely more on low spatial frequency
information. such as the facial outline. A longer exposure could reveal more detailed features
and imperfections supported by high-frequency information. This could explain the decrease
of initially perceived attractiveness.
This experiment further extended prior findings by showing that the effect of exposure
time may have different strengths depending on the level of attractiveness and the way the
face stimuli are presented. In the oval mask condition, the effect of longer exposure was
greater for unattractive faces than for attractive ones. This effect suggests that a full
identification of unattractive features may rely more on accessing the high spatial frequency
information. The results also showed that the strength of the oval mask advantage in the two
THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 15
exposure conditions was the same for the attractive faces and that the strength of this
advantage for the unattractive faces was greater in the brief exposure relative to the long
exposure.
Although the masking shape effects in the first two experiments could be due to greater
reduction of external features in the masked faces, there is also an alternative explanation.
Using an oval shape not only concealed more external features but also introduced a highly
regular and symmetrical shape. Hence the effect found in Experiments 1 and 2 could be due
to the advantage of a more regular and symmetrical shape. To determine whether the oval
shape alone could explain the effect, we conducted Experiment 3.
Experiment 3
The determine whether the oval mask effect in Experiments 1 and 2 was due to the
reduced contribution from the external features or a more regular and symmetrical shape, we
attempted to replicate Experiment 1 but added a third masking condition. In the new condition,
roughly the same area was masked, as in the oval mask condition, but with an irregular shape
that was an identical irregular shape, as in the facial outline condition. In other words, we
reduced the aperture size of the mask. If the regular and symmetrical feature alone could
explain the oval mask effect, there should be no difference in the ratings of the two outline
conditions. If there were a clear advantage in the reduced outline condition but the difference
between this condition and the oval mask condition were minimal, it would suggest that the
oval mask effect was mainly due to a reduction of external features.
Method
Participants. Forty-five university students (Mdn age 21 years, range 18-42 years, 31
females) participated in the experiment.
Materials. These were identical to Experiments 1 and 2, except a new mask version was
added for each face identity. The shape of the new mask was identical to the facial outline mask,
except the aperture size was reduced by 15% to obscure approximately the same external face
area as the oval-shaped mask. In contrast to the oval mask, however, it had an irregular shape.
Figure 4 illustrates the new version among the old versions of an example face.
Design and procedure. This was a within-participant design. The two factors were Mask
Shape (outline, reduced outline, and oval) and Attractiveness (attractive vs. unattractive).
THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 16
The procedure was essentially the same as in Experiment 1, except a block of 48 trials was
added to accommodate the additional, reduced outline condition. As in Experiment 1, each trial
within one block showed a unique face, and a different version of a face was presented in a
different block. The randomisation procedure was also the same as in Experiment 1, hence all
conditions were mixed in each block. The 48 face identities with 3 masking conditions
amounted to a total of 144 trials. All other aspects of the procedure and task were identical to
those in Experiment 1.
Results
The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 5. ANOVA showed significant main
effects of Mask Shape, F(2, 88) = 40.79, p < .001, <U+03B7>2p = .481, and Attractiveness, F(1, 44) =
566.06, p < .001, <U+03B7>2p = .928. These effects were also qualified by a significant interaction, F(2,
88) = 5.09, p = .008, <U+03B7>2p = .104. Simple effects analyses showed a significant main effect of
Masking Shape for Attractive Faces, F(2, 88) = 24.18, p < .001, <U+03B7>2p = .355. Pairwise
comparisons with Bonferroni correction showed that the oval mask condition produced a
higher attractiveness rating than the reduced outline mask, p = .038, Cohen’s d = 0.79, which
in turn produced a higher rating than the outline mask condition, p < .001., Cohen’s d = 1.25.
The main effect of Mask Shape was also significant for unattractive faces, F(2, 88) = 19.26, p
< .001, <U+03B7>2p = .304. Pairwise comparisons showed that both oval and irregular mask conditions
produced a higher attractiveness rating than did the outline condition, pp’s < .001, Cohen’s d =
1.73 and 1.41. The rating scores for the oval and irregular mask conditions were comparable,
p = 1.00.
As previous experiments, we performed item-based rank correlation analyses to assess
whether masking affected all faces in a similar way. The results showed high correlations
between masking conditions. For the attractive faces, the correlations ranged from 0.651 to
0.913, p’s <= .001. For the unattractive faces, the correlations ranged from 0.753 to 0.804, p’s
< .001.
Discussion
The results of this experiment show that the reduced outline condition had a clear
advantage over the outline condition for both attractive and unattractive faces. The oval shape
THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 17
condition was also rated higher than the reduced outline condition for attractive faces. There
was no difference in the perceived attractiveness of these two conditions for unattractive faces.
The results suggest that the relative advantage of the oval mask found in Experiments 1 and 2
was mainly explained by a greater occlusion of the external region of the face. The regular and
symmetrical outline of the oval shape may have played a role but may not be a major
contributing factor because there was no difference between the reduced outline and the oval
conditions for unattractive faces. These results were consistent with some prior research, which
showed that an explicit feature-based measurement of facial symmetry was not correlated with
human judgements of facial attractiveness (Bronstadô, Langlois, & Russell, 2008; Langlois,
Roggman, & Musselman, 1994).
There was a fundamental difference between the three masked versions of faces. In the
outline condition, the outline was the actual shape of the face, but in the other two conditions,
the outline was more likely to be seen as the occluding edge of the mask rather than a part of
the face. However, is it possible that due to the lack of context in these images, the contour that
belongs to the mask was interpreted as belonging to the face? For the outline version, it was a
correct interpretation because the mask shape overlapped with the face shape. However, in the
other two conditions, could the shape of the mask be mistakenly interpreted as the face shape?
If the faces were shown in a less ambiguous context, such that the mask shape could be more
readily interpreted as the edge of an occluding object, would the results in this experiment be
different? We examined this possibility in the next experiment.
Experiment 4
If the effect of the mask in the previous experiments was due to a misinterpretation of
outline ownership, can the effect be eradicated when the ambiguity is removed with a
context? We tested this alternative explanation in this experiment. The design and task were
exactly the same as in Experiment 3. The only difference was that we added a headscarf to
each face image.
The effect of a headscarf on perception of facial attractiveness has been studied before.
Mahmud and Swami (2010) compared the attractiveness rating of faces with or without a
hijab. They found that women wearing a hijab were rated less attractive than women without
a hijab. The purpose of our study, however, was quite different from theirs. Our aim was not
THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 18
to determine whether wearing a headscarf could make a face more or less attractive than
without the headscarf. All faces in this experiment wore a headscarf. Rather, our aim was to
measure how different levels of masking by the headscarf affect perceived facial
attractiveness.
Method
Participants. Thirty university students (mean age 20.6 years, SD = 2.9 years, range 20-
29 years, 27 females) participated. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
Materials. These were identical to Experiment 3, except a headscarf was digitally added
to all face images with Photoshop using the Puppet Warp tool. We used the same headscarf in
all face stimuli to avoid introducing extraneous variables. An illustration of this is given in
Figure 4 (second row).
Design and procedure. These were identical to Experiment 3.
Results
Results are shown in Figure 6. Similar to Experiment 3, there were significant main effects
of Mask Shape, F(2, 58) = 42.35, p < .001, <U+03B7>2p = .594, and Attractiveness, F(1, 29) = 277.22, p
< .001, <U+03B7>2p = .905. Moreover, these main effects were qualified by a significant interaction, F(2,
58) = 6.40, p = .007, <U+03B7>2p = .181. Simple effects analyses showed a significant main effect of
attractive faces, F(2, 58) = 28.12, p < .001, <U+03B7>2p = .492. Paired comparisons with Bonferroni
correction showed higher attractiveness ratings for oval and reduced outline masks relative to
outline mask, p’s < .001, Cohen’s d = 2.10 and 2.19, while the ratings for oval and reduced
outline mask were the same (p = 1.00). The simple main effect of Mask Shape for unattractive
faces was also significant, F(2, 58) = 19.40, p < .001, <U+03B7>2p = .401. Here, both oval and reduced
outline mask conditions were rated as more attractive than the outline mask condition, p’s
< .001 and = .002, Cohen’s d = 2.33 and 1.45, respectively. The ratings for the oval and reduced
outline conditions were comparable, p = .145.
We again conducted Item-based rank correlation analysis to assess whether masking
affected all faces in a similar way. For the attractive faces, the correlation between masking
conditions ranged from 0.714 to 0.892, p’s < .001. For the unattractive faces, the correlation
ranged from 0.778 to 0.827, p’s < .001.
Discussion
THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 19
The pattern of results in the two experiments was consistent with Experiment 3. The only
difference was that the oval mask advantage over the reduced outline mask condition for
attractive faces failed to replicate in this experiment. This may mean that the small difference
found between the conditions in Experiment 3 was not as robust as the other key findings.
The overall pattern of the results in this experiment further confirms that the advantage of
masking a greater area of external features relative to the more revealing outline mask was
not due to a symmetrical or regular attribute of the oval mask or the lack of face context. A
more plausible explanation is that mask shape was treated as a part of the face in holistic
processing.
The advantage of concealing a larger area of external features in the four experiments so
far was demonstrated relative to the outline mask condition, where the jawline and hairline
were fully visible. However, since the outline mask condition in the previous experiments did
not include complete external features or context, it is difficult to ascertain whether the
disadvantage of the outline mask relative to the other two mask conditions also extends to a
no mask condition, in which full external features are shown. Since appraisal of facial
attractiveness is likely to be the result of holistic processing of the entire face, where external
features interact with internal features, it is possible that evaluating a face through an outline
mask is different from evaluating it without a mask. To find the answer, we included
unmasked whole faces in the next experiment.
Experiment 5
Without comparing the rating of the masked faces to the original unmasked version, it
would not be clear whether the outline mask version made a face less attractive or the oval
version made the face more attractive relative to the unmasked version. This experiment
aimed to address this question by including the original unmasked version of each face. To
our knowledge, no research has compared the attractiveness ratings of faces masked by both
versions of external masks with the unmasked whole faces. A prior study by Santos and
Young (2011) did compare attractiveness judgements of faces masked by a circular window
with the unmasked whole-face condition. They found that judgements of attractiveness for
the whole-face condition were in higher agreement with the past judgements of the unmasked
faces by different participants. Because they did not report which condition received the
THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 20
higher attractiveness rating, it is unclear whether the faces with a circular window mask were
judged differently from those unmasked whole faces. We hoped to find an answer to this and
the relative effect of the outline mask condition in the present experiment.
Method
Participants. Thirty-seven university students (Mdn age 19 years, range 18-22 years, 33
females) participated in the experiment. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
Materials. These were identical to Experiment 3, except the face images for the reduced
outline condition were replaced with images with full external features. Figure 7 shows an
example face in the three conditions.
Design and procedure. Apart from replacing the reduced outline mask condition with
the unmasked whole face condition, these were identical to Experiment 3.
Results
Results are shown in Figure 8. There were significant main effects of Mask Shape, F(2,
72) = 8.48, p = .001, <U+03B7>2p = .191, and Attractiveness, F(1, 36) = 436.43, p < .001, <U+03B7>2p = .924. The
interaction between the two variables was also significant, F(2, 72) = 5.24, p = .008, <U+03B7>2p = .127.
Simple effects analyses showed a significant effect of Mask Shape for attractive faces, F(2, 72)
= 8.93, p = .001, <U+03B7>2p = .199, where ratings for the oval mask condition were higher than for the
outline mask condition, p = .004, Cohen’s d = 1.16, and ratings for the no mask, whole face
condition was also higher than the outline mask condition, p = .008, Cohen’s d = 1.08. There
was no difference between the ratings for the oval and whole face conditions. There was also
a significant effect of Mask Shape for unattractive faces, F(2, 72) = 4.95, p = .011, <U+03B7>2p = .121,
where the rating for the oval mask condition was higher than that for the outline mask condition,
p = .008., Cohen’s d = 1.08. The ratings for the whole face and outline mask conditions were
comparable, p = .099. The ratings for the whole face and oval mask conditions were also
comparable, p = 1.000.
As in the previous experiments, we conducted item-based rank correlation analyses to
assess whether masking affected all faces in a similar way. The results showed fairly high
correlations between mask conditions. The correlation ranged from 0.721 to 0.769 for attractive
faces, and 0.668 to 0.749 for unattractive faces, p’s <= .001.
The rating of whole faces are comparable to the original rating from the database, for
THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 21
attractive faces, M = 4.25 vs. 4.31, t(19) = 0.49, p = .631; for unattractive faces, M = 2.22 vs.
2.09, t(19) = 1.71, p = .104.
Apart from the item-based correlation analyses, we also compared the same masking
conditions across experiments to evaluate inter-rater reliability of attractiveness. This was done
for the outline and oval masks because they were used across all five experiments in this study.
The Intra-class Correlation Coefficient was 0.989 for oval shape mask, and 0.989 for outline
mask condition.
Discussion
The results in this experiment confirmed the previous finding that the oval mask condition
created a higher attractiveness rating than the outline mask condition. This effect was again
stronger for attractive faces than for unattractive faces. The novel finding in this experiment
was that the oval mask condition had no advantage over the unmasked whole face condition.
This finding suggests that the oval mask advantage in the previous experiments was likely due
to a reduced attractiveness suffered by the outline mask condition.
General Discussion
We compared how two popular methods for masking varying amounts of external face
features influence perceived facial attractiveness. All five experiments showed that masking a
larger area of external features with an oval window resulted in a more attractive-looking face
relative to masking external features, according to the shape of facial outline. Although the
effect was found for both attractive and unattractive faces, the size of the effect was consistently
stronger for attractive than for unattractive faces in these experiments, with the exception of a
brief exposure condition (Experiment 2) when faces were shown for 20 ms rather than for an
unlimited viewing time. After verifying these basic findings in Experiments 1 and 2, we
showed in the subsequent experiments that the effects could not be easily explained by the
symmetrical shape of the oval mask (Experiment 3) or the lack of face context (Experiment 4).
Finally, by comparing the same masking conditions used in the first two experiments with a
THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 22
whole-face condition where no masking of external features was used, we were able to establish
that the effect was due to a reduced attractiveness of the outline masking rather than increased
attractiveness of the oval mask condition.
These findings have a number of theoretical implications. The first is related to the
question of face boundary. Logically, when the attractiveness of a face is judged, the judgement
should be about the face within its boundary, rather than being influenced by the shape of an
adjacent object. However, our results appear to reject this. Indeed, the most striking aspect of
our findings is that although the shape of the occluding object is not a shape of the face, it
clearly affected the judgements of facial attractiveness. Participants were unlikely to treat the
oval shape as the boundary of a face. This should more clearly be the case in Experiment 4,
where the oval-shaped outline was likely to be seen as belonging to the headscarf. However,
participants still perceived faces with the oval mask as being more attractive. This effect is
equivalent to peeping at a face through keyholes of two different sizes, where one reveals only
a small area of internal features and conceals more external features, and the other reveals
greater external features and conceals only the part beyond the facial outline. Should the
judgements of facial attractiveness be affected by the size of keyholes? Our results showed that
they are.
This leads to another implication of our findings: Perception of facial attractiveness could
be a result of interaction between the internal region of the face and the shape of peripheral
occluding objects. This means that the boundary of face processing does not stop at the face
boundary. In other words, the edge of the occluding object could be a part of the holistic face
processing even though it is not a part of the face. Past research has shown that makeup can

alter a face’s perceived attractiveness. However, this is usually achieved by modifying the
appearance of certain facial features, such as eye-region contrast or apparent eye size (e.g.,
Russell, Porcheron, Sweda, Jones, Mauger, & Morizot, 2017; Morikawa et al., 2015). Our
findings are quite different because we showed that the boundary of an occluding object that
made no changes to a face could also influence perceived facial attractiveness. Future studies
will need to delineate the boundary, the extent of vicinity, and the conditions for the inclusion.
Identical internal features were used in our experiments, but changing the shape of the
occluding edge with a mask consistently modulated perceived attractiveness. This
demonstrates that internal features are influenced by the presence of external features.
Occluding a larger area of external features appears to make the eyes and other internal features
look larger relative to the occluding shape that followed a facial outline. This could account for
the enhanced attractiveness, as neonate features such as large eyes and thick lips tend to make
a face look more attractive (Cunningham, 1986; Geldart et al., 1999; Baudouin & Tiberghien,
2004). Hence, the effect in our study could be the apparent size of the internal features when
larger external features are masked. Curiously, however, the apparent size difference seems to
vanish when faces with the oval mask are compared with their unmasked versions. This could
explain why the effect disappears when the two conditions were compared in Experiment 5.
Masking external features by the facial outline appears to make the face larger and wider
compared to the unmasked whole-face version. If these casual observations were true, then the
apparent size of internal features relative to the area bound by the facial outline could account
for the effects observed in this study. The reduced attractiveness after scalp hair and other
external features was masked by the facial outline relative to other conditions could be due to
THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 24
the apparent reduction in size of the internal features. These observations will require empirical
evidence in future studies. Although the mechanisms behind this remain unknown, the absence
of the features beyond the facial outline is most likely associated with reduced attractiveness.
The missing features are clearly crucial for holistic face processing to produce a more
favourable impression of a face size relative to the size of internal features.
Another consistent finding in our experiments was that attractive faces benefited more
from extra masking when participants were given unlimited time to rate face stimuli.
Unattractive faces may benefit more from the masking effect when face stimuli were briefly
shown for 20 ms (Experiment 2). Internal features were likely to play a greater role in the effect
in the longer exposure condition, whereas external features were likely to play a greater role in
the brief exposure condition. In a brief exposure, the difference between attractive and
unattractive faces could be more salient in the outline mask condition. This is because a
judgement in this condition must rely more on the overall face shape, which is supported by
coarse spatial information. A judgement cannot rely on this information when it is made
unavailable in the oval mask condition. With a longer exposure, however, participants should
be able to appraise attractiveness in this condition.
Our results demonstrate that methods used to mask or remove external features could alter
perceived facial attractiveness in different ways. Because a face masked by its outline shape
could reduce attractiveness relative to its unmasked version, and because this effect could be
different for attractive and unattractive faces, it is necessary to exercise caution when
attractiveness measured from stimuli with an outline mask is used to represent the
attractiveness of the unmasked version. Although no difference was found between perceived
THE BOUNDARY OF HOLISTIC PROCESSING 25
attractiveness of the oval mask and the unmasked version, it is important not to assume that the
same mechanisms underpin the two conditions, as the outcome involved the holistic processing
of different face regions.
Occlusion or masking in reality may have a similar effect as shown in our laboratory
conditions. However, this will require further research. Although we used digitally manipulated
headscarves to mimic different extents of occlusion, the technique may have inadvertently
introduced elements that do not fully match the impression of headscarf shapes in reality.
Furthermore, faces in reality could be partially occluded by many different objects and shapes.
Our study supports the idea that facial beauty can be influenced by both intrinsic factors such
as the shape of the features determined by biological and extraneous factors, such as hairstyle
and occlusion. This suggests the possibility that even the way in which a headscarf is used to
obscure different areas can significantly alter the impression of facial attractiveness.
Perhaps the most important message in this study is that holistic processing of facial
attractiveness may extent to the shape of the occluding and adjacent object. Exactly how these
elements interact with a face in a computational process remains an unresolved mystery.

Appendix C
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
1\ It is consensus in the literature that, concerning facial features, a distinction is
made between external (e.g., hair, ears, facial outline) and internal (e.g., eyes, nose,
mouth) features (see Nachson and Shechory, Acta Psy, 2002; Ellis, Shepherd, &
Davies, 1979, see Fig. 1 there, which makes the distiction quite clear). Please these
use terms accordingly, and consistently within the ms, to avoid confusion.
As a result of imprecise use of terms, the abstract contains contradicting
statements. In 2nd sentence one reads “This study investigated how this exclusion
of the external features affects the perception of attractiveness“ … and later on:
“Further manipulation confirmed that the effect was mainly due to the occlusion of
a larger area of the external features rather than the regular and symmetrical
features of the oval shape“. How could this be if authors have already excluded
external features? Apparently, authors mean „occlusion of a larger area of the
inner face parts“ here.
We thank the reviewer for further comments on the issue of definition. We fully
agree with the definition in the literature, but as we attempted to explain
previously, even though specific features such as the eyes and hair are
unequivocally external or internal, the boundary between the internal and
external regions on the facial surface is rather fuzzy. If we were to segment a
photograph, where would be the border between the two regions? There is no
definition of this in the literature. The reviewer prefers that we say “occlusion of
larger area of the inner face parts” rather than “occlusion of a larger area of the
external features”. However, if we stick to the definition in the literature, the
suggested wording would create an apparent contradiction, because internal
features refer to the eyes, nose and mouth, yet our manipulation did not occlude
any of these, let alone “larger area” of these parts. We would also like to point out
that studies often use an oval mask to exclude external features rather than
“occlusion of a larger area of the inner face parts”. In the literature, both types of
masks are used to exclude external features. We think our wording is consistent
with this and we do not think there is a contradiction. If we have missed
anything, however, we would love to hear more advice from the reviewer.
2\ Abstract. The abstract mentions different results for different timings, but gives
no explanation for this. Thus is confusing – authors should better avoid to report
results in the abstract which are unexplained. Further, the authors state that the
oval mask advantage was merely due to reduced inner face area rather than to its
specific regular form, and that no advantage to an unmasked face was found. The
statement that there might be “interaction between the shape of a mask and the
internal features of the face“ is rather unspecific. Authors should end the abstract
with a sentence that tells the reader what the crucial and novel finding of this study
is and what it tells us about face attractiveness perception. The abstract, as it
stands now, has no clear take-home message.
We appreciate the reviewer’s new comments on the abstract. We agree it would
be easier for the reader if we provide an explanation after summarising the
result for each experiment. We worry that if we do this for all experiments, we
would have a long abstract. Given the word limit, we hope to summarise the key
findings in each experiment and focus on a take-home message at the end. We
think the effect of exposure duration in Experiment 2 is quite interesting as well,
but consider the finding relatively less important. So we decide to provide the
possible reasons for this effect in the main text. Our take-home message is that
the evaluation of facial attractiveness may incorporate non-face information (the
shape of occluding masks), which is treated as an element in holistic face
processing. If we have not clearly stated our take-home message, we would very
much appreciate the reviewer’s advice on how to improve it.
3\ Discussion of Exp. 4 and General Discussion. Exp. 4, p19 1st par: Authors
interpret the findings that “mask shape was treated as a part oft the face in holistic
processing“. However, in General Discussion, p. 22, they state „Participants were
unlikely to treat the oval shape as the boundary of a face. This should more clearly
be the case in Experiment 4, where the oval-shaped outline was likely to be seen as
belonging to the headscarf.“ I think the latter interpretation is correct, so the
sentence on p. 19 should be changed.
The reviewer makes a good observation here. We agree that the two statements
can be confusing. In the first statement, we refer to how the mask was treated in
holistic processing. We should note that the process of holistic processing is not
accessible to conscious inspection. In the second statement, we refer to how
participants would consciously judge the contour ownership if they were asked
of this question. We think they would not consciously judge the oval shape as the
boundary of a face. However, when they judge attractiveness, their answer was
clearly affected by this. Logically they should not be affected by the mask shape if
it had nothing to do with the shape of a face. But our results showed that the
mask shape clearly affected their judgements of facial attractiveness. Hence we
conclude the shape of the mask was treated as a part of the face, although this
might have occurred without conscious awareness. This is similar to the
difference between knowing and perception of visual illusions. For example, we
know there is no difference of line length in Muller-Lyer or Ponzo illusions, yet
we still can’t help perceiving the illusion. Following the reviewer’s comment, we
have tried to explain the difference between knowing and perception in our
paper more clearly. We hope the revised version has resolved the apparent
contradiction.
4\ General Discussion. I do not get the logic behind “In other words, the edge of the
occluding object could be a part of the holistic face processing even though it is not
a part of the face.“ Can the authors give any plausible reasons why the headscarf
should be included in holistic face processing? I think it is not necessary to posulate
this. It would be enough to show that external object surround can modulate
holistic processing of inner face parts. I think there are many studies in the
literature showing this, at least for for face identity perception.
The reviewer is right. The external object shape clearly modulated holistic
processing of faces. We think this question is related to the reviewer’s first
comment. If we postulate that only “inner face parts” is included in holistic
processing, where is the boundary of these inner parts? We think holistic
processing uses the entire face, rather than several isolated internal features
such as the eyes, nose and mouth. The entire face includes the facial surface
beyond those internal features. Where is the boundary of this? The boundary
should be occluding edge of the face. But in our stimuli, the face boundary was
occluded by a mask or headscarf. The reason we think the headscarf is included
in holistic face processing is that the shape of the scarf affected perceived facial
attractiveness. The reviewer favours the statement “external object surround
can modulate holistic processing of inner face parts”. We think this statement is
correct, but it is a description of the phenomenon rather than explanation. If the
statement is developed as an explanation, then it seems to require an extra step.
Namely, in the initial step facial attractiveness is assessed without the including
the headscarf, and then in the next step headscarf processing modulates/alters
the result of the initial step. We think this theory is more difficult to justify than
our simpler explanation, which considers the shape of headscarf as a part of
holistic processing.
5\ General Discussion. As I said for the abstract, a clear conlusion or take-home
message is lacking. Please try a good sumup that doesn‘t lack punsh. Please don’t
leave the reader with “unresolved mysteries“ (last sentence of GD).
The discussion attempts to convey the following take-home message. Holistic
processing and the role of external features of the face are two important issues
in the study of face perception. Our study advances the understanding of these
by comparing the effects of two popular masks that are commonly used to
remove the influence of external features of the face. We found that the two
masks consistently affected judgements of facial attractiveness differently. This
effect is striking because the shape of the mask is not a part of the face but is the
edge of an occluding object. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration
that holistic face processing may incorporate the occluding edge of non-face
objects. This has important implications for the current theory of holistic
processing, which has mainly focused on the effects of interaction among various
facial features and regions within the face boundary. Moreover, our study
demonstrates the limitation of the current methods that are used to control for
the contributing of external features, because our results showed that the ways
by which the external features of a face are masked could themselves affect the
judgements of its attractiveness relative to the unmasked version. At the end of
the article we point out a future research question, which is to explain how
holistic processing select input as a part of faces. We do think it is important to
flag outstanding questions (“mysteries”) in research. As we said earlier in our
response to the second comment, we would be happy to consider the reviewer’s
suggestions on how improve our take-home message if the reviewer thinks our
descriptions are not clear.
