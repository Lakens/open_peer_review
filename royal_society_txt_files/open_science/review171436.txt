This work investigates the use of laser-assisted synthesized Ag-rGO composites for optical
limiting. From experiments, it can be clearly seen that the composites are much better than GO
and rGO for this application. However, the current state and the novelty of this work is not good.
First, the application of Ag-rGO composites have been investigated by other groups. Compared
to their works, there is no advance in either the OL performance enhancement or the OL
mechanism. Second, the work load is too limited. It seems that the authors only did three
experiments and then tend to publish the results. Third, the analysis for OL effect is not sufficient.
Normally, the OL threshold where the 50% of normalized transmittance is obtained should be
given. But in Fig. 6 there is no data about this important data. Fourth, the literature and the
background introduction is also not good. The authors have to show the progress in the
applications of Ag-rGO composites for OL applications and the advantage of Ag-rGO in
comparison with other composites, such as the particle-polymer composites [Applied Surface
Science 392 (2017) 991–1003]. What is the novelty of this manuscript? New technique? Or new
composite? The authors have to point out the innovative point much clearly and their
contribution to the progress of this field.
Many other aspects of this manuscript has to be improved.
In the introduction part: Femtosecond laser ablation in solution (FLAS) method can provide a
green synthesis strategy of metal/graphene nanocomposites. FLAS is widely defined as laser
ablation in liquids (LAL) [Sci. China Phys. Mech. Astron. 2017, 60, 074201; ChemNanoMat 2017,
3, 512-533.] or laser synthesis and processing of colloids (LSPC) [Chem. Rev. 2017, 117,
3990-4103] The authors should not neglect the literature published previously and create a new
word, which seems that the authors are the first one in this field.
Compared with the conventional chemical methods, FLAS is more time-saving, easily operated,
and avoids the usage of harmful chemical reagents. This conclusion is not correct. Chemical
synthesis is much efficient than LAL if aiming at large-scale material synthesis.
The Ag-rGO is synthesized by LAL for 30 mins. Has ablation time been optimized? Long ablation
normally cause either particle fragmentation or melting [Sci. Rep. 2017, 7, 40355.] or induce the
damange of rGO [ACS Sustainable Chem. Eng. 2015, 3, 637-644]. This effect should be discussed
and analyzed, including the size evolution of Ag, the doping ratio of Ag on rGO and the integrity
of rGO. XPS and TEM data should be provided.
Also, the doping ability of Ag NPs on rGO should be investigated (Ag concentration vs rGO
concentration) and the maximal amount of Ag NPs on rGO should be quantified at different
synthesis conditions. In addition, both the effects of Ag NPs and the Ag-rGO composites on OL
should be supplemented and the differences between the results should be deeply analyzed.
In addition, the English writing skill is not good, in need of polishing by professional agency.

In this study, the authors prepared Ag NPs/rGO hybrids using the FLAS method, and measured
their non-linear light scattering efficiencies. The experiments were carried out properly.
However, main points of this study, preparation of metal NPs/rGO hybrids and investigation of
their non-linear optical properties, have been reported elsewhere as referred by the authors.
Novel information about the properties of NPs/rGO hybrids is provided.

In the revised manuscript, the authors have added data showing the effect of laser power,
irritation time, and Ag ion concentration on the properties of the Ag NPs/rGO composites.
However, these data show common features of laser possesses. In addition, no information of
effects of these parameters on the NLS, NLA properties are shown.
I still cannot recommend this manuscript to be published in this journal because of lack of

According to the comments of the reviewers, we have carefully revised our
manuscript RSOS-171436, “Femtosecond laser-assisted synthesis of silver
nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide hybrid for optical limiting”. The revisions
have been underlined for easier identification in the manuscript and are given in detail
in the following pages.
We thank the reviewers and editors for their helpful suggestions. We will appreciate if

Reviewer: 1
This work investigates the use of laser-assisted synthesized Ag-rGO composites for
optical limiting. From experiments, it can be clearly seen that the composites are
much better than GO and rGO for this application. However, the current state and the
novelty of this work is not good.
1. First, the application of Ag-rGO composites have been investigated by other
groups. Compared to their works, there is no advance in either the OL performance
enhancement or the OL mechanism.
Response: Thanks the reviewer for the comments.
Many synthesis strategies based on chemical methods have been explored to
prepare different kinds of graphene hybrids, however, the involvements of
environmentally hazardous chemicals and complex chemical processes greatly restrict
both the versatilities and flexibilities of the hybrid graphene materials. Laser ablation
in liquids (LAL) method can provide a green one-step synthesis strategy of graphene
nanocomposites. Using this method, D. Tan et al. fabricated rGO hybrids decorated
with silver (Ag) NPs with nanometer sizes. Although the NLO response of the hybrids
for femtosecond laser been reported, the controllable synthesis of Ag NPs/rGO
composites and their OL response for more widely used nanosecond laser pulses still
need further investigation.
For this reason, we prepared Ag NPs/rGO composites using LAL method in our
manuscript, and systematically studied the effect of laser power, irritation time, and
Ag ion concentration on the optical property and morphology of the products, as well
as their nonlinear OL behavior and mechanisms using a nanosecond laser.
According to the reviewer’s comments, we have added some experiments
and discussions, especially about the influence of experimental conditions on the
optical, morphology, and OL behaviors of the products. In addition, the
introduction part of the manuscript has been revised carefully to highlight our
research motivation.
2. Second, the work load is too limited. It seems that the authors only did three
experiments and then tend to publish the results.
Response: According to the reviewer’s comments, we have added some experiments
and discussions. The effect of laser power, irritation time, and Ag ion concentration
on the optical property and morphology of the products, as well as their optical
limiting properties are systematically studied. The revisions are given in the section of
“Results and discussion”.
3. Third, the analysis for OL effect is not sufficient. Normally, the OL threshold
where the 50% of normalized transmittance is obtained should be given. But in Fig. 6
there is no data about this important data.
Response: The reviewer’s comment is right. The OL threshold of the Ag-rGO
composites with best performance is estimated to be about 0.38 J/cm2. The following
revision is given at the end of the 1st paragraph in Section 4.2:
“The OL threshold of Ag NPs/rGO with 1 mM Ag ions is estimated to be about 0.38
J/cm2, which is much lower than the graphene dispersions given in some previous
reports [11].”
4. Fourth, the literature and the background introduction is also not good. The
authors have to show the progress in the applications of Ag-rGO composites for OL
applications and the advantage of Ag-rGO in comparison with other composites, such
as the particle-polymer composites [Applied Surface Science 392 (2017) 991–1003].
What is the novelty of this manuscript? New technique? Or new composite? The
authors have to point out the innovative point much clearly and their contribution to
the progress of this field.
Response: The nonlinear optical property of graphene can be enhanced by
functionalization. Some chemical methods have been explored to prepare different
kinds of graphene composites. However, the involvements of environmentally
hazardous chemicals and complex chemical processes greatly restrict both the
versatilities and flexibilities of the hybrid graphene materials. Laser ablation in liquids
(LAL) method can provide a green one-step synthesis strategy of graphene
nanocomposites. Using this method, D. Tan et al. fabricated rGO hybrids decorated
with Ag NPs with nanometer sizes. Although they have reported the OL response of
the hybrids for femtosecond laser, the controllable synthesis of Ag NPs/rGO
composites and their OL response for more widely used nanosecond laser pulses still
need further investigation. In our manuscript, we prepared Ag NPs/rGO composites
using LAL method, and the effects of experimental conditions on the optical property
and morphology of the composites were systematically studied. We studied the OL
behavior and mechanisms of the materials, and found that both nonlinear scattering
and nonlinear absorption effects contributed to the OL process of the composites.
To highlight our research motivation, we have carefully revised our
manuscript and added some references in the Introduction Section. The 3rd
Paragraph of Section 2 has been revised as following:
“Though many synthesis strategies based on chemical methods have been
explored to fabricate different kinds of graphene hybrids, the involvements of
environmentally hazardous chemicals and complex chemical processes largely restrict
both the versatilities and flexibilities of the hybrid graphene materials [18, 23, 24].
Laser ablation in liquids (LAL) method can provide a green one-step synthesis
strategy of graphene nanocomposites [25-29]. Due to its ultra-short pulse duration and
ultra-high peak power [30-33], when femtosecond laser irradiates on graphene oxide
(GO) aqueous solution containing metal ions, plasma plumes are produced and
reactions between these species result in NPs formation, as well as the reduction and
doping of GO. Using this method, D. Tan et al. fabricated rGO hybrids decorated with
silver (Ag) NPs with nanometer sizes [13]. Although the NLO response of the hybrids
for femtosecond laser been reported, the controllable synthesis of Ag NPs/rGO
composites and their OL response for more widely used nanosecond laser pulses still
need further investigation.”
5. Many other aspects of this manuscript has to be improved.
In the introduction part: Femtosecond laser ablation in solution (FLAS) method can
provide a green synthesis strategy of metal/graphene nanocomposites. FLAS is widely
defined as laser ablation in liquids (LAL) [Sci. China Phys. Mech. Astron. 2017, 60,
074201; ChemNanoMat 2017, 3, 512-533.] or laser synthesis and processing of
colloids (LSPC) [Chem. Rev. 2017, 117, 3990-4103] The authors should not neglect
the literature published previously and create a new word, which seems that the
authors are the first one in this field.
Response: According to the reviewer’s comment, we have changed “FLAS” using
“LAL” in our manuscript, and the references mentioned above have been cited.
6. Compared with the conventional chemical methods, FLAS is more time-saving,
easily operated, and avoids the usage of harmful chemical reagents. This conclusion is
not correct. Chemical synthesis is much efficient than LAL if aiming at large-scale
material synthesis.
Response: The reviewer’s comments are right. The 4th sentence in Paragraph 3,
Section 2 has been revised as following:
“Though many synthesis strategies based on chemical methods have been explored to
prepare different kinds of graphene hybrids, the involvements of environmentally
hazardous chemicals and complex chemical processes largely restrict both the
versatilities and flexibilities of the hybrid graphene materials. Laser ablation in liquids
(LAL) method can provide a green one-step synthesis strategy of graphene
nanocomposites.”
7. The Ag-rGO is synthesized by LAL for 30 mins. Has ablation time been
optimized? Long ablation normally cause either particle fragmentation or melting [Sci.
Rep. 2017, 7, 40355.] or induce the damange of rGO [ACS Sustainable Chem. Eng.
2015, 3, 637-644]. This effect should be discussed and analyzed, including the size
evolution of Ag, the doping ratio of Ag on rGO and the integrity of rGO. XPS and
TEM data should be provided. Also, the doping ability of Ag NPs on rGO should be
investigated (Ag concentration vs rGO concentration) and the maximal amount of Ag
NPs on rGO should be quantified at different synthesis conditions. In addition, both
the effects of Ag NPs and the Ag-rGO composites on OL should be supplemented and
the differences between the results should be deeply analyzed.
Response: Thanks the reviewer for the helpful suggestions. The effect of laser power,
irritation time, and Ag ion concentration on the optical property and morphology of
the products, as well as their optical limiting properties are systematically studied and
deeply analyzed in our revised manuscript.
The reaction time and laser power affect the reduction degree of Ag ions. The
reduction degree increases with increasing the laser power or prolonging the reaction
time, but too long time or too high laser power irradiation will cause the
fragmentization of the graphene as commented by the reviewer. The evolution of Ag
NPs is demonstrated using TEM, XPS and Raman spectroscopy (the results are
given in Figure 3 and Figure 4).
Ag ion concentration added into the GO solution influences the Ag NPs doping
ratio. By adjusting the Ag ion concentration, we are able to control the nonlinear
optical response of the composites. The Z-scan measurements of the materials
indicate that the OL property of Ag NPs/rGO is improved by increasing the Ag NPs
concentration (as given in Figure 5). It should be noted that, Ag ions with too high
concentration might cause the aggregation of graphene material (as given in by Inset
(v) in Figure 2).
8. In addition, the English writing skill is not good, in need of polishing by
professional agency.
Response: We have carefully revised the English language to make the manuscript
more accurate and readable.
Reviewer: 2
In this study, the authors prepared Ag NPs/rGO hybrids using the FLAS method, and
measured their non-linear light scattering efficiencies. The experiments were carried
out properly. However, main points of this study, preparation of metal NPs/rGO
hybrids and investigation of their non-linear optical properties, have been reported
elsewhere as referred by the authors. Novel information about the properties of
NPs/rGO hybrids is provided.
Response: Thanks the reviewer for the helpful comments. Many synthesis strategies
based on chemical methods have been explored to prepare different kinds of graphene
hybrids, however, the involvements of environmentally hazardous chemicals and
complex chemical processes greatly restrict both the versatilities and flexibilities of
the hybrid graphene materials. Laser ablation in liquids (LAL) method can provide a
green one-step synthesis strategy of graphene nanocomposites. Using this method, D.
Tan et al. fabricated rGO hybrids decorated with silver (Ag) NPs with nanometer
sizes. Although the NLO response of the hybrids for femtosecond laser been reported,
the controllable synthesis of Ag NPs/rGO composites and their OL response for more
widely used nanosecond laser pulses still need further investigation. For this reason,
we prepared Ag NPs/rGO composites using LAL method in our manuscript, and
systematically studied the effect of laser power, irritation time, and Ag ion
concentration on the optical property and morphology of the products, as well as their
nonlinear OL behavior and mechanisms using a nanosecond laser.
To highlight our research motivation, we have carefully revised the
Introduction Section of the manuscript. The 3rd Paragraph of Section 2 has been
revised as following:
“The abundant oxygen-containing groups in graphene oxide (GO) make it
possible for chemical functionalization of the material [14, 15]. Various
multifunctional materials such as organic materials, dye molecules, and dielectric
have been attached to GO to enhance the nonlinear optical (NLO) properties [16-20].
Among these materials, metal nanoparticles (NPs) modified reduced graphene oxide
(rGO) attracts much attention [21, 22]. Though many synthesis strategies based on
chemical methods have been explored to fabricate different kinds of graphene hybrids,
the involvements of environmentally hazardous chemicals and complex chemical
processes largely restrict both the versatilities and flexibilities of the hybrid graphene
materials [18, 23, 24]. Laser ablation in liquids (LAL) method can provide a green
one-step synthesis strategy of graphene nanocomposites [25-29]. Due to its ultra-short
pulse duration and ultra-high peak power [30-33], when femtosecond laser irradiates
on graphene oxide (GO) aqueous solution containing metal ions, plasma plumes are
produced and reactions between these species result in NPs formation, as well as the
reduction and doping of GO. Using this method, D. Tan et al. fabricated rGO hybrids
decorated with silver (Ag) NPs with nanometer sizes [13]. Although the NLO
response of the hybrids for femtosecond laser been reported, the controllable synthesis
of Ag NPs/rGO composites and their OL response for more widely used nanosecond
laser pulses still need further investigation.”
In addition, we have added a plenty of experimental results and discussions
in the revised manuscript. The effect of laser power, irritation time, and Ag ion
concentration on the optical property and morphology of the products, as well as
their optical limiting properties are systematically studied. The revisions are
given in the section of “Results and discussion”.

The authors have revised the manuscript according to the reviewers' comments. The
main content and the data become more convincing to be published as it is. However,
minor revision should done about the abstract where only no results or conclusions
are presented. In the current state, it is not so clear about the contribution of this
manuscript to the academia.
Response:
According to the reviewer’s comments, we have revised the abstract of our
manuscript as following:
Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) functionalized with silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) is
prepared using femtosecond laser ablation in liquids method. By ablating the mixed
aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and graphene oxide (GO) using femtosecond laser
pulses, Ag ions and GO are simultaneously reduced and well-dispersed Ag NPs
supported on rGO are obtained. The effect of laser power, irritation time, and Ag ion
concentration on the optical property and morphology of the products are
systematically studied. The nonlinear optical (NLO) responses of the functionalized
graphene are studied using nanosecond Z-scan technique. The rGO hybrid shows an
enhanced nonlinear absorption effect compared with GO and rGO, and thus exhibits
an excellent optical limiting (OL) property with very low activating threshold, which
is estimated to be about 0.38 J/cm2. The enhanced NLA effect in rGO hybrids makes
it possible to fabricate solid-state optical limiter, improving the practicality of
graphene materials in OL area.

Although, the authors modified the abstract, the main contents was not modified from
the previous version. I still can not find the novelty of this work. At least, the effect
of laser power, irritation time, and Ag ion concentration on the NLS, NLA properties
should be shown.
Response:
(1) To highlight the novelty of our paper, the last paragraph of the Introduction
Section has been revised as following:
“In this paper, rGO functionalized with Ag NPs nanocomposites are synthesized using
femtosecond LAL method. The prepared Ag NPs/rGO composites are studied using
absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, Raman
spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The effect of laser power,
irritation time, and Ag ion concentration on the optical property and morphology of
the products are systematically studied. From the view point of practical applications,
the OL properties and mechanisms of Ag NPs/rGO composites are studied suing the
nanosecond laser Z-scan technique, especially the NLA contribution to the OL
behaviour of the material are investigated. The results indicate that Ag NPs/rGO
exhibits better OL properties than rGO, which can be attributed to the enhanced NLA
and NLS effect in the composites. The enhanced NLA effect in the composites might
promote the practical application of graphene materials in the fabrication of
solid-state optical limiters.”
(2) The effect of Ag NPs concentration on the NLA and NLS effect has been added in
the revised manuscript. The NLS intensity is enhanced after GO is reduced to rGO.
For Ag NPs/rGO composites, the NLS intensity is increased compared with rGO
when the concentration of Ag ions is 0.1 mM. However, the NLS intensity of Ag
NPs/rGO is decreased when Ag ions concentration is increased to 0.5 mM and 1 mM.
We speculate that NLA effect might be enhanced when the concentration of Ag NPs
increases, and as a result the energy converted to heat reduces causing the decrease of
NLS intensity. The NLA measurements indicates that, the NLA effect is gradually
increased when the concentration of Ag ions is increased from 0.1 mM to 1 mM. We
can conclude that both NLA and NLS effects contribute to OL effect in rGO and Ag
NPs/rGO composites, while only NLS contributes to those in GO. With increasing the
Ag NPs concentration, the NLA induced OL property can be effectively enhanced.
The last two paragraphs in “Results and discussion” Section have been
revised as following:
“In the OL process of graphene materials, two main nonlinear effects, i.e, NLS
and NLA might participate. In order to determine the OL mechanism of these
solutions, the nonlinear scattering light intensity as a function of the incident light
intensity is measured with the incident pulse energy of 100 µJ. The results in Fig. 6(a)
indicate the onset of the increase of scattered signals is synchronous with the onset of
the decrease of transmission for all the solutions. This demonstrates that NLS effect
plays an important role in the OL process of the materials. We can clearly see that the
NLS intensity is enhanced after GO is reduced to rGO. For Ag NPs/rGO composites,
the NLS intensity is increased compared with rGO when the concentration of Ag ions
is 0.1 mM. As the used laser at 532 nm is at the band edge of the SPR peak of Ag
NPs/rGO, more laser energy can be absorbed and converted into heat energy. Because
the NLS effect mainly originate from thermally induced microbubbles and/or
microplasmas in solvent [11], more microbubbles and/or microplasmas can be
induced in Ag NPs/rGO which results in an enhanced NLS intensity at a low
concentration of Ag NPs. However, the NLS intensity of Ag NPs/rGO is decreased
when Ag ions concentration is increased to 0.5 mM and 1 mM. We speculate that
NLA effect might be enhanced when the concentration of Ag NPs increases, and as a
result the energy converted to heat reduces causing the decrease of NLS intensity.
To confirm the contribution of NLA effect to the OL behaviour of the materials,
NLA effects in the samples are measured by collecting the scattering light using a lens.
Using this arrangement, the collected scattering light and the transmitted light will
incident into the detector together. Therefore, the contribution of NLS effect to the OL
behaviour can be ruled out, and the decrease of the transmittance is mainly attributed
to NLA effect. Figure 6(b) shows the nonlinear transmittance as a function of the
incident light intensity induced by NLA effect. It is clearly seen that both rGO and Ag
NPs/rGO exhibit obvious OL behaviour, while the transmittances change little in GO.
Besides, the NLA effect is gradually increased when the concentration of Ag ions is
increased from 0.1 mM to 1 mM. When focused laser irradiate into the
nanocomposites, Ag NPs absorbs laser light and free electrons are generated. The
photogenerated electrons could efficiently transfer from Ag NPs to rGO, suppressing
the charge recombination and producing a charge-separated excited stated. Therefore,
it is believed that the photo-induced charge transfer from Ag NPs to rGO in the Ag
NPs/rGO composites lead to the enhanced NLA [21]. Finally, we can conclude that
both NLA and NLS effects contribute to OL effect in rGO and Ag NPs/rGO
composites, while only NLS contributes to those in GO. With increasing the Ag NPs
concentration, the NLA induced OL property can be effectively enhanced. As the NLS
effect mainly originates from thermally induced microbubbles and/or microplasmas in
solvent, the enhanced NLA effect in Ag NPs/rGO makes it possible to manufacture
solid-state optical limiter, improving the practicality of graphene in the field of OL.”
