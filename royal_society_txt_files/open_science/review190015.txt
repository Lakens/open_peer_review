This manuscript reported the synthesis of a new heteropolyoxotantalate and tested its
performance for photocatalytic degradation of three organic dyes in water. The materials are
generally well characterized. However, this reviewer has concerns over the rationale for using
this homogeneous photocatalyst for dye removal, since the compound is hard to remove from
water after photocatalytic test. Actually, this may be the reason why the compound (and other
homogeneous photocatalysts) are more suitable for solar energy applications such as hydrogen
generation instead of environmental applications such as water purification. To be accepted for
publication, the authors need to address the above concern and performance experiments to
show that this compound can be easily recovered from the treated water after photocatalyst tests
and possibly reused.

In this manuscript, the authors present the synthesis, structure and its photocatalytic properties
of a new HPOTa complex K3[H3P4(TaO2)6(OH)4O20]·12H2O, which was successfully used to
degrade the Rhodamine B, Methyl blue and Acid red 1. The characterization and data analysis of
this manuscript is sufficient. Therefore, the manuscript can be considered to be accepted after
further revision. The following questions needs to be addressed for further improvement:
1. The nature of catalyst is that the composition of catalyst does not change before and after the
catalytic reaction. In order to prove that the as-obtained material is a catalyst, please provide the
phase data of the material after the catalytic reaction.
2. Dye-degradation catalysts have been studied for decades. Many corresponding catalysts have

Dear Dr Laura Smith,
Thank you for your work to our manuscript entitled “Photocatalytic decolorization
of three commercial dyes using a new heteropolyoxotantalate catalyst”
(Manuscript ID: RSOS-190015). We have carefully checked and revised our
manuscript in accordance with the referee and Subject Editor suggestions. Also, the
reference style has been formatted according to this Journal. Revised portion are
highlighted in the revised manuscript and the revised supporting information.
In addition, the second unit of the first author, Yansong Wang, is updated from
“Collaborative Innovation Center on Yellow River Civilization Heritage and Modern
Civilization Construction, Henan University” to “National Demonstration Center for
Environmental and Planning, Henan University” owing to the inner administrative
adjustment of our University.
We hope this revised manuscript is acceptable.
Best regards,
Dr. Yansong Wang and Zhimin Zhou
Comments from Reviewer 1:
<U+F09F> This manuscript reported the synthesis of a new heteropolyoxotantalate and
tested its performance for photocatalytic degradation of three organic dyes in
water. The materials are generally well characterized. However, this reviewer
has concerns over the rationale for using this homogeneous photocatalyst for
dye removal, since the compound is hard to remove from water after
photocatalytic test. Actually, this may be the reason why the compound (and
other homogeneous photocatalysts) are more suitable for solar energy
applications such as hydrogen generation instead of environmental applications
such as water purification. To be accepted for publication, the authors need to
address the above concern and performance experiments to show that this
compound can be easily recovered from the treated water after photocatalyst
tests and possibly reused.
Response: Good point! In our experiment, compound 1a is almost dissolved in
RhB solution, and the recovery rate of compound 1a is only ca. 20%, which is
collected by centrifugation. The stability of compound 1a in solution can be
proved by the following three experiments. First, the time-scale UV spectra
suggest that the characteristic absorption peak of compound 1a at ca. 250 nm
remains unchanged over 12 h (Figure S10a in the revised Supporting
Information). Second, it can be clearly seen that the absorption peak of RhB (554
nm) is disappeared after irradiation while the peak at ca. 250 nm still exists in
the UV spectra for the compound 1a and Rhb mixed solution (Figure S10b in the
revised Supporting Information). Third, the negative-ion ESI-MS spectra indicate
that the main envelope observed at m/z = 597.5 for 1a could be assigned to the
formula [H7{P4Ta6(O2)6O24}]3-, which can be also remained for 24 h (Figure S11 in
the revised Supporting Information). These results ensure the catalytic role of
compound 1a under homogeneous condition.
Moreover, the IR spectrum (KBr pellet) of compound 1a retains very well
before and after catalysis (Figure S12 in the revised Supporting Information),
indicating that compound 1a can be stable in the solid state.
Figure S10. a) The time-scale UV spectra for the solution of compound 1a; b) the UV spectra of
compound 1a and RhB mixed solution before and after irradiation.
Figure S11. Negative-ion ESI-MS spectra of cluster anion in compound 1a during 24 h. It can be
seen that the main envelope observed at m/z = 597.5 for 1a could be assigned to the formula
[H7{P4Ta6(O2)6O24}]3-, which can be also remained for 24 h.
Figure S12. IR spectra of compound 1a before and after catalysis, highlight the region between
1250 to 400 cm-1.
As you mentioned above, photocatalytic water-splitting offers a promising way for
environmentally friendly solar-hydrogen production in recent years. Therefore, a
preliminary photocatalytic study for hydrogen generation has been done, and the
results show that the H2 evolution rate is 3383 µmol h–1 g–1 for compound 1a (100
mg) over 6 h with the corresponding turnover number of 432 (moles of H2 formed /
moles of 1a), which is shown in Figure S16 in the revised Supporting Information.
Also, blank experiments indicate that no H2 can be detected under the absence of
Pt-co-catalyst, sacrificial solvent (CH3OH) or cluster 1a.
Figure S16. Time courses of photocatalytic H2 evolution under the presence of compound 1a
(black) and the absence of compound 1a (red). Experiment condition: 100 mg of 1a and 0.05 mg
of H2PtCl6 were dissolved in 100 mL of 10% methanol, which was irradiated under UV using a 500
W mercury lamp.
Comments from Reviewer 2:
<U+F09F> In this manuscript, the authors present the synthesis, structure and its
photocatalytic properties of a new HPOTa complex K3[H3P4(TaO2)6(OH)4O20]•
12H2O, which was successfully used to degrade the Rhodamine B, Methyl blue
and Acid red 1. The characterization and data analysis of this manuscript is
sufficient. Therefore, the manuscript can be considered to be accepted after
further revision. The following questions needs to be addressed for further
improvement:
1. The nature of catalyst is that the composition of catalyst does not change
before and after the catalytic reaction. In order to prove that the as-obtained
material is a catalyst, please provide the phase data of the material after the
catalytic reaction.
Response: Thank you for your positive comments and good suggestion. As above,
the stability of compound 1a dissolved in solution can be proved by both UV and
ESI-MS spectra, shown in Figures S10 and S11 in the revised Supporting
Information. Whereas the IR spectra of compound 1a remain the same before
and after catalysis (Figure S12 in the revised Supporting Information), indicating
that compound 1a can be stable in the solid state.

compound 1a and RhB mixed solution before and after irradiation.

seen that the main envelope observed at m/z = 597.5 for 1a could be assigned to the formula

Figure S12. IR spectra of compound 1a before and after catalysis, highlight the region between
1250 to 400 cm-1.
<U+F09F> 2. Dye-degradation catalysts have been studied for decades. Many
corresponding catalysts have been developed. Please compare the previous
reports on dyestuff degradation catalysts and propose the advantages of using
HPOTa complex as a catalyst. The author can refer to relevant research, such as
Nanoscale, 2013, 5, 6589-6598; Nanoscale, 2014, 6, 1124-1133; CrystEngComm,
2012, 14, 3965-3971; Chemical Engineering Journal, 2018, 334, 1537-1549.
Response: Thank you for your good suggestion. POMs is a large family of metal
oxo clusters used for various applications as it has a lot of advantages like,
structural versatility, accessible redox property, being environmental friendly and
chemically stable. A number of investigations on the photocatalytic activity of
POM clusters are also studied. As you said, dye-degradation catalysts have been
studied for decades. Honestly, we have paid more attention on POMs instead of
the other materials in photocatalytic properties.
Thank you for your recommendation! We have carefully read these four
researches and cited them in our revised manuscript. However, it is difficult to
compare the dye-degradation effect owing to the different experiment
conditions, such as dye concentration, hydrogen peroxide concentration, pH,
light source (UV light or visible light) and the amount of reported clusters. For
example, most experiments were carried out with the help of H2O2 to yield
highly reactive hydroxyl radicals that can in turn react with the dyes and lead to
dye degradation.
In our experiment, the degradation of RhB could be negligible under 350 W
Xenon lamp irradiation in the absence of the title compound 1a, while the
degradation rate was greatly enhanced upon introducing compound 1a. After
270 min irradiation, about 90% of RhB was removed in the presence of the 1a
samples. However, your suggestion gives us an inspiration to design experiment
in the future, we should pay much attention to the related researches and do
comparison that maybe be more persuasive.
<U+F09F> 3. Please propose the mechanism of catalytic degradation.
Response: Thank you for your good suggestion. As shown in Figure S17 in the
revised Supporting Information, the charge separation may occur when the
compound absorbed the UV light. The adsorbed oxygen present in the system
and then form the active species O2· to degrade the RhB. So, we think it might be
a one-step mechanism for compound 1a.
Figure S17. Schematic illustration for the photocatalytic mechanism of compound 1a.
<U+F09F> 4. There are some typo and grammar mistakes. Please revise the manuscript
carefully.
Response: We have modified the English expression and polished the whole
manuscript, highlighted in yellow in the revised manuscript. Thank you!

Dear Dr Laura Smith,
Thank you for your work to our manuscript entitled “Photocatalytic decolorization of
three commercial dyes using a new heteropolyoxotantalate catalyst” (Manuscript ID:
label_version_3
RSOS-190015.R2).
We have contacted the CSD team in regards to the DOIs for the data records. The
response is: CSD team do not assign DOIs to data pre-publication. They only assign
DOIs to data once it has been published. The only solution is to publish our data as a
CSD Communication, which will make the data accessible to the public. However, this
should not be used if we are planning to publish our data in a scientific article.
Then, we got advice from Editorial Coordinator, Lianne Parkhouse and cited the CCDC
datasets appropriately within the revised manuscript.
In addition, we have already published the file we deposited to the Royal Society
figshare portal.
We hope this revised manuscript is acceptable.

Comments from Reviewer 1:
<U+F09F> In the revised manuscript, my previous concerns are partially addressed. Since
this reported dye decolorization by the compounds can be useful in applications
other than wastewater treatment, this manuscript can be accepted for
publication after minor revision, with the following concerns properly addressed.
1. Figure S17, for the polyoxometalates reported herein, is it more suitable to use
HOMO/LUMO or CB/VB in describing the proposed photocatalytic mechanism?
Response: Thank you for your positive comments and good suggestion. Figure
S17 has been revised in accordance with your suggestion.

<U+F09F> 2. Please refrain from using lumped references. For example, in the first three
sentences in the Introduction section, the authors used 7 references, but actually,
no more than 3 references are needed. There is no need to have 37 papers to
support the first two paragraphs of the Introduction. The authors are strongly
advised to remove the unnecessary references.
Response: Thank you for your advice. We generally will cite two or more
references to make our point, which leads to some unnecessary references in the
introduction section of our manuscript. And, we have only cited the
representative references and refrained the lumped references in accordance
with your suggestion. Thus, the reference number was decreased from 61 to 39
in the revised manuscript.
