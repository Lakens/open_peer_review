Review report RSOS-172193
The manuscript is interesting and well written, in my opinion the only critical issue is that some
paragraphs could be synthetized, making reading more fluent. In particular, lines 104-123 of the
introduction and some previous research, in the discussion, could be described in a more
focusing way. Overall, only minor revision are required before the publication.

Yousey et al. investigated the potential for thermal adaptation between and within temporal sub-
populations of a Daphnia pulicaria. This study utilizes resurrection ecology, a unique approach
that allows one to manipulate living constituents of ancestral populations. Yousey et al.
performed a set of thermal tolerance assays using clones “resurrected” from time periods that
historically experienced different temperatures. The expression of a gene coding for a heat shock
protein (Hsp70) was also quantified for each clone using qPCR. The data demonstrate an overall
trend of increasing thermal tolerance over time: modern clones exhibited a significantly higher
mean LT50 than the ancient clones. Hsp70 expression was somewhat variable by clone, but did
not exhibit a significant temporal trend, and was not correlated with mortality or survivorship.
This manuscript is exceptionally well written, and I generally had no issue comprehending the
data as presented. The manuscript is a good fit for this journal, appeals to a wide audience, and
3
makes good use of an underutilized approach (resurrection ecology) in evolutionary ecology and
physiology.
I have a few minor comments/questions that need clarification, which I list below. Assuming the
authors adequately address these concerns, I believe this manuscript merits publication in the
Royal Society of Open Science.
Minor Revisions and Questions:
Line 128: I do not believe that Simpson et al. 2015 is an appropriate citation here, as this paper did
not quantify any behavioral metrics.
357-358: I am aware that whole-dataset analyses (your GLMM) using mortality/survivorship
data often do not yield significant results, due to the usual lack of variation at the high and low
treatments. However, it might be helpful for other readers if you provide a sentence that explains
this. You certainly do not want to accidentally give the impression that you were “searching for
significance” by performing the ANOVAs post-hoc. I will leave this as a judgement call for the
authors.
353-355, 383-385: I am a little confused by the outcomes of the GLMMs for Experiments 1 and 2.
Why was survivorship not significantly different between sub-populations in Experiment 1, but it
was in Experiment 2? Looking at the data in Figure 1, it seems like it should be the opposite:
variability between sub-populations is greater at all treatments in Figure 1a than in Figure 1b. It is
possible that I am simply misinterpreting the data, or that the random effect variables swayed the
analysis in some way; hopefully the authors can elaborate.
387-389: I did not see this in the data (Figure 1b). Based on the mean survivorships in Figure 1b,
the survivorship at 35°C for each sub-population matched the authors’ predictions: the modern
clones had the highest survivorship and the ancient clones had the lowest. There was a lot of
variability around these means, but the trend still matches the prediction at all treatments.
Figure 1: The y-axis is labeled as “% Survivorship,” but the increments are depicted as
proportions. I recommend that you switch the axis label to either “Survivorship” or change the
numbers to actual percentages.

To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees. We strongly recommend uploading two versions of your revised manuscript:
1) Identifying all the changes that have been made (for instance, in coloured highlight, in bold
text, or tracked changes);
2) A 'clean' version of the new manuscript that incorporates the changes made, but does not
highlight them.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document";
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format);
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account;
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript. Make sure it is clear in your data accessibility statement how the data
can be accessed;
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://rs.figshare.com/). The heading and legend provided for
each supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page,
so please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches.
Files on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article
so that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Please note that Royal Society Open Science will introduce article processing charges for all new
submissions received from 1 January 2018. Charges will also apply to papers transferred to Royal
Society Open Science from other Royal Society Publishing journals, as well as papers submitted

appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and certainly do not want to give the impression that
are looking for significance. We have incorporated clarification throughout the methods

are happy to address what may be at play with the data. We believe it is a “power” issue due
low number of replicates available in experiment 1 (3 replicates) versus experiment 2 (5
licates). We do address the hardship of hatching success for ancient clones, as well as the
itation of the low number of clonal representatives in the discussion, lines 428-435.
