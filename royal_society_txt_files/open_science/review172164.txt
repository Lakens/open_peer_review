In this paper, the authors described the immobilization of a-amylase onto cyanuric chloride
activated acrylic fiber. However, this work is lack of persuasiveness and systematicness to be
published in Royal Society Open Science.
1. The material was merely characterized by using SEM and FTIR, which is inadequate.
2. In Table 1, due to insufficient data, the optimum pH and cyanuric chloride percentage for the
reaction cannot be accurately determined. Therefore, this part of the study is not convincing and
the data can not adequately support the conclusions.
3. As is shown in scheme 1, the author considered the immobilization procedure as a chemical
process. However, the chemical bonding between a-amylase and supporter could not be proved.
Furthermore, if a chemical reaction occurred, why the a-amylase could be easily dissolved in
reused process.
4. There is a lot of grammar and spelling mistakes in the writing of the entire article.

Start a new paragraph at line “The hydrolysis of starch using a and ß-amylases…. “
Material and Methods
Pag 12 – Replace “microfibers was” by “microfibers were” at line 149 and 151
Pag 12 – Physicochemical characterization of the enzyme: This item must be re-writen. It is
impossible to understand the methods used for enzyme characterization. I suggest describing in
detail and separately every method used to characterize enzyme activity.
Pag 13 – line 185 – replace “cheater” by “chelator”. Moreover, the item has some problems with
space between words at lines 183 and 184.
Results
All tables and figures – insert the values of standard deviation
Replace “immobilize” by “immobilized” enzyme at line 212 and 213
Replace “bands” by “band” at line 214
Start a new paragraph with “Figure 3……” Line 233
Start a new paragraph with “The immobilization was….” Line 243
Replace “importance” by “important” at line 244
Line 249: “The high concentrations of substrates and the damage to the support material led to
the decreased enzymatic efficiency observed during recycling[31- 32].
This statement is not completely correct. In fact, amylases are sensitive to losses of essential
calcium ion during catalytic cycle. Maybe if the authors introduced an incubation with a calcium
solution between each catalytic cycle the activity would remain unchanged for higher number of
cycles. So, I suggest considering the calcium leaching as an important factor for the activity losses
observed in the repeated use experiment.
Start a new paragraph at Line 253. The meaning of this sentence was not clear: “The pH was
increased from 6.0 for soluble a-amylase to 6.5 for the immobilized enzyme..“ Line 253

In this manuscript, Almulaiky and coworker report the <U+0391>-Amylase
immobilization on amidoximated acrylic microfibers activated by
cyanuric chloride, the utilization of cyanuric chloride activated the
amidoximated acrylic fabric.
Before the paper can be considered for publication, the manuscript
needs a careful addressing to the following points. I recommend the
publication of this manuscript in Royal Society Open Science: For
review only, after a minor revise. The following are my additional
comments which should be addressed.
Q1, I am really struggling to see the application of this work in
chemistry. Please completely explain what is the aim of the present
work?
Author´s response:
We thank the reviewer for the comment. The technique of
immobilized enzymes is one of the most important aspects for
industrial application. We try to synthesized amidoximated micro fiber
by treating acrylic microfiber with hydroxylamine hydrochloride. This
method provides stability and retains the structure of the a-amylase
under different chemical and physical conditions. An increased
stability could make the immobilized enzyme more advantageous than
the free form.
Q2, In repeated reactions, the reason is not clear why the reactivity
decreased gradually (Fig 4).
Author´s response:
We thank the reviewer for the comment. The immobilized a-amylase
was reused for 10 times and the residual activity gradually decreased.
Thus, the immobilized enzyme activities decreased while the reused
number increased. These results are due to the inactivation of the
enzyme caused by the denaturation of protein and the leakage of
protein from the supports upon use.
Reviewer #3:
In this paper, the authors described the immobilization of a-amylase
onto cyanuric chloride activated acrylic fiber. However, this work is
lack of persuasiveness and systematicness to be published in Royal
Society Open Science.
Author´s response:
We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments on this work, as
these comments led us to improve our manuscript. All the comments
were attended, and some major changes were made throughout the
manuscript.
Q1, The material was merely characterized by using SEM and FTIR,
which is inadequate.
Author´s response:
We thank the reviewer for the comment. The key goal of this word
was to study several characters on the immobilized enzyme. FESEM
and FTIR could be sufficient to indicate that the enzyme was
immobilized successfully on the activated acrylic fibers. Moreover,
most researchers in this area of work consider FESEM, AFM and
FTIR are enough to indicate the immobilization of the enzyme. Two
references are mentioned below.

Q2, In Table 1, due to insufficient data, the optimum pH and
cyanuric chloride percentage for the reaction cannot be accurately
determined. Therefore, this part of the study is not convincing and the
data can not adequately support the conclusions.
Author´s response:
We thank the reviewer for the comment. The details of this point are
included in the supporting information. We think that the provided
data in the supporting information is sufficient to highlight the
accuracy of the performed experiments.
Q3, As is shown in scheme 1, the author considered the
immobilization procedure as a chemical process. However, the
chemical bonding between a-amylase and supporter could not be
proved. Furthermore, if a chemical reaction occurred, why the a-
amylase could be easily dissolved in reused process.
Author´s response:
We thank the reviewer for the comment. We would like to emphasize
that the chemical bonding between the enzyme and the supporting
materials is clearly obvious in the FTIR data. The change in the
spectrum between the immobilized enzyme and the supporting
material indicates the occurrence of the bonding between the enzyme
and the support, as shown in scheme 1. Furthermore, the decrease in
the enzyme activity during reusability is due to the denaturation of the
enzyme and the leakage of the enzyme upon reuse not by dissolving
enzyme.
Q4, There is a lot of grammar and spelling mistakes in the writing of
the entire article
Author´s response:
We would like to mention that the manuscript was reviewed before the
first submission by an authorized agency (American journal Experts)
which is suggested by Royal Science open Science. The editorial
certificate is attached for your review.

Author´s response:
We thank the reviewer for the comment. The errors are modified
accordingly, and mentioned in the revised manuscript. You will find
this modification in line 56 (revised manuscript).
Introduction
Remove the “and” at line 94, it was removed as requested by reviewer
(revised manuscript).
Replace “hydrochlorideis” by “hydrochlorides” and add the word
“are” before “used as a strong…” at line, 95. it was corrected in page
3, lines 95-96 (revised manuscript).
Start a new paragraph at line “The hydrolysis of starch using a and ß-
amylases…. “
You will find this modification in line 105 (revised manuscript).
Material and Methods
Pag 12 – Replace “microfibers was” by “microfibers were” at line 149
and 151.
It was corrected in page 6, lines 149, 151 (revised manuscript).
Pag 12 – Physicochemical characterization of the enzyme: This item
must be re-writen. It is impossible to understand the methods used for
enzyme characterization. I suggest describing in detail and separately
every method used to characterize enzyme activity.
It was re-writen in details and separated as requested by reviewer. You
will find this modification in page 6-7 (revised manuscript).
Pag 13 – line 185 – replace “cheater” by “chelator”. Moreover, the
item has some problems with space between words at lines 183 and
184.
You will find this modification in page 7 - line 193 (revised
manuscript).
Results
All tables and figures – insert the values of standard deviation.
It was modified as requested by reviewer. You will find this
modification from page 19 to 28. (revised manuscript).
Replace “immobilize” by “immobilized” enzyme at line 212 and 213
You will find this modification in page 9 - lines 220-221 (revised
manuscript).
Replace “bands” by “band” at line 214
You will find this modification in page 9 - line 222 (revised
manuscript).
Start a new paragraph with “Figure 3……” Line 233
You will find this modification in page 9- line 242 (revised
manuscript).
Start a new paragraph with “The immobilization was….” Line 243
You will find this modification in page 10- line 253 (revised
manuscript).
Replace “importance” by “important” at line 244
You will find this modification in page 10 - line 253 (revised
manuscript).
Line 249: “The high concentrations of substrates and the damage to
the support material led to the decreased enzymatic efficiency
observed during recycling [31- 32].
This statement is not completely correct. In fact, amylases are sensitive
to losses of essential calcium ion during catalytic cycle. Maybe if the
authors introduced an incubation with a calcium solution between each
catalytic cycle the activity would remain unchanged for higher number
of cycles. So, I suggest considering the calcium leaching as an
important factor for the activity losses observed in the repeated use
experiment.
We thank the reviewer for the comment. The details of this point are
included in page 10- lines 258- 260 (revised manuscript).
Start a new paragraph at Line 253.
You will find this modification in page 10- line 265 (revised
manuscript).
The meaning of this sentence was not clear: “The pH was increased
from 6.0 for soluble a-amylase to 6.5 for the immobilized enzyme
“Line 253
The sentence was re-writing clearly in page 10- line 265 (revised
manuscript).
