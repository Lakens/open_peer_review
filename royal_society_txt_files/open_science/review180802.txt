The manuscript describes the production of a microreactor with integrated optofluidic
waveguide in an silica aerogel and the application of the opto-microfluidic reactor to a
photodegradation reaction. The usage of the nanostructured aerogels as cladding in liquid-core
waveguides is rather new (presented first in 2017, also by the group of authors) and its
application as microphotoreactor is novel. These kind of here presented photoreactors feature
some advantages with respect to other microphotoreactors that are also mentioned in the
manuscript. In general the contents are clearly presented and follow a very logic order. The
figures are of high quality and support the descriptions and statements.
In 2017 the same group of authors published an article in the Journal of Sol-Gel Sci. Technology in
which they described/focused on the production of the gel, the supercritical drying of the gel, the
treatment of the gel to make it hydrophobic, the generation/drilling of the channels into the gel
and the differences in light propagation when the channels are filled with air and with liquid. In
this current submission to Royal Society Open Science the authors in the introduction clearly
present their new study in the light of optofluidic microreaction and with this clearly distinguish
their new work from the previous work. But then in section 2 and section 3 there is a large
overlap with the contents already published in 2017. There is no doubt that the contents
presented in section 2 and section 3 are essential for the understanding of the manuscript but I
recommend to more often refer to the Sol-Gel Sci paper and as a consequence to shorten
especially section 2. Section 3 contains a variety of new findings/results that are shown in Figures
5, 7, 8, 9 and 10. These novel results justify the publication of these investigations into the
applicability of aerogels as optofluidic microreactors.
Lines 1 to 25 in the section 3.1 read like a repetition of what has already been explained in the
section 2. I recommend to clearly focus on the results in the results section and to skip the
descriptions regarding the methods.
Figure 5. Can the band between 4000 and 3000 wavenumbers be really assigned to a Si-OH
stretching. This way of writing makes the reader anticipate that the stretching might be between
Si and OH. I think that this band is due to the stretching between the O and the H. Thus I
recommend to label this band not as Si-OH but as O-H. Please also clarify in the text.
Total internal reflection: At several locations within this manuscript the authors mention that the
ITR occurs when the light “hits” the channel wall (see for example line 46 in section 3.2 and other
lines). To my understanding the TIR occurs when the light reaches the interface between the
liquid core (high index of refraction) and the aerogel matrix (lower index of refraction.
In section 3.2 the attenuation of the waveguide is specified with “significantly lower than
3dB/cm”. I recommend to provide for comparison the attenuation typical for hollow core
photonic crystal fibers.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
While this is a very interesting addition to the family of optofluidic waveguides and a potentially
useful application, there are some major questions regarding the waveguide performance as
listed below:
1. The authors report that the waveguide losses are significantly less than 3 dB/cm but there is no
measurement of this loss provided. This is a very important parameter when introducing or
characterizing a waveguide so the authors should report it. In this case, measurement of
waveguide loss should probably be attempted through a top-down scattering method.
2. The dimensions for the reported waveguides are very large. They are formed with a 2.1 mm
drill, which is enormous compared to most optical waveguides. Based on the size of the
waveguides, it is unclear just how necessary any "waveguiding" is in this application. A very
similar results might be obtained by taking a block of plastic, drilling the same sized hole through
it and shining light in the solution. I suggest that such an experiment be done as a comparison to
show that there is some utility in the waveguiding nature of the aerogel sample. If the length of
the waveguide was very long compares to its width, this utility would be more clear, of course,
but in this case where the length to diameter ratio is only around 23, the utility is not so clear.

RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS’ COMMENTS
Reviewer: 1
The manuscript describes the production of a microreactor with integrated
optofluidic waveguide in a silica aerogel and the application of the opto-
microfluidic reactor to a photodegradation reaction. The usage of the
nanostructured aerogels as cladding in liquid-core waveguides is rather new
(presented first in 2017, also by the group of authors) and its application as
microphotoreactor is novel. These kind of here presented photoreactors feature
some advantages with respect to other microphotoreactors that are also mentioned
in the manuscript. In general the contents are clearly presented and follow a very
logic order. The figures are of high quality and support the descriptions and
statements.
In 2017 the same group of authors published an article in the Journal of Sol-Gel Sci.
Technology in which they described/focused on the production of the gel, the
supercritical drying of the gel, the treatment of the gel to make it hydrophobic, the
generation/drilling of the channels into the gel and the differences in light
propagation when the channels are filled with air and with liquid. In this current
submission to Royal Society Open Science the authors in the introduction clearly
present their new study in the light of optofluidic microreaction and with this clearly
distinguish their new work from the previous work. But then in section 2 and section
3 there is a large overlap with the contents already published in 2017. There is no
doubt that the contents presented in section 2 and section 3 are essential for the
understanding of the manuscript but I recommend to more often refer to the Sol-Gel
Sci paper and as a consequence to shorten especially section 2. Section 3 contains a
variety of new findings/results that are shown in Figures 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10. These
novel results justify the publication of these investigations into the applicability of
aerogels as optofluidic microreactors.
Response
The text in Section 2 has been shortened, keeping only the most essential parts
in the manuscript. Sub-section 2.3 (Surface Modification with HMDS) has
been completely removed from the manuscript; relevant information from this
deleted sub-section has been partially added to sub-section 2.2 of the current
manuscript.
Lines 1 to 25 in the section 3.1 read like a repetition of what has already been
explained in the section 2. I recommend to clearly focus on the results in the results
section and to skip the descriptions regarding the methods.
Response
The initial part of Section 3 has been shortened. In the current version of the
manuscript, only information necessary for interpretation of our results has
been retained.
Figure 5. Can the band between 4000 and 3000 wavenumbers be really assigned to
a Si-OH stretching. This way of writing makes the reader anticipate that the
stretching might be between Si and OH. I think that this band is due to the stretching
between the O and the H. Thus I recommend to label this band not as Si-OH but as
O-H. Please also clarify in the text.
Response
The spectral band in question is usually assigned to Si-OH stretching in the
literature [1, 2]. In the manuscript, we have adopted the same interpretation
and provided appropriate references.
Total internal reflection: At several locations within this manuscript the authors
mention that the ITR occurs when the light “hits” the channel wall (see for example
line 46 in section 3.2 and other lines). To my understanding the TIR occurs when the
light reaches the interface between the liquid core (high index of refraction) and the
aerogel matrix (lower index of refraction.
Response
This statement about TIR is correct: when a ray of light is incident upon the
interface between the high-index liquid core and low-index aerogel cladding of
the waveguide from the liquid side at an angle greater than the critical angle,
the light is reflected back to the core liquid. We have changed the phrasing in
the manuscript in Section 1 on page 2 to make this clear.
In section 3.2 the attenuation of the waveguide is specified with “significantly lower
than 3dB/cm”. I recommend to provide for comparison the attenuation typical for
hollow core photonic crystal fibers.
Response
Information on the typical propagation losses of hollow-core photonic crystal
fibers has been added to the manuscript in Section 1 on page 2 where these
types of reactors are described.
Reviewer: 2
While this is a very interesting addition to the family of optofluidic waveguides and
a potentially useful application, there are some major questions regarding the
waveguide performance as listed below:
1. The authors report that the waveguide losses are significantly less than 3 dB/cm
but there is no measurement of this loss provided. This is a very important
parameter when introducing or characterizing a waveguide so the authors should
report it. In this case, measurement of waveguide loss should probably be attempted
through a top-down scattering method.
Response
Our recent studies cited in the manuscript describe procedures for the
measurement of waveguide propagation losses in terms of the input optical
power coupled into the waveguide and the output optical power observed after
the light has propagated a certain distance <U+0001D467> along the waveguide. We have
added to the manuscript the measured value of the propagation loss of -1.5
dB/cm reported in [add reference to our paper in the Journal of Sol-Gel
Science and Technology] for the same type of optofluidic waveguide.
2. The dimensions for the reported waveguides are very large. They are formed
with a 2.1 mm drill, which is enormous compared to most optical
waveguides. Based on the size of the waveguides, it is unclear just how necessary
any "waveguiding" is in this application. A very similar result might be obtained by
taking a block of plastic, drilling the same sized hole through it and shining light in
the solution. I suggest that such an experiment be done as a comparison to show
that there is some utility in the waveguiding nature of the aerogel sample. If the
length of the waveguide was very long compares to its width, this utility would be
more clear, of course, but in this case where the length to diameter ratio is only
around 23, the utility is not so clear.
Response
For the demonstration of the essential influence of waveguiding on the
efficiency of photochemical reactions carried out in optofluidic
microphotoreactors, we performed a control experiment, in which we replaced
the aerogel-based photoreactor with a piece of plastic tubing (outer diameter 4
mm and inner diameter 2 mm) with L-shaped geometry and the same
dimensions as the channel fabricated in the aerogel. Prior to the photolysis
experiments, light propagation in the tubing filled with aqueous MB solution
was characterized. It was observed that the light could not propagate along the
path of the liquid reactant in the liquid-filled tubing, since the contrast of the
refractive index between the liquid and the tubing was reversed with respect to
that required by TIR. Consequently, a large fraction of the input light coupled
into the tubing was scattered at the tubing elbow. Only a small fraction of the
incident light could reach the end of the tubing, exploiting TIR at the interface
between the tubing and ambient air. A photograph of the solution-filled tubing
with coupled light at 488 nm has been added to the manuscript.
Following the characterization of light propagation in the liquid-filled tubing,
photolysis of MB was carried out in the tubing under illumination with
activation laser light at 388 nm with an incident light power of 64 mW. At this
incident light power, the observed conversion of MB dye in tubing-based
photoreactor was only ~10 % after 60 minutes of irradiation, whereas for
aerogel-based photoreactor, the observed conversion of MB was 48 % under
the same experimental conditions (incident light power and exposure time).
These results that clearly show the importance of the light-guiding effect for
the high performance of the microphotoreactor have been added to the
manuscript (sub-section 3.3).
