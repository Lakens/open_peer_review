This experimental paper describes a novel type of memristive pn junction which emulates the
conductance dependence of STDP synapses. The approach is original as it proposes a novel
trapping mechanism which differs from that of Magneli alloys. The methodology appears
sounds overall but has some gaps in logic which the authors ought to address before the paper is
published:
1. While the mechanism of migration of Oxygen vacancies is plausible, its effect on the current
through the pn junction ought to be clarified. Either vacancies change the density of minority
carriers by increasing the barrier height in which case their effect should be discussed in relation
to the Schockley equation for the pn junction OR the current increases through the formation of
deep O2 levels in the gap of the pn junction increasing the leakage current. Which of these two
effects is involved? Why is one material p-doped and the other n-doped?
2. In multiple places in the paper there is confusion between "current", "conductance", "resistance"
and "synaptic weight". For example in Fig.1 when V>0 the current increases with V but the
conductance decreases (due to the sub-linear current responses). Another example in Fig.4, the
relation between "weight" and "conductance" should be clarified as the conductance is always
positive but the weight is negative. Please define what you mean by weight.
Minor comments:
- A horizontal timescale in the inset of Fig.3 would be useful.
- The description of voltage pulses used to demonstrate STDP action in Fig.4 is not described
sufficiently clearly in the text or the caption to allow the experiment for be replicated. As these
are not square pulses, explain what the t=50ms and t=380ms mean.

Le Zhao et al investigated resistance switching properties of CoO/Nb:SrTiO3 junctions and
found that the pulse-voltage-induced resistance changes of the CoO/Nb:SrTiO3 junctions could
emulate properties of synapse, proposing the CoO/Nb:SrTiO3 junctions as artificial synapse.
However the reviewer was not convinced with conclusions and interpretations of their
experimental data as described below. The reviewer would not recommend the manuscript for
publication until the issues raised by the author is clarified.
(1) It is said that the migration of oxygen vacancies and charge trapping and detrapping at the
heterojunction interface, which modify the depletion layer width and the interface barrier height,
is responsible for the resisting switching behavior in the CoO/Nb:SrTiO3 junctions. The reviewer
was not sure from which experimental data the author concluded this proposed mechanism.
(2) The schematic in Fig 1e indicates that oxygen vacancies could move from CoO layer’ surface
on the positive electrode side to the Nb-STO layer’s surface on the negative electrode. Is there any
experimental evidences on the oxygen ion movements in the CoO/Nb-STO junctions? The
reviewer was not sure how the authors verify the schematic. More explanations will be necessary.
(3) The authors need to add more explanations on details of their measurements. Especially
measurements of the junction resistance changes induced by applying pulse voltages. How did
the authors measure/probe the resistance changes after applying pulse voltages?
(4) For measurements in Figures 2 and 3, how long intervals between pulses were used? If the
interval would be changed, how would the junction resistance behavior be influenced? The
authors are asked to add more descriptions. If it is the case that the intervals affect the junction
resistance behavior, is it still safely say that the Co/Nb-STO junction can emulate synapse
properties?

The reviewer thanks authors for their efforts on revising the manuscript and responding
comments/suggestions. However, the reviewer is still not sure if migrations of oxygen vacancies
are the main origin for the resistance switching behavior of the CoO/Nb-STO junctions.
Although the authors are claiming that this conclusion is supported by the non-linear analysis on
the IV characteristics of the junctions, the authors’ analysis is indirect and the oxygen vacancy
migration scenario is just one of possibilities. This is a critical point because some discussion in
this manuscript are based on this claim. The reviewer thinks that the author should provide
direct evidences on this point.

Dear Authors,
Thank you for revising the paper after considering our fellow reviewers' comments. However
one of our reviewers is still concerned about the real mechanism of the resistance switching
phenomenon. Although the authors tried to use curve-fitting to explain it with relevant reference
support in the reply, it is still not convincible. It would be better if this can be experimentally
demonstrated as shown in Ref 26.

Appendix A
Reviewer reports:
Response:
We greatly appreciate that the reviewer gave us so many valuable suggestions for
improving our manuscript. The manuscript has been revised carefully based on the
comments and suggestions.
Reviewer #1: (1) While the mechanism of migration of oxygen vacancies is plausible,
its effect on the current through the pn junction ought to be clarified. Either
vacancies change the density of minority carriers by increasing the barrier height
in which case their effect should be discussed in relation to the schockley equation
for the pn junction Or the current increases through the formation of deep O2 levels
in the gap of the pn junction increasing the leakage current. Which of these two
effects is involved? Why is one material p-doped and the other n-doped?
Response:
CoO is usually a p-type semi-conductor due to the existence of Co vacancies [1],
while Nb:SrTiO3 substrate is a n-type semi-conductor because of the Nb doping. The
effect of migration of oxygen vacancies is indeed related to the schockley equation of
the pn junction. We added the nonlinear fittings of the transport characteristics in Fig.
1 to analyze the effect of migration of oxygen vacancies on the current through the pn
junction, which was uploaded in the revised manuscript.
The revised Fig. 1 is shown as follows:
Figure 1 (a) The schematic of heterojunction CoO/Nb:SrTiO3. (b) I-V characteristic showing
non-volatile bipolar memristive switches. Arrows indicate the voltage-sweep direction. Five
cycles of operation are shown. (c) Ln(I/V) vs (V)1/2 in the negative bias region at HRS. (d)
Ln(I) vs Ln(V) in the negative bias region at LRS. (e)(f) The schematic diagram of the
mechanism of RS behaviors in CoO/Nb:SrTiO3 heterostructure. (e) At forward bias voltage
(LRS) and (f) at reverse bias voltage (HRS). (g) Analogy between the CoO/Nb:SrTiO3 based
device and the biological synapse.
And the following sentences were added in page 2 lines 69-73. It reads:
To investigate the origin of the switching behavior, we also carried out nonlinear
fittings to the transport characteristics. Figure 1(c) shows an Ln(I/V) versus V1/2
plot, indicating the Poole–Frenkel(P–F) emission mechanism at HRS. However,
Figure 1(d) shows an approximate linear relationship between Ln(I) and Ln(V),
showing space charge limited (SCL) conduction at LRS. This behavior is
consistent with previous reports on the interfacial effects, where the migration of
oxygen vacancies and charge trapping/detrapping in the vicinity of the interface
drives RS in various heterojunctions [26-28].
(2) In multiple places there is confusion between “current”, “conductance”,
“resistance” and “synaptic weight”. For example in Fig 1 when V>0 the current
increases with V but the conductance decreases (due to the sub-linear current
responses). Another example in Fig 4, the relation between “weight” and
“conductance” should be clarified as the conductance is always positive but the
weight is negative. Please define what you mean by weight.
Response: Sorry for the confusion. We have revised several places in the paper in
order to clarify the conceptual confusion between “current”, “conductance”,
“resistance” and “synaptic weight”.
First, we have rewritten the description for Figure 1(b) in order to demonstrate that
here we only consider the resistance change driven by the applied voltage and
therefore the resistance here is inversely proportional to current shown in the Figure.
Here we also added the following sentences to explain why the memristive
characteristic is suitable for mimicking biological synaptic weight modulation.
In page 2 lines 60-68, it reads:
Figure 1(b) presents the current-voltage (IV) characteristics of CoO/NSTO in
semilogarithmic scale. It is measured by applying a sweeping voltage of
0V<U+F0E0>+1.5V<U+F0E0>0V<U+F0E0>-2V<U+F0E0>0V. The arrows in Figure 1(b) indicate the sweeping
direction. The device resistance can be set to high resistance state (HRS) to low
resistance state (LRS) under a positive voltage and reset to HRS under a
negative voltage. Besides, the device shows a typical non-volatile bipolar
memristive switching performance without a forming process. The memristive
characteristic is suitable for mimicking biological synaptic weight modulation for
two reasons. First, the resistance variation induced by voltage stimuli is similar
to the synaptic weight modification responding to the firing of pre-and
post-synaptic neurons. Second, bipolar switching avoids abrupt resistance
transition, so that it supports analog-like transition between the resistance states.
This is the base of achieving continuously change in synaptic weight.
Second, we focused on emulating the biological excitatory synapse in this paper
because phenomena such as long-term potentiation, long-term depression, usually
occurs at excitatory synapses [2]. An excitatory synapse increases the probability of
an action potential occurring in post-synaptic neurons and therefore the weight, or the
connection strength of an excitatory synapse is always positive. However, the change
of the synaptic weight can be either positive or negative. The x-axis in Figure 4 was
showing the weight change of the electrical synapse, which was represented by the
change of the device conductance. And in order to explain what “synapse” and
“synaptic weight” refers to in this paper as well as clarify the relation between
“synaptic weight” and “device resistance/conductance”, we have added the following
sentences:
In page 2 lines 84-93 it reads:
Figure 1(g) illustrates an analogy between the electronic synapse based on
CoO/Nb:SrTiO3 memristor and the biological excitatory synapse. Note that in
this paper we specifically focus on emulating excitatory synapses because
phenomena such as long-term potentiation, long-term depression, usually occurs
at these synapses [29]. As shown in Figure 1(e), a biological synapse is composed
of a pre-synaptic neuron, a post-synaptic neuron, and a synapse. In electronic
synapse based on CoO/Nb: SrTiO3 memristor, the negative and positive
electrodes work as the pre- and post-synaptic neurons, respectively. The synaptic
weight, which reflects the connection strength between two neighbouring
neurons, is represented by the device resistance or conductance. The resistance
or conductance of the electronic device is changed because of the oxygen
vacancies migration when receiving the input action potentials. This is similar to
the biological synaptic weight, which is changed because the pre-neuron releases
ions when receiving the input spikes. And the device resistance is inversely
proportional to the synaptic weight while the device conductance is proportional
to the synaptic weight.
In page 3 lines 146-148, it reads:
Here we use the conductance change of the device to represent the synaptic
weight modulation. Although the conductance is always positive, the change of it
can either be positive or negative.
Third, we corrected “resistance” to “conductance” in the following lines:
Page 3 lines 153-154: .In order to exclude conductance modification by a single
spike, the pulse and tail voltage amplitudes were selected to be both lower than
the threshold voltage Vth for SET and RESET processes.
Page 4 line 165: Figure 4 shows the resulting timing-dependent conductance
modulation.
Page 4 lines 166-168: For high <U+2206>t, the magnitude of injected voltage does not
exceed Vth at any time, thus conductance remains unchanged. For low <U+2206>t,
however, the magnitude of injected voltage in excess of Vth is applied,
conductance is thus increased or decreased depending on the sign of <U+2206>t.
Minor comments:
- A horizontal timescale in the inset of Fig 3. Would be useful.
Response:
Thanks for the suggestion.
The inset of Fig. 3 was a diagram of the pulse scheme. We have revised the figure and
added a horizontal timescale. Now the inset of Fig. 3 is displaying the actual time for
the horizontal axis.
The revised Fig. 3 is shown as follows:
Figure 3 Resistance switching cycles driven by consecutive positive or negative pulses,
representing synaptic weight modulation due to the potentiating or depressing pulses,
respectively. Upper inset: the pulse schemes. The pulse amplitudes vary with identical 2 ms
widths and 1 s pulse intervals.
- The description of voltage pulses used to demonstrate STDP action in Fig 4 is not
described sufficiently clearly in the text or the caption to allow the experiment
for be replicated. As these are not square pulses, explain what the t=50ms and t=380ms
mean.
Response:
Thanks for the suggestion.
We have added the vertical and horizontal scales in insets of Figure 4 in order to show
the details of the voltage pulses.
The revised Fig. 4 is shown as follows:
Figure 4 Plot of the device conductance (synaptic weight) change with variation in <U+2206>t
showing the STDP response of the electronic synapse. Insets: Schematic of the pulse-pair
applied to our device for STDP demonstration. Although amplitude of each pulse is under
the threshold, the sum of them can exceed the threshold of SET and RESET process and
lead to change in device conductance (synaptic weight). When the pre-spike precedes the
post-spike (<U+2206>t>0), the device is set (potentiated); when the post-spike precedes the pre-spike
(<U+2206>t<0), the device is reset (depressed). The timing (<U+2206>t) between the two spikes determines the
voltage flux (V×<U+2206>t) across the device.
And we have added the following sentences in order to explain how we set the
particular parameters of these voltage pulses.
In page 3 lines 150-153, it reads:
The detailed analysis of the different shapes of “spikes” and the resulting STDP
function was discussed in the paper of T. Serrano. Gottaredong et al. [39].
Although the shape of the spike is not decisive, it is assumed that each spike in
the pair consists of a narrow short positive pulse of large amplitude and a long
relaxing slowly decreasing negative tail.
In page 3 lines 154-157, it reads:
And we arbitrary set the duration of the short positive pulse and the duration of
the tail voltage to be 50 ms, and 380 ms, respectively. In this way, the spike has
the shape very close to those in biological systems. Meanwhile, this setting leads
to stimulation that is great enough to induce the conductance variation.
In page 3 line 161 and page 4 lines 162-164, it reads:
When the two spikes with opposite polarities arrived at the device, voltages
added up. The amplitude of the total voltage at the device could exceed the
threshold voltage Vth, leading a conductance variation. As <U+2206>t increases, both of
the effective voltage and the effective time decrease, eventually leading to the
decrease in synaptic weight change, and vice versa.
Reviewer #2: (1) It is said that the migration of oxygen vacancies and charge trapping
and detrapping at the heterojunction interface, which modify the depletion layer
width and the interface barrier height, is responsible for the resisting switching
behavior in the CoO/Nb: SrTiO3 junctions. The reviewer was not sure from which
experimental data the author concluded this proposed mechanism.
(2) The schematic in Fig. 1e indicates that oxygen vacancies could move from CoO
layer’ surface on the positive electrode side to the Nb-STO layer’s surface on
the negative electrode. Is there any experimental evidences on the oxygen ion
movements in the CoO/Nb-STO junctions? The reviewer was not sure how the authors
verify the schematic. More explanations will be necessary.
Response to comment (1) and comment (2):
We accepted the reviewer’s comments and suggestions. The manuscript has been
revised carefully based on these comments and suggestions. We added the nonlinear
fittings of the transport characteristics in Fig. 1 to investigate the origin of the
resistive switching behaviors, which was uploaded in the revised manuscript. The
following sentence was added in page 2 lines 69-73. It reads:
To investigate the origin of the switching behavior, we also carried out nonlinear
fittings to the transport characteristics. Figure 1(c) shows an Ln(I/V) versus V1/2
plot, indicating the Poole–Frenkel (P–F) emission mechanism at HRS. However,
Figure 1(d) shows an approximate linear relationship between Ln(I) and Ln(V),
showing space charge limited (SCL) conduction at LRS. This behavior is
consistent with previous reports on the interfacial effects, where the migration of
oxygen vacancies and charge trapping/detrapping in the vicinity of the interface
drives RS in various heterojunctions [26-28].
The revised Fig. 1 is shown as follows:

non-volatile bipolar memristive switches. Arrows indicate the voltage-sweep direction. Five
cycles of operation are shown. (c) Ln(I/V) vs (V)1/2 in the negative bias region at HRS. (d)

(3) The authors need to add more explanations on details of their measurements.
Especially measurements of the junction resistance changes induced by applying pulse
voltages. How did the authors measure/probe the resistance changes after applying
pulse voltages?
Response:
Thanks for the suggestion. We have added the following sentence in order to explain
the details of our measurements, especially the measurements of the junction
resistance changes induced by applying pulse voltages.
In page 2 lines 96-97, it reads:
The device resistance was monitored by applying a read voltage of 100mV for
100 ms after each pulse stimulus.
In page 3 lines 108-111, it reads:
The time intervals between pulses were 1 s (900 ms waiting time plus 100 ms
read time). During this interval, the resistance state was monitored by a read
voltage of 100 mV.
In page 3 lines 129-130, it reads:
All pulse widths were fixed at 2ms. Each pulse was followed by measurement of
the device resistance.
(4) For measurements in Figure 2 and 3, how long intervals between pulses were used?
If the interval would be changed, how would the junction resistance behavior be
influenced? The authors are asked to add more descriptions. If it is the case that
the intervals affect the junction resistance behavior, is it still safely say that
the Co/Nb-STO junction can emulate synapse properties?
Response:
The intervals between pulses would not affect the junction resistance behavior
because of the nonvolatile memory of the junction, which refers to a stable resistance
state after being stimulated. Therefore it is safely say that the Co/Nb-STO junction
can emulate synapse properties. In order to demonstrate the interval between pulses in
Figure 2 and 3, we have added the following sentences:
In page 3 lines 108-111, it reads:
The time intervals between pulses were 1 s (900 ms waiting time plus 100 ms
read time). During this interval, the resistance state was monitored by a read
voltage of 100 mV. The time interval between pulses would not affect the device
resistance because of the nonvolatile memory of the device, which refers to a
stable resistance state after being stimulated.
In page 3 lines 129-131, it reads:
All pulse widths were fixed at 2ms. Each pulse was followed by measurement of
the device resistance. Note that the time interval between pulses would not affect
the device resistance because of the non-volatile memory of the device.

Appendix B
Dear Dr. Chong Li, Editor
I should like to express my appreciation to you for suggesting how to improve our manuscript.
The manuscript has been revised carefully based on your comment and suggestion.
Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Chong Li):
Thank you for revising the paper after considering our fellow reviewers' comments.
However one of our reviewers is still concerned about the real mechanism of the
resistance switching phenomenon. Although the authors tried to use curve-fitting
to explain it with relevant reference support in the reply, it is still not
convincible. It would be better if this can be experimentally demonstrated as shown
in Ref. 26.
Response:
The release process of low resistance states was fitted well with a bi-exponential
relaxation equation as shown in the inset of Figure 1(d), which can be attributed to the
oxygen vacancy movements. In the revised manuscript, we added the following
sentences to discuss the double-exponential decay:
In page 2 lines 74-77, it reads: “Moreover, the time dependence of the current at
the LRS was fitted with a bi-exponential relaxation equation of <U+0001D408> = <U+0001D408><U+0001D7CE> +
<U+0001D400><U+0001D41E>-<U+0001D42D>/<U+0001D6D5><U+0001D7CF> + <U+0001D401><U+0001D41E>-<U+0001D42D>/<U+0001D6D5><U+0001D7D0> , where <U+0001D408><U+0001D7CE> is the steady state current, <U+0001D42D> is the time, A and B
are constant, and <U+0001D6D5><U+0001D7CF> and <U+0001D6D5><U+0001D7D0> are two relaxation time constants. The well fitted
curve with <U+0001D6D5><U+0001D7CF> = <U+0001D7D0><U+0001D7D5>. <U+0001D7D5><U+0001D42C> and <U+0001D6D5><U+0001D7D0> = <U+0001D7D1><U+0001D7D1><U+0001D7D5>. <U+0001D7D4><U+0001D42C> further implies oxygen vacancy
migration.”
We added the time dependence of the current at the LRS and the fitting curve in the
inset of Figure 1(d). The revised Figure 1 is shown as follows:
Figure 1 (a) The schematic of heterojunction CoO/Nb:SrTiO3. (b) I-V characteristic showing
non-volatile bipolar memristive switches. Arrows indicate the voltage-sweep direction. Five
cycles of operation are shown. (c) Ln(I/V) vs (V)1/2 in the negative bias region at HRS. (d)
Ln(I) vs Ln(V) in the negative bias region at LRS. Inset: the time dependence of the current
at the LRS and the fitting curve. (e)(f) The schematic diagram of the mechanism of RS
behaviors in CoO/Nb:SrTiO3 heterostructure. (e) At forward bias voltage (LRS) and (f) at
reverse bias voltage (HRS). (g) Analogy between the CoO/Nb:SrTiO3 based device and the

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
The reviewer thanks authors for their efforts on revising the manuscript and
responding comments/suggestions. However, the reviewer is still not sure if
migrations of oxygen vacancies are the main origin for the resistance switching
behavior of the CoO/Nb-STO junctions. Although the authors are claiming that this
conclusion is supported by the non-linear analysis on the IV characteristics of the
junctions, the authors’ analysis is indirect and the oxygen vacancy migration
scenario is just one of possibilities. This is a critical point because some
discussion in this manuscript are based on this claim. The reviewer thinks that the
author should provide direct evidences on this point.
Response:
Thanks for your review. In transition metal oxides, electrochemical migration of
oxygen ions has been widely regarded as the driving mechanism of bipolar-type
resistive switching [1]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the direct observation
of oxygen vacancy movements during resistive switching process has not been
reported. Oxygen vacancy movements are usually indirectly demonstrated by IV
curve fitting in Ref. 26 or magnetism variation [2]. Since defects at the heterojunction
interface play a significant impact on the conduction mechanism. The change of the
IV curve implies variations in the height and width of the barrier, which can be
attributed to the change of the defect distribution. At the same time, time relaxation of
resistance states can also be related with the oxygen vacancy movement [26].
Based on the editor’s suggestion, we added the well fitted curve of the
double-exponential decay in the inset of Figure1(d) and the following sentences in the
revised manuscript:
In page 2 lines 74-77, it reads: “Moreover, the time dependence of the current at
the LRS was fitted with a bi-exponential relaxation equation of <U+0001D408> = <U+0001D408><U+0001D7CE> +
<U+0001D400><U+0001D41E>-<U+0001D42D>/<U+0001D6D5><U+0001D7CF> + <U+0001D401><U+0001D41E>-<U+0001D42D>/<U+0001D6D5><U+0001D7D0> , where <U+0001D408><U+0001D7CE> is the steady state current, <U+0001D42D> is the time, A and B
are constant, and <U+0001D6D5><U+0001D7CF> and <U+0001D6D5><U+0001D7D0> are two relaxation time constants. The well fitted
curve with <U+0001D6D5><U+0001D7CF> = <U+0001D7D0><U+0001D7D5>. <U+0001D7D5><U+0001D42C> and <U+0001D6D5><U+0001D7D0> = <U+0001D7D1><U+0001D7D1><U+0001D7D5>. <U+0001D7D4><U+0001D42C> further implies oxygen vacancy
migration.”
The revised Figure 1 is shown as follows:

non-volatile bipolar memristive switches. Arrows indicate the voltage-sweep direction. Five
