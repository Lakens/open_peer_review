The work reported in this manuscript is interesting. However, it needs revisions and

1. Title should be revised to be precise and reflecting the contents;
2. No need to mention the abbreviation in the abstract unless it is reused.
3. Abstract is too short. Abstract should be rewritten to summarize the work; the abstract should
state briefly the purpose of the research, the principal results and major conclusions. An abstract
is often presented separately from the article, so it must be able to stand alone.

hors: We would like to thank the reviewers for their careful consideration. We have
e our best to address each concern directly and where appropriate within the
nuscript. We highlighted our responses in blue text below.

article can be accepted after the following minor revisions:
Please avoid first person terms such as 'we', 'our', etc. Rephrase those sentences with
person passive.
double-checked the author guidelines for RSOS and there is no specification for either
sive or active voice. The top three most cited RSOS papers all use active voice (e.g. use
person terms including “we”). We chose to write in active voice to make the manuscript
e concise and increase readability.
Experimental details for the methods can be briefed before providing the references simply.
E.g. page 4 - preparation & deployment of wristband; page 5 - extraction of wristband, SPE
extraction, GC & MSD method parameters, AMDIS processes, etc. and page 7 - for more
QC details and results on specific projects.
thank the reviewer for this comment, and we added additional specifics throughout the
hods section (page 5 lines 166-173, 176-178, 184-187, 192-193, 195, 204-207; page 6 lines
-239). We describe every laboratory process alongside appropriate references. We also
ed a table to the supplemental material which includes the gas chromatography-mass
ctrometry parameters (now Table S1).
Details on blank wristbands (or the controls) is not clear and sufficient. Should explain how
this is maintained and compared with actual wristbands under exposures.
appreciate this comment. While this paper is not a review of quality control results from all
iously published studies, we edited and added additional details pertaining to blank
tbands within the section titled “Quality Control Summary” on page 6 (lines 231-239). We
relocated information pertaining to blank wristbands from the wristband conditioning
ess under the “Preparation & Deployment” section to make this clearer.
For such wider spectrum of chemicals what were the internal standards employed for GC-
MS technique? Based on which USEPA method (or other equivalent) the analytical
procedures were established?
thank the reader for the opportunity to clarify. There is no EPA method or equivalent with
00 organic chemicals. This novel method is reported in Bergmann et al. 2018 and is based
ponse to Referees [RSOS-181836.R1]
target screening method. Target screening methods are frequently performed with GC or
d chromatography. With target screening, the full scan ion profile is captured and
onvolution software is used to extract specific signals from complex chromatograms. For this
k, we used the Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification System (AMDIS,
the National Institute of Standards and Technology) paired with commercially available
onvolution reporting software from Agilent (page 5, lines 194-197). The method is retention
locked to an internal standard, chloropyrifos (page 5, line 194), and additional internal
dards are not needed for this presence-absence method. We use calibration verifications
s) to monitor instrument conditions (page 6, lines 223-227), which include standards that
n the range of physical chemical properties in the method. For the quantification version of
method (separate from this manuscript and fully described in Bergmann et al. 2018),
itional standards and chemometrics are used to predict instrument response. For the
ence-absence target screen in this manuscript, it is suitable to present target screen
ware (page 5), chemical libraries (page 5), CV data quality objectives (page 6), and GC-MS
rating parameters (now added as Table S1 in response to comments).
How the LODs and LOQs were determined and, should provide those details in
supplementary data.
gmann et al. used a standard average response variation method to estimate instrument
Qs for all chemicals in the method. LOQs range from 40 to 500 pg/uL depending on the
mical (page 5, lines 201-203; Bergmann et al. 2018). Because LOQs are reported in a
iously published manuscript for all 1,530 chemicals and we are presenting presence-
ence data, it is appropriate to present the range of the LOQs for this method and reference
original manuscript. The data quality objectives we used to evaluate the presence/absence
chemical protects against false positives and we have now added this to the manuscript
ge 5, lines 204-205).
Why the variation for the number of volunteers and number of wristbands?
was an exploratory, retrospective study (page 4, lines 149-150; page 12, line 558) so the
ber of volunteers and number of wristbands was opportunistic and based on existing
tband projects. These projects had different funding sources, collaborators, and original
y questions – resulting in variation in the number of volunteers and number of wristbands
geographic community. We discuss the limitation of a convenience sample of volunteers on
e 12, lines 548-553. However, this is the “first exploration of organic chemical exposures
cted by wristbands across diverse communities, helping inform future research priorities”
ge 12).
While conducting this study were the communities asked to adhere to their routine tasks as
usual including the application of cosmetics, toiletries, washing/cleaning chemicals, etc?
How it has been practiced and what was the time period?
articipants were asked to maintain their normal daily activities and not change their
avior for the study. We added this information to page 4 (lines 154-155). Study time period
other community specifics are located in Table 1 and supplemental data set.
ny variation observed depending on the work/job sites of the studied persons?
vious wristbands have reported chemical exposure variation in relation to work/job sites
rgmann et al. 2017, O’Connell et al. 2014). However, we did not include work/job variables in
ponse to Referees [RSOS-181836.R1]
manuscript because we did not have information on these variables for a majority of
tbands.

work reported in this manuscript is interesting. However, it needs revisions and
rovements before the acceptance. Some comments are:
Title should be revised to be precise and reflecting the contents;
agree the title should be a short description of the research and we include words to help
ers discover this paper. After considering both reviewers’ comments, we decided to keep
title as is (Discovery of common chemical exposures across three continents using silicone
tbands).
No need to mention the abbreviation in the abstract unless it is reused.
only abbreviation in the abstract is “U.S.”, which we have now changed to “United States”
ne 45. This abbreviation is reused in the abstract.
Abstract is too short. Abstract should be rewritten to summarize the work; the abstract
should state briefly the purpose of the research, the principal results and major
conclusions. An abstract is often presented separately from the article, so it must be able
to stand alone.
agree the abstract should be standalone. We summarize the purpose, results, and major
clusions within the abstract. Per RSOS guidelines, the abstract must be concise and under
words, and we were at 198 words upon submission. We did add to the word count to
ress comment 2 and comment 4.
In the abstract; “highest mean number of chemical detections.…..” pls add quantitative
data
thank the reviewer for this comment and added in quantitative results to this sentence.
Define the terms and abbreviations when used.

The introduction should be clarified in term of uniqueness and advantage what is the
novelty of this work over the previous related work. There are many long sentences should

thank the reviewer for this comment. Within the introduction, we highlight the novelty of this
k by describing wristbands as an “unprecedented measurement platform”, the need for
ple personal monitoring methods”, and the generation of data to “inform future toxicology
epidemiology research.” We made edits to the sentence structure where applicable.
