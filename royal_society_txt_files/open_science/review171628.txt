A numerical approach is proposed to simulate the dynamics of elastic filaments. Shearing and
stretching modes are included and applications to locomotion involving specific external forces
are presented.
Simulations of filaments that can shear and stretch is by no means new. Peskin and Lim proposed
a numerical scheme that does exactly this (Lim Phys. Fluids 2010, Lim SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 31
2008) and is now used in a number papers on viscous fluid-structure interaction, see for example
the work of S. Olson. Simulating shearing and stretching is not particularly challenging either: the
constrained case (inextensible/unshearable) addressed in previous work is actually much more
difficult than the unconstrained case addressed in this paper. The authors should clearly state in
their manuscript that the shearable/extensible case that they address is numerically easier than
the unshearable/inextensible case treated in the literature.
The shearable/extensible extension of beam model is presented as the main contribution of the
paper but it is very limited both in terms of scope and accuracy. As noted by the authors, the
usual unshearable/inextensible model is applicable to most situations. The analysis of the
plectoneme/solenoid transition found in the paper is the only example that makes use of
shearability/extensibility, and this example is very specific, and treated in a crude way: for
quantitive predictions a 3d model would be required. A honest and thorough discussion of the
limitations of the Cosserat model is missing.
The discussion of the linear constitutive laws is very confusing. If the authors are trying to take
into account a finite axial stretching e, then the strain are finite and linear constitutive relations
are irrelevant. If instead e is close to 1, then there is no point rescaling everything as in equation
2.10.
Overall, I find the applications unimpressive. There is no real numerical challenge in the 2d
slithering problem. Swimming in low-Reynolds number fluids has already been treated at length
in the literature and with more refined fluid models.
The manuscript does not read well at all and I find its organization is loose. To give just one
example, the equations of motion are discretized in a seemingly arbitrary way; later on, it is
asserted that the discrete model is conservative (page 9 line 37) but without any proof or
indication why this should be true. An appendix is referred to in several places but is not
included. The discussion of the existing literature is highly insufficient for a numerical paper,
especially in view of the long literature on the simulation of elastic rods.
To sum up, I am having difficulties identifying any strong contribution in this manuscript. The
numerical model is similar to that of Peskin. The examples are really not impressive. I
recommend rejection.

This manuscript presents a numerical method for handling the general inertial dynamics of
elastic filamentary objects in the presence of external forces, such as fluid drag, self-repulsion,
and active internal forces. There are a large number of biological and engineering systems that
require analysis of these types of systems, and numerical algorithms are not generally available to
handle these systems, especially in the broad context in which this method is developed.
Therefore, I am supportive of publication. However, I do think that there are a few points that
need to be addressed.
1. While there are not many widely available methods for handling these types of problems,
there are methods that have been crudely described in the literature. For example, my own work
has developed a finite difference method spatial discretization routine that uses a semi-implicit
Crank-Nicolson time stepping to handle inextensible, overdamped filaments in viscous fluids.
(We have also recently augmented this to a finite volume scheme that is better because it
guarantees that the total force and torque on a self-propelled swimmer are identically zero). The
method proposed here is definitely more general than the other methods that I am familiar with;
however, what I am wondering is how efficient this algorithm is. Is it fairly typical for
manuscripts on numerical algorithms to provide information on the computational cost as a
function of grid spacing. How long do the simulations described here take to run on whatever
system they were computed on?
2. Similar to above, how stable is the algorithm? Can the authors derive or estimate CFL
conditions for the algorithm in at least some characteristic cases (e.g., purely inertial,
overdamped, etc.).

Summary
This manuscript focuses on developing a robust method to simulate the dynamics of elastic
filaments. The method is able to handle different scenarios with ease. The method is detailed and
several test cases are given. Note that I am reading this as a new reviewer after revisions have
already been made.
Overall, I do agree with Reviewer 2 that there are many applications where this method can be
used and since it is able to handle a large class of problems, it is worthy of publication.
On the other hand, I do not think the authors did a `complete’ job in answering reviewer 1. I do
agree with the reviewers that the method that Lim & Peskin first developed is to solve a different
subclass of problems. However, the authors have sold that method short and did not properly
cite all of the work. The authors take a line from the 2008 paper and say that it is only first order.
This is true for the initial method, but if the authors had looked a bit further, there was a
publication a few years later demonstrating that of this method can be made formally second
order accurate. Thus, only first order convergence is not a limitation of this other model since it
can be done with second order accuracy. Additionally, the 2008 paper cited by the authors did
not account for self contact. But, if the authors again had looked at newer publications by Lim &
Peskin, a fairly simple repulsive term was used in a very similar way to the current study. Thus,
in some ways I do agree with the first reviewer in that the way that the self-repulsion, active
internal forces, and fluid drag are handled is not new or novel in any way. I also agree with
Reviewer 1 in that many of the applications did not provide any new insight other than that one
could use this model to simulate these phenomena. I did find the inverse problem as the most
interesting and promising.
I do agree with Reviewer 2 and the authors rebuttal in that the major novelty is the ability to
account for stretching and shearing beyond a small numerical deviation as in the Lim and Peskin
approach. However, in the technical detail of this manuscript and the many examples, somehow
this point gets a bit lost.
Comments:
o I believe the discussion could be made a bit more clear and put this modeling framework
in a better context. A paragraph in the discussion that points out again why one would choose
this method for a particular application is of the utmost importance. It is also necessary for the
authors to point interested readers to alternate methods based on what the modeler is interested
in. As pointed out above, these take home points are totally lost in the technicalities and all of the
examples. If a short paragraph that then made clear one chooses this type of approach if
interested in the context of applications where stretching and shearing beyond a small threshold
were of interest. If one was not concerned with larger stretching and shearing and wanted an
accurate fluid solver (instead of RFT approximation), then the Lim & Peskin approach (with
newer added terms over the years) might be a better approach that again can handle self contact
8
etc. Again, other numerical approaches should be cited and this should be a fair summary of
when/why you would use this approach.
Minor comments:
* On p.5 after 2.2 towards end of the paragraph, there was a missing parentheses after Fig. 1
* Something is not right with the first sentence in the paragraph containing Eq 2.8. (We assume vs
“Assuming”?)
* Appendix: On p. 4 above Eq A1, the reference # is missing

This paper presents a discrete Cosserat rod model and a large number of applications to that
model. While I enjoyed reading this paper, I have a major complaint : the authors do not compare
their simulator to existing Cosserat simulators. In the introduction, it is claimed that previous
simulators were specific to Kirchhoff rod models, but this is wrong. For instance, CORDE
(Spillman et al.) was an implementation of a discrete Cosserat model, allowing for
streching/shearing/bending/twisting. Other authors have worked on Cosserat discrete models,
but are omitted here: Joachim Linn (see, e.g., Discrete kinematics of Cosserat rods based on the
difference geometry of framed curves) and Olivier Brüls (see, e.g., Geometrically exact beam
finite element formulated on the special Euclidean group), using similar formalisms. These
references should absolutely be commented on and compared against. Other reference missing :
Bertails et al., Super-helices for predicting the dynamics of natural hair (another discrete
Kirchhoff rod model). Likewise, there has been mutlipled approaches to couple thin elastic rods
to frictional contact, see e.g. Daviet et al, A Hybrid Iterative Solver for Robustly Capturing
Coulomb Friction in Hair Dynamics, and Durville, Numerical simulation of entangled materials
mechanical properties. Some discussion/comparisons would be needed there.
That said, I appreciated the variety and scope of applications proposed, based on the developed
discrete model. I think this is the main strength of the paper. I particularly like the
plectonema/coiled formation comparison, since this is a nice case where simulating
stretching+bending really makes a difference. So far, papers I saw on discrete Cosserat rod
models failed to convince me that stretching was really needed, since their scenarios would not
involve any stretching deformation. In this paper, for the first time this is made (impressively)
clear.
In conclusion, this paper is interesting and well-written, but fails to compare its approach to
others. Since I believe the strength of the paper is not really the proposed numerical model itself
(or, this should be proven by the authors by making fair comparisons with alternatives; showing
that their model can handle scenarios that other could not handle), I'm still suggesting acceptance
with major recommendation, so that the authors can better place the emphasis on their
applications, and fairly acknowledge prior art.

The authors have appropriately cited the references I've pointed to them. However, the focus of
the paper is still maintained on "selling" a new numerical model, as a model which would
outperforms others. I'm still not convinced about it. I believe previous art (work by Spillman,
Bergou, Linn) is discarded much too quickly. What's the key ingredient that your model has and
that others do not? At this point, I'm really not sure previous models would not be allowed to
tackle the scenarios developed here. I've seen in the past some impressive simulations made by J.
Linn, where cables can bend, twist, strech, shear (not infinitesimally), be in contact with other
objects, all at interactive rates, and in a very robust manner. I believe this could be a serious
competitor (and there are probably others), and I would like to see fair comparisons of the codes
to be convinced of the novelty of the model. Moreover, all other add-ons (contact and friction
handlings, etc.), are classical, and even sometimes below current state-of-the-art (nonsmooth
methods are now used for treating Signorini-Coulomb constraints implicitly, see e.g. Daviet et al.
2011).
That said, if the numerical model proposed here was not really new nor better than previous
approaches, this would not be killing the paper : as I said before, the true strength and richness of
the paper is to conduct many interesting experiments where very good agreement is shown
between the model and the experiement. No one has done that thorough and extensive validation
work in the past, and I believe that's a good contribution that would justify publication per se.
However, the paper would have to be fully oriented towards these applications, thus reducing
the importance of the numerical model developed (still it would be interesting to have its full
description in the main text or in appendix, for the sake of completeness and reproducibility).
Currently, the abstract clearly makes the focus on the numerical model, not on this validation
work, so this would have to be reworked too.
For me, the two options are good:
- either prove the novelty and gain brought by your numerical model, by making proper
evaluation and fair comparisons against previous relevant methods (meaning perhaps some
reimplementing of previous methods, if code is not readily available)
- or focus on the applications, reducing the weight on the novelty of the code.
I'd like to see a revision implementing successfully one of these two options.
To me, this is the only way that this paper advances the state of the art in a fair and useful way
for the scientific community.

Appendix A
Response to reviewer’s comments:
We thank the reviewers for their valuable time and consideration. In the
following, the comments of the reviewers are listed followed by our responses.
We hope that the reviewers consider our answers acceptable and the
improved manuscript is suitable for publication.
Reviewer #1
Comments to the authors: A numerical approach is proposed to simulate
the dynamics of elastic filaments. Shearing and stretching modes are included
and applications to locomotion involving specific external forces are
presented.
1) Simulations of filaments that can shear and stretch is by no means new.
Peskin and Lim proposed a numerical scheme that does exactly this
(Lim Phys. Fluids 2010, Lim SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 31 2008) and is now
used in a number papers on viscous fluid-structure interaction, see for
example the work of S. Olson.
We acknowledge that some relevant references have been accidentally
omitted. To amend this we have included the references suggested by the
reviewer both in the introduction and in the section relative to swimming.
Nevertheless, we wish to emphasize that the main contribution of our paper
lies in providing a general purpose, practical numerical framework able to
account for a number of physical effects, from stretching and shearing to self-
contact, friction, muscular activity, hydrodynamics etc.
The articles mentioned by the reviewer describe a numerical methodology
which avoids mathematically enforcing unstretchability and unshearability and
instead postulates an energy function to approximate them, by allowing for
slight numerical deviations. Although ingenious, those articles do not actually
treat stretching and shearing, and are instead specialized to resolve one
physical problem related to an almost inextensible ribbon immersed in Stokes
flows – an important, but rather narrow class of problems relative to those we
treat, as emphasized by the second Reviewer #2.
We quote verbatim from Lim SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 31 2008: “we avoid these
constraints on the fluid velocity by allowing the rod to stretch and also by
allowing the orientation of the triad to deviate from alignment with the direction
of the space curve. Instead of imposing the above constraints exactly, we
postulate an elastic energy function which tends to maintain them. Thus, our
rod is allowed to stretch slightly, and our triad is allowed to deviate slightly
from the alignment with the tangent direction to the rod”, and “It is assumed
that the rod has a circular cross section with constant radius.” The latter
assumption can only be consistent with the unstretchable/unshearable case
(in the presence of stretching mass is not conserved if the radius is not
rescaled appropriately). If the papers referred to were to actually account for
stretching (beyond slight numerical deviations), they would inconsistent. In
contrast, in the Cosserat formulation considered in our manuscript, filaments
are actually allowed to stretch and shear beyond slight numerical deviations,
and therefore, for consistency, we rescale the cross-section radii as stretching
occurs.
Finally, the paper the reviewer highlights is limited from both numerical and
physical perspectives. From Lim SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 31 2008: “A limitation
of the proposed method, at least in its current form, is that it is only first order
accurate. This is shown by an empirical convergence study”. The paper also
neglects inertia, which is a fundamental aspect in many physical settings.
Again, quoting from the paper verbatim, the model equations (Lim SIAM J. Sci.
Comput. 31 2008) solved are:
where it is evident that the inertia term (left hand side) is missing. This is not
at all incorrect in the context of very viscous flows, but it is nonetheless a
limitation of the model the reviewer refers to.
Additionally, the paper mentioned does not consider friction, does not
consider contact and does not consider self-contact. See Fig 1 below from
Lim Phys. Fluids 2010:
As can be seen, the simulated ribbons (from Lim Phys. Fluids 2010) cross
each other and overlap in an unphysical fashion, limiting the capabilities of
those articles to address a vast class of problems, that instead our model can
handle.
In summary, we respectfully disagree here with the reviewer. In fact, the
articles which are claimed to have already explored the work that we
presented in our manuscript do not consider stretch and shear, do not
consider inertia, contact forces, are characterized by a lower convergence
order, and are restricted in the class of physical problems they address.
Finally, they only address the forward problem, i.e. they have not been proved
in an optimization procedure (inverse problem) which typically represents a
demanding stress test for any simulation algorithm, since the optimizer may
explore unusual parameter sets or conditions.
In contrast, we include the effects of inertia, stretch, shear, show second order
convergence, and tackle a broader range of physical applications rather than
a single one specialized to Stokes flow. Moreover, we pose and solve both
the forward and inverse design problems and introduce an optimization
approach that spans a large space of possible design parameters to show
that our solver can operate in unusual and unanticipated conditions, and
eventually lead to a biologically consistent solution.
Overall, we believe that Reviewer #1 does not acknowledge how general and
versatile our proposed framework is, and focuses on results from papers that
although very relevant to our study, are more limited in scope, as we just
highlighted.
This assessment is also in stark contrast with Reviewer #2 (Prof. Charles
Wolgemuth), who explicitly states: “There are a large number of biological and
engineering systems that require analysis of these types of systems, and
numerical algorithms are not generally available to handle these systems,
especially in the broad context in which this method is developed. Therefore,
I am supportive of publication” and “The method proposed here is definitely
more general than the other methods that I am familiar with”.
2) The constrained case (inextensible/unshearable) addressed in
previous work is actually much more difficult than the unconstrained
case addressed in this paper. The authors should clearly state in their
manuscript that the shearable/extensible case that they address is
numerically easier than the unshearable/inextensible case treated in
the literature.
We agree with the reviewer, and in fact we never made this claim. We are
simply discretizing and solving a different set of equations since our goal is to
provide a multi-purpose framework able to capture a host of physical aspects
among which are shearability and stretchability, friction, inertia etc.
As requested by the reviewer we have expanded the first paragraph of section
2b: “Since we wish to account for all six deformation modes associated with
the six degrees of freedom at each cross section along the rod, we must
augment the Kirchhoff description of the previous section and add three more
constitutive laws to define the local stress resultants n. In fact, they are no
longer defined as Lagrange multipliers that enforce the condition of
inextensibility and unshearability, i.e. we now must allow t ¹ d3. We note that
this not only enables the model of Eqs. (2.4-2.7) to capture a richer set of
physical phenomena, but also significantly simplifies its numerical treatment
(Lagrange multipliers no longer needed), rendering our proposed approach
both flexible and relatively straightforward to implement.”
3) The shearable/extensible extension of beam model is presented as the
main contribution of the paper but it is very limited both in terms of
scope and accuracy. As noted by the authors, the usual
unshearable/inextensible model is applicable to most situations. The
analysis of the plectoneme/solenoid transition found in the paper is the
only example that makes use of shearability/extensibility, and this
example is very specific, and treated in a crude way: for quantitive
predictions a 3d model would be required. A honest and thorough
discussion of the limitations of the Cosserat model is missing.
We respectfully disagree with the reviewer on this:
a) Indeed, we did show that our framework is able to tackle a host of physical
phenomena, and we rigorously show its accuracy in terms of convergence
and by comparison with known analytic solutions (see section 3d and
Appendix) and experimental data (Section 5).
b) The very specific application to solenoids and plectonemes is not, in our
opinion, an objective statement but rather a personal opinion, which is
contradicted by recent articles that explicitly leverage on these phenomena in
the context of soft robotics and artificial muscles (see Ray Baughman's group:
Harvesting electrical energy from carbon nanotube yarn twist. Science, 2017,
and Artificial muscles from fishing line and sewing thread. Science, 2014, and
New twist on artificial muscles, PNAS, 2016). Therefore, we consider this a
timely application with ramifications in several domains, from robotics to more
fundamental questions that relate topological changes to mechanical
responses.
c) The limitations of the Cosserat theory are implicit in its assumptions, which
we report in the very first sentence of the manuscript. The theory is valid for
structures characterized by lengths much larger than the other dimensions,
and to test its accuracy we perform a rigorous validation against a number of
benchmark problems (Section 3d and Appendix) and verification against
experimental data (Section 5). The use of a 3D model would represent yet
another validation, but in our opinion would not add much to the tests we
already carried out, as we can rely on either analytic solutions or directly
experimental data to assess the accuracy of our numerical schemes.
4) The discussion of the linear constitutive laws is very confusing. If the
authors are trying to take into account a finite axial stretching e, then
the strain are finite and linear constitutive relations are irrelevant. If
instead e is close to 1, then there is no point rescaling everything as in
equation 2.10.
We are unsure on the second part on the comment. If substantial axial strains
are considered, it is of paramount importance to appropriately rescale the
governing equations with respect to the rest reference configuration so as to
conserve mass, account for varying rod diameters and for computing internal
forces and torques. Section 2b of the manuscript is entirely dedicated to the
rescaling of the governing equations via the term “e” due to axial strain, and a
rigorous mathematical derivation of our final equations is described step by
step in the Appendix.
5) Overall, I find the applications unimpressive. There is no real numerical
challenge in the 2d slithering problem. Swimming in low-Reynolds
number fluids has already been treated at length in the literature and
with more refined fluid models.
It is not up to us to claim whether the presented application are impressive or
not. In the paper we argue why we believe they are relevant in the context of
soft robotics design or bio-physics. Our aim is to showcase the versatility and
robustness of our framework, and illustrate how this can be successfully
employed both in the case of forward and inverse problems.
Although the referee is obviously free to consider these demonstration
ineffective, we belive that such a statement should be further articulated,
supported by references or data. Indeed, the slithering simulations involving
anisotropic friction turned out to be the most challenging among all our study
cases. In fact, even though the friction model is simple, the slip and stick
behavior (static vs kinetic friction) together with the inertia of the rod model
render these simulations prone to noise, and only a careful implementation
can avoid spurious oscillations (see smooth curves for example in Fig 10).
Moreover, the reviewer assessment is also directly refuted by Reviewer #2
who states “There are a large number of biological and engineering systems
that require analysis of these types of systems, and numerical algorithms are
not generally available to handle these systems, especially in the broad
context in which this method is developed. Therefore, I am supportive of
publication” and “The method proposed here is definitely more general than
the other methods that I am familiar with”.
Finally, we wish to emphasize that the main point of these bio-locomotion
studies (slithering and swimming) is to showcase the versatility of our solver in
a bio-physical context, as well as its practical use and robustness in an
inverse design context. We now explicitly state this in the first paragraph of
Section 5: “We emphasize here that one of the main points of these bio-
locomotion studies, beside verifying the versatility and prediction capabilities
of our solver in bio-physical settings, is to demonstrate its practical use in an
inverse (optimization) design process, which typically represents a demanding
stress test for any simulation algorithm, as unusual parameter sets or
conditions are explored.” Our optimal solutions are then compared with
experimental data, showing how our approach captures observed animal
behavior, verifying the prediction capabilities of our framework in a bio-
physical context.
6) The manuscript does not read well at all and I find its organization is
loose. To give just one example, the equations of motion are
discretized in a seemingly arbitrary way; later on, it is asserted that the
discrete model is conservative (page 9 line 37) but without any proof or
indication why this should be true.
We respectfully disagree with the reviewer on this. The spatial discretization
presented here is not arbitrary, our continuum equations are discretized by
applying standard discrete operators and closely follows the approach
presented in M. Bergou, M. Wardetzky, S. Robinson, B. Audoly, and E.
Grinspun. Discrete elastic rods. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG),
27(3):1–12, 2008. We directly reference to this paper in our discretization
section. Nevertheless, all mathematical derivations are reported either in the
main text or in the Appendix.
Finally, in our case (Hamiltonian system of mass particles) conservation of
energy depends on the time discretization: we employ a standard symplectic
time stepper which conserves energy by design, and we numerically show
that indeed energy is conserved in Fig 3d. We tried to clarify this point by
expanding the first paragraph of Section 3c: “If no additional physical effects
are introduced, for example via the external forces Fi and couples CiL, the
above discrete Hamiltonian system must be advanced via a conservative time
integrator to preserve energy. To this end, we choose a symplectic, second-
order Verlet scheme, so that our complete numerical scheme is energy-
preserving in the case of conservative dynamics. We note that despite the
failure of Verlet schemes to integrate rotational equations of motion when
represented by quaternions, in our case their use is justified as rotations are
represented instead by Euler angles [40].”
Reviewer #2
Comments to the authors: This manuscript presents a numerical method for
handling the general inertial dynamics of elastic filamentary objects in the
presence of external forces, such as fluid drag, self-repulsion, and active
internal forces. There are a large number of biological and engineering
systems that require analysis of these types of systems, and numerical
algorithms are not generally available to handle these systems, especially in
the broad context in which this method is developed. Therefore, I am
supportive of publication. However, I do think that there are a few points that
need to be addressed.
We wish to thank the reviewer for his time and the generally positive
disposition towards this paper. We very much appreciate the effort and
precise comments which have helped us to improve the content of this paper.
1) While there are not many widely available methods for handling these
types of problems, there are methods that have been crudely described
in the literature. For example, my own work has developed a finite
difference method spatial discretization routine that uses a semi-implicit
Crank-Nicolson time stepping to handle inextensible, overdamped
filaments in viscous fluids. (We have also recently augmented this to a
finite volume scheme that is better because it guarantees that the total
force and torque on a self-propelled swimmer are identically zero). The
method proposed here is definitely more general than the other
methods that I am familiar with; however, what I am wondering is how
efficient this algorithm is. Is it fairly typical for manuscripts on
numerical algorithms to provide information on the computational cost
as a function of grid spacing. How long do the simulations described
here take to run on whatever system they were computed on?
2) Similar to above, how stable is the algorithm? Can the authors derive
or estimate CFL conditions for the algorithm in at least some
characteristic cases (e.g., purely inertial, overdamped, etc.).
We wish to thank the reviewer for highlighting these points. We now
expanded Section 3c (relative to the time discretization) to address the
comment relative to the choice of an explicit time integration scheme as well
as the potential derivation of a CFL condition: “This algorithm strikes a
balance between computing costs, numerical accuracy and implementation
modularity: by foregoing an implicit integration scheme we can incorporate a
number of additional physical effects and soft constraints, even though this
may come at the expense of computational efficiency. Indeed, for large
Young’s or shear moduli or for very thin rods, the system of Eqs. (2.4-2.7)
might become stiff, so that small timesteps must be employed to ensure
stability. Although we have not derived a rigorous CFL condition, throughout
this work we employed the empirical relation dt = a*dl, with a ~ 10e-2 s/m,
and found it reliable in preventing numerical instabilities. Despite the potential
stiffness of this model, since the computational cost per timestep scales
linearly with the number of discretization elements n (the model is one-
dimensional), we could carry out all our computation on a laptop (details and
representative timings are summarized in the Appendix). It is worth to note
that because of the condition dt = a*dl, a smaller number of elements implies
larger timesteps (dl = L/n). Therefore, the time-to-solution may scale between
linearly and quadratically, depending on how the timestep is set.”
Moreover, as suggested by the reviewer we now report representative timings
relative to our studycases, for different level of resolutions. They are
summarized in the last section of the Appendix, and we report here a table for
the reviewer’s convenience.
Despite the potential stiffness of this model, since the computational cost per
timestep scales linearly with the number of discretization elements n, we
could carry out all our computation on a single processor on a MacBook Pro
equipped with a 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz,
with 64MB of eDRAM. Because of the condition dt = a*dl, a smaller number of
elements implies larger timesteps (dl = L/n). Therefore, as highlighte before,
the time-to-solution may scale between linearly and quadratically, depending
on how the timestep is set. This can be noted by inspecting the Euler and
helical buckling studies reported in the table below. In the Euler buckling
simulations the timestep is set to be the same for both case 1 and case 2, and
indeed by halving n, the time-to-solution and the time per timestep reduce by
a factor of 2. In the helical buckling study instead, the timstep was adaptively
selected according to dt = a*dl, so that, when n is halved, the time-to-solution
reduces by a factor of 4, while the time per timestep reduces by a factor of 2.

om alignment with the direction of the space curve. Instead of
posing the above constraints exactly, we postulate an elastic
nergy function which tends to maintain them. Thus, our rod is
lowed to stretch slightly, and our triad is allowed to deviate
ightly from the alignment with the tangent direction to the rod”,
nd “It is assumed that the rod has a circular cross section with
onstant radius.” The latter assumption can only be consistent
ith the unstretchable/unshearable case (in the presence of
retching mass is not conserved if the radius is not rescaled
ppropriately). If the papers referred to were to actually account
r stretching (beyond slight numerical deviations), they would
consistent. In contrast, in the Cosserat formulation considered in
ur manuscript, filaments are actually allowed to stretch and
hear beyond slight numerical deviations, and therefore, for
onsistency, we rescale the cross-section radii as stretching
ccurs.
nally, the paper the reviewer highlights is limited from both
umerical and physical perspectives. From Lim SIAM J. Sci.
omput. 31 2008: “A limitation of the proposed method, at least in
s current form, is that it is only first order Again, quoting from the
aper verbatim, the model equations (Lim SIAM J. Sci. Comput.
1 2008: “A limitation of the proposed method, at least in its
urrent form, is that it is only first order accurate. This is shown by
n empirical convergence study”. The paper also neglects inertia,
hich is a fundamental aspect in many physical settings. Again,
uoting from the paper verbatim, the model equations (Lim SIAM
Sci. Comput. 31 2008) solved are:
here it is evident that the inertia term (left hand side) is missing.
his is not at all incorrect in the context of very viscous flows, but
is nonetheless a limitation of the model the reviewer refers to.
dditionally, the paper mentioned does not consider friction, does
ot consider contact and does not consider self-contact. See Fig
below from Lim Phys. Fluids 2010:
s can be seen, the simulated ribbons (from Lim Phys. Fluids
010) cross each other and overlap in an unphysical fashion,
miting the capabilities of those articles to address a vast class of
oblems, that instead our model can handle.
summary, we respectfully disagree here with the reviewer. In
ct, the articles which are claimed to have already explored the
ork that we consider inertia, contact forces, are characterized by
lower convergence order, and are restricted in the class of
hysical problems they address. Finally, they only address the
rward problem, i.e. they have not been proved in an
ptimization procedure (inverse problem) which typically
presents a demanding stress test for any simulation algorithm,
nce the optimizer may explore unusual parameter sets or
onditions.
contrast, we include the effects of inertia, stretch, shear, show
econd order convergence, and tackle a broader range of
hysical applications rather than a single one specialized to
tokes flow. Moreover, we pose and solve both the forward and
verse design problems and introduce an optimization approach
at spans a large space of possible design parameters to show
at our solver can operate in unusual and unanticipated
onditions, and eventually lead to a biologically consistent
olution.
verall, we believe that Reviewer #1 does not acknowledge how
eneral and versatile our proposed framework is, and focuses on
sults from papers that although very relevant to our study, are
ore limited in scope, as we just highlighted.
his assessment is also in stark contrast with Reviewer #2 (Prof.
harles Wolgemuth), who explicitly states: “There are a large
umber of biological and engineering systems that require
nalysis of these types of systems, and numerical algorithms are
ot generally available to handle these systems, especially in the
oad context in which this method is developed. Therefore, I am
upportive of publication” and “The method proposed here is
efinitely more general than the other methods that I am familiar
ith”.
esponse from reviewer
he authors are essentially arguing here that they achieved a
nique combination of ingredients in their model: their answer
oes along ‘X did not include effect A, Y did not include effect B,
c’. I am not objecting this. What I am saying is that they
ollected ingredients here and there and that this was neither
articularly difficult nor led to particularly impressive applications. I
nderstand Lim et al did not include inertia, focussed on a
articular geometry and did not treat self-contact but they do have
hear and extension like many others have (in fact your reference
2 for instance does this, although the way you cite it makes it
possible to guess). Similarly, Bergou et al did not consider
hear but they do have both extensible and non-extensible
ehavior, as well as inertia and self-contact. On top of this, the
uthors of the manuscript added an extra layer of ingredients
ptimization, friction) but I see no strong contribution here either.
The constrained case (inextensible/unshearable) addressed in
evious work is actually much more difficult than the
nconstrained case addressed in this paper. The authors should
early state in their manuscript that the shearable/extensible case
at they address is numerically easier than the unshearable/
extensible case treated in the literature.
e agree with the reviewer, and in fact we never made this claim.
e are simply discretizing and solving a different set of equations
nce our goal is to provide a multi-purpose framework able to
apture a host of physical aspects among which are shearability
nd stretchability, friction, inertia etc.
s requested by the reviewer we have expanded the first
aragraph of section 2b: “Since we wish to account for all six
eformation modes associated with the six degrees of freedom at
ach cross section along the rod, we must augment the Kirchhoff
escription of the previous section and add three more
onstitutive laws to define the local stress resultants n. In fact,
ey are no longer defined as Lagrange multipliers that enforce
e condition of inextensibility and unshearability, i.e. we now
ust allow t 1 d3. We note that this not only enables the model of
qs. (2.4-2.7) to capture a richer set of physical phenomena, but
so significantly simplifies its numerical treatment (Lagrange
ultipliers no longer needed), rendering our proposed approach
oth flexible and relatively straightforward to implement.”
The shearable/extensible extension of beam model is
esented as the main contribution of the paper but it is very
mited both in terms of scope and accuracy. As noted by the
uthors, the usual unshearable/inextensible model is applicable to
ost situations. The analysis of the plectoneme/solenoid
ansition found in the paper is the only example that makes use
shearability/extensibility, and this example is very specific, and
eated in a crude way: for quantitive predictions a 3d model
ould be required. A honest and thorough discussion of the
mitations of the Cosserat model is missing.
e respectfully disagree with the reviewer on this:
Indeed, we did show that our framework is able to tackle a host
physical phenomena, and we rigorously show its accuracy in
rms of convergence and by comparison with known analytic
olutions (see section 3d and Appendix) and experimental data
ection 5).
The very specific application to solenoids and plectonemes is
ot, in our opinion, an objective statement but rather a personal
pinion, which is the context of soft robotics and artificial muscles
ee Ray Baughman's group: Harvesting electrical energy from
arbon nanotube yarn twist. Science, 2017, and Artificial muscles
om fishing line and sewing thread. Science, 2014, and New twist
n artificial muscles, PNAS, 2016). Therefore, we consider this a
mely application with ramifications in several domains, from
botics to more fundamental questions that relate topological
hanges to mechanical responses.
The limitations of the Cosserat theory are implicit in its
ssumptions, which we report in the very first sentence of the
anuscript. The theory is valid for structures characterized by
ngths much larger than the other dimensions, and to test its
ccuracy we perform a rigorous validation against a number of
xperimental data (Section 5). The use of a 3D model would
present yet another validation, but in our opinion would not add
uch to the tests we already carried out, as we can rely on either
nalytic solutions or directly experimental data to assess the
ccuracy of our numerical schemes.
esponse from reviewer
eiterate that the plectononeme/solenoid example is the most
teresting contribution in this manuscript; this is the only
mulation example that cannot obviously be simulated using
xisting methods. Statement c) is incorrect, the Cosserat theory is
ot quantitatively accurate when applied to elastic cylinders
ndergoing finite strain even when their aspect ratio is small. For
oblems such as the solenoid where there is no separation of
cales the only quantitatively correct approach would be the three
m. finite-elasticity. Now, it is interesting that you can reproduce
e plectoneme/solenoid transition with this model but, again, no
ne should expect quantitative match with experiments or three
m simulations and you should make this very clear.
ind it very exaggerated to call your section 5 a rigorous
alidation against a number of experimental data.
he slithering problem is two dimensional, and makes no use of
tations in 3d, shearability nor extensibility. It mostly
sconnected from the core of the paper which is the formulation
the rod model.
ame remark for the swimming problem which does not use the
pecifics of this particular numerical rod model, and adds an extra
yer of optimization.
The discussion of the linear constitutive laws is very confusing.
the authors are trying to take into account a finite axial
retching e, then the strain are finite and linear constitutive
lations are irrelevant. If instead e is close to 1, then there is no
oint rescaling everything as in equation 2.10.
e are unsure on the second part on the comment. If substantial
xial strains are considered, it is of paramount importance to
ppropriately rescale the governing equations with respect to the
st reference configuration so as to conserve mass, account for
arying rod diameters and for computing internal forces and
rques. Section 2b of the manuscript is entirely dedicated to the
scaling of the governing equations via the term “e” due to axial
rain, and a rigorous mathematical derivation of our final
quations is described step by step in the Appendix.
esponse of the reviewer.
ne more time: how can you expect your linear constitutive laws
be valid if your material deforms in the non-linear range?
Overall, I find the applications unimpressive. There is no real
umerical challenge in the 2d slithering problem. Swimming in
w-Reynolds number fluids has already been treated at length in
e literature and with more refined fluid models.
is not up to us to claim whether the presented application are
pressive or not. In the paper we argue why we believe they are
levant in the context of soft robotics design or bio-physics. Our
m is to showcase the versatility and robustness of our
amework, and illustrate how this can be successfully employed
oth in the case of forward and inverse problems.
lthough the referee is obviously free to consider these
emonstration ineffective, we belive that such a statement should
e further articulated, supported by references or data. Indeed,
e slithering simulations involving anisotropic friction turned out
be the most challenging among all our study cases. In fact,
ven though the friction model is simple, the slip and stick
ehavior (static vs kinetic friction) together with the inertia of the
d model render these simulations prone to noise, and only a
areful implementation can avoid spurious oscillations (see
mooth curves for example in Fig 10). Moreover, the reviewer
ssessment is also directly refuted by Reviewer #2 who states
here are a large number of biological and engineering systems
at require analysis of these types of systems, and numerical
gorithms are not generally available to handle these systems,
specially in the broad context in which this method is developed.
herefore, I am supportive of publication” and “The method
oposed here is definitely more general than the other methods
at I am familiar with”.
nally, we wish to emphasize that the main point of these bio-
comotion studies (slithering and swimming) is to showcase the
ersatility of our solver in a bio-physical context, as well as its
actical use and robustness in an inverse design context. We
ow explicitly state this in the first paragraph of Section 5: “We
mphasize here that one of the main points of these bio-
comotion studies, beside verifying the versatility and prediction
apabilities of our solver in bio-physical settings, is to
emonstrate its practical use in an inverse (optimization) design
ocess, which typically represents a demanding stress test for
ny simulation algorithm, as unusual parameter sets or conditions
e explored.” Our optimal solutions are then compared with
xperimental data, showing how our approach captures observed
nimal behavior, verifying the prediction capabilities of our
amework in a bio- physical context.
The manuscript does not read well at all and I find its
ganization is loose. To give just one example, the equations of
otion are discretized in a seemingly arbitrary way; later on, it is
sserted that the discrete model is conservative (page 9 line 37)
ut without any proof or indication why this should be true.
e respectfully disagree with the reviewer on this. The spatial
scretization presented here is not arbitrary, our continuum
quations are discretized by applying standard discrete operators
nd closely follows the approach presented in M. Bergou, M.
ardetzky, S. Robinson, B. Audoly, and E. Grinspun. Discrete
astic rods. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 27(3):1–12,
008. We directly reference to this paper in our discretization
ection. Nevertheless, all mathematical derivations are reported
ther in the main text or in the Appendix.
nally, in our case (Hamiltonian system of mass particles)
onservation of energy depends on the time discretization: we
mploy a standard symplectic time stepper which conserves
nergy by design, and we numerically show that indeed energy is
onserved in Fig 3d. We tried to clarify this point by expanding the
st paragraph of Section 3c: “If no additional physical effects are
troduced, for example via the external forces Fi and couples
iL, the above discrete Hamiltonian system must be advanced via
conservative time integrator to preserve energy. To this end, we
hoose a symplectic, second- order Verlet scheme, so that our
omplete numerical scheme is energy- preserving in the case of
onservative dynamics. We note that despite the failure of Verlet
chemes to integrate rotational equations of motion when
presented by quaternions, in our case their use is justified as
tations are represented instead by Euler angles [40].”
esponse of the reviewer.
ow can you claim that your system is conservative/Hamiltonian if
ou don’t even provide the expression of its energy? Again, your
screte equations of motion should derive from some discrete
nergy/Hamiltonian, which I don’t see in you manuscript. I am
peaking of space discretization, not even time discretization.
Appendix C
Review of Computational mechanics of soft filaments by M. Gazzola et al.
I did not review this manuscript the first time around, and the authors
have done a careful job responding to the earlier referees, so I will confine
myself to a few remarks. The authors propose a new numerical algorithm
for modeling the mechanics of thin soft elastic filaments. Unlike previous
approaches to the problem, the filaments are allowed to deform by shear and
stretching in addition to the usual bending and twisting modes. The numer-
ical algorithm is based on a discrete (rather than continuous) representation
of the filament. The authors carefully validate their basic model against
known analytical solutions. They then extend the model by adding additional
physical effects, including dissipation (viscosity), internal (muscular) activ-
ity, self-contact, contact with solid boundaries, surface friction, and slender-
body hydrodynamics. Finally, the authors illustrate three applications of
their new formalism: plectonemes and solenoids (which involve self-contact,
bending, and twist), self-propulsion by slithering, and low Reynolds-number
swimming.
Having gone carefully through the authors’ responses to the comments of
the referees, I think that the manuscript is now publishable.

We thank the reviewer for the positive assessment. We also realized that our
manuscript would benefit from the inclusion of references from the reviewer
himself, in order to better contextualize previous works that employed Cosserat
models for the investigation of viscous threads. We now included in the
introduction the references to:

Reviewer #3
Summary:
This manuscript focuses on developing a robust method to simulate the
dynamics of elastic filaments. The method is able to handle different scenarios
with ease. The method is detailed and several test cases are given. Note that I
am reading this as a new reviewer after revisions have already been made.
Overall, I do agree with Reviewer 2 that there are many applications where this
method can be used and since it is able to handle a large class of problems, it
is worthy of publication.
On the other hand, I do not think the authors did a `complete’ job in answering
reviewer 1. I do agree with the reviewers that the method that Lim & Peskin first
developed is to solve a different subclass of problems. However, the authors
have sold that method short and did not properly cite all of the work. The
authors take a line from the 2008 paper and say that it is only first order. This
is true for the initial method, but if the authors had looked a bit further, there
was a publication a few years later demonstrating that of this method can be
made formally second order accurate. Thus, only first order convergence is not
a limitation of this other model since it can be done with second order accuracy.
Additionally, the 2008 paper cited by the authors did not account for self contact.
But, if the authors again had looked at newer publications by Lim & Peskin, a
fairly simple repulsive term was used in a very similar way to the current study.
Thus, in some ways I do agree with the first reviewer in that the way that the
self-repulsion, active internal forces, and fluid drag are handled is not new or
novel in any way. I also agree with Reviewer 1 in that many of the applications
did not provide any new insight other than that one could use this model to
simulate these phenomena. I did find the inverse problem as the most
interesting and promising.
I do agree with Reviewer 2 and the authors rebuttal in that the major novelty is
the ability to account for stretching and shearing beyond a small numerical
deviation as in the Lim and Peskin approach. However, in the technical detail
of this manuscript and the many examples, somehow this point gets a bit lost.
Comments:
I believe the discussion could be made a bit more clear and put this modeling
framework in a better context. A paragraph in the discussion that points out
again why one would choose this method for a particular application is of the
utmost importance. It is also necessary for the authors to point interested
readers to alternate methods based on what the modeler is interested in. As
pointed out above, these take home points are totally lost in the technicalities
and all of the examples. If a short paragraph that then made clear one chooses
this type of approach if interested in the context of applications where
stretching and shearing beyond a small threshold were of interest. If one was
not concerned with larger stretching and shearing and wanted an accurate fluid
solver (instead of RFT approximation), then the Lim & Peskin approach (with
newer added terms over the years) might be a better approach that again can
handle self contact etc. Again, other numerical approaches should be cited and
this should be a fair summary of when/why you would use this approach.
3
We thank the reviewer for her/his overall positive assessment. We agree with
the reviewer on the need to better position our work with respect to previous
works, to emphasize the application aspect of this study, and to highlight where
and when our framework is advantageous over other methods, and vice-versa.
To this end we added three recent references from Lim and Peskin (Griffith,
Lim, Communications in Computational Physics, 2012; Lim, Peskin, Physical
Review E, 2012; Ko et al, Physical Review E, 2017) to acknowledge the
improved convergence accuracy of their flow solver, and the inclusion of a self-
contact model in publications following up their SIAM, 2008 study.
We now refer to these and the previous references in the introduction, and in
the section related to hydrodynamic coupling (page 20). There we added the
sentence “For more advanced and accurate viscous flow models we refer the
reader to [Lim&Peskin publications]”, so that the reader, if interested in forward
problems that do not entail significant stretching and shear, may find a more
suitable approach.
In the introduction, the references are reported in a more general paragraph
that aims at better positioning our work with respect to previous studies across
a broad range of applications (among which fluid-mechanic interaction of elastic
filaments and ribbons). Overall, the introduction has been substantially
reworded to:
• Better position our work with respect to previous studies
• Place more emphasis on applications and on the multi-physics
capabilities of our solver (especially targeting soft-robotics), rather than
on the numerics itself
• Highlight the importance of including stretch and shear via a clear
example related to plectonemes and solenoids formation
• Emphasize the importance and the need of realistic solvers that are
robust enough to be employed in inverse design processes, an emerging
paradigm to aid the design of robotic prototypes as well as to
characterize from an optimal standpoint bio-physical phenomena.
The core three new paragraphs now read:
These mathematical foundations [5] prompted a number of discrete
computational models [12–16] that allow for the exploration of a range of
physical phenomena. These include, for example, the study of polymers and
DNA [12,17], elastic ribbons and filaments [14,18,19], botanical applications
[20,21], woven cloth [22] and tangled hair and fibers [19,23–25]. Because the
scaled ratio of the stretching and shearing stiffness to the bending stiffness for
slender filaments is L2/r2 » 1, the assumption of inextensibility and/or
unshearability is usually appropriate, justifying the widespread use of the
Kirchhoff model in the aforementioned applications.
Fewer studies have considered, in different flavors, the Cosserat model, mostly
to take advantage of relaxed extension and shearing constraints to simplify
numerical implementations and to facilitate the integration of additional physical
4
effects. For example, specialized models including extension and constitutive
laws based on strain rates have been developed for the investigation of viscous
threads [15,16,26–30]. Lim and Peskin allow for small numerical shear and
axial strain and couple their model with an accurate viscous flow solver to
investigate fluid-mechanic interactions of ribbons and flagella [31–36]. The
graphics software CORDE [13] implements a Cosserat-based fast solver for
the rendering of looping systems, accounts for (self) contact, operates in the
small extension regime and maintains the unshearability constraint,
showcasing a number of visually impressive and physically plausible scenarios.
Durville [25] introduced a fiber model specialized to efficiently resolve contact-
friction effects in entangled materials. Linn [37] explored an elegant theoretical
connection between Cosserat rods and differential geometry of framed curves,
and numerically tested it on the classic Euler’s Elastica and Kirchhoff’s helix
problems [38]. Finally, Sonneville [39] presents a geometrically exact finite
element formulation on the Euclidean group SE(3) and verifies it on test cases
that do not involve stretching nor environmental effects.
More recently, there has been a need to generalize the model to explain new
experimental phenomena such as the plectoneme-solenoid transition [40], that
has been used as the basis for artificial muscles [41–43]. Additional new
technologies such as soft robotics [44,45] are also generating applications for
highly stretchable and shearable elastomeric structures raising the need for
methods able to realistically handle these large strains together with a variety
of interface and environmental effects. Moreover, the capability to
computationally solve both forward [46–48] and inverse problems is emerging
as a crucial paradigm to aid the design of novel, more capable soft-robotic
prototypes [49,50], as well as to characterize from an optimality standpoint bio-
physical phenomena [51–56]. Motivated by these advancements and
challenges, we present a relatively simple, versatile and robust numerical
framework that complements and extends the scope of previous models,
enables inverse design processes and substantially broadens the spectrum of
potential engineering and bio-physical investigations. By taking full advantage
of the Cosserat formalism, and consistently with the full Euclidean group SE(3),
we allow for bend, twist, and significant shear and stretch [4], and demonstrate
the importance of the latter through an example inspired by artificial muscle
actuation [41,42] in which the transition between plectonemes and solenoids is
crucially enabled by axial extension. Then, moving beyond the passive
mechanics of individual filaments, we also account for the interaction between
filaments and complex environments with a number of additional biological and
physical features, including muscular activity, self-contact and contact with solid
boundaries, isotropic and anisotropic surface friction and viscous interaction
with a fluid. Therefore, these features (some of which already considered in
previous works as pointed our earlier) are now included and tested in a single
framework. Finally, and unlike previous works, we demonstrate the capabilities
and the robustness of our solver by embedding it in an inverse design cycle for
the identification of optimal terrestrial and aquatic limbless locomotion
strategies.
The same concepts are now recapped in the Conclusion section, where we
added the sentences:
5
“Particular emphasis is placed in realistically accounting for substantial axial
extensions and shear strains, targeting emerging soft robotic applications.”
and
“We emphasize that in general the solution of an inverse problem, in this case
achieved by coupling our method with evolutionary strategies, severely tests
the robustness of any solver, due to the (often unforeseen) variety of candidate
solutions produced throughout the process. This is an additional aspect that
sets our work apart from previous studies.”
We hope that this new version satisfactorily addresses the comments of the
reviewer and fairly summarizes previous/alternative approaches.
Minor comments:
On p.5 after 2.2 towards end of the paragraph, there was a missing parentheses
after Fig. 1
Something is not right with the first sentence in the paragraph containing Eq
2.8. (We assume vs “Assuming”?)
Appendix: On p. 4 above Eq A1, the reference # is missing
We thank the reviewer for pointing this out, we now corrected the typos
above.

Reviewer #4
The authors are essentially arguing here that they achieved a unique
combination of ingredients in their model: their answer goes along ‘X did not
include effect A, Y did not include effect B, etc’. I am not objecting this. What I
am saying is that they collected ingredients here and there and that this was
neither particularly difficult nor led to particularly impressive applications. I
understand Lim et al did not include inertia, focused on a particular geometry
and did not treat self-contact but they do have shear and extension like many
others have (in fact your reference 22 for instance does this, although the way
you cite it makes it impossible to guess). Similarly, Bergou et al did not consider
shear but they do have both extensible and non-extensible behavior, as well as
inertia and self-contact. On top of this, the authors of the manuscript added an
extra layer of ingredients (optimization, friction) but I see no strong contribution
here either.
We thank the reviewer for appreciating the integration of previous approaches
to broaden the spectrum of possible applications that can be tackled with our
framework. Regarding the lack of difficulty in doing so, the lack of impressive
applications, and the limited contribution related to inverse design, we accept
her/his personal assessment. We will limit ourselves to address the technical
content of the above comment.
We added three recent references from Lim and Peskin (Griffith, Lim,
Communications in Computational Physics, 2012; Lim, Peskin, Physical

More recently, there has been a need to generalize the model to explain new
experimental phenomena such as the plectoneme-solenoid transition [40], that
has been used as the basis for artificial muscles [41–43]. Additional new
technologies such as soft robotics [44,45] are also generating applications for
highly stretchable and shearable elastomeric structures raising the need for
methods able to realistically handle these large strains together with a variety
of interface and environmental effects. Moreover, the capability to
computationally solve both forward [46–48] and inverse problems is emerging
as a crucial paradigm to aid the design of novel, more capable soft-robotic
prototypes [49,50], as well as to characterize from an optimality standpoint bio-
physical phenomena [51–56]. Motivated by these advancements and
challenges, we present a relatively simple, versatile and robust numerical
framework that complements and extends the scope of previous models,
enables inverse design processes and substantially broadens the spectrum of
potential engineering and bio-physical investigations. By taking full advantage
of the Cosserat formalism, and consistently with the full Euclidean group SE(3),
we allow for bend, twist, and significant shear and stretch [4], and demonstrate
the importance of the latter through an example inspired by artificial muscle
actuation [41,42] in which the transition between plectonemes and solenoids is
8
crucially enabled by axial extension. Then, moving beyond the passive
mechanics of individual filaments, we also account for the interaction between
filaments and complex environments with a number of additional biological and
physical features, including muscular activity, self-contact and contact with solid
boundaries, isotropic and anisotropic surface friction and viscous interaction
with a fluid. Therefore, these features (some of which already considered in
previous works as pointed our earlier) are now included and tested in a single
framework. Finally, and unlike previous works, we demonstrate the capabilities
and the robustness of our solver by embedding it in an inverse design cycle for
the identification of optimal terrestrial and aquatic limbless locomotion
strategies.
The same concepts are now recapped in the Conclusion section, where we
added the sentences:
“Particular emphasis is placed in realistically accounting for substantial axial
extensions and shear strains, targeting emerging soft robotic applications.”
and
“We emphasize that in general the solution of an inverse problem, in this case
achieved by coupling our method with evolutionary strategies, severely tests
the robustness of any solver, due to the (often unforeseen) variety of candidate
solutions produced throughout the process. This is an additional aspect that
sets our work apart from previous studies.”
I reiterate that the plectononeme/solenoid example is the most interesting
contribution in this manuscript; this is the only simulation example that cannot
obviously be simulated using existing methods. Statement c) is incorrect, the
Cosserat theory is not quantitatively accurate when applied to elastic cylinders
undergoing finite strain even when their aspect ratio is small. For problems such
as the solenoid where there is no separation of scales the only quantitatively
correct approach would be the three dim. finite-elasticity. Now, it is interesting
that you can reproduce the plectoneme/solenoid transition with this model but,
again, no one should expect quantitative match with experiments or three dim
simulations and you should make this very clear. I find it very exaggerated to
call your section 5 a rigorous validation against a number of experimental data.
The slithering problem is two dimensional, and makes no use of rotations in 3d,
shearability nor extensibility. It mostly disconnected from the core of the paper
which is the formulation of the rod model. Same remark for the swimming
problem which does not use the specifics of this particular numerical rod model,
and adds an extra layer of optimization.
We thank the reviewer for her/his appreciation for our plectoneme/solenoid
investigation. Regarding the quantitative accuracy of the Cosserat model, if no
stretching occurs and if separation of scales holds, we have showed in our
manuscript good agreement with a number of benchmark problems. Other
works have performed quantitative comparison with 3D finite element models
finding very good agreement (we refer the reviewer to H. Lang and J. Linn. A
second order semi-discrete Cosserat rod model suitable for dynamic
simulations in real time. AIP Conference Proceedings, 1168(1):1057–1060,
2009; H. Lang, J. Linn, and M. Arnold. Multi-body dynamics simulation of
9
geometrically exact Cosserat rods. Multibody System Dynamics, 25(3):285–
312, 2011). We note, that they also considered the test case of a swinging
rubber rod undergoing small, but finite elongation and found the classic
Cosserat model to compare well with ABAQUS simulations. Others (S. Sadati,
S. Naghibi, A. Shiva, I. Walker, K. Althoefer, and T. Nanayakkara. Mechanics
of continuum manipulators, a comparative study of five methods with
experiments. Conference Towards Autonomous Robotic Systems, pages 686–
702, 2017) were able to quantitatively predict the behavior of a real slender
robotic arm within 10% accuracy via Cosserat models. Of course, the Cosserat
model cannot capture highly non-uniform stress distribution over cross sections,
and therefore we do expect to observe discrepancies among our model and 3D
FEM simulations for large stretching, as the reduction in cross sectional areas
is intrinsically a 3D phenomenon. Moreover, as pointed out by the reviewer, in
the case of tightly packed solenoids separation of scales might no longer hold.
This is why in the specific case of solenoids we never claimed quantitative
accuracy, but we explicitly mentioned that our solver was able to qualitatively
reproduce the observed topological transitions (we highlighted this in the text
for the reviewer’s convenience). We also note that capturing such topological
rearrangements is a challenging feature even for 3D FEM solvers, given the
inaccuracies that arise from mesh nodes displacements, computational
elements distortion and meshing re-initializations. Since the submission of this
paper, we have carried out a more in-depth investigation of the
plectoneme/solenoid problem and compared with our own and others’
experimental observations. We find that our model is capable of reproducing
observed complex topological transitions (work under review). Motivated by
these results, we plan to carry out a careful quantitative comparison between
our model, 3D simulations and experiments on this particular problem to
establish the limits within which our approach and full scale simulations can be
successfully employed for the design of real soft actuators.
Finally, we do not see the slithering and swimming problems as disconnected
from the rest of the paper. In fact they integrate well with the overall narrative
that we require simulation methods for a range of problems that involve slender
elastic filaments, e.g. soft-robotics, where there is an increasing need for
inverse designs approaches able to handle flexible structures interacting with
the surrounding environment. The slithering and swimming problems illustrate
the suitability of our solver to tackle this particular kind of problem, which reflect
an actual practical need.
One more time: how can you expect your linear constitutive laws to be valid if
your material deforms in the non-linear range? How can you claim that your
system is conservative/Hamiltonian. if you don’t even provide the expression of
its energy? Again, your discrete equations of motion should derive from some
discrete energy/Hamiltonian, which I don’t see in you manuscript. I am speaking
of space discretization, not even time discretization.
We thank the reviewer to point this out. Indeed we should have been more
explicit in the class of materials that we are interested in addressing with our
model. Given our motivation to aid soft-robotic design, we are interested in
modeling materials such as rubber, elastomers and biological tissue. Many of
these materials are hyper-elastic, i.e. they are materials that can exhibit very
10
large strains (sometimes up to 700% their initial length). We do not want to
necessarily consider such large deformations (indeed the maximum extension
considered in the paper for the solenoid formation case is around ~15%), but
we want to be able to capture the behavior of this class of solids over a
reasonably large compression/extension range (say 30%). Two popular hyper-
elastic models are Neo-Hookean and Mooney-Rivlin. For the purpose of
computing the contact loads acting on our filaments, it turns out that the simple
linear stress-strain relation combined with the rescaling of cross sectional
areas as elongation takes place (which renders the load-strain relation no
longer linear) provides a reasonably good approximation of both Neo-Hookean
and Mooney models (within a 10% deformation range), and of the Neo-
Hookean model up to a 30% deformation range, as can be noticed in the Figure
below. The figure below illustrates the load as a function of the elongation factor
e for the four different models indicated in the legend. We considered for
simplicity the case of a rubber filament axially loaded and computed the force
response for prescribed elongations. While our approach progressively departs
from the more accurate Neo-Hookean and Mooney-Rivlin approaches, within a
30% compression/stretch range is consistent with the predictions of the above
mentioned models.

Neo-Hookean
Mooney-Rivlin
We now report in the Appendix the details of this calculation (new section, page
3), together with the expressions of the 1D Neo-Hookean and Mooney-Rivlin
models. Moreover, in the main text (page 7) we added a paragraph to better
specify the class of solids we are interested in, and to highlight the relation
between our approach and more advanced hyper-elastic models. The new
paragraphs reads: “This is consistent with the modeling of hyperelastic
materials such as rubbers, silicones, and biological tissues and therefore in line
with targeted soft robotic applications. Indeed, the combination of linear stress-
strain constitutive models with the geometrical rescaling by e, leads to a
11
reasonable approximation of Neo-Hookean [58] and Mooney-Rivlin models
[59,60] (especially tailored to hyperelastic solids) over a compression/extension
range up to 30%. See the Appendix for a quantitative comparison in the axial
stretch case.”
Relative to the Hamiltonian structure of the system [3.6-3.9], we misinterpreted
the original comment of the reviewer and provide now a more precise answer.
Our derivation, starting from linear and angular momentum balance
transparently shows how material laws are integrated, and how equations are
geometrically rescaled to conserve mass as the filament undergoes extension
or compression. Finally, the smooth equations are directly discretized making
use of a vertex-edges approach (M. Bergou, M. Wardetzky, S. Robinson, B.
Audoly, and E. Grinspun. Discrete elastic rods. ACM Transactions on Graphics
(TOG), 27(3):1–12, 2008), and standard difference and average difference
operators based on trapezoidal quadrature rule (definition of integrated
quantities over edge length: M. Bergou, M. Wardetzky, S. Robinson, B. Audoly,
and E. Grinspun. Discrete elastic rods. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG),
27(3):1–12, 2008; difference operators: T. Futterer, A. Klar, and R. Wegener.
An energy conserving numerical scheme for the dynamics of hyperelastic rods.
International Journal of Differential Equations, 2009). Obviously, depending on
the choice of constitutive laws, on the nature of the acting external loads and
couples, and on the presence of dissipative models (such as internal viscous
dissipation which in the case of rubbers and biological tissue is very relevant)
the obtained system might not be conservative. Nevertheless, by construction,
in the bare case of infinitesimal axial strains and linear stress-strain relations,
we recover the classic Cosserat model which is conservative (see for example:
Z. Ge, H. Kruse, and J. Marsden. The limits of Hamiltonian structures in three-
dimensional elasticity, shells, and rods. Journal of Nonlinear Science, 6(1):19–
57, 1996.) and that can be equivalently determined from its quadratic energy
functionals [reported in the main text] (see for example: in H. Lang, J. Linn, and
M. Arnold. Multi-body dynamics simulation of geometrically exact Cosserat rods.
Multibody System Dynamics, 25(3):285–312, 2011; M. Bergou, M. Wardetzky,
S. Robinson, B. Audoly, and E. Grinspun. Discrete elastic rods. ACM
Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 27(3):1–12, 2008). Therefore, for consistency,
we employ a symplectic energy-preserving time integrator. Moreover, for the
sake of generality, we removed from the text the claim of Hamiltonian system,
and clarified the aspects outlined above in a new paragraph in page 10. The
paragraph reads: “The derivation above leads to a system that in general is not
Hamiltonian, as this depends on the nature of the external loads acting on the
filament as well as on the choice of constitutive laws. Nonetheless, without
external loads and under the assumptions of linear stress-strain relations, this
derivation amounts to a geometric rescaling through e of the classic Cosserat
rod model (here directly discretized via standard finite difference and
trapezoidal quadrature rule, as outlined in [14,18,67,68]), which is a
Hamiltonian system [18,69] with quadratic energy functionals [68]: [reported in
the main text]. Therefore, by construction, in the limit of e <U+2192> 1 (no axial
elongation) the equivalence with the Cosserat model holds, and for consistency
we opt for an energy preserving time integrator, and in particular a symplectic,
second-order Verlet scheme.”

Reviewer #5
This paper presents a discrete Cosserat rod model and a large number of
applications to that model. While I enjoyed reading this paper, I have a major
complaint: the authors do not compare their simulator to existing Cosserat
simulators. In the introduction, it is claimed that previous simulators were
specific to Kirchhoff rod models, but this is wrong. For instance, CORDE
(Spillman et al.) was an implementation of a discrete Cosserat model, allowing
for streching/shearing/bending/twisting. Other authors have worked on
Cosserat discrete models, but are omitted here: Joachim Linn (see, e.g.,
Discrete kinematics of Cosserat rods based on the difference geometry of
framed curves) and Olivier Brüls (see, e.g., Geometrically exact beam finite
element formulated on the special Euclidean group), using similar formalisms.
These references should absolutely be commented on and compared against.
Other reference missing : Bertails et al., Super-helices for predicting the
dynamics of natural hair (another discrete Kirchhoff rod model). Likewise, there
has been mutlipled approaches to couple thin elastic rods to frictional contact,
see e.g. Daviet et al, A Hybrid Iterative Solver for Robustly Capturing Coulomb
Friction in Hair Dynamics, and Durville, Numerical simulation of entangled
materials mechanical properties. Some discussion/comparisons would be
needed there.
That said, I appreciated the variety and scope of applications proposed, based
on the developed discrete model. I think this is the main strength of the paper.
I particularly like the plectonema/coiled formation comparison, since this is a
nice case where simulating stretching+bending really makes a difference. So
far, papers I saw on discrete Cosserat rod models failed to convince me that
stretching was really needed, since their scenarios would not involve any
stretching deformation. In this paper, for the first time this is made
(impressively) clear.
In conclusion, this paper is interesting and well-written, but fails to compare its
approach to others. Since I believe the strength of the paper is not really the
proposed numerical model itself (or, this should be proven by the authors by
making fair comparisons with alternatives; showing that their model can handle
scenarios that other could not handle), I'm still suggesting acceptance with
major recommendation, so that the authors can better place the emphasis on
their applications, and fairly acknowledge prior art.
We thank the reviewer for her/his overall positive assessment, and for pointing
out a number of works that allowed us to better contextualize the present study.
We agree with the reviewer on the need to better position our work with respect
to previous investigations and to emphasize the application aspect of this study.
To this end we included all the references highlighted by the reviewer, and
briefly summarized their contribution in the context of Cosserat modeling. We
then specify the target application of this study (soft-robotics) highlighting the
need for a framework able to capture substantial finite stretch strains, and
robust enough to be employed in an inverse design cycle to aid soft robotic
prototyping. Following the reviewer’s suggestion we extensively reworded the
introduction to:
14
• Better position our work with respect to previous studies
• Place more emphasis on applications and on the multi-physics
capabilities of our solver (especially targeting soft-robotics), rather than
on the numerics itself
• Highlight the importance of including stretch and shear via a clear
example related to plectonemes and solenoids formation
• Emphasize the importance and the need of realistic solvers that are
robust enough to be employed in inverse design processes, an emerging
paradigm to aid the design of robotic prototypes as well as to
characterize from an optimal standpoint bio-physical phenomena.
The core three new paragraphs now read:
These mathematical foundations [5] prompted a number of discrete
computational models [12–16] that allow for the exploration of a range of
physical phenomena. These include, for example, the study of polymers and
DNA [12,17], elastic ribbons and filaments [14,18,19], botanical applications
[20,21], woven cloth [22] and tangled hair and fibers [19,23–25]. Because the
scaled ratio of the stretching and shearing stiffness to the bending stiffness for
slender filaments is L2/r2 » 1, the assumption of inextensibility and/or
unshearability is usually appropriate, justifying the widespread use of the
Kirchhoff model in the aforementioned applications.
Fewer studies have considered, in different flavors, the Cosserat model, mostly
to take advantage of relaxed extension and shearing constraints to simplify
numerical implementations and to facilitate the integration of additional physical
effects. For example, specialized models including extension and constitutive
laws based on strain rates have been developed for the investigation of viscous
threads [15,16,26–30]. Lim and Peskin allow for small numerical shear and
axial strain and couple their model with an accurate viscous flow solver to
investigate fluid-mechanic interactions of ribbons and flagella [31–36]. The
graphics software CORDE [13] implements a Cosserat-based fast solver for
the rendering of looping systems, accounts for (self) contact, operates in the
small extension regime and maintains the unshearability constraint,
showcasing a number of visually impressive and physically plausible scenarios.
Durville [25] introduced a fiber model specialized to efficiently resolve contact-
friction effects in entangled materials. Linn [37] explored an elegant theoretical
connection between Cosserat rods and differential geometry of framed curves,
and numerically tested it on the classic Euler’s Elastica and Kirchhoff’s helix
problems [38]. Finally, Sonneville [39] presents a geometrically exact finite
element formulation on the Euclidean group SE(3) and verifies it on test cases
that do not involve stretching nor environmental effects.
More recently, there has been a need to generalize the model to explain new
experimental phenomena such as the plectoneme-solenoid transition [40], that
has been used as the basis for artificial muscles [41–43]. Additional new
technologies such as soft robotics [44,45] are also generating applications for
highly stretchable and shearable elastomeric structures raising the need for
methods able to realistically handle these large strains together with a variety
of interface and environmental effects. Moreover, the capability to
computationally solve both forward [46–48] and inverse problems is emerging
15
as a crucial paradigm to aid the design of novel, more capable soft-robotic
prototypes [49,50], as well as to characterize from an optimality standpoint bio-
physical phenomena [51–56]. Motivated by these advancements and
challenges, we present a relatively simple, versatile and robust numerical
framework that complements and extends the scope of previous models,
enables inverse design processes and substantially broadens the spectrum of
potential engineering and bio-physical investigations. By taking full advantage
of the Cosserat formalism, and consistently with the full Euclidean group SE(3),
we allow for bend, twist, and significant shear and stretch [4], and demonstrate
the importance of the latter through an example inspired by artificial muscle
actuation [41,42] in which the transition between plectonemes and solenoids is
crucially enabled by axial extension. Then, moving beyond the passive
mechanics of individual filaments, we also account for the interaction between
filaments and complex environments with a number of additional biological and
physical features, including muscular activity, self-contact and contact with solid
boundaries, isotropic and anisotropic surface friction and viscous interaction
with a fluid. Therefore, these features (some of which already considered in
previous works as pointed our earlier) are now included and tested in a single
framework. Finally, and unlike previous works, we demonstrate the capabilities
and the robustness of our solver by embedding it in an inverse design cycle for
the identification of optimal terrestrial and aquatic limbless locomotion
strategies.
The same concepts are now recapped in the Conclusion section, where we
added the sentences:
“Particular emphasis is placed in realistically accounting for substantial axial
extensions and shear strains, targeting emerging soft robotic applications.”
and
“We emphasize that in general the solution of an inverse problem, in this case
achieved by coupling our method with evolutionary strategies, severely tests
the robustness of any solver, due to the (often unforeseen) variety of candidate
solutions produced throughout the process. This is an additional aspect that
sets our work apart from previous studies.”
We hope that this new version satisfactorily addresses the comments of the
reviewer and fairly summarizes previous/alternative approaches.

Reviewer #5
The authors have appropriately cited the references I've pointed to them.
However, the focus of the paper is still maintained on "selling" a new numerical
model, as a model which would outperforms others. I'm still not convinced about
it. I believe previous art (work by Spillman, Bergou, Linn) is discarded much too
quickly. What's the key ingredient that your model has and that others do not?
At this point, I'm really not sure previous models would not be allowed to tackle
the scenarios developed here. I've seen in the past some impressive
simulations made by J. Linn, where cables can bend, twist, strech, shear (not
infinitesimally), be in contact with other objects, all at interactive rates, and in a
very robust manner. I believe this could be a serious competitor (and there are
probably others), and I would like to see fair comparisons of the codes to be
convinced of the novelty of the model. Moreover, all other add-ons (contact and
friction handlings, etc.), are classical, and even sometimes below current state-
of-the-art (nonsmooth methods are now used for treating Signorini-Coulomb
constraints implicitly, see e.g. Daviet et al. 2011).
That said, if the numerical model proposed here was not really new nor better
than previous approaches, this would not be killing the paper : as I said before,
the true strength and richness of the paper is to conduct many interesting
experiments where very good agreement is shown between the model and the
experiement. No one has done that thorough and extensive validation work in
the past, and I believe that's a good contribution that would justify publication
per se. However, the paper would have to be fully oriented towards these
applications, thus reducing the importance of the numerical model developed
(still it would be interesting to have its full description in the main text or in
appendix, for the sake of completeness and reproducibility). Currently, the
abstract clearly makes the focus on the numerical model, not on this validation
work, so this would have to be reworked too.
For me, the two options are good:
- either prove the novelty and gain brought by your numerical model, by making
proper evaluation and fair comparisons against previous relevant methods
(meaning perhaps some reimplementing of previous methods, if code is not
readily available)
- or focus on the applications, reducing the weight on the novelty of the code.
I'd like to see a revision implementing successfully one of these two options.
To me, this is the only way that this paper advances the state of the art in a fair
and useful way for the scientific community.
We thank the reviewer for the overall positive assessment and comments. We
did attempt to shift the emphasis to the application side in our previous review,
and in light of the new comments we have taken additional steps to further
highlight this point. These are summarized in the following:
• We modified the title that now reads: “Forward and inverse problems in
the mechanics of soft filaments” instead of “Computational mechanics of
soft filaments” to shift the focus from the computational methodology
perspective to its use in terms of applications.
• Consistent with this, we have reworked the entire abstract, to clarify
upfront our interest in validating and using the Cosserat model, across a
broad set of applications. The new abstract now reads: “Soft slender
structures are ubiquitous in natural and artificial systems, in active and
passive settings and across scales, from polymers and flagella to snakes
or space tethers. Here we demonstrate the use of a simple and practical
numerical implementation based on the Cosserat rod model to simulate
the dynamics of filaments that can bend, twist, stretch and shear, while
interacting with complex environments via muscular activity, surface
contact, friction and hydrodynamics. We validate our simulations by
solving a number of forward problems of passive filament mechanics, by
comparing with known analytic results and experimental observations
relative to solenoid and plectoneme formation in twisted, stretched
filaments. We then study active filaments such as snakes and other
slender organisms, by solving inverse problems to identify optimal gaits
for limbless locomotion on solid surfaces and in bulk liquids.”
• In the same spirit in the introduction we added a sentence that
emphasizes the use of our numerical implementation, rather than its
numerical novelty : “Motivated by these advancements and challenges,
we use a versatile implementation of the Cosserat model that we
validate in a set of physical simulations, and then deploy in the context
of inverse design problems to broaden the spectrum of its potential
engineering and bio-physical investigations.”
• Throughout the text we removed all claims of numerical novelty, so as
to emphasize the application aspect of this study.
• Finally, we modified accordingly the conclusions. Note that at the end of
it we explicitly state that showcasing the use of the Cosserat model in a
broad spectrum of application is the main contribution of this
investigation, while we removed the claim of numerical novelty. “We
have presented a versatile implementation of the Cosserat rod model for
the simulation of soft filaments deforming in three dimensional space.
These filaments at any given cross section can experience all
deformation modes, namely normal and orthonormal bending, twisting,
stretching and shearing. Particular emphasis is placed in realistically
accounting for substantial axial extensions and shear strains, targeting
emerging soft robotic applications. The solver also handles self-contact,
muscular activity, solid boundaries, isotropic and anisotropic friction as
well as hydrodynamics. The outcome is a simple algorithm suitable to
tackle a plethora of engineering and bio-physical phenomena. We
verified this against a battery of benchmark problems entailing different
physical aspects and boundary conditions, and used it to solve a range
of forward and inverse problems spanning mechanics and bio-physics.
In particular we studied the formation of solenoids and plectonemes and
the evolutionary optimization of terrestrial limbless locomotion and
swimming. We emphasize that in general the solution of an inverse
problem, in this case achieved by coupling our method with evolutionary
strategies, severely tests the robustness of any solver, due to the (often
unforeseen) variety of candidate solutions produced throughout the
process. Our results demonstrate the utility of a modeling approach
based on Cosserat rods in a wide range of settings that involve
active and passive soft filaments, broadening the scope of
previous studies. We emphasize here that this is the main
contribution of this investigation. Ongoing work involves its coupling
to realistic high Reynolds number flow solvers [100], its integration with
sensory feedback models for the characterization of locomotory neural
circuitry [80], and its use for the rational design of bio-hybrid bots
[45,101].”
We believe that these modifications now clearly emphasize the application
aspect of our study, rather than its numerical novelty, as suggested by the
reviewer. We nevertheless retain in the main text the algorithm description for
the sake of reproducibility. Moreover, since the code is openly distributed, the
algorithmic description serves the purpose of clarifying the various aspects of
our software.
We hope that these changes will satisfy the reviewer, and that this new version
is found acceptable for publication.
