This is an interesting paper and should be published. I think it would be improved if the data
analysis were to be extended.Could the actual Gc values be included and can the authors explain
how the peak stress is calculated and give the values? I think this would be more informative
than the ratios used.

The paper is very poorly prepared. The title is misleading. The first impression is that the authors
have developed some novel molecules that can undergo self exothermal reaction at ultra-low
temperatures, but the fact is electricity resistance heating aided by embedding electrical
conductive materials, CFS or CNS was necessary to aid the exothermal reaction. In this case, the
environmental temperature does not mean much anymore.
It is surprising that the authors did not give much information (viscosity and flow property,
exothermal temperature, mechanical properties after exothermal reaction etc.) about the healing
material/agent though this is a study on self-healing.
The authors should also address the knock down factor in mechanical properties (in-plane
modulus and strength) on base composite laminates after CFS and CNS were embedded.

It is not clear how the authors quantify the strain energy release rate GI (equation 1) in relation to
the load-displacement curve in the appendix.

The authors made clear efforts to enhance the scientific quality of the manuscript with the
additional information. The added information indicates there is some inconsistency in
calculating the strain energy release rate e.g. eq (3). There are the ASTM or ISO standards for the
determination of the mode-I strain energy release rate from DCB specimens. The authors should
refers to the standards in this respect.
In addition, the section of 2.2 Fabrication Procedure should be condensed to a half of a page.
What is the definition of the strain energy in Figs 6 & 7?
Some cotton fibre composites results were presented in Figure 8 without any early information,
why?
It is appreciated that the additional information added by the authors helps the comprehension of
the results, but the author should make the presentation concise.

Dear Editor,
We wish to submit our manuscript entitled “Sustainable Self-healing at Ultra-low Temperatures in
Structural Composites Incorporating Hollow Vessels and Heating Elements” for your consideration.
The original manuscript ID RSOS-160121 with the shorter title “Sustainable Self-healing at Ultra-low
Temperatures” was rejected by The Royal Society Open Science and we were permitted to re-submit the
work after taking account of the comments received.
According to the first reviewer, the paper was interesting and should be published. He or she also
suggested that adding actual values and more explanation of calculations would make the article more
informative. We agree with the reviewer. We have collected additional data and presented them in a
new table of test results, and have explained the calculation of healing efficiencies more clearly.
The second reviewer recommended that the paper be rejected. His/her comments were:
1. The paper is very poorly prepared. The title is misleading. The first impression is that the authors
have developed some novel molecules that can undergo self exothermal reaction at ultra-low
temperatures, but the fact is electricity resistance heating aided by embedding electrical conductive
materials, CFS or CNS was necessary to aid the exothermal reaction. In this case, the environmental
temperature does not mean much anymore.
2. It is surprising that the authors did not give much information (viscosity and flow property,
exothermal temperature, mechanical properties after exothermal reaction etc.) about the healing
material/agent though this is a study on self-healing.
3. The authors should also address the knock down factor in mechanical properties (in-plane modulus
and strength) on base composite laminates after CFS and CNS were embedded.
4. It is not clear how the authors quantify the strain energy release rate GI (equation 1) in relation to
the load-displacement curve in the appendix.
Our response is as follows.
1. Although we did not claim in any way that self-healing at ultra-low temperature was achieved using
new healing agents, we have changed the title of the paper to avoid misunderstanding.
2. We believe that the article gave sufficient relevant information about healing agents. We clearly
stated in the article that the healing agent was RT151 by Resintech Ltd. Details of RT151, such as its
viscosity, can be found in datasheets available online at the manufacturer’s website.
3. We have now included the effects of the conductive sheets on the mechanical properties of the
composites in the article.
4. We have slightly expanded the description of how G1 is quantified and moved the description from
the appendix to the Method section to clarify matters.
Thank you for your consideration of this manuscript.
Sincerely,
Y. J. Wang and D. T. Pham
