Response to Reviewer 1 comment:
<U+2160>. Several statements we made turned out to be more ambiguous than intended, So we
have adjusted the texts to be clearer. Our manuscript has been reviewed by a native
English speaker and revised to improve readability. The modified part is shown by blue
in new manuscript.
<U+2161>. The development of carbon dots-based probe for nitrite detection has been added to
the original manuscript introduction. In addition, references about development of
carbon dots-based probe for nitrite detection have been added as [24-25]. The details as
following:
Introduction
Nitrite as important oxynitride plays a significant role in the nitrogen cycle of natural
environment. Meanwhile, in the fields of agriculture and food industry, it is always used
as fertilizers and preservative. However, the usage of nitrite is constrained in
physiological systems because the excessive ingestion of nitrite can lead to hazardous
affects for human health, especially for children, the elderly and pregnant women1-5.
For example, the haemoglobin oxidation in blood, the formation of carcinogenic
nitrosamines in the digestive system6,7, and many diseases such as esophageal cancer
and blue baby syndrome8-10 are all caused by an excess ingestion of nitrite. The World
Health Organization specified that the maximum concentration of nitrite could not
exceed 3 mg<U+F0D7>L-1 in the drinking water11. Therefore, it is important to detect nitrite in
living environment for improving the quality of human health. In recent years, many
methods of the aqueous nitrite determination are coming into daily life, including the
spectrophotometry12,13, electrochemistry14,15, chemiluminescence16-18 and fluorometry
methods. Afkhami reported the spectrophotometric determination of nitrite based on
the color reaction of nitrite with p-nitroaniline12. The electrochemical nitrite sensor
based on graphene quantum dots decorated N-doped carbon nanofibers composite was
found by Li’s groups19. Abdolmohammad-Zadeh’s groups used ag@agcl@graphene
oxide@Fe3O4, nanocomposite for chemiluminescence detection of nitrite20. However,
their work still had some disadvantages, such as complicated and expensive instruments,
toxic raw materials and complicated synthesis process. Compared to these methods,
fluorometry methods have many advantages including simple operation, speediness,
low cost, portability, high sensitivity, good selectivity and high time efficiency as shown
in Table 1. Liu’s groups used fluorometry methods based on graphene quantum dots co-
doped for nitrite sensing 21.
For the fluorescent detection, it is well known that the commonly used organic dyes are
often suffering from light bleaching. A solid substitute is fluorescent semiconductor
quantum dots such as CdTe, CdS, PbS etc., which is a kind of "zero-dimensional" nano-
materials with quantum confinement effect. However, the fluorescent semiconductor
quantum dots are often synthesized with heavy metal ions, which could substantially
diminish their biocompatibility. Carbon dots, as a relatively new member of the nano-
material family22, inherit some of the good properties of semiconductor quantum dots
such as photostability, and are also capable to maintain non-toxicity, even a green
synthesis from reagents to products. Therefore, they are potential in bioimaging,
biosensing, nanomedicine and so on23. It has been reported that carbon dots were used
as reductant and reinforcement for hydrogen peroxide24 and nitrite detection25.

<U+2162>. The part in 3.1 of original manuscript has been modified about the discussion of the
crystal structure of carbon dots and the discerption of strongest emission. The
wavelength shift of carbon dots fluorescence under the different excitation was
discussed in the part 3.1 of new manuscript. The discerption of optical images of
fluorescence changes was added and the Stern-Volmer equation was discussed in the
part in 3.3 of original manuscript. In addition, a reference about fluorescent wavelength
shift of carbon dots was shown in new [28]. The details as following:
3.1 The characterization of Carbon dots
The XRD pattern of carbon dots are shown in Fig.1 (a). The peak at 25 degrees
corresponds to the crystal lattice distance of (002), which is a key feature of materials
based on carbon.27. TEM of carbon dots in Fig.1(b) shows that the size of carbon dots
was in the range of 3-6 nm and the crystal structure was observed unclearly, which
demonstrated that the structure of carbon dots was dominated by amorphous form. The
UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectrum of carbon dots were recorded in Fig.2(a),
respectively. The electronic transition of C-C and C=O bonds in the excited carbon dots
could account for the peak at 261nm and 343nm in the absorption spectrum,
respectively. And it can be seen that the optimum excitation wavelength of carbon dots
was 355 nm.
Fig.2 (b) shows the fluorescent emission intensity of carbon dots, which demonstrated
that the strongest emission wavelength of carbon dots was located in the range from
440 nm to 475 nm at the excitation wavelength in the range from 330 nm to 365 nm.
FromFig.2 (c), it can be seen that the different wavelength excitation of carbon dots
could account for varying its fluorescence intensity. The spectra of carbon dots were
normalized to show that excitation at different wavelength also resulted in fluorescence
wavelength shift as shown in Fig.2 (d). The wavelength of emission shifted from 450
nm to 505 nm when the excitation shifted from 320 nm to 440 nm, which might be
assigned to the various size for carbon cores and different surface groups. It has been
widely reported that multiple fluorophores existed on the surface of carbon dots,
contributing to a wide range of emission wavelength28. Though under certain
monocolour excitation, most fluorophores would be eclipsed by the dominant ones.
This dominating behaviour largely depends on the absorbance and quantum yield of the
fluorophores. So as the excitation wavelength varies from short to long, the
fluorophores with high absorbance around the current wavelength take the stage
successively. As a result, the emission wavelength shows a dependence on the
excitation. Many multiple applications based on carbon dots can be benefited from the
property that they have a wide range of excitation and emission wavelengths.

confinement and surface states. Journal of Nanophotonics 10(2), 026028. (doi:
10.1117/1.JNP.10.026028)
3.3 The fluorescence of carbon dots quenched by aqueous nitrite
The fluorescence intensities and peaks of carbon dots were different with the change of
pH as shown in Fig.5 (a). The reason might be ascribed to the influence of the
concentration of hydrogen ion in aqueous solution upon the fluorescent groups on the
surface of carbon dots There was a certain linear relationship between relative
fluorescence intensity of carbon dots and the concentration of aqueous nitrite under
different pH as shown in Fig.5 (b). And the carbon dots solution with pictures in the
upper left corner of Fig.5 (b) changes from colourless to bright blue after excited by
UV light at 355 nm. With increasing concentration of the aqueous nitrite, the
fluorescence intensity of the carbon dots decreased accordingly. The influence of the
same concentration of aqueous nitrite on carbon dots was different under various pH.
The fluorescent intensity of carbon dots was more sensitive to nitrite with the decrease
of pH. The following Stern-Volmer equation was used to analyze the fluorescence
quenching of aqueous nitrite.
I0/I-1=Ksv[C]
where I0 and I are the fluorescence intensity of carbon dots without and with the aqueous
nitrite, respectively. Ksv is the quenching constant which is the slope of the linearity and
[C] is the concentration of the aqueous nitrite. The fine linearity I0/I-1=0.046[NaNO2]
(R2=0.99) was achieved under pH=5 in Fig.5 (b). The sensitivity of fluorescent carbon
dots for detection of aqueous nitrite can be described by Ksv. A higher value of Ksv
indicates that the more obvious quenching effect can be observed at slighter change in
the concentration of the aqueous nitrite. Because nitrous acid is a weak acid, hydrolysis
reaction of nitrite ion exists in water. The hydrolysis reaction of nitrite ion was
reinforced under the acidic condition. Therefore, the content of nitrous acid in aqueous
solution increased, which enhanced the effect of fluorescence quenching due to the
higher activity of nitrous acid than nitrite ion.
<U+2163>. Some new results have been achieved recently by experiments. HRTEM pictures of
carbon dots have been taken and the dispersity of carbon dots is now shown in new
Fig.1(b). The strongest emission intensity is shown in new Fig.2 (b), and Fig.2 (c) in
original manuscript has been transferred to Fig.2 (a) in the new manuscript. The
excitation from 390 nm to 440 nm in original manuscript has been extended to 320 nm
- 440 nm in the new manuscript, as shown in new Fig.2 (c-d). The wavelength of
emission shift has been changed from 460 nm - 505 nm to 450 nm – 505 nm. The
corresponding description about Fig.2 (c-d) has been modified in the part 3.1 of the new
manuscript. The details as following:
Fig. 1 (a) The XRD pattern of carbon dots. (b) The high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy images of carbon dots.
Fig.2 (a) The absorption spectrum of carbon dots. (b) The 3D scanning
fluorescence spectra of carbon dots. (c) The fluorescence spectra of carbon dots
excited at variant wavelength. (d) The normalized fluorescence spectra of carbon dots.
3.1 The characterization of Carbon dots
The wavelength of emission shifted from 450 nm to 505 nm when the excitation
shifted from 320 nm to 440 nm, which might be assigned to the various size for carbon
cores and different surface groups.
Reviewer #2: Huang et al. reported fluorescent carbon dots probe for detection of
aqueous nitrite was fabricated by a one-pot hydrothermal method and the transmission
electron microscope. I recommend its publication in this journal after major revision
according to the following comments:
1. The title can be brief, such as “Detection for nitrite based on fluorescent carbon
dots by hydrothermal method with folic acid”.
2. Figure 3b shows quantum yield of carbon dots which prepared under different
temperature. Figure 5b shows the Stern-Volmer plot for the quenching of the carbon
dots caused by aqueous nitrite. Figure 6 shows the changes of fluorescence intensities
of the carbon dots after the addition of different chemicals. It’s better to include error
bars for each data point and present the standard deviation of the measurements. If
necessary, calculate the p-values to support your claims.
3. Please provide optical images of fluorescence color about fluorescent carbon dots
probe for detection of aqueous nitrite.
4. What is the sensitivity of fluorescent carbon dots probe for detection of aqueous
nitrite?
5. What is the advantage of fluorescent carbon dots probe for detection of aqueous
nitrite in this work compared to other methods? Please discuss in the introduction and
provide the table.
