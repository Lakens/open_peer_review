Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
Predator-prey dynamics have been well-studied in the 4-year and 10-cycle, but apparently not so
well in irruptive systems. The authors present a nicely-designed study that elucidates aspects of
predator-prey relations in an irruptive system. I have two general suggestions for improving the
manuscript:
1. For most of the manuscript, the term “small mammals” is presented as a unified concept, and
the reader assumes that if there are multiple species of small mammals, then they must be
ecologically similar: they are all preferred prey, and they all irrupt similarly. Late in the paper it
is revealed that this is not the case, which is confusing. It would help to tell the reader, early on,
that there are multiple small mammals and that they are not all ecologically similar, and explain
the reasons why small mammals are treated as a single entity for hypotheses 1 and 2, and as
separate entities for hypothesis 3. I am not saying that this variable treatment of small mammals
is invalid, but rather that without disclosure and explanation, it is confusing.
2. The paper is solid through line 275, but the last four paragraphs begin drifting well beyond the
data presented. I agree that a brief mention of the possibility of the predator pit is justified, but I
question whether the rest of these four paragraphs is sufficiently connected to the data presented.
Specific comments:
Lines 266-267: the point about “energetically profitable (up to 200 g)” is repeated on line 269, and
the line 269 version is the better-presented of the two, so I suggest deleting the statement on lines
266-267.
Lines 270-275: this sentence tries to cram in far too much information. I read it twice and still do
not understand it, so please break up into shorter, more coherent sentences.
Line 279: it would help to tell the reader which species are native and which are nonnative.
Lines 277-286: I have read this paragraph twice. The first sentence makes sense to me, although I
would argue that it is a sweeping generalization that extends beyond the data: “impact on the
prey” is too vague a notion, and impact on prey is influenced by factors besides dietary
preference, such as predator abundance (as is stated on lines 288-289) and consumption rate. The
rest of the paragraph does not make sense to me.
Lines 288-298: this is a lot of words to make a point that is not derived from your data. I suggest
greatly reducing or deleting this passage. And again, you are leaving out consumption rate: if
dingoes and cats have equal abundance and eat the same prey, the impact of the dingo will be
much greater.
Line 300: you are making an important point in this sentence, and the vague reference to “results
of Greenville” is not adequate. The results of Greenville presented on lines 292-296 are only
partly related to a predator pit hypothesis; please refocus the message.
Line 301: insert “for the” after “potential”.
Line 307: you have not told the reader which prey are irruptive or non-irruptive.
Lines 308-309: “in addition” and “also” are redundant.
3
Lines 312-313: I don’t understand the basis for concern about Forrest’s mouse. Intense predation
pressure on surviving prey is an expected dynamic in either boom-bust or cycling systems, and
for both systems, local extinctions are an unsurprising outcome of a bust or crash. So, why the
sudden concern about the Forrest’s mouse? Hasn’t it persisted for some time in a boom-bust
system?
Lines 315-331: I appreciate the intent of the concluding paragraph, but I do not believe the
attempt being made here is successful. “Conservation actions” are mentioned – but no
conservation context has been established in the paper. Are some of the small mammals of
conservation concern? I don’t understand the focus on feral cats – in the conceptual model, other
predators show a higher percentage of mammal prey during the post-irruptive period. The
suggestion that we manage for dingoes to reduce cat abundance comes across as far-fetched.
Dingoes also eat small mammals, and no evidence is provided that the increased impact of more
dingoes will not exceed the reduced impact of fewer cats. Further, is it truly feasible to manage
for more dingoes? And, the evidence that increasing dingoes will actually result in reduced cat
predation sounds weak. Finally, the conceptual model simply portrays that predation can be
proportionally intense after the peak of the irruption, and that different predators may show
differing percentages of the prey in question in their diets (but it does not show kill rate, which is
the variable of interest). I am not sure that this concept is all that new in fluctuating systems. For
example, 50 years ago Oliver P. Pearson (1971) showed this pattern with real data (not a
conceptual model) for the vole cycle, with the added advantage of measuring predator
abundance and kill rate.
Line 412: by “prey item”, do you mean prey individual or prey species?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This paper reports on the dietary response of 3 predators to a significant fluctuation in preferred
prey. The information is interesting and useful, and the paper is generally well written. I do
have some concerns and recommendations, and these are offered below. In general, I feel that the
4
paper tries to do too much, some of which isn’t really warranted by the data, and therefore
probably could be substantially shortened.
More general comments:
1. I feel that the paper tries too hard to create a theoretical context for the information
presented. For example, it is abundantly established in the literature that dingoes and red foxes
are generalist foragers while cats are more specialized on small vertebrates. Concomitantly, it is
well established that generalists will adjust foraging patterns based on the availability of
profitable food items and that specialists will have less flexibility to switch to other items. In that
regard, it seems that any results other than those observed would have been unusual. Thus, I feel
that some of the theory-based review information in the introduction and some of the
interpretation with respect to theory in the discussion could be markedly reduced.
2. Also, I feel that much of the discussion on the impacts of the predators on small mammal
populations could be removed or at least significantly reduced. Continued use of a species that is
in decline doesn’t necessarily equate to increased pressure on the prey populations. To infer that,
you really would need to know much more about the abundance of the predators and whether or
not they were declining as well. Also, the decline in prey likely was in response to declining food
availability as a function of lower precipitation following the “boom” year. If carrying capacity
was declining for the prey species, then the mortality due to predators may simply have been
compensatory. In the absence of additional information, I don’t think you can say much about
predation effects on the small mammals.
Specific comments:
Line 45: Not quite sure how some of these factors would influence diet variation. Seems like
preferences would decrease variation, as you observed in the cats. And how would hunger
influence variation? Are you implying a predator might be less selective? And risk of injury
from a given prey species to a given predator species should be a constant. Several of these
factors might operate on an individual basis, but not really on a population wide basis.
Lines 46 and 47: Generalist predators having specialist diets seems contradictory.
Lines 56-60: Not the best example as snowshoe hares aren’t really small mammals.
Line 61: Suggest replacing “animals” with “foods”. E.g., in the next line, you describe how foxes
included “fruits” in their diet.
Lines 68-81: I think that you really could remove this entire paragraph. As mentioned
previously, your data don’t really reveal much about the effects of predators on their prey, and I
think this information could/should probably be removed from the paper.
Line 131: Your third prediction seems contradictory to your earlier statement that generalist
predators would “uphold narrow specialist diets until their preferred prey become scarce.” It
also contradicts your second prediction that dietary diversity will increase as small mammal
populations decline, which is typically what indeed occurs.
Lines 243-313: I really feel that you could remove all of this text. Very little of this is supported
by your data and generally is speculative. I think you mostly can concisely conclude that your
results were consistent with established foraging theory for generalist and specialist predators
and also were consistent with results from many other studies.
Lines 318-322: You might emphasize that under ANY circumstances, regardless of small
mammal population dynamics, it would be good to promote the native predator (i.e., dingoes)
5
both because they are part of the native fauna AND because they might aid in the reducing non-
native and very destructive smaller predators (i.e., red foxes and feral cats).
Lines 322-325: I’m not sure that there is anything novel about this model or that it truly applies to
your results, for reasons given earlier. I think this text and Figure 6 could be removed to make
the paper more concise.
Methods: You use a lot of percentage (i.e., proportional) data. Such data are constrained in that
they are limited to values between 0 and 100. Consequently, they typically are non-normal. Did
you conduct any tests of normality on your data? Proportional data typically are subject to some
sort of data transformation prior to statistical analysis, commonly an arcsine transformation. In
the absence of normality tests and/or data transformation, your PERMANOVA results may be
suspect.
Also, it isn’t clear what your dependent variables are in your statistical models. Looks like you
used predator species and irruption stage as the independent variables. Did you include the
volumetric proportions of all food item categories simultaneously as the response variable? You
might provide more detail here.
Figure 1. If this figure will remain in black & white, you might find some more distinctive line
styles. The current ones are somewhat difficult to discern.
Figure 2. Your irruption category labels on your x axis are not consistent with those throughout
the paper. You really should change Pre-boom to Late bust, Post-boom to Decline, and Bust to
Early bust.
Figure 3. I didn’t feel that the redundancy analysis revealed anything different and the figure,
although slick and flashy, is very difficult to interpret. The information presented appears to
mostly duplicate that which is more clearly presented in Figure 3. I recommend removing the
analysis and this figure, which won’t result in any information loss and will make the paper more
concise.
Figure 5. I have very mixed feelings about this figure and the associated preference analysis.
Trapping data are so very different from dietary data that it seems that quantitatively comparing
the 2 is a little shaky. Also, the detection of prey remains in scats is (or should be) consistent
across small mammal species. If the predator ate the species and the remains are in the scat, you
should detect them. In that sense, the probability of detection among prey species in the scats
should be equal. However, I strongly suspect that the probability of detecting small mammal
species in traps, particularly pitfall traps, is highly variable among species. Just like with any
trapping technique, some species are much easier to capture than others. Thus, unless you have
some sort of corroborating information, it’s possible that relative capture rates in traps may not
accurately reflect abundance of the small mammals. Your techniques are sufficient for comparing
abundance for a given species among irruption periods, but probably not for comparing
abundance between species or to diet composition. I think you can look at trends in use of a
given species by predators relative to trends in the occurrence of that species in scats, but I don’t
really think you can validly say much, at least quantitatively, about preference. Also, I think your
use of “avoidance” is not really appropriate. Did the predators really “avoid” the species, or was
it just that other species were more profitable, or more abundant, or easier to capture, etc.?
Figure 6. As mentioned earlier, I think that this is both common knowledge from a theoretical
perspective and speculative with regards to your data, and I recommend removing the figure.
Despite the numerous comments above, I don’t intend them to be harsh or overly critical. I did
enjoy reading the paper and think that there is a good core data set that is worthy of publication.
I just feel that there is a little too much “over reach” in the paper. With some reduction and
condensing, I think it will be a fine contribution to the scientific literature. I hope my comments
are helpful in achieving this goal.

The authors have made a good-faith effort to address reviewer comments, and the manuscript
has markedly improved as a result. I have only a few comments, mostly dealing with clarity:
Line 81: the meaning of “invasive or exotic” is unclear. Do you mean these as separate terms (e.g.,
“blue or green”)? If so, some would argue that the terms mean the same thing. Or, are you giving
two alternative terms with the same meaning, to ensure that the reader knows what you mean
(e.g., “the peak, or high point, of a cycle”)?
Line 82: the meaning of “highly adapted” is unclear: highly adapted to what? In one sense, it is
hard to imagine an extant predator, exotic or native, that does not have highly adapted hunting
behaviors. Do you mean highly adapted to be a specialized, or generalized predator? Please
clarify.
Line 87: here the term used is “introduced”, whereas on line 81 the terms are “exotic” and
“invasive”. Do these terms all mean the same thing, or different things?
Lines 228-229: this argument is making a connection between retractable claws/specialized
dentition and success at capturing small prey, but I don’t understand this prey-size connection.
Another felid, the tiger, has both adaptations and is efficient at capturing large prey. Please
explain the connection between claws/dentition and ability to capture small prey.
Lines 232-233: I suggest adding a qualifier to this statement, such as “potentially were not high
enough”, because the proposed explanation is one of multiple possible explanations.
Lines 234-236: this statement does not follow logically from the prior statement. The prior
statement is a comparative one, showing that cats do less prey-switching than dingoes and foxes,
whereas this statement is an absolute one, which appears to apply only to cats. OK, so alternate
prey are not available; but then why do foxes and dingoes switch to alternate prey? Please clarify.
Also, “base density” is rather vague. I know what you are trying to say, but it is best to be
explicit.
Line 248: what is meant by “larger predators”? I assume that means dingoes and foxes, but if so,
this is confusing because the passage is about how all three predators prefer the long-haired rat,
not just dingoes and foxes.
Lines 248-251: I do not understand this statement. The comparison is between systems that did or
did not irrupt; why is that important? What is meant by “much greater disparity” (please be more
specific)? “Between” refers to two entities, yet three are listed; do you mean cats and foxes
combined, compared with dingoes? If so, please make that clear and also explain why cats and
foxes are combined.
Lines 316-317: I think that the singular “trap” cannot be “spaced apart”; hence, how about
changing “Each individual pitfall trap was” to “Individual pitfall traps were”?

label_comment_4
This is a revised manuscript for which I was not an original reviewer. I conducted my review
before reading the comments by the prior reviewers, however, in an attempt to provide an
independent assessment of the manuscript. The manuscript investigated tracked dietary shifts by
3 mammalian carnivores - feral cats, red foxes, and dingoes, through a non-cyclic irruption of
small mammalian prey. Although not necessarily groundbreaking or exceedingly novel (see
comments below), I expect such a topic could be of interest to the readership of Royal Society
Open Science. The manuscript is generally well-written and the methodology seems appropriate.
Below I provide some comments and questions to highlight my concerns and provide
suggestions I think could improve both the effectiveness and clarity of the paper. I generally
included the points as I encountered them in the manuscript:
1. P3-4 (L66-82). The authors frame their study as an unusual example of investigating predator
responses in non-cyclic (rather than cyclic) irruptions of prey. That might be the case, but the
manuscript could be improved by more explicitly discussing why the distinction between non-
cyclic and cyclic systems is interesting, specifically regarding the key comparison of generalist vs
specialist predators. That is, why would we expect the disparity between generalist vs specialist
predators in non-cyclic systems to be fundamentally different than that in cyclic prey systems?
The authors argue that greater dietary flexibility might be necessary in non-cyclic systems, which
seems reasonable. But, wouldn’t we still expect that generalist predators would be more apt to
exhibit dietary flexibility in non-cyclic systems, similar to cyclic systems? A stronger, more
explicit framing of the generalist-specialist dichotomy in reference to non-cyclic systems
specifically would be helpful; indeed, generalist or specialists are not even mentioned in this
critical paragraph. And, the discussion of the impacts of predators on prey (P3, L78-82) seems
somewhat tangential, given no data were collected on such impacts and it is not a focus of this
manuscript.
More generally, as the authors explain in the Introduction and Discussion, it is well-known that
generalist predators often display dietary shifts in response to prey fluctuations, particularly in
comparison to specialist predators. Thus, the primary conclusion that carnivores with more
generalized diets (red foxes and dingoes) shifted their diet more than a carnivore with a more
specialized diet (domestic cats) is not at all surprising, thus diminishing its novelty and impact. I
realize, however, that such subjective evaluations of the impact or importance of a manuscript are
not valid selection criteria for publication in Royal Society Open Science. Nonetheless, I think
there are opportunities to rework or reframe some text to enhance both impact and importance of
the manuscript. I’ve tried to make such suggestions throughout my review.

2. P4, L89. The “generalist” nature of feral cats seems somewhat overstated here, particularly in
relation to a broad generalist omnivore such as the red fox. In contrast to foxes, aren’t feral cats
strict carnivores?
3. P5, L98-104. Short paragraph, contributing to choppy feel at end of Introduction. Consider
combining with next paragraph to create one concluding paragraph.
4. P5, L112-117. The explanation of the third hypothesis is somewhat unclear and awkwardly
worded, across 2 sentences. Could rework to tighten and clarify.
5. P6, L118-121. This sentence seems somewhat tangential and out of place. Contributes to the
awkward feel towards the end of the Introduction. Overall, I’d suggest reworking this last
paragraph to condense and tighten.
6. P6, L140. Judging by Figure 2, it appears as if small mammals also declined in the bust stage for
cats as well (more so for the early bust stage), albeit less so than foxes and dingoes. I’d consider
acknowledging this pattern evident in Figure 2.
7. P7, L146-147. I found the wording here to be a bit confusing. The parentheticals seem to
suggest that the pairwise comparisons for “Boom, Decline” and for “Late bust, Early bust” were
statistically significant, when they were not according to Table 1. I realize that is not your intent,
but clarification would help.
8. P7, L149-150. Same comment as above. Some readers might think the text states that that the
pairwise comparison for “Boom, Decline” and for “Late bust, Early bust”, as listed is Table 1,
were statistically significant, which is not your intent.

understand the focus on feral cats – in the conceptual model, other predators
show a higher percentage of mammal prey during the post-irruptive
period. The suggestion that we manage for dingoes to reduce cat abundance
comes across as far-fetched. Dingoes also eat small mammals, and no
evidence is provided that the increased impact of more dingoes will not
exceed the reduced impact of fewer cats. Further, is it truly feasible to
manage for more dingoes? And, the evidence that increasing dingoes will
actually result in reduced cat predation sounds weak. Finally, the
conceptual model simply portrays that predation can be proportionally
intense after the peak of the irruption, and that different predators may show
differing percentages of the prey in question in their diets (but it does not
show kill rate, which is the variable of interest). I am not sure that this
concept is all that new in fluctuating systems. For example, 50 years ago
Oliver P. Pearson (1971) showed this pattern with real data (not a conceptual
model) for the vole cycle, with the added advantage of measuring predator
abundance and kill rate.

small mammal genera, and broad prey types,

to other items. In that regard, it seems that any results other than those
observed would have been unusual. Thus, I feel that some of the theory-
based review information in the introduction and some of the interpretation
with respect to theory in the discussion could be markedly reduced.
Also, I feel that much of the discussion on the impacts of the predators on Many thanks for this suggestion, we have

Response to Reviewers
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors have made a good-faith effort to address reviewer comments, and the
manuscript has markedly improved as a result. I have only a few comments, mostly
dealing with clarity:
Line 81: the meaning of “invasive or exotic” is unclear. Do you mean these as separate
terms (e.g., “blue or green”)? If so, some would argue that the terms mean the same thing.
Or, are you giving two alternative terms with the same meaning, to ensure that the reader
knows what you mean (e.g., “the peak, or high point, of a cycle”)?
Thank you for pointing out the lack of clarity here, we have removed “invasive or exotic” and
replaced it with “introduced” to ensure that the reader knows what we mean.
Line 82: the meaning of “highly adapted” is unclear: highly adapted to what? In one
sense, it is hard to imagine an extant predator, exotic or native, that does not have highly
adapted hunting behaviors. Do you mean highly adapted to be a specialized, or generalized
predator? Please clarify.
Thank you for the suggestion. We agree and have changed “highly adapted hunting behaviours”
to “highly efficient hunting strategies”. We hope this clarifies the sentence.
Line 87: here the term used is “introduced”, whereas on line 81 the terms are “exotic” and
“invasive”. Do these terms all mean the same thing, or different things?
For clarity we replaced the terms “exotic” and “invasive” on line 81 with “introduced”.
Lines 228-229: this argument is making a connection between retractable claws/specialized
dentition and success at capturing small prey, but I don’t understand this prey-size
connection. Another felid, the tiger, has both adaptations and is efficient at capturing large
prey. Please explain the connection between claws/dentition and ability to capture small
prey.
Agreed, we have removed the prey-size connection in this sentence.
Lines 232-233: I suggest adding a qualifier to this statement, such as “potentially were not
high enough”, because the proposed explanation is one of multiple possible explanations.
Thanks, we agree and have included the qualifier as suggested.
Lines 234-236: this statement does not follow logically from the prior statement. The prior
statement is a comparative one, showing that cats do less prey-switching than dingoes and
foxes, whereas this statement is an absolute one, which appears to apply only to cats. OK,
so alternate prey are not available; but then why do foxes and dingoes switch to alternate
prey? Please clarify. Also, “base density” is rather vague. I know what you are trying to
say, but it is best to be explicit.
We agree with your suggestions and have changed the statements to enhance statement
connectivity. We also replaced “base density” with “densities of…. during bust stages”. We have
also replaced the use of the words “base density” throughout the manuscript.
Line 248: what is meant by “larger predators”? I assume that means dingoes and foxes,
but if so, this is confusing because the passage is about how all three predators prefer the
long-haired rat, not just dingoes and foxes.
Agreed, therefore we have changed the statement to suggest that the red fox and feral cat prefer
the long-haired rat (as smaller predators, due to the rat’s ease of capture, preference for open
environments etc.), in addition to the dingo (as the rat is a heavier prey item).
Lines 248-251: I do not understand this statement. The comparison is between systems
that did or did not irrupt; why is that important? What is meant by “much greater
disparity” (please be more specific)? “Between” refers to two entities, yet three are listed;
do you mean cats and foxes combined, compared with dingoes? If so, please make that
clear and also explain why cats and foxes are combined.
We have reworded this statement to increase clarity. We have clarified that it was not between
systems in which small mammal irruptions occurred and did not occur, but between irruptive
systems in which long-haired rats did irrupt or did not irrupt (i.e. other species were irrupting at
the time). We removed “much greater disparity” and “between”, to simplify.
Lines 316-317: I think that the singular “trap” cannot be “spaced apart”; hence, how
about changing “Each individual pitfall trap was” to “Individual pitfall traps were”?
We agree with this suggestion and have made the change. Thank you.
Reviewer: 3
1. P3-4 (L66-82). The authors frame their study as an unusual example of investigating
predator responses in non-cyclic (rather than cyclic) irruptions of prey. That might be the
case, but the manuscript could be improved by more explicitly discussing why the
distinction between non-cyclic and cyclic systems is interesting, specifically regarding the
key comparison of generalist vs specialist predators. That is, why would we expect the
disparity between generalist vs specialist predators in non-cyclic systems to be
fundamentally different than that in cyclic prey systems? The authors argue that greater
dietary flexibility might be necessary in non-cyclic systems, which seems reasonable. But,
wouldn’t we still expect that generalist predators would be more apt to exhibit dietary
flexibility in non-cyclic systems, similar to cyclic systems? A stronger, more explicit
framing of the generalist-specialist dichotomy in reference to non-cyclic systems specifically
would be helpful; indeed, generalist or specialists are not even mentioned in this critical
paragraph.
We agree with your suggestion that a more explicit framing of the generalist-specialist
dichotomy in reference to non-cyclic systems would be helpful. At lines 75-83, in particular, we
have now included discussion of how predators may use prey in the context of
specialist/generalist feeding strategies.
And, the discussion of the impacts of predators on prey (P3, L78-82) seems somewhat
tangential, given no data were collected on such impacts and it is not a focus of this
manuscript.
We partially agree with your suggestion here and have reduced and rephrased this discussion.
We did not delete this section in its entirely, however, as while with our data we could not
determine specifically whether/how predators contribute to the overall decline of the small
mammal populations and species we studied, we did use our selectivity analysis (use of small
mammal by predators relative to small mammal availability in the environment) to discuss
potential impacts of predators on small mammal species. Thus, there is some relevance in terms
of discussing the impacts of predators on prey in this system.
More generally, as the authors explain in the Introduction and Discussion, it is well-known
that generalist predators often display dietary shifts in response to prey fluctuations,
particularly in comparison to specialist predators. Thus, the primary conclusion that
carnivores with more generalized diets (red foxes and dingoes) shifted their diet more than
a carnivore with a more specialized diet (domestic cats) is not at all surprising, thus
diminishing its novelty and impact. I realize, however, that such subjective evaluations of
the impact or importance of a manuscript are not valid selection criteria for publication in
Royal Society Open Science. Nonetheless, I think there are opportunities to rework or
reframe some text to enhance both impact and importance of the manuscript. I’ve tried to
make such suggestions throughout my review.
Many thanks for your insightful review, the authors have done their best to address your
suggestions.
2. P4, L89. The “generalist” nature of feral cats seems somewhat overstated here,
particularly in relation to a broad generalist omnivore such as the red fox. In contrast to
foxes, aren’t feral cats strict carnivores?
Although the cited papers have described the feral cat as “generalist”, we agree that this
description may be somewhat overstated here, therefore we removed the term “generalist” and
replaced it with “dietary flexibility”.
3. P5, L98-104. Short paragraph, contributing to choppy feel at end of Introduction.
Consider combining with next paragraph to create one concluding paragraph.
We combined the two paragraphs as suggested.
4. P5, L112-117. The explanation of the third hypothesis is somewhat unclear and
awkwardly worded, across 2 sentences. Could rework to tighten and clarify.
We agree and have reworked these hypotheses to tighten and improve clarity.
5. P6, L118-121. This sentence seems somewhat tangential and out of place. Contributes to
the awkward feel towards the end of the Introduction. Overall, I’d suggest reworking this
last paragraph to condense and tighten.
Thanks, we agree and thus have removed this sentence and reworked the paragraph, condensing
it substantially.
6. P6, L140. Judging by Figure 2, it appears as if small mammals also declined in the bust
stage for cats as well (more so for the early bust stage), albeit less so than foxes and dingoes.
I’d consider acknowledging this pattern evident in Figure 2.
While we agree that Figure 2 might indicate that the dietary composition of small mammals
dropped somewhat from the decline to the early bust stage for the feral cat, this result was not
supported by statistical tests (i.e. pair-wise analyses listed around line 144) and such an
acknowledgement might lead the reader to believe that the slight drop indicated that the cat was
including (statistically) less of the small mammal prey type in its diet during this stage. Therefore
we decided not to acknowledge the pattern, although we have altered that sentence slightly in
order to hopefully remove the need to acknowledge the pattern.
7. P7, L146-147. I found the wording here to be a bit confusing. The parentheticals seem
to suggest that the pairwise comparisons for “Boom, Decline” and for “Late bust, Early
bust” were statistically significant, when they were not according to Table 1. I realize that
is not your intent, but clarification would help.
Noted and we agree. We have clarified the wording here as suggested.
8. P7, L149-150. Same comment as above. Some readers might think the text states that
that the pairwise comparison for “Boom, Decline” and for “Late bust, Early bust”, as listed
is Table 1, were statistically significant, which is not your intent.
Again noted and again we agree. Changed wording as above.
