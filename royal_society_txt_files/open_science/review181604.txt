The manuscript describes transcriptomic changes in mammary glands of sheep affected with
clinical mastitis compared to healthy mammary tissues. The study resulted in the typical long list
of DEGs, that were subsequently grouped into a meaningful functional categorization. Validation
of RNA-seq results was done for a few genes with RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. The
study was well-conducted and as transcriptome data of clinical mastitis in sheep are yet not
available it represents an important addition to literature.

This is an interesting manuscript studying the transcriptome signature of clinical mastitis in
sheep.
Although the manuscript is well written, the sample size is small and the authors used very mild
significant thresholds. Stricter significant thresholds-at least adjusting for multiple testing- should
be performed for the Differential Expression analysis. All the analysis related to co-expression,
pathway and network analysis etc should be repeated using only the DE results after adjusting
for multiple testing using for example FDR correction.
Moreover, the whole discussion should be re-written in a more focused way with in depth
comparisons among the present studies and previous studies on the topic. The authors also miss
recent publications on the topic for example
https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3982-1

Material and Methods:
The authors talk about natural infection-clinical mastitis without clarifying which was the
causing agent. Did they perform microbiological analysis to identify the responsible pathogen?
Was the responsible pathogen the same for all three cases?
Line 22: The current reference genome version is Ovis aries v3.1. The authors mention that they
are using Oar_v4.0 genomic dataset. Could the authors give some more details on these?
Line 36: I assume that the P <0.05 is the uncorrected P value and not the adjusted after FDR
correction. I am wondering how many genes remain significantly differentially expressed after
adjusting for multiple testing using FDR correction.
A P <0.05 is a very mild threshold and the results could be false positive. This should be amended
and the genes which are presented as differentially expressed should be the ones which remain
significant after correcting for multiple testing.
Did you find in the two groups any differentially spliced genes?

Response to Reviewer 2 Comments
Point 1: This is an interesting manuscript studying the transcriptome signature of clinical
mastitis in sheep. Although the manuscript is well written, the sample size is small and the
authors used very mild significant thresholds. Stricter significant thresholds-at least adjusting
or multiple testing- should be performed for the Differential Expression analysis. All the
analysis related to co-expression, pathway and network analysis etc should be repeated using
only the DE results after adjusting for multiple testing using for example FDR correction.
Response 1: Thank you very much for your comments. Admittedly, in the present study, the
sample size is small, but it meets the minimum biological research requirement. In many
elevant literatures published recently, the sample size is also n=3. [Reference 1: Zhang H,

n our ongoing study, we selected more sample size (n=5) to reveal the specific regulator
mechanisms of key candidate genes and pathways in mastitic sheep mammary glands
experimentally infected with single or mixed bacteria isolated from infected animals used in
his study.
According to your comment, we re-screen the differentially expressed genes in healthy and
mastitic groups based on thresholds of |log2(fold change)| > 1 and FDR < 0.05. All results
elated to clustering heatmap, GO annotation, pathway enrichment, co-expression network,
protein-protein interaction network etc were also re-analyzed according to differential gene
esults after FDR correction.
Point 2: The whole discussion should be re-written in a more focused way with in depth
comparisons among the present studies and previous studies on the topic. The authors also miss
ecent publications on the topic for example
https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3982-1
Response 2: Thank you very much for your comment and suggestion. We have re-written the
whole “Discussion” in our revised version according to the comment. In revised manuscript,
we also cited this recent reference in “Discussion” part.
Point 3: Material and Methods: The authors talk about natural infection-clinical mastitis
without clarifying which was the causing agent. Did they perform microbiological analysis to
dentify the responsible pathogen? Was the responsible pathogen the same for all three cases?
Response 3: Thank you very much for your comment. We have to apologize for not
description in our “Material and Methods”. During experiment, sheep milk samples derived
rom right udder of 45 clinical cases were collected, and pathogens from each sample were
solated and identified by Gram staining and biochemical methods. In this study, we selected
hree mastitic sheep were all caused by mixed infections with Staphylococcus aureus and
Escherichia coli.
Point 4: Line 22: The current reference genome version is Ovis aries v3.1. The authors mention
hat they are using Oar_v4.0 genomic dataset. Could the authors give some more details on
hese?
Response 4: Thank you very much for your comment. We are very sorry for our
negligence. In our revised manuscript, we have provided the URL address on Oar_v4.0
genomic dataset used in this study. For details, please see “3.3. Quality control of raw data and
mapping reads to the genome” section.
Point 5: Line 36: I assume that the P < 0.05 is the uncorrected P value and not the adjusted
after FDR correction. I am wondering how many genes remain significantly differentially
expressed after adjusting for multiple testing using FDR correction. A P < 0.05 is a very mild
hreshold and the results could be false positive. This should be amended and the genes which
are presented as differentially expressed should be the ones which remain significant after
correcting for multiple testing.
Response 5: Thank you very much for your invaluable comments and suggestions. As you can
see in the answer of Point 3, in our revised manuscript, we re-identified 420 significantly
differentially expressed genes based FDR < 0.05. GO terms and KEGG pathways were
eanalyzed, and GO terms and pathways enriched significantly by these differentially expressed
genes were re-screened with a criterion corrected p < 0.05. We have made correction in
evised version of this paper, as shown in “3.5. Functional annotation and pathway analysis of
DEGs”.
Point 6: Did you find in the two groups any differentially spliced genes?
Response 6: Thank you very much for your comment. We identified some differentially spliced
genes in the two groups by rMATS analysis based on a threshold of FDR < 0.05, and these
esults have been supplemented in our revised manuscript. For details, please see “4.6.
dentification of genes with differential splicing events” and “figure 7”.
