Dear authors,
The fabrication of BiVO4 via simple electrodeposition and annealing method over the TiO2/Ti
substrate followed by their photoelectrochemical properties are investigated in detail. The
morphological and charge carrier separation from SEM and EIS respectively finds some
interesting aspects. The organization of the article is excellent and discussions presented are
adequate to carefully follow the work. A revision according to the listed comments are needed for
more understanding.
Major comments
(1) The charge carrier transfer pathways considering the band edge potentials of TiO2 and BiVO4
may also be provided to under carrier separation-recombination dynamics.
Minor comments
Abstract
(1) The electrodeposition method may be expressed more clearly for understanding. The term
3
‘annealing of vanadium precursor solution’ is confusing and requires language editing!
(2) The results of materials characterization may be briefly highlighted.
Introduction
(1) Add review ‘Applied Surface Science 355 (2015) 939-958’ along with ref. [14].
(2) The introduction must be made more comprehensive to convey the scope of the work: (i)
advantage of TiO2 followed by heterostructuring with other semiconductors; (ii) merit of BiVO4;
(iii) previous reports on TiO2/BiVO4 composites; (iv) scope of the present work highlighting the
electrodeposition method, TiO2/Ti substrate, and photoelectrochemical properties.
Experimental procedure
(1) The deposition of BiVO4 requires clarification: (i) Bi precursor was electrodeposited on the
electrode, while BiVO4 was obtained only after immersing the electrode in V-precursor followed
by annealing. If this is the scenario, the content must be rewritten clearly; (ii) the immersing time
and reaction conditions (temperature, sonication) of electrode in V-precursor solution must be
specified to ensure reproducibility; (iii) it may not be appropriate to quote ‘annealing in
VO(acac)2 + DMSO solution’.
(2) Does the structural feature vary if TiO2/Ti electrode is immersed in the solution containing
Bi(NO3)3 and VO(acac)2 for the specified time and followed by annealing? This may be
addressed with reasonable experimental support.
(3) Typo: materialsls? (Sec. 2.3)
Results and discussion
(1) Indicate the crystal structures of BiVO4 and TiO2.
(2) The XRD patterns of TiO2/Ti after electrodepositing the Bi must also be provided for
understanding.
(3) The experimental support regarding the V2O5 formation and removal as claimed may be
supplemented.
(4) The optical properties for all the samples must be provided for comparison.

List of Responses
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning our
manuscript entitled “Preparation of nanoporous BiVO4/TiO2/Ti films through
electrodeposition for photoelectrochemical water splitting” (ID: RSOS-180728).
Those comments are all valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our
paper, as well as the important guiding significance to our researches. We have
studied comments carefully and have made correction which we hope meet with
approval. Revised portion are marked in red in the paper. The main corrections in
the paper and the responds to the reviewer’s comments are as following:
Responds to the reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer #1:
Response to comments: The authors report the fabrication of Ti/TiO2/BiVO4 films
for PEC water spilitting. The manuscript was quite poorly prepared, there are lot
type and grammar errors. And the presented results are not convinced. I don't think
it is suitable for publication in its current form.
Response: the whole manuscript was modified, and the revised portion is marked in
red in the paper. The type and grammar errors were modified. All of the UV spectra
were added and the band gap of the as-prepared materials was obtained to support
our results.
For example:nanoporus was modified to nanoporous.
Reviewer #2
Response to Major comments:
(1) The charge carrier transfer pathways considering the band edge potentials of
TiO2 and BiVO4 may also be provided to under carrier separation-recombination
dynamics.
Response: In order to provided the charge carrier transfer pathway. The UV–vis
absorption spectra and Tauc plot of nanoporous TiO2/Ti film and BiVO4 /TiO2/Ti
heterojunction film prepared with different electrodeposition times was shown in
Figure 3. And the band gap of semiconductor can be calculated by employing the
following equation [29].
(ahv)2= hv-Eg (1)
where a is the absorption coefficient, v is the light frequency, Eg is the band gap of a
semiconductor. From the curve of the (ahv)2 versus the hv shown in Figure 3(b), the
energy of the band gap of TiO2/Ti film is 3.20 eV, which is the same as the results
reported before[30]. The band gap energy of the BiVO4/TiO2/Ti film with 10 s, 30 s,
100 s, 500 s and 1000 s electrodeposition time is calculated to be 2.98 eV, 2.83 eV,
2.62 eV, 2.58 eV and 2.53eV, respectively.
The schematic of energy bands and charge transfers at BiVO4/TiO2/Ti film was
shown in Figure 7. The excited electrons in TiO2 facilely transported by the
conductive Ti, and directed to the Pt counter electrode via the external circuit. And
the photogenerated electrons were scavenged by hydrogen ions on the Pt foil, while
the photogenerated holes oxidized water on the surface of the BiVO4/TiO2/Ti.
Minor comment:
Abstract
(1) Response to comments: The electrodeposition method may be expressed more
clearly for understanding. The term annealing of vanadium precursor solution is
confusing and requires language editing!
Response: The electrodeposition method was expressed as follows: Nanoporous
BiVO4 /TiO2/Ti film was successfully fabricated by electrodeposit nanoporous BiOI
film on the nanoporous TiO2 arrays followed by annealing at 450°C for 2h. And the
annealing of vanadium precursor solution was rewritten to annealing at 450°C for
2h.
(2)Response to comments: The results of materials characterization may be briefly
highlighted.
Response: The results of materials characterization was rewritten as follows: UV-vis
spectrum absorption studies confirmed an increase in absorption intensities with
increasing electrodeposition time, and the band gap of BiVO4/TiO2/Ti film is lower
than that of TiO2/Ti. The photocatalytic efficiency of BiVO4/TiO2/Ti heterojunction
film was higher compared to that of the TiO2/Ti film owing to the longer transient
decay time for BiVO4/TiO2/Ti film (3.2 s) than that of TiO2/Ti film (0.95 s) in our
experiment. The BiVO4/TiO2/Ti heterojunction film prepared by electrodeposition
for 1000 s followed by annealing showed a high photocurrent density of 0.3363
mA/cm2 at 0.6 V vs. saturated calomel electrode. Furthermore, the lowest charge
transfer resistance from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was recorded for
the BiVO4/TiO2/Ti film (1000 s) under irradiation.
Introduction
(1)Response to comments: Add review “Applied Surface Science 355 (2015) 939-
958” along with ref. [14].
Response: The Reference number of “Applied Surface Science 355 (2015) 939-958”
is [15] added.
Also some other references were also added in our revised paper.
(2) Response to comment: The introduction must be more comprehensive to convey
the scope of the work: (i) advantage of TiO2 followed by heterostructuring with
other semiconductors; (ii) merit of BiVO4; (iii) previous reports on TiO2/BiVO4
composites; (iv) scope of the present work highlighting the electrodeposition
method, TiO2/Ti substrate, and photoelectrochemical properties.
Response: (i) The advantage of TiO2 followed by heterostructuring with
semiconductors is added. For example, ‘Among these heterogeneous materials,
BiVO4/TiO2 remains one of the best photocatalytic materials due to the low cost of
TiO2 and the faster electron transfer properties’.
(ii) The merit of BiVO4 was given as follows: BiVO4 has attracted significant
attention because of its high photocatalytic activity in oxygen evolution under the
external bias. However, the conduction band level is low and it is unsuitable for O2
formation.
(iii) Concerning the BiVO4/TiO2, most of the BiVO4/TiO2 electrodes were prepared
through sol-gel, metal organic decomposition, chemical thermal deposition and
spinning[19-22. The efficient charge transfer between BiVO4 and TiO2 has already
reported[23]. Nanoporous TiO2/ Ti arrays has been successfully prepared by anodic
oxidation and the electrocatalytic properties has also been extensively
analysed[24].. And the previous work about TiO2/BiVO4 has been mentioned
(iv) The electrodepositon was highlighted as : few reports have been done to put
porous BiVO4 film onto the nanoporous TiO2/ Ti arrays through electrodeposit BiOI
film followed by sintering method.
Experimental procedure
(1) Response to comment: The deposition of BiVO4 requires clarification: (i) Bi
precursor was electrodeposited on the electrode, while BiVO4 was obtained only
after immersing the electrode in V-precursor followed by annealing. If this is the
scenario, the content must be rewritten clearly; (ii) the immersing time and reaction
conditions (temperature, sonication) of electrode in V-precursor solution must be
specified to ensure reproducibility; (iii) it may not be appropriate to quote
‘annealing in VO(acac)2 + DMSO solution’.
Response: The deposition of BiVO4 was clarified. (i) the 0.2 M vanadyl
acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide was drop-cast onto the
working electrode with volume of 1mL followed by heating in muffle furnace at
450<U+2103> for 2h in air. (ii) Reference 27 was given. (iii) the ‘annealing in VO(acac)2 +
DMSO solution’ was modified to be ‘vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) dissolved
in dimethyl sulfoxide’.
(2) Response to comment: Does the structural feature vary if TiO2/Ti electrode is
immersed in the solution containing Bi(NO3)3 and VO(acac)2 for the specified time
and followed by annealing? This may be addressed with reasonable experimental
support.
Response: the variation of structural feature of TiO2/Ti electrode was shown in
Figure 1. The detail of structureal feature variation of TiO2 nanotube arrays
corresponding to annealing temperature has been studied by others [27]. And in our
experiment procedure, 450°C is used because the feature of TiO2 nanotube is stable
under this temperatue.
(3) Response to comments Typo: materialsls?
Response: I am sorry. The materialsls was modified to be materials.
Results and discussion
(1) Response to comments: Indicate the crystal structures of BiVO4 and TiO2.
Response: the crystal structures of BiVO4 and TiO2 was added.
(2) Response to comments: The XRD patterns of TiO2/Ti after electrodepositing the
Bi must also be provided for understanding.
Response: The XRD pattern of TiO2/Ti after electrodepositing the Bi was provided in
Figure 1(a).
(3) Response to comments: The experimental support regarding the V2O5 formation
and removal as claimed may be supplemented.
Response: The reference [25, 26] was added, we can find the experimental support
clearly in the reference.
(4) Response to comments: The optical properties for all the samples must be
provided for comparison.
Response: The optical properties of all samples has been characterized once more.
And the new data was put in Figure 3.
(4) Response to comments: Figure 4: Typo – blue color line: it should be ‘film’
instead of ‘f’!
Response: the film was added instead of f. I am sorry.
(6) Response to comments: Figure 6: The text inside the figure must be made clear.
Response: Figure 6 has been modified.
(7) Response to comments: In addition to electrodeposition time of Bi, annealing
with V-precursor also plays a major role in optimizing the performance which needs
to be discussed.
Response: This topic is complex. Because of the structure of TiO2 will also changed
along with the sintering temperature. And the further work of the effects of
annealing temperature on the photocataylitic properties of BiVO4/TiO2/Ti films will
be done.
Conclusion
(1) Response to comments: Typo: electrodephotion?
Response: We are very sorry for our incorrect writing. It’s elctrodeposition.
We tried our best to improve the manuscript and made some changes in the
manuscript. These changes will not influence the content and framework of the
paper. And here we did not list the changes but marked in red in revised paper.
We appreciate for Editors/Reviewers’ warm work earnestly, and hope that the
correction will meet with approval.
Once again, thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.
