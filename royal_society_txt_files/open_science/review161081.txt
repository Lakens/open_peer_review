Surbeck et al use strong statistical methods, developed for the purpose, to assess a series of prior
reports about patterns of sex-specific association in chimpanzees and bonobos. Their sample size
(5 chimpanzee communities, 2 bonobo communities) is a substantial increase compared to the
typical pattern of reporting on a single community and comparing with previous data. Their
conclusions generally confirm previous understandings, but there are nuanced improvements.
This study takes previous more informal findings to a new level of confidence, as well as
introducing a valuable new method for assessing associations.
The analysis uses an elegantly conservative approach of asking, for each individual, who their
“top” and “most significant” associates are. While I suspect that the answer is influenced rather
little by individual differences within a community in the frequency of being observed, I
recommend that this question be directly addressed. For example, in the large community at
Ngogo adult males are better habituated, and more frequently seen, than some adult females. By
coding females according to their degree of habituation, it should be possible to tell whether
degree of habituation influences the estimated tendency for females to have other females as their
top associates, etc. This is not quite the same as controlling for gregariousness, since individuals
can differ in their frequency of being observed either because they vary in how shy they are, or
because they vary in their readiness to associate with other chimpanzees (or both).
163-166 The theoretical rationale is clear for expecting that in chimpanzees “males have
principally other males as top and significant associates”. But no reasons are given for expecting
that “females have other females as top and significant associates”, or that in bonobos there will
be “a limited impact of close maternal kinship (mother-son and maternal brothers) on those
association patterns for both sexes”. The reasons need to be given. These predictions seem to be
based on prior reports rather than theoretical grounds. But if there is a theory for why (for
example) female chimpanzees “have other females as top and significant associates”, it needs to
be stated.
167 “In bonobos, with weak between-group competition…” Say what “weak between-group
competition” means.
182 At 10 years of age female chimpanzees are in early adolescence and have not reached the
typical age at which they would emigrate. As Pusey (1983) and subsequent reports have shown, if
these females have living mothers they have very strong associations with them, which would
almost certainly normally be “top” and “significant” in Surbeck et al’s terms. Depending on how
many of these adolescent females are in the data-set, results could therefore be influenced rather
strongly by female-female kinship. This problem needs to be acknowledged or dealt with (e.g. by
showing that there are too few young females for this to be a problem).
184 “e.g.” should be “i.e.”
197 The fact that “the vast majority of females are not maternal siblings or mother-offspring”
(which presumably should read “the vast majority of female dyads…”) is not sufficient to reject
the possibility that a female’s “top” associate is regularly a close kin. The difficulty is that a high
proportion of daughters could remain in their natal communities and associate with their
mothers as top associates, while it would still be true that “the vast majority of female dyads are
not maternal siblings or mother-offspring”. This is a problem given that Surbeck et al “assumed
no such close maternal kin relationships existed females in our data set” (198). They need to
address this problem since it potentially undermines the conclusion that kinship is not an
important influence on female association in chimpanzees (e.g. p. 21, and elsewhere).
NB Surbeck et al do note in 201-202 that conclusions about the effects of close maternal
kinship on association patterns should be viewed with caution, but given their assumption of no
close maternal kin relationships in the data set, their cautionary remark is not strong enough.
3
Cf. Table 2 refers to “controlling for kinship” as if applying to female as well as male
chimpanzees, but it is meaningless to refer to controlling for female-female kinship, if an absence
of close maternal kin relationships is assumed a priori.
249-266 The GLMMs appear to treat the 5 chimpanzee communities as independent. But
individuals in the 3 Taï communities could plausibly show relatively similar patterns of
association to each other. So I recommend treating ‘study population’ as a random intercept or
finding some other way to solve this problem.
357 “In both species, maternal kin were more likely to be top associates than other
individuals”. In chimpanzees, is this because the results are dominated by associations among
males?
413 “50” is an odd reference here.
422-425 “Males’ tendency to associate primarily with other males might also be driven by the
benefits derived from hunting as a group since the number of male participants in a hunt
increases the likelihood of success in both eastern and western chimpanzees”. Although this
observation is true, Gilby et al (2015, Phil Trans Roy Soc) have shown that the reason for group
hunts being more successful is not because of a generalized increase in the number of males.
Instead, hunts are more successful when groups are larger because in larger groups there is an
increased chance of a specific ‘impact male’ being present. That finding presents a different
perspective from the implication (in 422-425) that association with ‘males in general’ promotes
hunting success.
443 “in Taï.. females use the entire community home range…” This is stated as if it is
different from chimpanzees in eastern Africa. However, females in eastern populations also use
the entire community range: as implied in 439-442, those females concentrate their range use in
limited core areas, but still use the whole range. To establish a difference between Taï and eastern
populations, a more nuanced comment is needed.
486 Ref 113 is submitted, not published.
530 The idea that male bottlenosed dolphins associate only for reproductive purposes is true
at an ultimate level (but so it is for chimpanzees and any other species). But it is not true at a
proximate level, as 531 et seq indicates.

This paper covers an interesting topic can could potentially provide a valuable contribution to the
literature - the language is acceptable, but not always clear. I can see the importance of testing
the stated hypotheses. Statistically, the analysis uses multilevel models and I think these are
appropriate given the hypotheses to be tested. However, it is the way the draft is written makes it
difficult to disentangle the precise details of the methodological approaches.
Some minor points:

General comments
This paper aimed to elucidate the differences and similarities in the association with members of
same or different sex in chimpanzees and bonobos by comparing party composition of 5 groups
of chimpanzees and 3 groups of bonobos. Although most of the results are similar to those of
previous studies on these species, there have been few studies that examined such tendencies by
comparing plural groups and species using the same standardized methodologies and elaborated
5
statistical tests. Therefore, this study is very valuable in providing us a clear image of differences
in association patterns between chimpanzees and bonobos. I have some minor concerns about the
insufficient explanation about the equations used for indices on the association, insufficient
references to preceding studies, and insufficient explanation about one of the main results of this
paper. However, I would recommend publication of this paper if those concerns are properly
addressed.

Specific comments
Line 103-104: Refer to the following papers that documented mother’s support towards sons:
Furuichi T. 1997. Agonistic interactions and matrifocal dominance rank of wild bonobos (Pan
paniscus) at Wamba. Int J Primatol 18:855-875.
Furuichi T. 2011. Female Contributions to the Peaceful Nature of Bonobo Society. Evol Anthropol
20(4):131-142.
Line 105-107: Refer to the following paper that first documented the peaceful encounter between
groups of bonobos:
Idani G. 1990. Relations between unit-groups of Bonobos at Wamba, Zaire: encounters and
temporary fusions. Afr Study Monogr 11(3):153-186.
Lines 184-186: Refer to the paper #115, or other papers if existing, that proposed this
methodology of checking members within one hour observation.
Line 182-183: The earliest record of the reproduction of wild chimpanzees is 9.5 years. See the
following paper:
Sugiyama Y, Fujita S. 2011. The demography and reproductive parameters of Bossou
chimpanzees. In Matsuzawa T et al. (eds) The chimpanzees of Bossou and Nimba. Springer, pp
23-34.
Lines 186-188: As shown in the paper #115, the 1-hour party method will represent a large
proportion of members present in the party but not all of them. Therefore, the method used for
Lomako bonobos would represent larger proportion of the party members. Please explain
whether a bias caused by such difference in methodologies may or may not affect the results of
statistical analyses in this paper.
Lines 195-199: This sentence about the immigration of females in chimpanzees and bonobos is too
much simplified and incorrect. For bonobos, authors may want to say that all females emigrate
from their natal community to join new communities during late juvenile hood or early
adolescence by citing the following paper:
Sakamaki T, Behncke I, Laporte M, Mulavwa M, Ryu H, Takemoto H, Tokuyama H, Yamamoto S,
Yangozene K, Furuichi T. 2016. Intergroup transfer of females and social relationships between
immigrants and residents in bonobo (Pan paniscus) societies. In: Furuichi T, Aureli F, Yamagiwa J
(eds), Dispersing primate females. Springer, pp. 127-164.
For chimpanzees, recent review showed that a considerable number of females stay and
reproduce in their natal communities, especially in eastern chimpanzees (50% in Gombe and 10%
in Mahale):
Stumpf RM. 2011. Chimpanzees and bonobos: Inter- and intra-species diversity. In: Campbell CJ,
Fuentes A, MacKinnon KC, Bearder SK, Stumpf RM, editors. Primates in Perspective, 2nd
Edition. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p 340-356.
Therefore, authors need to explain why they can assume that no close maternal kin relationships
existed among females in their data set.
6
Line 218-221: PAV is given by unfamiliar equations in which differences between observed SRI
and expected SRI is divided by 1-expected SRI (when observed SRI is larger) or by expected SRI
(when expected SRI is larger). However, there is no explanation about the use of such equations.
PAV cannot be given simply by observed SRI minus expected SRI? If not, why use of such
equations are justified?
Line 301: Why SK is given by sum of cube of PAV minus mean PAV? Why authors do not use
square of PAV minus mean PAV that is commonly used for evaluation of variance? Please
explain.
Line 404-406: Authors showed that top associate for male bonobos are females because males
tend to frequently associate with their mother (see lines 365-371 in results and lines 465-475 in
discussions). If so, the result that the association patterns were most differentiated from males
towards females in bonobos (lines 385-387) might be resulted from very high association of males
with their mother. Isn’t it possible to examine such possibility by controlling for kinship as
authors did so for the analyses on top associate and significant associates? If such examination is
impossible for some reasons, please at least mention about such possibility in discussions.
Line 431-437: The paper #62 on chimpanzees in Kalinzu showed that females used a common
range and associated with females more frequently than with males as is shown by this study.
However, unlike this study, the association among females was less differentiated than the
association among males (see Fig. 5.6). Please include discussion about this difference in this
paragraph.
Line 475-476: Cite two papers that I mentioned on lines 103-104.

Surbeck et al use strong statistical methods, developed for the purpose, to assess a series of prior
reports about patterns of sex-specific association in chimpanzees and bonobos. Their sample size
(5 chimpanzee communities, 2 bonobo communities) is a substantial increase compared to the
typical pattern of reporting on a single community and comparing with previous data. Their
conclusions generally confirm previous understandings, but there are nuanced improvements.
This study takes previous more informal findings to a new level of confidence, as well as
introducing a valuable new method for assessing associations.
The analysis uses an elegantly conservative approach of asking, for each individual, who their

because they vary in their readiness to associate with other chimpanzees (or both).
163-166 The theoretical rationale is clear for expecting that in chimpanzees “males have
principally other males as top and significant associates”. But no reasons are given for expecting
that “females have other females as top and significant associates”, or that in bonobos there will
be “a limited impact of close maternal kinship (mother-son and maternal brothers) on those
association patterns for both sexes”. The reasons need to be given. These predictions seem to be
based on prior reports rather than theoretical grounds. But if there is a theory for why (for
example) female chimpanzees “have other females as top and significant associates”, it needs to
be stated.
167 “In bonobos, with weak between-group competition…” Say what “weak between-group

finding some other way to solve this problem.
357 “In both species, maternal kin were more likely to be top associates than other
individuals”. In chimpanzees, is this because the results are dominated by associations among
males?
413 “50” is an odd reference here.
422-425 “Males’ tendency to associate primarily with other males might also be driven by the
benefits derived from hunting as a group since the number of male participants in a hunt
increases the likelihood of success in both eastern and western chimpanzees”. Although this
observation is true, Gilby et al (2015, Phil Trans Roy Soc) have shown that the reason for group
hunts being more successful is not because of a generalized increase in the number of males.
Instead, hunts are more successful when groups are larger because in larger groups there is an
increased chance of a specific ‘impact male’ being present. That finding presents a different
10

hunting success.

PAV cannot be given simply by observed SRI minus expected SRI? If not, why use of such

tend to frequently associate with their mother (see lines 365-371 in results and lines 465-475 in
discussions). If so, the result that the association patterns were most differentiated from males
towards females in bonobos (lines 385-387) might be resulted from very high association of males
with their mother. Isn’t it possible to examine such possibility by controlling for kinship as
authors did so for the analyses on top associate and significant associates? If such examination is
impossible for some reasons, please at least mention about such possibility in discussions.

r Prof. Padian,
would like to thank you and the reviewers very much for your input and the
e you took to review our manuscript RSOS-161081 entitled "Sex-specific
ociation patterns in bonobos and chimpanzees reflect species differences
cooperation".
the revised version, we explain better how our analytical approach
trols for individual differences in observation frequencies and maternal
atedness, and we give more information about the percentage of dyads that
closely related. We also discuss in more detail how variation in these
tors might affect our conclusions. Furthermore, we introduce the
tistical models more broadly to guide the reader in the method section.
ow we comment in more detail on each issue raised by reviewers and explain
we addressed it in the revised version of the manuscript in bold and
lic. We think the revisions have strengthened the manuscript and we would
e to thank you for accepting our manuscript for publication in Royal
iety Open Science.

ments to the Author(s)
beck et al use strong statistical methods, developed for the purpose, to
ess a series of prior reports about patterns of sex-specific association
chimpanzees and bonobos. Their sample size (5 chimpanzee communities, 2
obo communities) is a substantial increase compared to the typical pattern
reporting on a single community and comparing with previous data. Their
clusions generally confirm previous understandings, but there are nuanced
rovements. This study takes previous more informal findings to a new level
confidence, as well as introducing a valuable new method for assessing
ociations.
analysis uses an elegantly conservative approach of asking, for each
ividual, who their “top” and “most significant” associates are. While I
pect that the answer is influenced rather little by individual differences
hin a community in the frequency of being observed, I recommend that this
stion be directly addressed. For example, in the large community at Ngogo
lt males are better habituated, and more frequently seen, than some adult
ales. By coding females according to their degree of habituation, it
uld be possible to tell whether degree of habituation influences the
imated tendency for females to have other females as their top associates,
. This is not quite the same as controlling for gregariousness, since
ividuals can differ in their frequency of being observed either because
y vary in how shy they are, or because they vary in their readiness to
ociate with other chimpanzees (or both).
thank the reviewer for raising this point and have tried to clarify it. We
e already thinking about the issue raised by the reviewer while coming up
h our measures for dyadic association strength. In order to account for
ividual differences in observation frequencies, we kept the observation
ber per individual constant when generating the expected association value
dyads. However, if an individual was seen very rarely, it leads to a
er power in detecting its significant associates. This is only a problem
we would compare the actual numbers of significant associates. However, we
not see a reason why and how it could influence our comparisons of the sex
s among the top and significant associates. In other words, for shyer
ividuals we might have fewer significant associates, but we are only
erested in whether they are males or females, which is not influenced by
observation frequency.
thermore, the fact that we found a very similar sex specific association
tern across all chimpanzee sites, regardless of the site differences in
habituation state of the females, indicates the robustness of our measure
inst such influences.
make this more explicit to the reader we not only mention this more
arly in the main manuscript in the introduction (L148)and method sections
1ff), but we also add a sentence to the supplementary information section,
re we describe the randomization procedures:
eping the number of observations per individual constant, we accounted for
ividual differences in observation frequencies. While a smaller number of
ervations reduces the power to detect a significant association, it does
influence the measures we used (top associate, sex ratio among
nificant associates).”
-166 The theoretical rationale is clear for expecting that in chimpanzees
les have principally other males as top and significant associates”. But
reasons are given for expecting that “females have other females as top
significant associates”, or that in bonobos there will be “a limited
act of close maternal kinship (mother-son and maternal brothers) on those
ociation patterns for both sexes”. The reasons need to be given. These
dictions seem to be based on prior reports rather than theoretical
unds. But if there is a theory for why (for example) female chimpanzees
ve other females as top and significant associates”, it needs to be
ted.
the revised version of the manuscript we now state the reasons for the
ectations more explicitly as follows:
5ff
ven the potential benefits of socialization of offspring with a same aged
r [74,75], we expected females to have other females as top and
nificant associates. Furthermore, we expected a limited impact of close
ernal kinship (mother-offspring and maternal siblings) on those
ociation patterns among females because of female dispersal [76], and
ng males because large inter-birth intervals reduce the availability of
table closely related cooperation partners [51]”
“In bonobos, with weak between-group competition…” Say what “weak
ween-group competition” means.
specify this in the revised version of the manuscript as follows:
0
th low aggression rates during between-group encounters”
At 10 years of age female chimpanzees are in early adolescence and
e not reached the typical age at which they would emigrate. As Pusey
83) and subsequent reports have shown, if these females have living
hers they have very strong associations with them, which would almost
tainly normally be “top” and “significant” in Surbeck et al’ s terms.
ending on how many of these adolescent females are in the dataset, results
ld therefore be influenced rather strongly by female-female kinship. This
blem needs to be acknowledged or dealt with (e.g. by showing that there
too few young females for this to be a problem).
acknowledge these site differences and their potential influence on our
clusions in the revised version of the manuscript by using the suggested
erence as follows:
3ff
nally, given limitations in the assessment of maternal kinship in this study,
results concerning the influence of close kinship on association patterns
uld be viewed with caution. We know that female chimpanzees remaining in
ir natal community can form strong associations with their mothers [128].
hough we expect the number of undetected mother-daughter dyads to be small,
number of those female dyads in communities potentially affects the strength
the influence of maternal kinship on association patterns.”
“e.g.” should be “i.e.”
8
e
The fact that “the vast majority of females are not maternal siblings
mother-offspring” (which presumably should read “the vast majority of
ale dyads…”) is not sufficient to reject the possibility that a female’s
p” associate is regularly a close kin. The difficulty is that a high
portion of daughters could remain in their natal communities and associate
h their mothers as top associates, while it would still be true that “the
t majority of female dyads are not maternal siblings or mother-offspring”.
s is a problem given that Surbeck et al “assumed no such close maternal
relationships existed females in our data set” (198). They need to
ress this problem since it potentially undermines the conclusion that
ship is not an important influence on female association in chimpanzees
g. p. 21, and elsewhere).
re is probably a misunderstanding here likely due to our confusing
ding: The sentence “assumed no such close maternal kin relationships
sted females in our data set” refers to migrated female maternal siblings
not to resident mother-daughter pairs. As many sites miss a proper
etic analysis of maternal relatedness, we identify maternal siblings as
se individuals who shared the same mother, which is more difficult for
ales if they migrate, however, it might still be possible if they remain
their community.
clarify this we reworded the method part to:
,205ff
e rationale here is first, most females emigrate from their natal
munity to join a new community at adolescence, and second, previous
earch in one chimpanzee community has shown that the vast majority of
ale dyads are not maternal siblings or mother-offspring pairs [76]. Thus,
defined any dyad among adult females, that was not observed from birth to
e the same mother or was not observed as a mother-daughter dyad, to be
elated. Moreover, for many male-male and male-female dyads we were unable
determine whether or not they were maternal siblings, as their mothers
d before sample collection and genotyping were possible.”
thermore, we show the actual percentage of close kinship dyads included
each sex combination in each species in the method section and refer to
le 1 where this information is given separately for each community.
thermore, we added the percentage of mother-offspring pairs in the male-
ale and the female-female dyads in table 1 for each community.
ff
himpanzees: 1.1% of female-female dyads, 2.0 % of male-male dyads, 0.6% of
e-female dyads; bonobos: 0.2% of female-female dyads, 4.5% of male-male
ds, 7.1% of male-female dyads; for more details see Table 1).”
Surbeck et al do note in 201-202 that conclusions about the effects of
se maternal kinship on association patterns should be viewed with caution,
given their assumption of no close maternal kin relationships in the data
, their cautionary remark is not strong enough.
emphasize this limitation by including an additional paragraph in the
ised version of the manuscript:
3ff
nally, given limitations in the assessment of maternal kinship in this study,
results concerning the influence of close kinship on association patterns
uld be viewed with caution. We know that female chimpanzees remaining in
ir natal community can form strong associations with their mothers [128].
hough we expect the number of undetected mother-daughter dyads to be small,
number of those female dyads in communities potentially affects the strength
the influence of maternal kinship on association patterns.”
Table 2 refers to “controlling for kinship” as if applying to female as
l as male chimpanzees, but it is meaningless to refer to controlling for
ale-female kinship, if an absence of close maternal kin relationships is
umed a priori.
completely agree with the reviewer on this if it would be the case, but as
tioned above, there are actually close maternal kin relationships for
ales in this study. To avoid this misunderstanding, we specify the
centage of closely related dyads for each sex combination in the methods
the revised version of the manuscript and refer to figure 1 where this
ormation is given for each site. Furthermore, we added the percentage of
her-offspring pairs in the male-female and the female-female dyads in
le 1 for each community.
ff
himpanzees: 1.1% of female-female dyads, 2.0 % of male-male dyads, 0.6% of
e-female dyads; bonobos: 0.2% of female-female dyads, 4.5% of male-male
ds, 7.1% of male-female dyads; for more details see Table 1).”
-266 The GLMMs appear to treat the 5 chimpanzee communities as independent.
individuals in the 3 Taï communities could plausibly show relatively
ilar patterns of association to each other. So I recommend treating ‘study
ulation’ as a random intercept or finding some other way to solve this
blem.
agree that it would be desirable (and very interesting) to account for
dy population in our models. However, with the current data this seems
y unlikely to be possible (or reveal anything meaningful). In fact, with
bonobo communities from two populations and five chimpanzee communities
m three populations the effects of community and population are largely
ntical and, hence, impossible to disentagle. Furthermore, although with
current model we cannot assess population differences, we are still
fident that these, in case they exist, would be 'taken over’ by the random
ect (random intercept and slopes) of community, in which case they would
ear as clustered (or correlated) 'best linear unbiased predictors' (BLUPs,
yen 2008), which would be hard to detect given the small sample with
ard to the number of communities and populations.
“In both species, maternal kin were more likely to be top associates
n other individuals”. In chimpanzees, is this because the results are
inated by associations among males?
believe, this is unlikely to be the case, given that the number of actual
luded closely related sex-dyads is lowest for males in chimpanzees. This
now apparent to the reader, as we included the actual percentage of
sely related dyads in the methods and refer to table 1 where this
ormation is presented for each community.
ff
himpanzees: 1.1% of female-female dyads, 2.0 % of male-male dyads, 0.6% of

ds, 7.1% of male-female dyads; for more details see Table 1).”

-425 “Males’ tendency to associate primarily with other males might also be
ven by the benefits derived from hunting as a group since the number of
e participants in a hunt increases the likelihood of success in both
tern and western chimpanzees”. Although this observation is true, Gilby et
(2015, Phil Trans Roy Soc) have shown that the reason for group hunts
ng more successful is not because of a generalized increase in the number
males. Instead, hunts are more successful when groups are larger because
larger groups there is an increased chance of a specific ‘impact male’
ng present. That finding presents a different perspective from the
lication (in 422-425) that association with ‘males in general’ promotes
ting success.

uscript:
4ff
wever, given that the hunting success, at least in some eastern chimpanzee
ulations, increases with the presence of good hunters in larger male parties,
ting might be less likely to explain such a general male affinity [106].”
“in Taï.. females use the entire community home range…” This is stated
if it is different from chimpanzees in eastern Africa. However, females in
tern populations also use the entire community range: as implied in 439-
, those females concentrate their range use in limited core areas, but
ll use the whole range. To establish a difference between Taï and eastern
ulations, a more nuanced comment is needed.

The idea that male bottlenosed dolphins associate only for
roductive purposes is true at an ultimate level (but so it is for
mpanzees and any other species). But it is not true at a proximate level,

ociate to cooperate and made this more explicit in the revised version of

tistically, the analysis uses multilevel models and I think these are

ft is written makes it difficult to disentangle the precise details of the
hodological approaches.
order to address the concerns raised by the reviewer we give at the

eral comments
s paper aimed to elucidate the differences and similarities in the
ociation with members of same or different sex in chimpanzees and bonobos
comparing party composition of 5 groups of chimpanzees and 3 groups of
obos. Although most of the results are similar to those of previous
dies on these species, there have been few studies that examined such
dencies by comparing plural groups and species using the same standardized
hodologies and elaborated statistical tests. Therefore, this study is very
uable in providing us a clear image of differences in association patterns
ween chimpanzees and bonobos. I have some minor concerns about the
ufficient explanation about the equations used for indices on the
ociation, insufficient references to preceding studies, and insufficient
lanation about one of the main results of this paper. However, I would
ommend publication of this paper if those concerns are properly addressed.

portion of the party members. Please explain whether a bias caused by such
ference in methodologies may or may not affect the results of statistical
lyses in this paper.
olutely, we have tried to extremely careful in how we compare these
ferences in data collection. They might affect the actual party sizes, and
entially the number of significant associates. For this reason, we
licitly do not compare these measurements between species. We only used
sex ratios in top and significant associates which are unlikely to be
ected by these sampling differences. Furthermore, our randomisation
roach accounts for community differences in party sizes, by keeping them
stant within a given community.
make this more explicit to the reader we have added in the revised version
the manuscript the following sentence:

bonobos is too much simplified and incorrect. For bonobos, authors may

chimpanzees, recent review showed that a considerable number of females

mpanzees (50% in Gombe and 10% in Mahale):

this is usually the case, however a recent study at LuiKotale identified
least one female that remained with her mother in their natal community

e to these methodological limitations, our analyses regarding the effects
close maternal kinship on association patterns should be viewed with

ir degree of female dispersal [50,84,86].”
thermore, we included a section in the discussion discussing the
lications of it:

refore, authors need to explain why they can assume that no close maternal
relationships existed among females in their data set.
mentioned in the reply to reviewer 1, the formulation here was very
ortunate and what we mean is that we assumed no such close maternal kin
ationships among non-natal females in our data set. Furthermore, we
cify the percentage of closely related dyads for each sex combination in

trolling for kinship as authors did so for the analyses on top associate
significant associates? If such examination is impossible for some
