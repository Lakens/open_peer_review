Authors have investigated the effect of sonication on the efficiency of SIRs to extract Vanadium.
The authors have presented a systematic study. However, following issues need to be addressed:
1. Authors should replace the word " Ultrasound Irritation" by Ultrasound Irradiation". Irritation
sounds irritating at times.
2. Authors should present a schematic to explain the working of SIRs.
3. I think there is a mistake in Eq. 1. It should be (m1 -m2)/m2 rather than (m2-m1)/m2
4. In Fig.2, why QM changes only slightly with an increase in sonication power?
5. Authors mention that 100W sonication power is better but that is the lowest sonication power
they have tried. Does it mean that lower sonication power, let us say 20W or 40W could have
been better? I anticipate a kind of maximum there. It will be better if authors can do experiments
at sonication powers lower than 100W.
5. Why spreading of extractant on the surface of pores has to be an endothermic process? Any
explanation? Adsorption as such is an exothermic process.
6. Fig.3 implies that at steady state values of impregnation ratio for SIRs-UIs is lower than that for
SIRs-CI? This is quite a contradiction. Any explanation?
7. In Fig. 4, impregnation ratio for SIRs-UI is lower than that for SIRs-CI at higher N235
concentration. ANy explanation?
8. In Fig. 5, there is no difference in QM for SIRs-CI and SIRs-SI? This means no effect of
sonication at all. Why?
9. It seems that authors have done experiments only in single runs. It is always better to run
triplicates so as to get statistically correct information.

In general, this is a well written paper that has a decent standard of English.
There are a couple of papers that should be brought to the authors' attention. These papers also
describe the ultrasound assisted impregnation of resins and really should be cited. A comparison
with these papers is also necessary.

The main advantages to the procedure are its increased speed of preparation, marginally better
capacity and marginally better stability.
There are several other problems with the paper. Among the more minor is the numerous
occasions that a square is present instead of degrees C.
In the nomenclature table, the authors have stated D2HEPA but then define it as Di (2-othyl......
Error bars on the figures are necessary - especially for figures that supposedly show minor
differences, e.g. Fig. 5.
My main problem with the manuscript is the lack of scientific evidence. The authors make several
conclusions that do seem to make sense from the results, but do not explore them scientifically for
proof. Electron microscopy could help with some of this.
Overall, it is a paper with promise, but does need extra work.

Appendix A
Point-by-point responses to the reviewer’s comments
Dear Editor and Reviewers,
Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments concerning our manuscript. The
authors thank cordially the editor and two anonymous reviewers for giving us an opportunity to
improve the manuscript. These comments are all valuable and very helpful for revising and
improving our paper, as well as the important guiding significance to our research. We studied
your comments carefully and have made revisions thoroughly which we hope meet with your
approval. The specific corrections in the manuscript and the responds to the reviewer’s comments
are as follows:
Responses to Reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer #1: Authors have investigated the effect of sonication on the efficiency of SIRs to
extract Vanadium. The authors have presented a systematic study. However, following issues need
to be addressed:
1. Authors should replace the word "Ultrasound Irritation" by "Ultrasound Irradiation". Irritation
sounds irritating at times.
Response: We have replaced the word "Ultrasound Irritation" by "Ultrasound Irradiation" in the
revised manuscript.
2. Authors should present a schematic to explain the working of SIRs.
Response: Thanks for your suggestion. The working of SIRs is an important part in explanation
for the mechanism of ultrasound irradiation on the adsorption processes of vanadium. Thus, a
schematic explaining the working of SIRs has been presented in the revised manuscript as Fig. 3.
3. I think there is a mistake in Eq. 1. It should be (m1 -m2)/m2 rather than (m2-m1)/m2.
Response: We think Eq. 1 for calculating the impregnation ratio of SIRs is correct, which is also
used by many researchers. But, there may be an explanation mistake for the m2 that should be the
weight of the dry pretreated resins.
4. In Fig.2, why QM changes only slightly with an increase in sonication power?
Response: This phenomenon needs further clear explanation. As mentioned in the manuscript, the
extractant may go into the deeper pores at higher ultrasound. However, the adsorption time of
1
12 h (used in the adsorption experiments) is not enough for vanadium adsorption to achieve
equilibrium onto the SIRs, and the extractant in the deeper pores is hard to react with V(V).
Thus, the effective extractant reacting with vanadium within the adsorption time of 12 h just
slightly increases, and then the QM increases slightly with the augment of sonication power,
which is illustrated in Fig. 2.
5. Authors mention that 100W sonication power is better but that is the lowest sonication power
they have tried. Does it mean that lower sonication power, let us say 20W or 40W could have
been better? I anticipate a kind of maximum there. It will be better if authors can do
experiments at sonication powers lower than 100W.
Response: Thanks for your suggestions. The authors agree that it is meaningful to do the
impregnation experiments at sonication power lower than 100 W. However, we cannot carry out
the experiments at sonication power lower than 100 W because 100 W is the lowest sonication
power of the ultrasonic impregnation instrument used in this study. The ongoing study plans to
probe the effect of sonication power on SIRs in details.
6. Why spreading of extractant on the surface of pores has to be an endothermic process? Any
explanation? Adsorption as such is an exothermic process.
Response: Endothermic process may not be a precise description on the impregnation of the
extractant onto the resin. However, in our previous work on the impregnation process of
extractants onto resins, it was found that not only the impregnation ratio of P204 but also that of
N235 increase with the augment of the temperature. Thus, the precise and scientific statement
should be that the impregnation is usually enhanced by increase of the temperature, which has
been adopted in the revised manuscript.
7. Fig.3 implies that at steady state values of impregnation ratio for SIRs-UIs is lower than that for
SIRs-CI? This is quite a contradiction. Any explanation?
Response: The steady impregnation ratio for SIRs-UI is lower than that for SIRs-CI is not a
contradiction. It can be explained that though the high-speed microjets and shock generated by
the ultrasonic irradiation can enhance the mass transfer of the extractant on the support resins
but it may also break some bonds between the extractant and the resins and cause some parts of
the loaded extractant get into the aqueous phase, leading to the lower impregnation ratio for
SIRs-UI than for SIRs-CI. All of these have been described in the revised manuscript.
2
8. In Fig. 4, impregnation ratio for SIRs-UI is lower than that for SIRs-CI at higher N235
concentration. Any explanation?
Response: Thanks for your comments. The effect of N235 content on the impregnation ratio is an
interesting phenomenon in this study which may be influenced by many factors and is worth
intensive and deep studying. It may be speculated that in the ultrasound irradiation process, the
extractant is likely to accumulate in the pores of the resin as multimolecular layers at high N235
concentration (high viscosity) compared with that the extractant is easily formed as monolayer
films in the resin’s pores at low N235 content (low viscosity). As mentioned in the section of
impregnation time in the manuscript, there is an adsorption-desorption equilibrium for the
extractant onto the support resin. The multimolecular N235 may be easier to be desorbed from
the resin than the monolayer N235 under the ultrasound irradiation, which leads to the fact that
the impregnation ratio for SIRs-UI is lower than that for SIRs-CI at higher N235 concentration.
9. In Fig. 5, there is no difference in QM for SIRs-CI and SIRs-UI? This means no effect of
sonication at all. Why?
Response: It is indeed a fact the QM of SIRs-CI is always slightly higher than that of SIRs-UI
(about 2~3 mg·g-1) before 10 h as shown in Fig. 6 in the revised manuscript. From the working
schematic of SIRs (Fig. 3), it is obviously observed that the adsorption process of metals onto
SIRs involves the metal diffusion in aqueous phase, intraparticle diffusion in the resin and the
reaction between the metal and extractant, of which the rate determining step is intraparticle
diffusion in most cases. Accordingly, the SIRs-UI with deeper extractant in the pores would
need more time to arrive the adsorption equilibrium with vanadium. Thus, the contacting time
of 10 h is not enough to reach the adsorption equilibrium for SIRs-UI, which may lead to the
slightly lower QM than that of SIRs-CI. With the extension of contacting time, it is obvious that
the QM of SIRs-UI is higher than that of SIRs-CI (about 3 mg·g-1). The authors should note
that the significant advantages of UI are that it can obviously shorten the impregnation time and
make the extractant be distributed more homogeneously and deeply into the pores of the resin
rather than the improvement of adsorption capacity and impregnation ratio of SIRs.
10. It seems that authors have done experiments only in single runs. It is always better to run
triplicates so as to get statistically correct information.
3
Response: The experiments have been repeated for several times to get statistically correct
information. We found that the error of the data presented is within 3%, and the error bars have
been added in the corresponding figures in the revised manuscript.
Reviewer #2: In general, this is a well written paper that has a decent standard of English. The
main advantages to the procedure are its increased speed of preparation, marginally better capacity
and marginally better stability.
1. There are a couple of papers that should be brought to the authors' attention. These papers also
describe the ultrasound assisted impregnation of resins and really should be cited. A
comparison with these papers is also necessary.
Gizli, N. and Arabaci, M., Chemical Industry and chemical Engineering Quarterly. vol 23,
207-216, 2017.
Kalidhasan S. et al., J. Hazard. Mat. vol 213, 249-257, 2012.
Response: Thanks for your recommendation to cite these two papers describing the ultrasound
assisted impregnation. We read these papers carefully and have cited them in the revised
manuscript.
2. There are several other problems with the paper. Among the more minor is the numerous
occasions that a square is present instead of degrees C.
Response: Thank you very much for your careful review. The correct forms of °C have been
presented in the revised papers.
3. In the nomenclature table, the authors have stated D2EHPA but then define it as Di
(2-othylhexyl) phosphorice acid.
Response: We have revised this mistake by replacing Di (2-othylhexyl) phosphorice acid by Di
(2-ethylhexyl) phosphorice acid.
4. Error bars on the figures are necessary - especially for figures that supposedly show minor
differences, e.g. Fig. 5.
Response: We agree with you that error bars is a necessary for some figures in this manuscript,
which can guarantee the statistically correct information getting from the experimental data. The
error bars have been added into two figures (Fig. 2 and Fig. 6 in the revised manuscript) to
confirm the minor differences.
5. My main problem with the manuscript is the lack of scientific evidence. The authors make
4
several conclusions that do seem to make sense from the results, but do not explore them
scientifically for proof. Electron microscopy could help with some of this.
Response: Thank you very much for your suggestions. According to your advice, scanning
electron microscope (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) has been applied to
analyze the effect of ultrasound irradiation on the distribution of extractant in the pores and on the
adsorption of vanadium (shown in Fig. 7). It can be from Fig. 7a2 and b2 that vanadium
distributes deeper in SIRs-UI than that in SIRs-CI after adsorption, implying that the impregnated
extractant can go deeper into the pores of the support under ultrasonic irradiation than under CI
process.
The authors thank again the editor and the reviewers for your constructive and
pertinent comments, which have improved the manuscript to a large extent.
