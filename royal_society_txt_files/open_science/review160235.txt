This manuscript analyzes the evolution of molecular replicators. The main point is that
individual replicators, such as viruses, often use products of other replicators. For example, a
virus may lose the ability to produce a replicase and instead use the replicase encoded by another
virus. More broadly, microbes commonly use the products of other microbes for a variety of
functions. The author discusses aspects of self-encoding and production versus exploitation of
neighbors' products.
Such evolutionary problems have clearly played a fundamental role in shaping major
characteristics of viruses and other replicators. However, as the author discusses, the current
literature is ambiguous in its understanding of these problems.
This manuscript is unusual in its goals, structure, and accomplishments. Overall, I think it works
very well, and may contribute significantly to progress in this field. I recommend publication.
The unusual aspects arise because the manuscript attempts to: (1) introduce the profound
concepts in a simple and readable way, (2) summarize many biological examples to illustrate the
framework, (3) analyze a mathematical model of evolutionary game theory to make specific
predictions, (4) tie the mathematical predictions to actual biological predictions, and 5) use the
insights to push for an improved general conceptual framing of this broad subject.
It is of course not easy to accomplish all of those goals in a short article. But I think the author
does a remarkably good job of it. The manuscript is very readable, in a simple and direct style.
Yet it does not give up on pushing the concepts and the biology to a new level.
Minor technical issues:
Line 139: I am not sure in what sense the modeling is linear. That is a more difficult point that is
usually realized, might just drop it, because it is not important here.
General: The manuscript emphasizes exploitation. In some interesting cases, obligate mutualisms
or other synergisms arise. Although not common, these examples provide some clues about
profound aspects of replication and evolution. Not necessary to discuss, but if it fits, then leads to
a natural extension.

Review of ‘The evolutionary ecology of molecular replicators’ by Sean Nee
Summary: This paper applies social evolution theory to molecular replicators and reviews data
about molecular replicators in this new light. The author uses a mixture of kin selection
methodology, a novel ecological model, and a review of empirical data to demonstrate how social
evolution can illuminate the study of viruses, transposons, and other molecular replicators. The
author does a neat job of using the theoretical model to parse up the molecular world in a way
that brings new insight to the existing observations about viruses. Finally, the author uses a
mixture of the model developed in the paper and the reviewed data to make a prediction for the
existence of an as-of-yet undiscovered class of defective interfering molecular replicators. The
author discusses the importance of this new approach to the study of molecular replicators with
regards to unifying the field and making headway with viral infection research, with a special
emphasis on the need for unified theory to unite the many disciplines that make up molecular
replicator research. Finally, the author encourages molecular replicators to be firmly enveloped
into the sociomicrobiology fold.
Review: This paper takes the important step of bringing molecular replicators into the social
evolution remit. In particular, the author shows how simple kin selection models, like the direct
fitness model developed in the paper, can isolate parameters (r and P) in a way that sheds new
light on what we already know about viruses. Molecular replicator biology is discussed in a way
which is sure to spur novel research directions. I do have some concerns, outlined below, some of
which could originate from lack of exposition.
4
Model 1: novelty
The first model presented is a good example of simple direct-fitness formulation as developed by
Taylor and Frank (1996). However, the model itself is the same as that put forward by Nee and
Maynard Smith (1990). The difference, as pointed out, is in the analysis, which, by using the
Taylor Frank approach allows r to remain. Could it be made more explicit that this direct fitness
model is the same as Nee and Maynard Smith (1990), possibly somewhere around l. 115?
2) Model 2: Use of ESS methodology
The Taylor Frank approach used in this paper requires two steps: defining a fitness function (l.
112), and then finding the strategy that maximises it (l. 135). This ESS is by definition
uninvadeable. This makes the approach of the second model, to find a strategy that will invade
the ESS, a little confusing. Could you be more explicit about why you have adopted this
approach? For a strategy to invade the ESS, a change in the fitness function that determines a
strategy’s success is required. This is achieved in model 2 by introducing alpha (l. 260). I’m
wondering, then: does the introduction of alpha into the fitness function for this system nullify
the ESS result found in the first model? The replicators are now enjoying a special benefit by
being complemented, which didn’t exist in the first model. Perhaps you could incorporate alpha
into the first model, so that the fitness functions match? Could you then identify the conditions
you are looking for directly from the kin selection approach, which might be a more satisfying
result?
It seems that the motivation for making the second model is to search for conditions under which
the strategy x=0 could exist. If I am understanding correctly, this doesn’t turn up in the original
model because the fitness function provides no scope for complete parasitism. There’s also no
scope for complete sacrifice (x=1). If you are interested in these extremes, could you adjust the
first model so that it the fitness function includes scope for those strategies?
3) Insight gained from the models
As the paper is written now, it seems that the main insight gained from the second model is how
it is used to guide the sections on different “worlds”. However, it seems to me that the effect of
raising and lowering P and r was already revealed by the first direct fitness model. There, too,
raising r increases x* and increasing P reduces it. Could you clarify what specifically the second
model adds to the first in terms of clarity or understanding?
Detailed comments
* l. 23 others->other’s
* l.39 Taylor and Frank 1996 should be referenced here. That paper develops the methodology
used here.
* l.61 example->examples
* l.69 possibly remove “literally”
* l.71 possibly remove comma after ‘protein’
l.88 others->other’s
Expressions 1 and 2 could include alpha: (1-x)(x+alphaPy)
l.114 reference Taylor and Frank 1996
l.110-117 Is it worth mentioning somewhere around here that this is basically an others-only
public goods model, for the purpose of linking to other social evolution work?
l.158 Again, I think it is fair to give Taylor shared credit for the development of this approach.
l. 164-167 Actually, I think this is the concept of relatedness as envisioned by Hamilton and as
used in inclusive fitness work: a statistical association. It’s also probably not fair to dismiss
5
inclusive fitness and only cite two references, especially when one of them (ref. 4) doesn’t actually
support the claim.
l.168-171 I’m not sure this is the best analogy. r is a measure of covariance. The changes between
signatures do not covary. It’s also not clear what you mean by importance here.
l. 175-177 I’m not clear here on how this encapsidation leads to negative r. Probably just needs
half a sentence more exposition to clarify.
l. 221-222 This analogy might be a stretch. You previously excluded the common cold from your
DI list because it depended on the metazoan host, rather than another replicator. This made it
seem you were interested in social deficiency, where deficiencies are made up by other members
of the population (this makes sense, because it’s what leads to interesting games). So I’m not sure
the lion/plant relationship fits.
l.229 x=0 was already in the strategy set in the first model, so it is not being introduced here.
l.233 I’m not convinced this model generates r. It seems to include it as a parameter instead.
l. 320 Reference needed
l. 332-333 Reference needed
l.342-343 Reference needed
l.394-395 Maybe it should be made clear here that this is a prediction based on a mixture insight
from the theory and understanding of virus biology. I’m worried the term “firmly” implies that
the theory can predict the existence of some organism- which evolutionary theory can’t do.

The evolutionary ecology of molecular replicators.
Sean Nee
Response to referees.
Reviewer 1 - Steve Frank.
I am naturally very glad that Steve Frank is so favourable, as he is an architect of the
theory used and has a wide-ranging grasp of the many biological areas involved. I
have deleted the 'linear modelling' remark as he suggested, as it is unnecessary here.
I look forward to learning more about his thinking on this point at a later date.
Frank expresses interest in obligate mutualisms and synergisms and I have
accordingly drawn more attention to those relationships and to Nee (2000) which is
all about them.
Reviewer 2.
This reviewer has provided a thoughtful and insightful analysis which clarifies and
improves my thinking and the submitted manuscript, and is also a welcome reminder
that the review process can function as a positive factor in the scientific process.
The reviewer begins with three main points: 1) Model 1 novelty; 2) Model 2
methodology; 3) Insight gained from the models.
Model 1 novelty. I have now included the important reference to Taylor and Frank
(1996) where the reviewer suggested, and repeat this important reference in many
central places elsewhere: it appears as [6]. While my submitted paper goes to great
lengths to highlight Frank as a main architect of the theoretical framework being
used, I believe this unintentionally resulted in my downplaying the role of Taylor,
which is totally inappropriate. I have made changes to rectify this throughout, e.g. I
refer now to the 'Frank-Taylor-Price' framework, rather than just the 'Frank-Price'
framework. I doubt that either compound title will stick, but it plays an important
role of exposition in this paper.
For the other part of the reviewer's point 1, I have added the following sentence to
the discussion of Nee and Maynard Smith (1990) follwing eqn 5, para beginning
“Indeed, a simpler ...”:
“The transition from the assumption of complete independence is a qualitative one,
not one of degree, and this requires contemporary tools. These, in turn, allow the
development in understanding described in the rest of this paper.”
I believe this makes clear what I know, personally, to be the case; that the
contemporary theory of social evolution, unavailable to me in 1989, endows the
model published in 1990 with wide-ranging implications it did not then have.
Model 2 methodology and Insights to be gained. These points are bound together
and will be discussed together.
First, I will describe what I consider to be the issue under discussion. I do not think
the reviewer and I have any fundamental disagreement that may compromise the
paper, but instead have a foundation for further interesting discussion, outwith this
particular paper for its particular purpose. In general, the reviewer feels that Model 1
and Model 2 could be combined together as one Model whereas I do a separate
treatment. I have added a brief paragraph to the revised paper making this explicit
and briefly explain why I use the separate treatment. I expand here on the reasoning.
The issue. Model 1 presents an ESS analysis in which a continuous trait evolves to
an optimum given by optimality analysis/calculus with frequency-dependent
maxima, fitness slopes and so on. Looking at ESS thinking for the study of simply
related and continuous characters like sex ratios, for example, this is natural as More
(males) means Less (females). Not being exhaustively/exhaustingly precise in these
comments, Model 1 is framed in terms of a mental image of a similar kind of trade-
off between More (template) and Less (replicating machinery), although I go to pains
to emphasise that 'replicating machinery' has a broad meaning.
Model 2 then switches to looking at invasibilty criteria. Historically, these
viewpoints have been entwined and coexisted in evolutionary game theory since its
inception, viz Maynard Smith's constant refrain 'Consider a gene that …' tells the
bearer to lie, murder individuals with a certain badge colour etc.
Model 1 allows me to introduce the critical ideas concerning relationships, P, r and so
on in the clearest, simplest way at my disposal. The ideas involved are by no means
straightforward and I know, again personally, that they do not come easily.
The invasibility approach of Model 2 then readily entertains the the introduction of
complete novelties. For example, off the top of my head, consider an antibiotic
resistance gene introduced into a game, which carries a cost in terms of some other
component of a fitness package. The invasibility approach of Model 2 is a natural
way to think about the evolution of this, and what we may call the Crow-Kimura
device for generating r, which was not needed in Model 1, is introduced to facilitate
the approach.
It is true that once the novelty appears in our thinking, we could then recast the
analysis in terms of a continuous Model 1 optimality analysis, in which antibiotic
resistance is a dimension of variation along which some replicators may have the
value zero, i.e. do not encode it at all. So I have much confidence in the reviewer's
suggestion that these two models could be combined in principle. However, I see
this as a future development, not one that is required at this particular moment to
proceed. This would probably be more than just a notational fusion of models, as
Model 2 contains the Crow-Kimura idea as well.
Perhaps more importantly, the profligacy and trans-Domain promiscuity of molecular
replicators in terms of their information components and use of products is their
dominant feature, and Model 2 is a way of thinking that is most amenable to that
reality, whereas Model 1 is most useful for many of the ideas. Phenomena like the
chimera Pea Enation Mosaic Virus - is it one? is it two? - in which different
components encode their own replicases, could be made to fit into the Procrustean
More-Less bed of Model 1, but I am not sure we want to. Ditto the marvelous
Sputnik. Returning again to the historical perspective, Hamilton in his canonical sex
ratio paper (1967) found it useful to adopt a variety of modelling approaches.
In summary: I see the current way of presenting the ideas to be useful from a didactic
and expository point of view as well as for thinking about the varied biology. Many
of the ideas are abstract and unfamiliar and, I know from personal experience,
challenging to hold together as a mental package even for many who are familiar the
the elements. I believe that what could be gained from a unified approach in terms of
elegance and making a short paper even shorter, would be vitiated by making the
ideas in the paper even more abstracted for a large audience.
Reviewers detailed comments in order with the reviewer's page numbering, which is
the numbering of my originally submitted manuscript.
l. 23 … l. 88 Done:
“Expressions ...”. See discussion above on reviewers main points 2 and 3.
l. 114 Done, and also referenced elsewhere.
l. 110-117. I have not followed this suggestion because I am not sufficiently familiar
with public goods models to feel comfortable. There are subtleties concerning
distinctions between public goods, common goods and so. Yes, I understand the idea
in general, but do not have the expert familiarity I would want to mention it in a
formal paper like this.
1. 158. Done. I now refer to 'Frank-Taylor-Price' and am glad to have had been
asked to do this.
l. 164 -167. I agree, and have deleted the offending sentences, which were just a
coded barb - my bad. I have replaced them with the following, which makes clear
that Hamilton, unsurprisingly, had a very clear understanding. "The fact that social
evolution can be studied entirely from a personal fitness approach with r having an
abstract, statistical meaning was perfectly understood by Hamilton, as evidenced by
his study of the evolution of spite, which envisions negative r."
l. 168-171. I have rewritten in a way which I hope clarifies my point. "More
formally, each instance of your signature can be considered to consist of an identical,
'ideal' instance plus random noise." The general point I am trying to convey is an
intuitive one, but not entirely straightforward, and has arisen in the social evolution
literature in the problematic idea of 'identity-by-descent'.
l. 175-177. I have rewritten, which I hope clarifies the point, adding the sentence
"The relationship r may be determined by outside agencies, such as predators in the
case of the evolution of warning colouration, and, in a different general model, r may
be negative. For example, in influenza virus, the capsid component of the machinery
may choose to encapsidate template elements that are complementary. "
l. 221-222. This relates to the expressed interest of reviewer 1 in mutualisms and
other such relationships, not just deficiencies compensated by parasitism. As with
referee 1, I hope I now make it more clear in the paper that I am interested in the full
range of ecological relationships, so I really, really want to keep the photosynthetic
lions.
l. 229. Wording changed. I say we 'start at the boundary x = 0' rather than
'introduce'.
l. 233. Wording changed. a model generating r, TO an explicit model for r
l. 320 - l. 343. Done
l. 394. I agree completely with the reviewer and rewrite to "By combining
conmporary social evolution theory with our growing knowledge of virus biology,
we can predict ..."
