Referee’s report on Open Science ms RSOS-160326
General
This is a straightforward behavioural study that seeks to investigate the effects of reduced oxygen
levels (hypoxia) in aquatic habitats on the nest building behaviour, nest-defence behaviour,
parental care and filial cannibalism of gobies. The topic is timely, given the increasing frequency
of anoxia in shallow water brackish and marine bays in which these fish live. Whilst it is not the
first study to study the effects of hypoxia on these factors, it is the first to use a live untethered
egg predator, and hence is a useful addition to the literature. The result suggest that reduced
hypoxia affects the size of the nest hole, and that predators were more likely to enter nests under
hypoxic conditions. Males did not increase nest defensive behaviour under hypoxia. Whilst the
behavioural results in the study are quite clear, the extent to which they can be upscaled to the
field situation is less so, and the authors need to discuss more critically the limitations of their
study.
Major comments
1. Nest hole size and female entry
Line 159-160 – If the nest hole was measured after the female has spawned, then could it simply
be an artefact of the size of the female? Larger females make bigger holes in the nest when they
enter and exit? If this is not the case then perhaps this needs to be explained more carefully. Also,
how consistent is the nest hole size over time – has anyone looked at consistency / repeatability
within males?
2. Crab foraging ecology
There is no real statement / discussion about the mechanisms that crabs use to locate prey, yet
the foraging ecology of the crab is critically important to understanding the ecological importance
of these results. As I understand they primarily use olfactory cues when foraging, and so the
most likely benefit for having a smaller nest hole is that they are less ‘leaky’ to food smells
(kairomones). Visual cues may be less important. I would very much encourage the authors to
have short section outlining the foraging cues used by crabs, to place the results into context.
3. Tanks versus the natural environment
The results of the study are relatively clear, however, I am concerned that they may not transfer
over to the natural situation very easily and yet there is no real discussion of the limitations of the
tank studies described here and the problems with upscaling the results to the natural
environment. The main issue is that in nature, an attack / display by a nest-defending goby may
serve to divert the attentions of the crab more easily, since the crab will have may other foraging
opportunities. But in the study the crab does not have other opportunities – if it wants to feed it
HAS to get to the eggs in the nest. This is a limitation of the study, and demands some
explanation in the discussion. The key point is that although defense does not ‘fully offset the
3
threat from predators’ (Lines 33 and similar statements on and 382 and 391) on the tank study, it
might do so in the field.
Minor comments and typos etc
Line 21 – ‘For fish with parental care,…’
Line 31-32 – not clear about this sentence – ‘prioritise egg ventilation over small nest openings
under hypoxia’. Does the authors mean ‘over large nest openings’?
Line 44 – ‘…through camouflage and the adoption of inconspicuous behaviour…’
Line 44 – Should ‘inconspicuous behaviour’ really be described as ‘passive’. The fish are actively
choosing to be inconspicuous… Perhaps needs to be rephrased for clarity.
Line 68 – delete the word ‘brick’ – not needed and confusing.
Line 74 ‘their appearance’ – does this relate to the nest or the opening?
Line 118 – expect the Latin binomial for sand goby to be given here.
Line 118-119 – ‘shallow, sandy bays…’
Line 121 – should probably mention the fact that vocalizations are also an important component
of goby display.
Line 128 – ‘eye stalks’ (not ‘stalk eyes’)
Line 128 – expect the Latin binomial for shore crab to be given here
Line 166-167 – should probably say how you monitored the O2 levels during the adjustment.
Line 173 – I’m not sure about the significance of the statement in the last sentence, starting
‘Extensive oxygen consumption…’ Are you indicating that this was a potential problem or a real
problem in the predator treatments (i.e. did predator treatments have lower dO2 levels than the
nno-predator treatments?) Please clarify either way.
Line 177-178 – I would have thought a 40mm carapace crab COULD pose a threat to sand gobies.
Can you back up this claim (that 40mm crabs do not pose a threat to adult gobies) with a
reference?
Line 188 – ‘display’ here is not defined at all. Reading further this appears to be ‘display against
predators’, whereas at this point I took it to mean ‘sexual display’ (as that is the only display
previously discussed – on line 121). Please rename and define the variable ‘display’ so it is clear.
Line 195 – this seems a very low tech and very rough method of calculating egg losses. It relies on
eggs being very consistent in their density between and within clutches. Further, eggs could also
be cannibalized from the centre of the mass, making the outline uninformative.
Line 203-204 – ‘masters of disguise’ is somewhat colloquial – please use more scientific language!
Line 204 – is it right to discount these trials? Should an extra behaviour category be included
(‘hidden’ or ‘buried’) that allows these trials to be included in the analysis?
Line 219 (also Line 222) – ‘blotted dry’ better than ‘wiped dry’
Line 220 – here you say that you measured the latency to begin feeding and the time spent eating,
but you do not present any data on these. Either give the result or cut this from the methods
section.
Line 257-258 – I am not sure that a logistic regression is correct in this situation. Surely this is
simply count data with no continuous variable, so should this not simply be a Chi-square test?
Line 268 – I am confused why t-test statistics are given here when a GLM ANOVA has been
undertaken – shouldn’t the authors be presenting F-ratio values?
Figure 1 - the order of data points here is not logical, nor is the use of a scatter plot when
elsewhere bar charts are used. I suggest ordering the data in figure 1 are ordered in the same way
as in figure 2 and that the same format bar chart is also used.
Figure 2b – In the results section the stats for this are non-parametric, indicating the data were not
normal and could not be normalized. The figure, however, indicates means +/- SE, which is not
very useful if the data are non-normal. Far better to change the figure to a boxplot showing
median, IQR and 95% confidence intervals in that case.
4
Figure 4a – to me this is not a logical way of presenting the data. I would strongly recommend
plotting the data so that the x-axis is ‘oxygen level’ (high/low) and the stacked bars for each
show ‘intact’ (white) / ‘intruded’ (filled). That would convey the key message far more clearly.
Figure 4b – the second part of the x-axis label was missing (assuming it should be ‘Intruded
nests’).

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The current manuscript investigates how environmental variation (O2 saturation) and exposure
to predation (shore crabs) interact in modulating paternal care behaviour in a nest-guarding fish,
the sand goby P. minutus. It builds on previous work that described the independent effects of
water oxygenation and perceived predation risks on nest opening sizes and care behaviour in the
same species. The key novelty of the new work thus originates from (a) considering these factors
in combination, allowing to identify interaction effects and the degree to which fish prioritize egg
care over predation avoidance, and (b) exposing fish – for the first time in this context – to actual
predation (rather than just a perception of predation risk).
This manuscript is largely publication-ready. A very pleasant reading indeed! The described
experiments are also very well conducted and convincingly isolate the factors of interest,
oxygenation and predator exposure. I therefore have only a few minor comments that may aid
the authors in preparing a final version for publication.
l. 140: first mention of the two oxygen treatments – but the justification for choosing these
particular 2 levels only comes far later (in the ethical note, l. 228 ff). I suggest to add this here.
l. 156 and throughout: The authors sometimes just report p thresholds rather than the actual p-
values. I personally prefer to see actual p-values reported throughout.
5
l. 172ff: What did the authors do to deal with the ‘particular concern’ of oxygen consumption by
shore crabs? Can this have affected their results? Or was adding additional oxygen always
successful and the treatment levels thus kept stable?
l. 186: Did the 15 min observation always start immediately with crab release? Why was this
duration chosen? Is this the period in which to expect the major interactions between crabs and
fish, and the situation ‘settles’ later?
l. 190: counting the number of fin beats: Can this be done reliably on direct observation?
l. 195 ff: estimating ‘egg mass weight’. If I understand correctly, the loss in egg mass weight was
indirectly inferred from the change in ‘paper weight’ for paper cut to the original egg mass area
and paper reduced to the final egg mass area. Hence, essentially, the authors here express a
proportion of the initial size. Please clarify.
Experimental design: I am missing explicit statements how observer bias was avoided in the
various behavioural measurements. I reckon this difficult (OK, probably near-impossible) for
behaviours related to the presence versus absence of predators (treatment is directly visible). But
at least for the oxygen treatment, it would have been possible to conduct behavioural
observations blind to the oxygenation level. Has this been attempted? If not, can the authors
specify how potential observer bias effects were mitigated?
l. 236 ff: tests for homogeneity of variances. Why did the authors conduct 2 alternative tests?
Where these tests useful at all? Note that ANOVA is usually more robust to slight violations of
homoscedasticity, at least more so than explicit tests for variance homogeneity. Also, several
ANOVA techniques (e.g. Welch’s ANOVA) allows internal control for violations of this
assumption.
Discussion: I generally wondered whether shore crabs would care about nest entrance size, at all.
It should be very easy for crabs to open a “narrow” entrance – this is just a loose sandpit! If true,
sand gobies in turn should also not care so much in terms of nest entrance size for the presence of
crabs (just as visible in the data), simply because the nest entrance provides no protection. This
may be different of course if the nest entrance is determined by hard structures (e.g. the size of
the chosen nest shell). But this has not been modified in the current study.

ajor comments
Nest hole size and female entry Typically, females spawn during the night with L165-168
ine 159-160 – If the nest hole was measured after the the nest opening being measured the following
male has spawned, then could it simply be an artefact morning. The male thus have time to repair the
the size of the female? Larger females make bigger nest. Furthermore, while a female may disturb
oles in the nest when they enter and exit? If this is not the opening when entering the nest, the amount
e case then perhaps this needs to be explained more of sand disturbed in this way is quite small,
refully. Also, how consistent is the nest hole size over compared to the amount of sand being
me – has anyone looked at consistency / repeatability displaced when the male covers the entire nest
ithin males? by sand. With respect to nest consistency, nest
cover tends to be consistent over time
(p=0.06), but nest opening does not (Olsson et
al, 2009, Anim. Behav.), possibly because nest
opening is more sensitive to environmental
cues. Method clarified.
Crab foraging ecology Done. L405-419
here is no real statement / discussion about the
echanisms that crabs use to locate prey, yet the
raging ecology of the crab is critically important to
nderstanding the ecological importance of these
sults. As I understand they primarily use olfactory
es when foraging, and so the most likely benefit for
aving a smaller nest hole is that they are less ‘leaky’ to
od smells (kairomones). Visual cues may be less
portant. I would very much encourage the authors to
ave short section outlining the foraging cues used by
abs, to place the results into context.
Tanks versus the natural environment Done. L405-419
he results of the study are relatively clear, however, I
m concerned that they may not transfer over to the
atural situation very easily and yet there is no real
scussion of the limitations of the tank studies
escribed here and the problems with upscaling the
sults to the natural environment. The main issue is that

ay serve to divert the attentions of the crab more
sily, since the crab will have may other foraging
pportunities. But in the study the crab does not have
her opportunities – if it wants to feed it HAS to get to
e eggs in the nest. This is a limitation of the study, and
emands some explanation in the discussion. The key
oint is that although defense does not ‘fully offset the
reat from predators’ (Lines 33 and similar statements
n and 382 and 391) on the tank study, it might do so in
