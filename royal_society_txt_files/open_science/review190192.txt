In this paper, the inhibition behavior of three new benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone derivatives
on mild steel in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution was investigated using gravimetric measurements,
potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron
microscopy and theoretical calculations. The inhibitor exhibited good inhibition efficiency
(96.6%). The work is interesting and I fee that it could be published after making the following
corrections/ suggestions.
1. “Acid corrosion” should be added as one of the keyword.
2. In abstract, the sentence “The analysis of polarization curves indicated that the three
benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone derivatives acted were of mixed type and PBST and OCT
predominantly anodic.” should be rewritten.
3. Throughout the text,“molecule structure” should be replaced by “molecular structure”.

Title: Inhibition behavior of mild steel by three new benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone derivatives
in 0.5 M H2SO4: Experimental and computational study
Journal: Royal Society Open Science
Manuscript number Review: RSOS-190192
Reviewer:
1- The English of the manuscript is adequate for its publication but there are some corrections to
be made.
2- The introduction is poorly structured.
3- The solubility of inhibitor in the solvent must be explained. The effect of the solvent on
the inhibition needs more discussion.
4- In the gravimetric method why did you choose 8 hours as immersion time.
3
5- It seems that the recommended scan rate for obtaining Tafel slopes is lower than 1 mV s-1 (~0.2
V s-1). Why was the reason to use 1 mV s-1?
6- The figures are not clear?
7- The Ecorr unit must be corrected
6- The OCP vs time should be shown and discussed.
7- The authors used curve fitting or Tafel extrapolation method in obtaining the values of
corrosion currents??
8- Thank you to give a detailed discussion on the Tafl slopes (ba and bc).
9- Nyquist plots should show some define frequencies.
10-
11- A representative of example simulation of Nyquist and Bode diagrams with suggested
models without and with of inhibitor should be given. It would be necessary to give, in the Table
5, the scattering (error bars) of all fitted parameters to evaluate the accuracy of the used models.
12- The author must justify the choice of use the CPE.
13- In part electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements: the authors should give and
interpret in detail the variation of n value in the absence and presence of inhibitory molecule.
14- You must add the error for each parameter in the impedance tables.
15- The sentence “The negative value of indicates that the <U+2206>0 adsorption of benzaldehyde
thiosemicarbazone derivatives onto Q235 mild steel in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution is spontaneous (due
the negative value!!).” is wrong. Please delete this. This parameter is a thermodynamic
representation of the equilibrium constant, that is all.
16- Why you did not calculate the other activation parameters?
17- You must add all the equations concerning the theoretical part.
18- The paper includes a rather verbose discussion of DFT calculated molecular electronic
properties using HOMO-LUMO type cliche inferences that have been used countless times in the
literature. Such an approach is not acceptable in the year 2018, because the DFT methodology to
explicitly model the adsorption of molecules on materials surfaces is well established and mature
for almost two decades (e.g., see Hammer & Norskov, Advances in Catalysis 45 (2000) 71-129). It
has been recently clearly demonstrated that these HOMO-LUMO parameters are not very useful,
because for a large data set of corrosion inhibitors the purported correlations between inhibitor's
frontier molecular orbital parameters and inhibitor efficiency disappears, see: J. Mater. Chem. A 2
(2014), 16660-16668, Green Chem. 16 (2014), 3349-3357. Please refer to Corros. Sci. 85 (2014) 109–
114, stating: "In terms of predictive power, such an approach has at best limited value, and is
potentially simply misleading…"
19- It is well known that the benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone derivatives inhibitors could be
protonated in acid solution, so the quantum chemical calculation should be considered the
protonated inhibitors.
20- Dynamic molecular simulation needs to be added?
Based on my observations, I would recommend this manuscript for publication in "Royal Society
Open Science" but after the previous major corrections.

Journal: Royal Society Open Science
Manuscript number Review: RSOS-190192
Reviewer:
1-The English of the manuscript is adequate for its publication but there are some
corrections to be made.
Author reply: many thanks.
2-The introduction is poorly structured.
Author reply: have been corrected, many thanks.
Three new benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone derivatives namely benzaldehyde
thiosemicarbazone (BST), 4-carboxyl benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (PBST) and
2-carboxyl benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (OCT) were synthesized and their
inhibition effects on mild steel corrosion in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution were studied
systematically using gravimetric and electrochemical measurements. Weight loss
results revealed that PBST exhibited the highest inhibition efficiency of 96.6% among
the investigated compounds when the concentration was 300 µM. The analysis of
polarization curves indicated that the three benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone
derivatives acted as mixed type inhibitors and PBST and OCT predominantly anodic.
The adsorption process of all these benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone derivatives on
Q235 steel surface in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution conformed to Langmuir adsorption
isotherm. Scanning electron microscopy was conducted to show the presence of
benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone derivatives on Q235 mild steel surface. The results
of theoretical calculations were in good agreement with that of experimental
measurements.
3-The solubility of inhibitor in the solvent must be explained. The effect of the solvent
on the inhibition needs more discussion.
Author reply: It is reported that the solvent, such as double-distilled water, ethanol,
has little effect on the inhibition property, thus, most studies did not investigate the
influence of the solvent on the inhibition behavior. (Nurdane Yilmaz, Alper Fitoz,
Ümit Ergun, Kaan C. Emregül, A combined electrochemical and theoretical study into

of some hydantoin derivatives for mild steel in 0.5 M HCl solution: Experimental,
quantum chemical, Monte Carlo simulations and QSAR studies, Journal of Molecular
Liquids, 252 (2018) 62-74.)
4-In the gravimetric method why did you choose 8 hours as immersion time.
Author reply: the choose of 8 h immersion time in the gravimetric measurements is to
give an accurate average corrosion rate for Q235 mild steel in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution
in the absence and presence of the investigated inhibitors.
The immersion time in the gravimetric measurements was different in different
references. (3 h, Chandra Bhan Verma, M.A. Quraishi, Ambrish Singh,

5-It seems that the recommended scan rate for obtaining Tafel slopes is lower than 1
mV s-1 (~0.2 V s-1). Why was the reason to use 1 mV s-1?
Author reply: the scan rate should be slower during the dynamicpolarization
measurements. For most studies, the scan rate was set at 1 mV/s, which value was
slow enough for the steady state measurement. (1 mV/s, Kegui Zhang, Bin Xu,

6-The figures are not clear?
Author reply: have been corrected, many thanks.
7-The Ecorr unit must be corrected
Author reply: have been corrected, many thanks.
The Ecorr unit was mV in this manuscript, as shown in Table 4.

Open circuit potential curves
The open circuit potential for Q235 mild steel in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution without and
with 300 µM BST, PBST and OCT inhibitor was depicted in Fig.2. It is can be seen
that the OCP reached a steady state after 1 h immersion time. Apparently, the OCP
value moved in the negative direction with addition of 300 µM BST, PBST and OCT
inhibitor compared to the blank. This shift may be correlated to the adsorption of
these compounds on mild steel surface.

7-The authors used curve fitting or Tafel extrapolation method in obtaining the values
of corrosion currents??
Author reply: have been corrected, many thanks.
Tafel extrapolation method was employed to obtain some useful parameters, including
corrosion potential (Ecorr), corrosion current density (jcorr), anodic and cathodic Tafel
slopes.
8-Thank you to give a detailed discussion on the Tafl slopes (ba and bc).
Author reply: have been corrected, many thanks.
It is noticeable that the shape of polarization curves without inhibitors is similar to
that with addition of these three inhibitors. This phenomenon demonstrated that the
addition of these inhibitors did not change the corrosion mechanism of Q235 mild
steel dissolution in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution [36] and the inhibitive effect of these
inhibitors is originated from the coverage of inhibitor molecules at the active sites to
restrain their exposing to the acidic environment.
9-Nyquist plots should show some define frequencies.

The representative Nyquist plots and the fitted results for Q235 mild steel dissolution
in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at 298 K in the absence and presence of different
concentrations of BST, PBST and OCT inhibitors were shown in Fig.4. It can be seen
that the fitted results almost overlapped with the experimental data, suggesting that
the proposed models are suitable to fit the EIS data.

12-The author must justify the choice of use the CPE.
Author reply: have been corrected, many thanks.
Fig.3 also shows that the centers of the impedance loops are below the real axis. This
finding indicates a non-ideal electrochemical behavior at the metal/solution interface
[40,41], which is generally resulted from the surface roughness and heterogeneities
[42,43]. Therefore, a constant phase element CPE (Q) was used to replace capacity
[44] and the thus improved electrochemical equivalent circuit (EEC) was depicted in
Fig.4, which was used to analyze the EIS data.
13-In part electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements: the authors should
give and interpret in detail the variation of n value in the absence and presence of
inhibitory molecule.
Author reply: have been corrected, many thanks.
Additionally, the value of n were all near to 1 in the absence and presence of these
inhibitors (Table 5), suggesting the homogeneity nature of the surface. Moreover, it is
worth noting that the inhibition efficiencies of PBST and OCT inhibitor are higher
than that of BST at the same concentration, which may be correlated to the presence
of –COOH functional group in the molecular structure.
14-You must add the error for each parameter in the impedance tables.

15-The sentence “The negative value of indicates that the adsorption of
benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone derivatives onto Q235 mild steel in 0.5 M H2SO4
solution is spontaneous (due the negative value!!).” is wrong. Please delete this. This
parameter is a thermodynamic representation of the equilibrium constant, that is all.
Author reply: has been deleted, many thanks.
16-Why you did not calculate the other activation parameters?
Author reply: The effect of testing temperature on the inhibition behavior was
discussed and the results were listed in Table 8. The apparent activation energy was
calculated from the corrosion rate according to the Arrhenius equation, and the
smaller values of Ea for the Q235 mild steel dissolution in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution
containing 200 µM inhibitors compared to the uninhibited suggested the chemical
adsorption of organic inhibitor molecules on mild steel surface. This finding also
supported the conclusion that inferred from the Langmuir isotherm that the adsorption
behavior of the synthesized compounds on mild steel surface conforms to
chemisorptions.
17-You must add all the equations concerning the theoretical part.
Author reply: have been corrected, many thanks.
18-The paper includes a rather verbose discussion of DFT calculated molecular
electronic properties using HOMO-LUMO type cliche inferences that have been used
countless times in the literature. Such an approach is not acceptable in the year 2018,
because the DFT methodology to explicitly model the adsorption of molecules on
materials surfaces is well established and mature for almost two decades (e.g., see
Hammer & Norskov, Advances in Catalysis 45 (2000) 71-129). It has been recently
clearly demonstrated that these HOMO-LUMO parameters are not very useful,
because for a large data set of corrosion inhibitors the purported correlations between
inhibitor's frontier molecular orbital parameters and inhibitor efficiency disappears,
see: J. Mater. Chem. A 2 (2014), 16660-16668, Green Chem. 16 (2014), 3349-3357.
Please refer to Corros. Sci. 85 (2014) 109–114, stating: "In terms of predictive power,
such an approach has at best limited value, and is potentially simply misleading…"
Author reply: quantum chemical studies are among the most effective methods for
investigating the correlation between inhibition efficiency and molecular structure.
The calculation of quantum chemical parameters, such as the energies of the highest
occupied molecular orbital, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, the energy gap
and molecular dipole moment are very important. In most studies, the complete
geometrical optimization of the investigated compound was performed using Density
Functional Theory (DFT) with the Becke’s three parameter exchange functional along
with the Lee-Yang-Parr nonlocal correlation functional (B3LYP) with 6-31G (d,p)
basis set implemented in Gaussian 03 program package. (Nurdane Yilmaz, Alper Fitoz,

19-It is well known that the benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone derivatives inhibitors
could be protonated in acid solution, so the quantum chemical calculation should be
considered the protonated inhibitors.
Author reply: have been corrected, many thanks.
To explore the correlation between the inhibition behavior and molecular structures,
the quantum chemical calculation were performed, and the optimized geometry
structures and the frontier molecule orbital density distributions of these inhibitors as
well as their protonated forms are presented in Fig.11-12. The useful parameters, such
as EHOMO, ELUMO, energy gap <U+0394>E, dipole moment were determined and applied to
explore the correlation between the inhibitor molecular structure and mild steel.
According to the frontier molecular orbital theory, EHOMO is related to the ability of
molecule to donate electrons to appropriate electron acceptors, thus, a molecule
exhibits stronger tendency to donate electrons to the steel vacancy d-orbital in the
present study when the calculated EHOMO value is higher. Whereas ELUMO corresponds
to the electron accepting ability of the molecule and a molecule has higher capability
of accepting electrons when the calculated ELUMO value is lower [27,62,63].
Furthermore, the energy gap <U+0394>E is an important parameter to evaluate the inhibitive
effect of the inhibitor molecules. It is previously inferred [64,65] that an inhibitor
possesses higher inhibition efficiency when its <U+0394>E value is smaller, because lower
energy is needed to remove an electron from the last occupied orbital.
All of these calculated quantum chemical parameters are summarized in Table 10.
It is apparent that the neutral form of PBST inhibitor as wll as its protonated form
PBST-H+ has a minimum value of ELUMO and lowest value of <U+0394>E which is well
agreement with its highest inhibition efficiency. Moreover, PBST inhibitor shows the
lowest value of dipole moment (µ), which will favor accumulation of the inhibitor
[67]. However, there is still a controversy about the correlation between the dipole
moment and inhibition efficiency that many researchers suggested that the inhibition
efficiency increased with the increase of dipole moment [68,69], while others stated
that inhibitor molecule with a lower value of dipole moment revealed higher
inhibition efficiency [67]. Generally, the value of electronegativity <U+03C7> represents the
chemical potential and a higher value indicates better inhibition performance. In
addition, an inhibitor always shows a higher inhibition efficiency when the value of
global hardness is smaller according to the hard-soft acid base (HSAB) principle [70].
Inspection of Table 10 also demonstrates that PBST has the highest electronegativity
and lowest global hardness, resulting into the maximum inhibition efficiency
compared to the other two inhibitors, which is consistent with the result of weight loss
and electrochemical measurements.

20-Dynamic molecular simulation needs to be added?
Author reply: In this paper, the geometric optimizations of the synthesized derivatives
and quantum chemical calculations were performed using the functional hydride
B3LYP Density Functional Theory (DFT) formalism. During the calculations, the
electron basis set 6-31G (d, p) in the standard Gaussian-03 software package was
employed. As a result, some useful quantum chemical parameters, such as energy of
the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO), the energy of the highest occupied
molecular orbital (EHOMO), the energy gap (<U+0394>E) between LUMO and HOMO, the
ionization potential (I), the electron affinity (A), dipole moment, the global hardness
(<U+03B7>) and the global softness (s) were calculated. The above procedure has also been
conducted in many references, and the theoretical results were discussed and agreed
well with the experimental measurements. (Nurdane Yilmaz, Alper Fitoz, Ümit Ergun,
