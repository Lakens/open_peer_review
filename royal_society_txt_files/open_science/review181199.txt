The overall paper is a important work done by Wang et al within metalloporphyrin system,
especially current TDDFT study is necessarily needed. However the data analysis are very
routine to simply explain each data and figures containing inadequate descriptions for giving
reason or mechanism interpretation. For example, I notice the red-shifts for the 450, 600, and 700
nm dominant peaks, this should be given with a detail mechanistic analysis. Current description
is obviously not enough, please work out the interpretation.

Title: Theoretical investigation on the structural and spectroscopic properties of expanded
metalloporphyrin complexes
Manuscript ID: RSOS-181199
Thank you for submitting the above manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. On behalf of the
Editors and the Royal Society of Chemistry, I am pleased to inform you that your manuscript will
be accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science subject to minor revision in accordance
with the referee suggestions. Please find the reviewers' comments at the end of this email.
The reviewers and handling editors have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. Therefore, I invite you to respond to the comments and revise your
manuscript.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit
the revised version of your manuscript before 28-Nov-2018. Please note that the revision
deadline will expire at 00.00am on this date. If you do not think you will be able to meet this date
please let me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
4
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.

The topic of the study is of interest, the level of theory used is adequate for the
molecular systems studied.
Thank you for your careful reviews. We appreciate your valuable
comments and suggestions to improve our manuscript. With regards to
your comments (for Reviewer: 1), we hope to reply as follows:
For D-A porphyrin/benzoporphyrin complexes, most of attention
are focus on the CT band. The light-absorption ability and energy
levels (HOMO and LUMO) of D-A porphyrin/benzoporphyrin
complexes can be modulated using different combination of donor and
acceptor units (and substituents in lesser extent), thus different D-A
porphyrin/benzoporphyrin complexes can be synthesized and
developed in large and various manners. One of the principles of
energy level manipulation is by charge transfer interactions (i.e.
different natures of donor to acceptor) and can be explained by a
simple molecular orbital theory concept where the frontier molecular
orbitals of conjugated or interacting fragments couple to make new
frontier molecular orbitals with a lower energy gap. A drawing (Figure
1) is presented below.
Figure 1. The principle of energy level manipulation in D-A
conjugated system.
Indeed, two new occupied molecular orbitals are generated after
the HOMO of donor unit interacts with that of the acceptor unit. One
of the two new orbitals is higher and the other one is lower than the
two initial HOMOs. And the two new unoccupied molecular orbitals
are also generated after similar molecular orbital hybridization which
is coming from the two initial LUMOs of donor and acceptor, where
one is lower and the other is higher than before too. Hence, a new
higher HOMO and a new lower LUMO are formed, leading to a
smaller band gap and red-shift of absorption spectra in the D-A
conjugated system.
