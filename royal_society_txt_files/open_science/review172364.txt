Title: Preparation of Cu-ZSM-5 catalysts by chemical vapor deposition for catalytic wet peroxide
oxidation of phenol in a fixed bed reactor
Author(s): Donglin He; Huiping Zhang; Ying Yan.
Thank you very much for your useful comments and suggestions on our manuscript. We have
modified the manuscript accordingly, and the changes made in the manuscript will not influence the
content and framework of the paper. The revised portions are marked in yellow in the revised
manuscript, and detailed responses to all reviewers are listed below:
Response to reviewers’ comments:
Reviewer 1:
Comments to the Author(s)
1. Please, state the novelty or main goals of the work in the Abstract and Introduction Section.
Emphasize the novelty of the work. Conclusion Section should be revised to make the original
claims more concrete.
v Thank you very much for your useful comments. The aim of this work is to probe the feasibility
of Cu-ZSM-5 catalysts prepared by CVD for CWPO of phenol in a fixed bed. After comparing the
catalytic efficiency of Cu-ZSM-5 catalysts developed by CVD with the catalyst prepared by the
impregnation method, it can be concluded that the catalyst prepared by CVD has a better capacity
of further oxidizing the intermediate organic products into carbon dioxide and water with less metal
loading. We have carefully revised the Abstract, Introduction Section and Conclusion Section to
emphasize the novelty of the work and make the original claims more concrete. The changes made
during the revision are marked in yellow in the paper.
2. the claim of accelerated OH production is not very convincing, suggest to design experiments
using radical scavenger titration to quantify it.
v Thank you very much for your useful comments. It has been reported that Fenton-like reactions
are based on the production of OH radicals by catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide [1, 2].
These reactions are responsible for the rapid degradation of the organic compounds [3]. However,
hydrogen peroxide may also decompose to other less active radical species such as HO2·which has
low reactivity compared to OH· radicals and does not play any important role in the total oxidation
[1]. Therefore, the higher TOC conversion achieved in higher reaction temperature can be explained
by the formation of more OH radicals per time with the same feed flow rate. What’s more, we will
do further research on the phenol CWPO mechanism and determine the generation of OH radical in
detail in the next work stage.
3. for discussion on catalytic results, please use specific rates or TOF.
v Thank you very much for your useful comments. We used specific rates and TOF to discuss
catalytic performances of VOCs combustion in a fixed bed [4]. But it is more suitable to measure
the TOC and phenol concentration of inlet and outlet fluids in the wastewater treatment, and
calculate the TOC and phenol conversion to evaluate the efficiency of the catalyst in a continuous
system [2, 5, 6]. This is because it is still a challenge to determine the accurate amount of active
phase in the catalyst during the continuous operation with active phase leaching. In addition, we
will do further research on the improvement of stability of Cu-ZSM-5 with less Cu leaching, and
will study intrinsic kinetics of phenol oxidation with the Cu-ZSM-5 in a batch reactor and determine
the reaction rate in next work stage.
4. the activation energy of H2O2 decompostion and phenol conversion can be calculated and
compared to literature data.
v Thank you very much for your useful comments. The aim of this work is to probe the feasibility
of Cu-ZSM-5 catalysts prepared by CVD for CWPO of phenol in a fixed bed, so we focus on the
effects of the copper loading, reaction temperature, catalyst bed height and feed flow rate on the
activity and stability of the catalysts. We will do further research on the phenol CWPO mechanism
and establish mathematical modeling of phenol peroxide oxidation processes in a fixed reactor in
the next work.
5. in several figures, the deactivation of the system (drop in conversions) was measured, please
explain.
v Thank you very much for your useful comments. We explained the deactivation of the system in
section 3.2.5 (Stability and reusability of the catalysts). The catalytic deactivation was found to
relate with several factors: (i) the formation of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst, (ii) poisoning
of the catalyst by complexation of active sites with acid organic compounds, preventing its reactivity
with other reactants, and (iii) the leaching of Cu in the liquid phase [7-9]. In our research, we found
that the loss of Cu content of the catalyst is main reason for the deactivation of the system. We will
discuss the mechanism of deactivation in detail to find Anti-deactivation methods in the next work
stage.
6. Cu leaching was measured as well, then quantify the contribution of homogeneous reaction by
leached Cu species to the over reaction performance.
v Thank you very much for your useful comments. The contribution of homogeneous reaction is
very limited in a continuous system because leached Cu species are continuously removed from the
reactor during the reaction. Therefore this kind of operation can reduce the contribution of
homogeneous reaction by Cu leaching [2, 5, 10, 11].
7. please identify clearly the benefit of CVD for Cu inclusion.
v Thank you very much for your useful comments. We added an experiment to compare the catalytic
efficiency of Cu-ZSM-5 catalysts developed by CVD with the catalyst prepared by the impregnation
method. The experimental results consisted of the conversion of phenol, H2O2, TOC and the Cu
leaching concentration in the treated solution. These results show that CVD is a superior method in
developing heterogeneous catalyst supported on porous solid. Furthermore, the catalyst prepared by
CVD has a better capacity of further oxidizing the intermediate organic products into carbon dioxide
and water with less metal loading. We have added the discussion in Section 3.2.2 (Page 11) and
revised the Fig. 6. The detail of preparing IM Cu-ZSM-5 (11%) by the impregnation method can be
seen in Page 5-6 (Section 2.2). The changes made during the revision are marked in yellow in the
paper.
