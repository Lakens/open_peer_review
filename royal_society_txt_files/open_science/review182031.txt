The paper “Optimized micro/nano-hierarchical structured TiO2 coating on titanium by micro-arc
oxidation enhances osteoblast adhesion and differentiation” describes the preparation and
physico-chemical and biological characterization of micro/nano structured TiO2 coatings by
micro-arc oxidation, making this paper of interest for broader public.
This study is well conceived and results clearly presented, however there are several points that
should be addressed before accepting the paper:
a) Introduction
- More details about TiO2 coatings obtained by micro-arc oxidation should be given.
b) Statistical analysis
- The number of repetitions is not given, although it can be deduced from SI data.
- How were proliferation data Fig. 5 treated considering that they consist of both repeat
and replicate measurements?
c) Material characterization
- In Fig 1. higher magnification micrographs for Ti and 11%-13 MAO should be provided.

This manuscript, entitled, 'Optimized micro/nano-hierarchical structured TiO2 coating on
titanium by micro-arc oxidation enhances osteoblast adhesion and differentiation,' is considered
to be interesting and to be within the scope of this journal. However, there are many concerns to
be addressed. And English editting is necessary.
Introduction
Line 51, page 2: Moreover, the surface…bone formation.
References are needed.
Line 4, page 3: Hydroxylated or hydrated…differentiated osteoblast phenotype.
References are needed.
Line 18, page 3: The presence of TiO2 layer…Ti in dental implants.
The reviewer disagrees with the authors. If the authors really believe that this description is
right, please, explain it in detail, including proper references.
Line 35, page 3: Micro-arc oxidation (MAO)…of micro-plasma.
References are needed.
Line 42, page 3: Firmly adherent porous…surfaces for osseointegration [7, 8].
What is the coating material formed on the surface of Ti by MAO? The reviewer thinks that
MAO produces a TiO2 layer. Why is this layer different from that preventing osseointegration?
Just the change of crystallinity is not considered to be the transformation from being biotoxic to
being biocompatible.
Materials and methods
2.1. Specimen preparation
Which grade of cp-Ti was used in this study?
Results
3.1. Material characterization
Line 46, page 8: The surface of Ti was primarily smooth.
The authors are asked for more detailed description of the cp-Ti surface. Why did the authors
think that the Fig. 1A image showed a smooth surface? What does the word, ‘smooth,’ mean
exactly?
Line 4, page 9: The surface chemistry was analyzed by XRD (Fig. 2)
Although XRD has some information in surface chemistry, XRD is usually known to analyze a
surface in crystallinity. The authors analyzed the surfaces in phase only, not in chemical elements
or in the percentages (atomic or weight) of the elements in this study. Maybe, oxygen is also
detected on the titanium surfaces if the authors analyze the surfaces by X-ray photospectroscopy
or energy dispersive spectroscopy.
Also, the significant figures in the results are recommended to be consistent.
Discussion
Line 21, page 14: Here, we aimed…dental implants therapy.
The micro/nano-hierachical structure of the authors is not considered to be an optimized
biomaterial, based on the results of this study. The authors did not perform the experiments
depending on the MAO times or the duty circles. The results were not statistically analyzed when
these factors were independent variables. The word, ‘optimized,’ is inadequate in this study.
Further studies are definitely needed.
Please, describe the limitations of this study. The authors did not perform in vivo experiments.
What is the difference between the authors’ study and the previous study of Li YD, et al
(Reference No. 10), which includes the in vivo results? The reviewer recommends that the

Response to Referees
Reviewers' Comments to Author:
Reviewer: 1
a) Introduction
- More details about TiO2 coatings obtained by micro-arc oxidation should be given.
Response:I have given more details about TiO2 coatings obtained by micro-arc oxidation in
the last paragraph of the Introduction, marked in red.
b) Statistical analysis
- The number of repetitions is not given, although it can be deduced from SI data.
Response:All experiments were performed in triplicate. And I have added it in the part of
“2.4. Statistical analysis”, marked in red.
- How were proliferation data Fig. 5 treated considering that they consist of both repeat
and replicate measurements?
Response:The experiments of cell proliferation were performed in triplicate. Three
replicate wells were set for each group in each experiment, and the mean value of three
replicate wells was taken, so three averages per group can be given. One-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was performed using three averages.
c) Material characterization
- In Fig 1. higher magnification micrographs for Ti and 11%-13 MAO should be
provided.
Response:I have provided higher magnification micrographs for Ti and 11%-13 MAO in Fig
1.
- In Fig. 2. XRD of Ti should be provided.
Response:I have provided XRD of Ti in Fig 2.

Line 42, page 3: Firmly adherent porous…surfaces for osseointegration [7, 8].
What is the coating material formed on the surface of Ti by MAO? The reviewer thinks that
MAO produces a TiO2 layer. Why is this layer different from that preventing osseointegration?
Just the change of crystallinity is not considered to be the transformation from being biotoxic
to being biocompatible.
Response:MAO produces porous and rough TiO2 coatings. In the current study, the coating in
the 9%-2MAO group showed a nanoporous structure; 11%-13MAO consisted of equally
distributed micro-sized slots (3–7 µm wide) and nano-sized pores (diameter: 10–300 nm) and
showed a typical micro/nano dual structure that mimicked the hierarchical characteristics of
bone. 11%-13MAO was beneficial for cell adhesion and differentiation. The TiO2 layer
formed spontaneously on the Ti surface owns good biocompatibility and remarkable corrosion
resistance. However, it is complete and dense. This inherent oxide layer results in the growth
of fibrous connective tissue, preventing new bone formation on the implant surface, which
retards osseointegration between the implant and bone.
Materials and methods
2.1. Specimen preparation
Which grade of cp-Ti was used in this study?
Response: TA-2 . I have added it in the part of “2.1. Specimen preparation”, marked in red.
Results
3.1. Material characterization
Line 46, page 8: The surface of Ti was primarily smooth.
The authors are asked for more detailed description of the cp-Ti surface. Why did the
authors think that the Fig. 1A image showed a smooth surface? What does the word, ‘smooth,’
mean exactly?
Response:I have described the cp-Ti surface more detail, corrected the wording, and marked
in red.
Line 4, page 9: The surface chemistry was analyzed by XRD (Fig. 2)
Although XRD has some information in surface chemistry, XRD is usually known to
analyze a surface in crystallinity. The authors analyzed the surfaces in phase only, not in
chemical elements or in the percentages (atomic or weight) of the elements in this study.
Maybe, oxygen is also detected on the titanium surfaces if the authors analyze the surfaces by
X-ray photospectroscopy or energy dispersive spectroscopy.
Also, the significant figures in the results are recommended to be consistent.
Response:I have changed “the surface chemistry” to “the surface phase structure”, which was
marked in red.
Discussion
Line 21, page 14: Here, we aimed…dental implants therapy.
The micro/nano-hierachical structure of the authors is not considered to be an optimized
biomaterial, based on the results of this study. The authors did not perform the experiments
depending on the MAO times or the duty circles. The results were not statistically analyzed
when these factors were independent variables. The word, ‘optimized,’ is inadequate in this
study. Further studies are definitely needed.
Response: The word, “optimized”, has been deleted. At the last part of discussion, I added
the sentence “Further studies are needed to determine the effect of MAO times or duty circles
on the structure of the TiO2 coating”, marked in red. In our study, what’s more, we would like
to screen a suitable structured TiO2 coating for osteoblast adhesion and differentiation in
dental implants. Thus, we prepared different structural TiO2 by changing the conditions of
MAO. In the future study, we will systematically analyse the effect of independent variable
(MAO times or duty circles) on the surface structure of coatings.
Please, describe the limitations of this study. The authors did not perform in vivo experiments.
What is the difference between the authors’ study and the previous study of Li YD, et al
(Reference No. 10), which includes the in vivo results? The reviewer recommends that the
authors should describe improvement of this study, compared with the previous one.
Response: At the last part of discussion, I described the limitations of this study. In the first
paragraph of discussion, the difference between our study and the previous study of Li YD, et
al has been given. And I discussed improvement of this study. They were marked in red.
