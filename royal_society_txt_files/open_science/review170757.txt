This is an interesting manuscript aimed to extend the concept of the “flexibility windows”
developed by the authors. The manuscript deserves to the published. I have only a few
suggestions aimed to improve the quality of the manuscript:
1) Pag. 1, Introduction. In this section, the author uses the term “density”. For an
experienced scientist in the field of open-framework structures, it is clear that the author refers to
“framework density”. However, this is not clear for a “common” reader. I would suggest adding
something like: “…a range of “densities” (here defined as the number of tetrahedral sites per unit
volume)…”.
2) Pag. 2, line 40. I think that it is very useful for the reader that further details about the
NaOH- and NaBr-SOD, used in this paper, are added. In particular, their chemical formulae
should be given, along with the lattice constants at room conditions and the framework density.
In addition, it would be also useful to give a representation of the crystal structure of NaOH- and
NaBr-SOD (for example in Fig. 1).
3) Pag. 6, lines 44-46. Please, consider that the name of chemical compounds should not be
given with the first capital letter (e.g., “Fluorinert” is not correct, “fluorinert” is correct; the same
is for methanol, ethanol, and water). In addition, I suggest to use the form “Powder diffraction
patterns”, as “spectra” is usually used for other kinds of vibrational phenomena.
4) Pag. 6, lines 46-48. The author uses the terms “amorphises” or “amorphization” (here
and later). Actually, by the inspection of Fig. 6, I think that it is not correct to talk about
amorphization of NaOH-SOD at about 1 GPa: all the Bragg peaks (excluding that at about 3.6
GPa) are still visible at 1 GPa, and it is highly likely that even a Rietveld structure refinement is
feasible on the basis of the data collected at 1 GPa. “Amorphization” implies a total loss of the
long-range order, with the absence of all the diffraction peaks. I suggest the author to talk about
“first evidence of amorphization” at 1 GPa for the NaOH-SOD. This is somehow corroborated by
the in-situ experiments on a class of materials structurally close to SOD: the cancrinite-group
materials (CAN topology), which are proved to keep their crystallinity at least up to 8-10 GPa.

This manuscript reports the introduction of a new geometric restraint – allowing for distortions in
polyhedra – to improve definition of the ‘flexibility window’ in zeolites, extending its application
beyond ideal SiO2 systems. The new definitions of the flexibility window are used to explain the
onset of pressure-induced amorphisation in sodium sodalite and sodium bromide sodalite.
I understand that a general requirement of the journal is full publication of supporting data – the
authors are in possession of GASP input/output files and PEARL diffraction data that, I believe,
would need to be made available. I was unable to find a section on data accessibility and would
suggest that a link to access these data be included in a subsequent revision.
In general, I have no issue with recommending the article for publication, subject to data
availability and the following revisions:
1. It’s not actually clear to me why the soft geometric constraint is called a ‘bar’ constraint?
2. Figures 3 and 4 could be combined into a single figure – it would make comparison of
the SiO4 and AlO4 rotational behaviour more straightforward
3. In setting up the simulations, the cages are populated with spheres to represent
Na/OH/Br. How are these placed? Are they sat on crystallographic sites or randomly placed in
the cage (and if the latter, how is this performed?)
4. The authors claim that Br ions hinder the rotation of the polyhedral on the basis of a
reduced RMS rotation, and that Na atoms do not. In the NaOH case, the increase in RMS, relative
to the empty framework, appears to be of a similar magnitude to the decrease seen with Br. Does
this mean rotation is being facilitated in the NaOH case – can this behaviour be explained?
5. I found Figure 5 very hard to understand – the overlap of points makes it difficult to
follow what’s being described in the main text. I would recommend a re-design of this Figure so
that it is made clearer. (Perhaps as simple as plotting the three datasets separately).
6. In Figure 6 - at 6.23 GPa, almost all diffraction signal is gone, but this appears to be
contributions from both sample and P-E press material. What’s happened here?

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This is an interesting manuscript aimed to extend the concept of the “flexibility windows” developed by
the authors. The manuscript deserves to the published. I have only a few suggestions aimed to improve
the quality of the manuscript:
1) Pag. 1, Introduction. In this section, the author uses the term “density”. For an experienced scientist
in the field of open-framework structures, it is clear that the author refers to “framework density”.
However, this is not clear for a “common” reader. I would suggest adding something like: “…a range of
“densities” (here defined as the number of tetrahedral sites per unit volume)…”.
On the first occurrence of the term “density”, we now specify framework density. In the subsequent
discussion of results we discuss unit cell size in terms of the cell parameter directly rather than density.
2) Pag. 2, line 40. I think that it is very useful for the reader that further details about the NaOH- and
NaBr-SOD, used in this paper, are added. In particular, their chemical formulae should be given, along
with the lattice constants at room conditions and the framework density. In addition, it would be also
useful to give a representation of the crystal structure of NaOH- and NaBr-SOD (for example in Fig. 1).
We have added a reference to the framework density of sodalite in the first sentence of the results
and Discussion section, which now reads “Mineral sodalite is a fully ordered aluminosilicate
framework with a framework density of approximately 16.7 tetrahedra per 1000 A3 [3]”. We have
added the chemical formulae of Na-SOD, Na8(Al6Si6O24)(OH)2, and NaBr-SOD, Na8(Al6Si6O24)Br2,
to the description of our experimental synthesis and compression of sodalites, and also given their
ambient lattice constants with the sentence “The ambient lattice parameters are $a$=8.94\AA for
NaBr-Sod, and $a$=9.02\AA for Na-Sod, in methanol/ethanol/water medium.”. Representations of
the crystal structures have been included as subfigures of Figure 6. The caption of Figure 6 now begins
with the sentence “Sodium sites in Na-Sod (a) and sodium and bromine sites in NaBr-Sod (b) are
shown as larger spheres.”
3) Pag. 6, lines 44-46. Please, consider that the name of chemical compounds should not be given
with the first capital letter (e.g., “Fluorinert” is not correct, “fluorinert” is correct; the same is for
methanol, ethanol, and water). In addition, I suggest to use the form “Powder diffraction patterns”, as
“spectra” is usually used for other kinds of vibrational phenomena.
We have made the requested correction.
4) Pag. 6, lines 46-48. The author uses the terms “amorphises” or “amorphization” (here and later).
Actually, by the inspection of Fig. 6, I think that it is not correct to talk about amorphization of NaOH-
SOD at about 1 GPa: all the Bragg peaks (excluding that at about 3.6 GPa) are still visible at 1 GPa, and
it is highly likely that even a Rietveld structure refinement is feasible on the basis of the data collected at
1 GPa. “Amorphization” implies a total loss of the long-range order, with the absence of all the
diffraction peaks. I suggest the author to talk about “first evidence of amorphization” at 1 GPa for the
NaOH-SOD. This is somehow corroborated by the in-situ experiments on a class of materials structurally
close to SOD: the cancrinite-group materials (CAN topology), which are proved to keep their crystallinity
at least up to 8-10 GPa.
The reviewer has slightly misunderstood the data presented in the figure. The persistent peaks are
those attributable to the sample holder and the lead standard, it is specifically the sodalite (211) peak
at around d=3.6 A which varies and provides evidence of amorphisation. This information is provided
in the caption to figure 6. The reviewer’s comment makes clear that this point needed to be more
clearly explained in the main text itself. We have therefore added the following explanatory sentence
regarding the powder diffraction patterns: “The range of $d$-spacings accessible on PEARL allow us
to compare the intensity of the sodalite (211) peak, observable at about 3.6$ A, to peaks
attributable to the sample holder (alumina and zirconia) and the lead pressure standard; the
sodalite peak is highlighted with a box in the figures.”
With this clarification we hope it is fully clear that we have evidence for the loss of the Na-Sod
diffraction peak by 1 GPa while in the NaBr-Sod it persists to at least 4 GPa.

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript reports the introduction of a new geometric restraint – allowing for distortions in
polyhedra – to improve definition of the ‘flexibility window’ in zeolites, extending its application beyond
ideal SiO2 systems. The new definitions of the flexibility window are used to explain the onset of
pressure-induced amorphisation in sodium sodalite and sodium bromide sodalite.
I understand that a general requirement of the journal is full publication of supporting data – the
authors are in possession of GASP input/output files and PEARL diffraction data that, I believe, would
need to be made available. I was unable to find a section on data accessibility and would suggest that a
link to access these data be included in a subsequent revision.
Data accessibility is now specified as per journal requirements.
In general, I have no issue with recommending the article for publication, subject to data availability and
the following revisions:
1. It’s not actually clear to me why the soft geometric constraint is called a ‘bar’ constraint?
On the introduction of the term we have added the following explanatory sentence: The `bar'
terminology indicates that the distance between a pair of atoms is constrained, as by a bar joining
two spheres.
2. Figures 3 and 4 could be combined into a single figure – it would make comparison of the SiO4
and AlO4 rotational behaviour more straightforward
We have explored several presentation options for these figures and found that the combination into
a single panel is not helpful, in particular it limits the size of the subfigures and reduces readability. We
have therefore retained the separate figures.
3. In setting up the simulations, the cages are populated with spheres to represent Na/OH/Br. How
are these placed? Are they sat on crystallographic sites or randomly placed in the cage (and if the latter,
how is this performed?)
We specify that the spheres representing Na and OH occupy sodium sites, providing the following
explanatory sentence: The spheres are placed upon the eight crystallographic sodium sites in the
cage.
Spheres representing Na and Br are placed on the relevant crystallographic sites, as specified in the
explanatory phrase: … , placing these spheres on the sodium and bromine crystallographic sites.
As noted in our response to reviewer 1, the positions of these sites in the cage are now shown in
Figure 6.
4. The authors claim that Br ions hinder the rotation of the polyhedral on the basis of a reduced RMS
rotation, and that Na atoms do not. In the NaOH case, the increase in RMS, relative to the empty
framework, appears to be of a similar magnitude to the decrease seen with Br. Does this mean rotation
is being facilitated in the NaOH case – can this behaviour be explained?
We have noted this interesting behaviour by adding the phrase “…, with the rotation magnitudes
being comparable to or even greater than those seen in the empty framework” when we describe
rotations in the Na-only case. The greater degrees of rotation might be involved in accommodating
the cage contents, but we would rather not speculate too far in the text.
5. I found Figure 5 very hard to understand – the overlap of points makes it difficult to follow what’s
being described in the main text. I would recommend a re-design of this Figure so that it is made clearer.
(Perhaps as simple as plotting the three datasets separately).
We have found that attempting to plot the datasets separately reduces comparability and so does not
improve clarity; we have therefore opted to increase the size of the figure somewhat, for greater
legibility, and have added to the figure caption the sentence: “Note the onset of substantial clashes
in the NaBr framework from a ~ 9.00 A and in the Na framework from a ~ 7.00 A.”
6. In Figure 6 - at 6.23 GPa, almost all diffraction signal is gone, but this appears to be contributions
from both sample and P-E press material. What’s happened here?
The plotted data represent signal after background subtraction; the apparent loss of signal at the
highest pressure point is the result of a worsening signal-to-noise ratio. For this reason we have
restricted our discussion in the manuscript to lower pressure points.
Thank you and best regards,
