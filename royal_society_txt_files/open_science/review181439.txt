The authors have combined graphene oxide and montmorillonite sheets using the freeze drying
process for producing aerogels. As these are both plate-like substrates, it makes sense that they
could align. The authors show that under ideal conditions, liquid crystallinity is observed, which
is very nice!
The use of English requires a great deal of work. I recommend that the authors find a native
speaker willing to heavily edit the work - there are words that I don't understand "nicols?",
phrases such as "primarily prepared" and misspellings, such as "dramasticly". If the authors have
access to MS Word, the spell and grammar check features should identify most of these issues.
Use of "sol-gel" will be confusing to aerogel readers, who usually associate that phrase with the
silica/hydrolysis route. It is unnecessary to say sol-gel. Clay forms a hydrogel, and can bond the
GO.
In the conclusions, the statement about using these materials to clean sewage streams of dyestuffs
is not realistic. These aerogels are very expensive and are water sensitive. There really is no
chance of such a large scale application. Better to just state that the absorbance performance has
been demonstrated.

The present paper mainly deals about the arrangement and self-assembly of graphene oxide (GO)
and montmorillonite nanoplatelets (MMT) in water suspensión used as precursor to GO/MMT
aerogels. Altough the matter of the paper is not fully new, it contains remarkable contributions to
3
the knowledge in the field justifying its publication. Nevertheless I would like to point out some
minor issues that authors may adress before publication.
1. Even thought I am not native English speaker, I have found some gramatical errors difficulting
the correct understanding of the work. I suggest revising the language used.
2. FTIR section. I agree that no reaction between MMT and GO exists. However, the statement at
the end of page 18, line 46, is not fully accurate. The absence of signal in the FTIR analysis may be
also due to the detection limit of the technique. The absence of signal do not necessarily
guaranties the absence of reaction.
3. In the investigation of the absortion capability an aerogel is formed by adding PVA and
crosslinking with glutaraldehyde. It would be good to know if the previously reported structures
(figure 5) are or not mantained. In other words, it would be recomendable showing the structures
of the PVA-based aerogels because these systems are in fact used in the final application (dye
adsorption)

Comments to the Author:
The referees have shown enthusiasm for this work, but have raised important concerns regarding
the overall readability of the manuscript. I highly recommend the authors modify their
manuscript with these comments in mind. Modifying their introduction and conclusions with
regard to the potential applicability of these materials may also be warranted.

Appendix A
Dear Editor,
We would like to resubmit the revised manuscript entitled “Clay-gaphene oxide Liquid
crystals and their aerogels: synthesis, characterization and properties” for consideration by the
Royal Society Open Science. We would like to thank the reviewers for thoroughly reviewing our
manuscript and making many thoughtful comments. We have revised the manuscript extensively.
And mark the modified part in red.Here are our point-by-point responses:
Reviewer #1:
Comment 1: In the conclusions, the statement about using these materials to clean
sewage streams of dyestuffs is not realistic. These aerogels are very expensive and are water
sensitive. There really is no chance of such a large scale application. Better to just state that the
absorbance performance has been demonstrated.
Answer: This suggestion is constructive and helps us improve our manuscript. We have
made changes and removed the unreasonable points. These changes are provided in line 16-18 in
page 12,line 30 in page 12 and line 1-2 in page 13.
Comment 2: Use of "sol-gel" will be confusing to aerogel readers, who usually
associate that phrase with the silica/hydrolysis route. It is unnecessary to say sol-gel. Clay forms
a hydrogel, and can bond the GO.
Answer: To make the readers more understandable, we have changed the "sol-gel" where
the aerogel readers are confused.
Reviewer #2:
Comments 1 : Even thought I am not native English speaker, I have found some
gramatical errors difficulting the correct understanding of the work. I suggest revising the
language used.
Answer: We are very sorry for our English writing. English of this manuscript has
been improved, including grammar, vocabulary and sentences, etc.
Comments 2 : FTIR section, I agree that no reaction between MMT and GO exists.
However, the statement at the end of page 18, line 46, is not fully accurate. The absence of signal
in the FTIR analysis may be also due to the detection limit of the technique. The absence of signal
do not necessarily guaranties the absence of reaction.
Answer: In FTIR section, the inaccurate description has been revised. They are changed
in line 19-22 in page 11.
Comments 3 : In the investigation of the absortion capability an aerogel is formed by
adding PVA and crosslinking with glutaraldehyde. It would be good to know if the previously
reported structures (figure 5) are or not mantained. In other words, it would be recomendable
showing the structures of the PVA-based aerogels because these systems are in fact used in the
final application (dye adsorption)
Answer: We added a small amount of PVA crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (GA) to
the aerogel to prevent the sample from falling to pieces in aqueous solution. From SEM
images below (Fig.1), we found that the addition of PVA and glutaraldehyde had little effect
on the structure of GO-MMT aerogels, which is attributed to their small amounts. So, the
effect of the addition of these materials on the aerogel structure was not discussed in the
manuscript.

Once again, thank you very much for your constructive comments and suggestions which
would help us in depth to improve the quality of the paper.
