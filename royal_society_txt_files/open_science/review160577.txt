Review of manuscript RSOS-160577
This paper expands our understanding of the extent and possible role of alloparenting, and more
specifically the role of infant handling, in chimpanzees. The authors use a novel methodological
approach to show that mothers who permitted infant handling showed reduced lactation effort,
and conclude that alloparenting may facilitate a more rapid weaning process than would be
otherwise possible, and thereby enhance maternal fitness by enabling the mother to more quickly
resume cycling.
Overall the manuscript is very strong, and does not require much revision. The paper is very well
written. The flow of the paper is very logical and clear, making the authors’ arguments and aims
very easy to follow. The methodology is sound, and the novel approach to quantifying weaning
is one that will likely end up being applied widely in wildlife studies. Finally, the conclusions
drawn from the data clearly follow from the results presented.
My concerns are minor. I think the paper is acceptable pending the minor revisions discussed
below:
Most important, perhaps, is a statistical analysis consideration - I am concerned that the number
of predictor variables you include in your GEEs is too high given your sample size. Too many
predictors relative to the number of cases risks overparameterization and this makes
interpretation of beta coefficients and standard errors of covariates difficult. I make suggestions
below on a way to possibly alleviate this concern (I think it can be done rather easily). Also, I
think the role of feeding competition at Ngogo in helping to explain these results can be
expanded upon, and I suggest ways of doing so below. Finally, I think more can be made of the
fact that Ngogo is a rather unique community (at least among those that are currently habituated
to human observers). It is enormous and includes far more females than can be found in other
communities. The role of this unique demographic makeup in influencing the authors’ results is
discussed a bit in the Discussion section, but I would like to see a more explicit mention of this
much earlier on, in the Introduction.
Below are more specific comments:
Line 32-65: It would be good to include some mention of the potential costs for each party
engaged in alloparenting, though I realize that is not the primary focus of the paper. Mothers,
infants, and alloparents all clearly potentially benefit, but what are the costs? This could help in
evaluating the relative strength of the benefits, as well.
Line 95-101: Something could also be said here concerning milk quality (as opposed to just
volume). Maternal lactation effort may indicate something about volume produced but quality
may still be compromised.
Line 141-143: How does the frequency of this reporting differ from that in other species? What
I’m getting at is, how less likely are chimpanzee mothers to allow non-relatives to alloparent than
are mothers of other primate species? (alloparenting is common among relatives in other species,
as well)
3
Line 145-155: (Note re: the following the comment - I see now that you address this in line 168-
172, but it would be useful to include a statement to this effect somewhere in line 145-155, as well)
I don’t quite see how natal attraction rates are really helping you get at whether there are
discernible maternal fitness impacts associated with alloparenting. If the infant is still in physical
contact with the mother and others are merely showing interest, the possibility for suckling
remains, and so how is this markedly different from situations in which other individuals are
NOT showing natal attraction?
Line 159: (I see that you bring up this issue in lines 351-355 in the Discussion, but I would add
some text to this part of the Introduction, as well) I would suggest caution in using time spent
feeding as an index of caloric consumption. A female feeding on carbohydrate- and lipid-rich ripe
fruits and seeds can obtain the same caloric benefit as a female feeding on fiber-rich pith and
stems in a much shorter amount of time feeding. Also, using proportion of time spent feeding
potentially overlooks the fact that resting and traveling (as well as other non-feeding-related
activities) are not equivalent in their caloric costs. Indeed, two females may feed for the same
percentage of time (say, 40% of the day), but if female “A” spends 30% of her day traveling and
30% resting, while female “B” only spends 20% traveling and 40% resting, there will likely be a
difference in caloric balance between these two individuals.
Line 166: change “net energetic net gains” to “net energy gains”
Lines 173-175 (but more generally, as well): to what extent did the females studied differ in
amount of time spent feeding when they did NOT have nursing offspring - pregnant, cycling,
etc? If you have the data, would it be useful to look among individuals at the difference in
amount of time spent feeding while nursing offspring vs. not nursing?
Line 179: should read “comprises”
Line 187-197: This is all important information, but I wonder if it would fit better into the
Introduction than the Methods
Line 235-236: what was the basis for deciding on the one minute gap between bouts? Is this
biologically meaningful?
Line 241-242: what were other behavioral categories? How were they defined?
Line 248-254: I definitely see the rationale for including maternal parity and infant age as
covariates, but is it necessary to include infant sex? Has this been demonstrated to impact
weaning patterns in other studies? By including so many predictor variables you risk over-
parameterization of the model (though there is plenty of debate as to whether
overparametrization is even a problem in GEE/GLM-type models)
Line 277: Did you specify a link function for the GEEs? Something like a log link would be
appropriate, as your response variable takes the form “number of bouts per unit time”
Line 306: The interpretation of the stats on effect of infant age is somewhat misleading - the beta
coefficients for attraction and handling are the same, according to the table, even though the p
values differ
Line 430: change to “may be that”
4
Line 431: This raises an interesting question - was there any detectable “seasonality” in the
frequency of infant handling? Were mothers more or less likely to allow others to carry their
infants at different times of the year? What might be the relationship with food availability?
Line 431-437: But couldn’t the contrary be true? Is it possible that decreased feeding competition
enables mothers to feed efficiently even with a clinging and suckling infant, thereby reducing the
potential feeding advantage of allowing others to carry their infant? (I know you didn’t see a
relationship with feeding effort, but this could at least be mentioned as a hypothetical).

Overall, I found this study and manuscript to be very interesting. The research presented here
contributes to a hole where research is lacking: alloparental care in a non-cooperative breeding
male philopatric species. It appears that there is still much work to be done in this area, but the
finding that infant handling reduces maternal lactational effort is quite fascinating and a
worthwhile contribution to the scientific literature on both chimpanzees and the evolution of
alloparental care. It also raises the possibility of an additional benefit to the high levels of
gregariousness and female dyadic associations documented at the Ngogo site.
I recommend this manuscript for publication with minor revisions. Below are my specific
comments on areas that I think need some attention for editing and clarity.
Introduction:
Line 44: “much alloparenting”, in “…Infants who receive much alloparenting experience longer
periods between nursing bouts…” is awkward. I suggest revising.
5
Methods:
Lines 212 – 218 (Behavioural data collection): There are a few things here that need clarifying. It
is explained that samples on a focal infant lasted one hour with at least 30 min in between unless
there is a change in the behavioral state of the infant. What is unclear is after the hour is up, was
a new infant focal chosen (if available in the party)? And if there was only one infant present,
then was there just a wait time to start another sample? How were focal infants selected if there
was more than one in the party? I am also curious about the reasoning behind starting a new
focal sample if the infant changed behavioral state. The older the infant, the more frequently
behavior will change. I don’t suspect that this led to any biases in the data, it’s just not clear why
this protocol was chosen.
Lines 222 – 230: I understand the importance of the distinction between infant handling and natal
attraction (in fact I was left wondering based on your results and discussion if “natal attraction”
should really be considered alloparenting). However, I was surprised to see grooming and
playing in the natal attraction category rather than the handling category. Later it is explained
that infant handling takes precedent over the other behaviors when done in combination with
handling. Where I am left confused is if an individual is grooming or playing with the infant
when the infant is not on the mother’s body, but not physically holding the infant at the time (e.g.
both the infant and the “alloparent” are sitting on a branch/ground/nest and the alloparent is
grooming or playing with the infant), was this classified as handling or attraction? Does
attraction only apply if the infant is clinging to the mother at the time of the interaction? If
grooming and playing are classified as attraction in this scenario, then what is the justification for
this (especially in the case of grooming)? Why isn’t it considered handling?
Lines 250 – 251: Mothers classified as “primiparous” or “multiparous”. This is clear enough, but
then subsequently in the manuscript (in results and discussion, lines 303 and 405), “uniparous” is
used in text with “primiparous” used in the figures only. Are the terms being used
interchangeably, or is there meant to be a distinction between the two? If the former, than I
would be consistent throughout, if the latter, then the distinction needs to be defined.
Discussion:
Lines 356 – 357 & 375: The authors note in the introduction that reduced lactational effort leads to
earlier weaning. Thus they are using maternal lactational effort (measured by nursing time and
isotope ratios) as a proxy for time to weaning in chimpanzees. Indeed, they find that increased
infant handling results in statistically significant lower nursing rates and faecal nitrogen
differences. What is unclear, however, is if this absolute difference is great enough to merit the
conclusion that time to weaning is accelerated when no data on variation in age at weaning is
presented in this manuscript, especially when the process is so gradual as it is in chimpanzees. In
other words, is the statistically significance difference a biologically meaningful difference?
Perhaps the inclusion of some raw data would help determine if the conclusion can be drawn that
infant handling leads to accelerated weaning. For example, what are nursing rates and isotope
values by infant age category? What are the absolute differences between females with infants
that experience little to no infant handling compared to infants that experience high rates of
handling at any given age (if possible to do)? Ultimately, I defer to the authors’ expertise on the
matter, and the results are interesting and important regardless, but I would like to see it
presented in a way that other readers don’t do a double take when they get to statements in the
discussion, like that on like 357, and wonder how they made the leap from data showing reduced
lactational effort to the absolute conclusion that weaning is accelerated.
Lines 401 – 402: Could this also be that multiparous females are able to produce higher quality
milk than primiparous females? I believe that Katie Hinde has found this in her research on
macaques.
6
Lines 433 – 434: I suggest citing Wakefield (2013) here in addition to Wakefield (2008) because the
2013 paper presents the ranging data, whereas 2008 discusses the reduced feeding competition.
General comments:
I would be really interested to see the data on who is doing the alloparental care (what
proportion are older siblings, “friends” of the mother, adult kin, females or males…), but I am
guessing that this will be examined in a separate publication. So I look forward to that.

s paper expands our understanding of the extent and possible role of alloparenting, and
re specifically the role of infant handling, in chimpanzees. The authors use a novel
hodological approach to show that mothers who permitted infant handling showed
uced lactation effort, and conclude that alloparenting may facilitate a more rapid
ning process than would be otherwise possible, and thereby enhance maternal fitness
enabling the mother to more quickly resume cycling.
rall the manuscript is very strong, and does not require much revision. The paper is
y well written. The flow of the paper is very logical and clear, making the authors’
uments and aims very easy to follow. The methodology is sound, and the novel
roach to quantifying weaning is one that will likely end up being applied widely in
dlife studies. Finally, the conclusions drawn from the data clearly follow from the results
sented.
concerns are minor. I think the paper is acceptable pending the minor revisions
ussed below:
st important, perhaps, is a statistical analysis consideration - I am concerned that the
mber of predictor variables you include in your GEEs is too high given your sample size.
many predictors relative to the number of cases risks overparameterization and this
kes interpretation of beta coefficients and standard errors of covariates difficult. I make
gestions below on a way to possibly alleviate this concern (I think it can be done rather
ly). Also, I think the role of feeding competition at Ngogo in helping to explain these
ults can be expanded upon, and I suggest ways of doing so below. Finally, I think more
be made of the fact that Ngogo is a rather unique community (at least among those that
currently habituated to human observers). It is enormous and includes far more
ales than can be found in other communities. The role of this unique demographic
keup in influencing the authors’ results is discussed a bit in the Discussion section, but I
ld like to see a more explicit mention of this much earlier on, in the Introduction.
per your thoughtful suggestion, we ran all of the GEE analyses without infant sex as a
ariate and the significance/non-significance of our analyses did not change. However, we do
k it is important to include each of the three different covariates in the analyses, and in Lines
-305, we now include justifications and associated references for why we added each of the
e covariates in the GEE models. In particular, infant sex differences in weaning have been
onstrated in other chimpanzee populations (e.g. Fahy et al., 2014 at Tai, Cote d’Ivoire).
nt sex has also been shown to influence lactation and milk quality in primates (e.g. Hinde
7; 2009), as well as the amount of alloparenting received (e.g. Badescu et al., 2015).
ernal parity was included as a covariate because of its possible influence on milk quality,
ation performance, and mothering experience (e.g. Tanaka 1997; Hinde 2007; Hinde and
ligan 2011). In addition, the QIC and QICC values, which are used to evaluate the strengths
ach model in a GEE and are in the “smaller is better form”, remained similar between the
dels that included infant sex and the ones that excluded infant sex. The differences in
/QICC values between models with and without the infant sex covariate were between 1 or 2
d they jumped up by 10 or 20 when adding the infant sex variable, we would have been
cerned that the precision of the output results was decreased due to too many covariates, and
would have strongly considered removing this variable. QIC and QICC values are generally
reported in manuscripts using GEE analyses but we have made a note in text (Lines 344-348)
cribing that we did consider QIC and QICC values as a way to evaluate the models.
es 503-507, 517-523, 537-539 in the Discussion, we included sections where we more
oughly consider the extent to which feeding competition and food availability at Ngogo
ld affect maternal permissiveness and alloparenting rates at Ngogo.
es 83-88: We have added a section early in the Introduction highlighting some of the unique
ures of the Ngogo chimpanzee community, including the large number of females and overall
e number of individuals, the low female feeding competition, and high tendency for natal
ales to reproduce in the group at Ngogo.
ow are more specific comments:
e 32-65: It would be good to include some mention of the potential costs for each party
aged in alloparenting, though I realize that is not the primary focus of the paper.
thers, infants, and alloparents all clearly potentially benefit, but what are the costs?
s could help in evaluating the relative strength of the benefits, as well.
es 66-69: We now include a sentence considering the potential costs of alloparenting to
nts, mothers when alloparenting is less competent, rough or excessive, and to alloparents
n they expend time and energy on caring for infants who are not their own.
e 95-101: Something could also be said here concerning milk quality (as opposed to just
ume). Maternal lactation effort may indicate something about volume produced but
lity may still be compromised.
es 106-109: We included a sentence on how differences in maternal milk composition can
uence nursing, nutritional needs and growth and development for infants.
e 141-143: How does the frequency of this reporting differ from that in other species?
at I’m getting at is, how less likely are chimpanzee mothers to allow non-relatives to
parent than are mothers of other primate species? (alloparenting is common among
tives in other species, as well)
added a phrase addressing the idea that alloparenting by non-kin in chimpanzees seems to be
n less common that alloparenting done by kin, Lines 156-158. Rates or frequencies of
parenting are very difficult to find for chimpanzees. One paper from Mahale (Nishida 1983)
cifically talks about rates of infant/non-mother interactions according to kin and non-kin
gories, and we provide these reports in Lines 158-161. The lack of reported rates makes it
icult to generalize about how common alloparenting by non-kin may be in this species. In a
arate manuscript, we are planning to look at rates of alloparenting done by different age/sex
ses and kin categories at Ngogo.
e 145-155: (Note re: the following the comment - I see now that you address this in line
-172, but it would be useful to include a statement to this effect somewhere in line 145-
, as well) I don’t quite see how natal attraction rates are really helping you get at
ther there are discernible maternal fitness impacts associated with alloparenting. If the
nt is still in physical contact with the mother and others are merely showing interest,
possibility for suckling remains, and so how is this markedly different from situations
hich other individuals are NOT showing natal attraction?
es 179-185: We have added phrases here that indicate how natal attraction and infant
dling differentially affect access for infants to their mothers’ nipples to nurse.
e 159: (I see that you bring up this issue in lines 351-355 in the Discussion, but I would
some text to this part of the Introduction, as well) I would suggest caution in using time
nt feeding as an index of caloric consumption. A female feeding on carbohydrate- and
d-rich ripe fruits and seeds can obtain the same caloric benefit as a female feeding on
r-rich pith and stems in a much shorter amount of time feeding. Also, using proportion
ime spent feeding potentially overlooks the fact that resting and traveling (as well as
er non-feeding-related activities) are not equivalent in their caloric costs. Indeed, two
ales may feed for the same percentage of time (say, 40% of the day), but if female “A”
nds 30% of her day traveling and 30% resting, while female “B” only spends 20%
eling and 40% resting, there will likely be a difference in caloric balance between these
individuals.
es 190, 196-199: We added sections in the Hypotheses and Predictions to clarify that we are
stigating one potential aspect of maternal energy gains and expenditures through the time
hers spent feeding, and also talk about the limitations on this measure. This make it clear
ier on in the text that we are investigating one aspect of maternal energy balance out of
eral possible measures, which are covered earlier in the introduction section and later in the
ussion section.
e 166: change “net energetic net gains” to “net energy gains”
e 195: Changed phrase to “net energy gains”.
es 173-175 (but more generally, as well): to what extent did the females studied differ in
ount of time spent feeding when they did NOT have nursing offspring - pregnant,
ing, etc? If you have the data, would it be useful to look among individuals at the
erence in amount of time spent feeding while nursing offspring vs. not nursing?
, this would be an interesting contrast in feeding times among females. We do not presently
e feeding data from females without dependent offspring but will keep this comparison in
d for future data collection.
e 179: should read “comprises”
e 218: changed to “comprises”
e 187-197: This is all important information, but I wonder if it would fit better into the
oduction than the Methods
moved all of this information (now Lines 162-172) to the section called “Alloparenting in
mpanzees” in the Introduction.
e 235-236: what was the basis for deciding on the one minute gap between bouts? Is this
ogically meaningful?
nursing, a 1 minute interval has been shown to be a biologically meaningful amount of time
ween bouts. Gomendio 1989 showed statistically that when an infant interrupted nipple
tact for longer than 1 minute, the bout was considered to be finished, while if the interruption
less than 1 minute, it was a within-bout break. The 1-minute inter-bout length has also been
d in several primate infant studies for different behaviours and we cite these studies in-text,
e 278, to justify our use of the 1 minute interval.
e 241-242: what were other behavioral categories? How were they defined?
e 285-288, we added a sentence describing the other behavioral categories we recorded for
focal infants’ mothers.
e 248-254: I definitely see the rationale for including maternal parity and infant age as
ariates, but is it necessary to include infant sex? Has this been demonstrated to impact
ning patterns in other studies? By including so many predictor variables you risk over-
ameterization of the model (though there is plenty of debate as to whether
rparametrization is even a problem in GEE/GLM-type models)
es 294-308: We now include justifications and associated references for why we included
h of the three covariates in the GEE models. In particular, infant sex differences in weaning
e been demonstrated in other chimpanzee populations (e.g. Fahy et al., 2014 at Tai, Cote
oire). Infant sex has also been shown to influence lactation and milk quality in primates (e.g.
de 2007; 2009), as well as the amount of alloparenting received (e.g. Badescu et al., 2015).
think that these studies provide reasonable reasons for including infant sex as a covariate in
GEE analyses. We did, however, repeat all of the GEEs without infant sex and the
ificance/non-significance of our analyses did not change.
e 277: Did you specify a link function for the GEEs? Something like a log link would be
ropriate, as your response variable takes the form “number of bouts per unit time”
repeated all of the analyses with the “log” link function and the significance of our results
not change. We decided to use an “identity” log link function because this link can be used
h any distribution of the data and is appropriate when you have a mixture of continuous,
ry, and ordinal dependent variables. We now also identify our link function in text, Line 348.
e 306: The interpretation of the stats on effect of infant age is somewhat misleading - the
a coefficients for attraction and handling are the same, according to the table, even
ugh the p values differ
es 363-366: We added a section clarifying that while the effect of infant age was only
ificant for infant handling, the beta value, which is a measure of how strongly alloparenting
infant age are correlated, was the same for both natal attraction and infant handling.
e 430: change to “may be that”
phrase in previous Line 430 no longer exists in the text.
e 431: This raises an interesting question - was there any detectable “seasonality” in the
uency of infant handling? Were mothers more or less likely to allow others to carry
r infants at different times of the year? What might be the relationship with food
ilability?
es 517-523 and 537-539, we now talk about seasonality in subgrouping patterns of females,
d availability and the potential effects of these on alloparenting. Interestingly, Chapman et al.
99) found that Ngogo has relatively rare seasons of low food availability and food abundance
ms to be pretty constant for the chimpanzees at the site. Wakefield (2008) found that there
no distinguishable seasonality in female grouping patterns at Ngogo in relation to food
lability. While we do not have sufficient long-term data to look at statistical differences in
parenting according to seasons of abundance versus scarcity, this is something to investigate
he future as we continue our data collection on infants. Similarly, detecting seasonality in
parenting apart from food availability would require more long-term data, as we some
hers are generally more permissive than others, so the comparisons would need to be made
hanges in alloparenting for individual mothers over time rather than lumping all mothers
ther. We currently do not have sufficient data on individual mothers/infants to look at
nges in alloparenting over time but this is something that is very interesting to us and that we
aim to investigate in the future.
e 431-437: But couldn’t the contrary be true? Is it possible that decreased feeding
petition enables mothers to feed efficiently even with a clinging and suckling infant,
reby reducing the potential feeding advantage of allowing others to carry their infant?
now you didn’t see a relationship with feeding effort, but this could at least be
ntioned as a hypothetical).
es 503-507: We now include a section in the discussion that talks about the connection you
nted out between decreased feeding competition and potential decrease in alloparenting
efits for maternal feeding efficiency. We suggest that this may explain why we did not find a
elation between handling and maternal time spent feeding.

mments to the Author(s)
rall, I found this study and manuscript to be very interesting. The research presented
e contributes to a hole where research is lacking: alloparental care in a non-cooperative
eding male philopatric species. It appears that there is still much work to be done in this
a, but the finding that infant handling reduces maternal lactational effort is quite
inating and a worthwhile contribution to the scientific literature on both chimpanzees
the evolution of alloparental care. It also raises the possibility of an additional benefit
he high levels of gregariousness and female dyadic associations documented at the
go site.
commend this manuscript for publication with minor revisions. Below are my specific
ments on areas that I think need some attention for editing and clarity.
oduction:
e 44: “much alloparenting”, in “…Infants who receive much alloparenting experience
ger periods between nursing bouts…” is awkward. I suggest revising.
es 43-44: To make less awkward, we changed the word ‘much’ to ‘more’ and the phrase now
“frequent alloparenting may lead to quicker weaning because infants who receive more
parenting experience longer periods between nursing bouts…”
thods:
es 212 – 218 (Behavioural data collection): There are a few things here that need
ifying. It is explained that samples on a focal infant lasted one hour with at least 30 min
etween unless there is a change in the behavioral state of the infant. What is unclear is
r the hour is up, was a new infant focal chosen (if available in the party)? And if there
only one infant present, then was there just a wait time to start another sample? How
e focal infants selected if there was more than one in the party? I am also curious about
reasoning behind starting a new focal sample if the infant changed behavioral state.
older the infant, the more frequently behavior will change. I don’t suspect that this led
ny biases in the data, it’s just not clear why this protocol was chosen.
es 245-253: We now specify that after the 1 hour focal was over, we made an effort to choose
w focal infant to follow, if they were available (i.e. present and/or visible). If there were
nts that we did not have as much data on, or if there was a newborn infant, we did make an
rt to follow and focal them sooner. Line 245, we also now specify that the reasoning behind
ting for the focal behaviour to change before starting a new sample was to maximize our
ity to ensure independence between samples and in the behavioral states of the focal infants. I
ally think that older infants will change state behaviors faster because they may be more
ly to have long bouts of resting or feeding like the adult chimpanzees do. Younger infants
only rest for a little bit and then start squirming around, either looking to nurse, play, or just
ctive while the rest of the group continues to rest and feed. I do agree that potentially, the
y young infants (less than 2 months old) may just sleep for large portions of time. In any case,
waiting for the state behaviour to change was a guideline for us to maximizing inter-sample
pendence, while also being able to maximize our ability to collect as much data as possible.
es 222 – 230: I understand the importance of the distinction between infant handling
natal attraction (in fact I was left wondering based on your results and discussion if
tal attraction” should really be considered alloparenting). However, I was surprised to
grooming and playing in the natal attraction category rather than the handling
gory. Later it is explained that infant handling takes precedent over the other
aviors when done in combination with handling. Where I am left confused is if an
ividual is grooming or playing with the infant when the infant is not on the mother’s
y, but not physically holding the infant at the time (e.g. both the infant and the
oparent” are sitting on a branch/ground/nest and the alloparent is grooming or playing
h the infant), was this classified as handling or attraction? Does attraction only apply if
infant is clinging to the mother at the time of the interaction? If grooming and playing
classified as attraction in this scenario, then what is the justification for this (especially
he case of grooming)? Why isn’t it considered handling?
es 265-273: We now include an explanation that there were instances of natal attraction when
infant was near the mother but not in body contact, and a conspecific was grooming or
ing with the infant, this was considered a natal attraction interaction. We also provide
ons for why this grey area in alloparental interactions was considered natal attraction rather
handling. In these situations, the infant is not generally constrained and it can still move
ly easily between interacting with the alloparent and also returning to the mother to nurse or
away from the alloparent. There is more risk during instances when the infant is actually
g held compared to just being groomed while separated from the mother, as the alloaprent
potentially kidnap the infant while holding it, or the alloparent can drop the infant and there
more opportunities for clumsy or rough interactions that could hurt the infant. We have seen
ations when the mother allows these kinds of independent playing or grooming interactions,
then the alloparent will attempt to grab and hold the infant ventrally and the mother quickly
eves the infant. We think this indicates that for the mother, there may be more at risk during
al holding than during independent grooming and playing. Thinking about it, this makes
e for human babies too – the risk of hurting a baby is greater when it is being held because it
be dropped, compared to a baby that is already on the ground being tickled or played with.
es 250 – 251: Mothers classified as “primiparous” or “multiparous”. This is clear
ugh, but then subsequently in the manuscript (in results and discussion, lines 303 and
), “uniparous” is used in text with “primiparous” used in the figures only. Are the terms
ng used interchangeably, or is there meant to be a distinction between the two? If the
mer, than I would be consistent throughout, if the latter, then the distinction needs to be
ned.
oughout the text, we changed all of terms from uniparous to primiparous, as they were being
d interchangeably and this was confusing.
cussion:
es 356 – 357 & 375: The authors note in the introduction that reduced lactational effort
s to earlier weaning. Thus they are using maternal lactational effort (measured by
sing time and isotope ratios) as a proxy for time to weaning in chimpanzees. Indeed,
y find that increased infant handling results in statistically significant lower nursing
s and faecal nitrogen differences. What is unclear, however, is if this absolute
erence is great enough to merit the conclusion that time to weaning is accelerated when
data on variation in age at weaning is presented in this manuscript, especially when the
cess is so gradual as it is in chimpanzees. In other words, is the statistically significance
erence a biologically meaningful difference? Perhaps the inclusion of some raw data
ld help determine if the conclusion can be drawn that infant handling leads to
elerated weaning. For example, what are nursing rates and isotope values by infant age
gory? What are the absolute differences between females with infants that experience
e to no infant handling compared to infants that experience high rates of handling at
given age (if possible to do)? Ultimately, I defer to the authors’ expertise on the matter,
the results are interesting and important regardless, but I would like to see it presented
way that other readers don’t do a double take when they get to statements in the
ussion, like that on like 357, and wonder how they made the leap from data showing
uced lactational effort to the absolute conclusion that weaning is accelerated.
es 128-130: We now include a sentence to say that changes in fecal stable nitrogen isotopes
h infant age provide a biologically meaningful way of tracking nutritional development and
ning in this population. Detailed descriptions of how fecal stable nitrogen isotopes tend to
nge with infant age and through development were reported in Badescu et al. (in press) and
should be available soon. Similarly, changes in rates of nursing, as well as a detailed contrast
ween nursing rates and fecal stable isotope values through infant age categories will be
orted in a separate manuscript that we are currently preparing. We include below, only for
r personal viewing, a graph that has not been peer reviewed, showing how nursing rates and
l stable isotopes change with infant age. This demonstrates how the pattern of infant nursing
he Ngogo chimpanzees changes with age and how it compares to changes in fecal stable
ogen isotopes as infants age.
ure 1: Mean rates of infant nursing and infant – mother differences in fecal stable nitrogen
opes (d15N ‰), by infant age. Vertical bars show standard error.
also provide means of our raw data in Figure 2 and 3 below, to show how mean infant
dling rates (split up in two categories: lower half of infant handling rates and upper half of
nt handling rates) compared to mean nursing rates and mean fecal stable nitrogen differences
nfant age categories. There seems to be a visible pattern of higher nursing rates and higher
l stable nitrogen isotope differences associated with the lower half of infant handling rates.
wever, we do not think that these raw data figures should be included in the manuscript as
1) lump rates of handling into two categories so that we could make the comparisons but are
what was actually tested in the GEE analyses, and 2) the comparisons in these figures do not
into account any of the interactions between covariates that were considered in the GEE
lyses, so the raw data could be misleading because of this.
ure 1. Mean nursing rates of infants who were handled in the lower versus upper halves of the
nt handling rates categories, by infant age. Bars show standard errors.
ure 2. Mean mother-infant differences in faecal stable nitrogen isotopes for infants who were
dled in the lower versus upper halves of the infant handling rates categories, by infant age.
s show standard errors.
es 401 – 402: Could this also be that multiparous females are able to produce higher
lity milk than primiparous females? I believe that Katie Hinde has found this in her
arch on macaques.
es 295-297, 468-473: Yes, this is true. We now address maternal milk quality in several
ions throughout the text and we added Katie Hinde’s work to these sections.
es 433 – 434: I suggest citing Wakefield (2013) here in addition to Wakefield (2008)
ause the 2013 paper presents the ranging data, whereas 2008 discusses the reduced
ing competition.
e 88, 499: We included Wakefield (2013) as a reference here and in another section in the
.
eral comments:
ould be really interested to see the data on who is doing the alloparental care (what
portion are older siblings, “friends” of the mother, adult kin, females or males…), but I
guessing that this will be examined in a separate publication. So I look forward to that.
nk you your interest in this. We are planning to examine the effects of kinship, age and sex of
nts and alloparents on natal attraction and infant handling in another manuscript. Preliminary
lyses were presented at the 2015 Canadian Association of Physical Anthropology (CAPA)
ference in Winnipeg. Here are the preliminary results we reported in this conference abstract:
tes of behaviors did not seem to vary by the ages of infants (GEE, natal attraction: p = 0.94;
nt handling: p = 0.38) or handlers (natal attraction: p = 0.07; infant handling: p = 0.77).
ales were more attracted to infants than males (p = 0.04), but they did not get to handle them
e (p = 0.10). Infant females received more natal attraction (p = 0.01) and infant handling (p =
) than males. Maternal male and female kin showed the most natal attraction (p=0.00) and
nt handling (p=0.00).”
