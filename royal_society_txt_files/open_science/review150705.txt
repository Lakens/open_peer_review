Report:
The submitted manuscript, "An NMR Study of Water in Aggrecan Solutions", reports on
transport and dynamical properties of Aggrecan biomolecules in water solution, using nuclear
3
magnetic resonance (NMR). The subject is actual and quite important; as one of the main
constituents of cartilage, the study of isolated aggrecan at different concentrations using NMR
could certainly shed some light into the effort of understanding better the role of aggrecan in
both, healthy and unhealthy tissue.
The manuscript presents valuable experimental data, but in my opinion there is a lack of a
rigorous interpretation. The authors perform the discussion based on very well known models
from the literature, however it is difficult to find a consistent general argumentation on why they
choose these experiments and how the results contribute to the field of articular cartilage.
Comments and questions:
1) It would be great if the authors could clarify why they have chosen two different magnetic
field strengths (high and low). What are the advantages in each case?
2) The dynamic of the solutions depends on the concentration and temperature, but is
independent of the different magnetic field strengths. Could the authors comment/clarify why
the activation energies related with both, T1 and T2 relaxation processes, are significantly
different in figure 3 C (low field) and D (high field)?
3) Page 5, paragraphs 1 to 3: The authors mention with uncertainty, that there is a kind of
"transition" region (lines 8/9) for example in R2, around the concentrations 0.012 – 0.019, possibly
because of self-assembly/aggregation of aggrecan molecules. It is known, for instance from
reference [4] in the manuscript that aggrecan, in near physiological conditions, forms complexes
with hyaluronic acid (HA) and as a consequence, the degree of order increases in the presence of
HA.
My question is whether is possible to see, as the authors claim, self-assembly or aggregation in
absence of HA?
Moreover, I am a bit confuse, when the authors write, in lines 18/19 something like:
" It must be noted that the features discussed here and above, the inflection and nonlinearity,
could in principle be due to the errors in the sample preparation and, consequently, the
concentrations".
The authors discuss and even make conclusions on something that is not certain? The authors
should comment on this point.
4) Page 6, lines 20 to 21. The authors refer to the amplitude of R1 in its Arrhenius form. Which is
the physical meaning of this amplitude? How these "amplitudes" can be correlated and
interpreted more precisely?
5) In section "Conclusion", at the end (lines 58 and below). Comment: This conclusion somehow is
detached from the rest of the manuscript.
Minor points:
i) The authors could refer to a more fundamental reference (for instance: Gisser, D. J.; Ediger, M.
D. J. Phys. Chem. 1993, 97, 10818) for formula (3) instead of reference (37).
ii) The figures 1 and 3 are somehow difficult to read in a printed version.
4
iii) In order to compare, it will make the things easier when the ordinate-axes scales in Figures 1
C and D are the same.
The manuscript, from my point of view, does not introduce any original idea, however there is
still a lot of valuable experimental work, and could be taken into consideration for publishing
after the authors address the list of comments and questions.

Dear Editors,
The manuscript "An NMR Study of Water in Aggrecan Solutions" presents a detailed study of the
characteristic nmr relaxation (R1 and R2) parameters and diffusion of the aggrecan proteoglycan
at different concentrations in aqueous salt solutions, in a range of temperatures covering
physiological conditions.
In a previous report on the former manuscript, I have mentioned the relevance of this study
because of its contribution to understand the role of aggrecan in the cartilage tissue.
I still think that this study introduces valuable experimental data. I have expressed in my first
review several concerns about originality and interpretation of the results. However, I am finding
in this new submitted version of the manuscript that the authors have clarified in a positive way
my concerns and somehow answered the questions I have raised before.
The results give as well inputs in the (very relevant) field of dynamics of the hydration (and bulk)
water in proteins, in this case in the aggrecan macromolecule in solution.
In particular the authors quite justify the use of two different magnetic fields, finding in this way
the influence of the chemical exchange in the processes of relaxation.
In my opinion, the manuscript can be published in the actual form without further changes.
Yours sincerely,
Carlos Mattea

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_5
This manuscript reports experimental data on relaxation rates and water self-diffusion
coefficients as a function of aggrecan concentration and temperature. The experimental data seem
to be accurate and worth reporting however their data analysis is somewhat superficial and it is
not clear how their results are relevant to cartilage. Although I am not expert in the field of
cartilage and let other reviewers comment on this, there are statements that make me wonder. For
example:
The description of Eq.3 (Stokes-Einstein) is perplexing. This is introduced as describing the
“rotational diffusion of a sphere”. However this equation deals with translational diffusion. It
might be a typo but difficult to accept (there is also a “rotational friction”). Anyhow, all data
analysis seems approximate.
Table 2: how is it possible that the discrepancy between g/g concentration and g/L concentration
increases with dilution? Since the density of the aqueous fluid is close to 1 g/mL and the specific
volume of protein/carbohydrate materials is close to 0.8 cm3/g, the two concentrations should be
very close to each other at low concentration while the volume concentration will tend to become
larger than the mass concentration as the solute amount increases.

Comments to the Author(s)
The manuscript is enhanced than the previous submission but authors did not respond appropriately
to the present reviewer's suggested experiment. I spent time for this manuscript to be enhanced but
the response was only "a word and superficial" rather than "an action with experiment or to be
actual".
>> We have clarified the aims of the paper by redrafting the final paragraph in section 2 of the
paper. We believe that understanding the NMR response of the individual constituents of cartilage,
in this case, Aggrecan, is important to understanding the function of those constituents within
cartilage us both healthy and unhealthy tissue.
>>Due to the biological nature of the sample, the samples measured were only viable for the short
period of time, during which time all the measurements for the paper were made. The cost of
procuring new samples is currently prohibitive and thus further experiments cannot currently be
performed.
I do not care whether you cite suggested papers or not but if you insist the work without further
experiment, there is no value for any followers to read your work as a basis for further development
in cartilage biology and any other radiology study.
You put some solution/liquid and claim that your work is about cartilage. Does that make sense at
all?
>> The aim of the paper was not to directly infer information about cartilage, but to investigate the
NMR response of Aggrecan molecules in water. This, to our knowledge has not been done in the
literature and we believe that to fully understand the NMR response in more complex biological
tissues, such as cartilage, there is value in understanding how the individual constituents of the
tissues. This has been clarified within the section 2 of the paper.

The submitted manuscript, "An NMR Study of Water in Aggrecan Solutions", reports on transport

cartilage, the study of isolated aggrecan at different concentrations using NMR could certainly shed
some light into the effort of understanding better the role of aggrecan in both, healthy and

The manuscript presents valuable experimental data, but in my opinion there is a lack of a rigorous
interpretation. The authors perform the discussion based on very well known models from the
literature, however it is difficult to find a consistent general argumentation on why they choose
these experiments and how the results contribute to the field of articular cartilage.
Comments and questions:
1) It would be great if the authors could clarify why they have chosen two different magnetic field
strengths (high and low). What are the advantages in each case?
>> The use of two different magnetic field strengths allowed the effects of chemical exchange to be
investigated. This has been clarified in the final paragraph of section 2.
2) The dynamic of the solutions depends on the concentration and temperature, but is independent
of the different magnetic field strengths. Could the authors comment/clarify why the activation
energies related with both, T1 and T2 relaxation processes, are significantly different in figure 3 C
(low field) and D (high field)?
>> T1 in the low field case is becoming sensitive to low frequencies, whereas T2 at both high and low
field is sensitive to low frequencies.
3) Page 5, paragraphs 1 to 3: The authors mention with uncertainty, that there is a kind of
"transition" region (lines 8/9) for example in R2, around the concentrations 0.012 – 0.019, possibly
because of self-assembly/aggregation of aggrecan molecules. It is known, for instance from
reference [4] in the manuscript that aggrecan, in near physiological conditions, forms complexes
with hyaluronic acid (HA) and as a consequence, the degree of order increases in the presence of
HA.
My question is whether is possible to see, as the authors claim, self-assembly or aggregation in
absence of HA?
>> It is our interpretation that we are seeing self-assembly/aggregation of the aggrecan in this study.
Reference [3] in the manuscript (Chandran and Horkay) indicates that this has been observed
previously in the absence of HA.
>> However, this is perhaps beyond the scope of the paper, which is to primarily report the NMR
response and would be the subject of future work.
Moreover, I am a bit confused, when the authors write, in lines 18/19 something like:
" It must be noted that the features discussed here and above, the inflection and nonlinearity, could
in principle be due to the errors in the sample preparation and, consequently, the concentrations".
The authors discuss and even make conclusions on something that is not certain? The authors
should comment on this point.
>> We accept that this line was confusing to the reader and it has been removed.
4) Page 6, lines 20 to 21. The authors refer to the amplitude of R1 in its Arrhenius form. Which is the
physical meaning of this amplitude? How these "amplitudes" can be correlated and interpreted
more precisely?
>> We have expanded our physical interpretation of this term within the text of the discussion.
5) In section "Conclusion", at the end (lines 58 and below). Comment: This conclusion somehow is
detached from the rest of the manuscript.
>> This paragraph has been moved to the discussion section. The inclusion in the conclusion was an
error.
Minor points:
i) The authors could refer to a more fundamental reference (for instance: Gisser, D. J.; Ediger, M. D.
J. Phys. Chem. 1993, 97, 10818) for formula (3) instead of reference (37).
>> We have added this more fundamental reference.
ii) The figures 1 and 3 are somehow difficult to read in a printed version.
>> The figures have been re-plotted in order to make them clearer
iii) In order to compare, it will make the things easier when the ordinate-axes scales in Figures 1 C
and D are the same.
>> The scaling has now been adjusted to make comparison clearer.
The manuscript, from my point of view, does not introduce any original idea, however there is still a
lot of valuable experimental work, and could be taken into consideration for publishing after the
authors address the list of comments and questions.

Comments to the Author(s)
Minor: Please briefly explain why relaxation rates decrease with temperature.
>> In accordance to BPP theory, there exist two regimes for relaxation rates – a solid-like phase and
a liquid-like phase. It is believed that in the system studied here, we are probing within the liquid-
like regime and thus in accordance with BPP theory, relaxation rates decrease with temperature.
Major: Eq. 3: I have two concerns about the use of the Stokes-Einstein relation for a solvent
molecule. This relation has been derived for large particles in the presence of solvent treated as a
continuum. Furthermore, it applies to dilute condition; on the other hand, it is here applied to
solvent (small) molecules that are concentrated.
The authors should expand/clarify/revise this section so that the equations they use are explained
including relevant literature.
>> Stokes-Einstein has been previously used in similar work on macromolecules in solution.
Justification and explanation of this approach has been included in the discussion in much greater
detail with full references to justify the use of Stokes-Einstein in this context.
Important: Concentration, Cm, in the figures. It is expected that units are included on the x-axis

se in the aggrecan macromolecule in solution.
icular the authors quite justify the use of two different magnetic fields, finding in this way the influence of the
al exchange in the processes of relaxation.
pinion, the manuscript can be published in the actual form without further changes.

anuscript reports experimental data on relaxation rates and water self-diffusion coefficients as a function of
an concentration and temperature. The experimental data seem to be accurate and worth reporting however
ata analysis is somewhat superficial and it is not clear how their results are relevant to cartilage. Although I am
pert in the field of cartilage and let other reviewers comment on this, there are statements that make me
r. For example:
scription of Eq.3 (Stokes-Einstein) is perplexing. This is introduced as describing the “rotational diffusion of a
”. However this equation deals with translational diffusion. It might be a typo but difficult to accept (there is
rotational friction”). Anyhow, all data analysis seems approximate.
sentence the referee is referring to is on page 5 starting the paragraph above equation 3:
ydrodynamic basis for determining a rotational friction coefficient for spheres rotating within a viscous
m was introduced by Stokes and then later used by Einstein to describe the Brownian motion of particles.”
atement is entirely correct and describes the origin of the Stokes-Einstein equation in terms of the work by
and the later development of this by Einstein. Therefore we do not need to make any changes to our
ent.
: how is it possible that the discrepancy between g/g concentration and g/L concentration increases with
n? Since the density of the aqueous fluid is close to 1 g/mL and the specific volume of protein/carbohydrate
als is close to 0.8 cm3/g, the two concentrations should be very close to each other at low concentration while
ume concentration will tend to become larger than the mass concentration as the solute amount increases.
able 2 the middle column gives the amount of aggrecan experimentally added to the salt solution in terms of
ss of aggrecan per total mass of the resultant solution. The right column is an independent experimental
re of the concentration of aggrecan, achieved by determining the density of sulphonated groups, which is
ed to be proportional to the density of aggrecan molecules present. If though, the availability of sulphonated
is affected by the structure of the aggrecan (packing / assembly / entanglements) then this measure will not
ctly proportional to our concentrations that have been determined by known sample masses. A further
cation is that during self-assembly water can be excluded from the space between the molecules, meaning
nsity may not scale in the way described by the reviewer.
