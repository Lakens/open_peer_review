We thank the Associate Editor and the Reviewer for their comments and have responded to each of
them individually below. Where appropriate we have made changes to the manuscript and these are
highlighted in the revised version with red text.
Comments from the Associate Editor
This paper makes an interesting contribution to the literature by investigating modulation of joint and
leg actuation patterns during emulated acceleration. While I am happy to accept this paper in
principle, the authors need to address a number of additional issues before the paper will be suitable
for publication. Specifically, I would like the authors to 1) adding some important missing details to
the methods section including software details and, more importantly, error information relevant to
the inverse dynamics analysis, 2) ensure that the discussion appropriately acknowledges the
limitations of the joint-level analysis, and 3) provide access to the full data set in support of the
findings, in line with RSOS policy. Please revise the manuscript to address the specific points below.
I agree with the previous reviewer’s point that the timing of mechanical events is likely to be very
important in understanding energetics and dynamics of the locomotor task and for applying the
findings of this study to prosthetics or exoskeletons, which limits the utility of the indices presented.
We do appreciate the concerns of the previous reviewer and current editor regarding the lack of
temporal information provided by the functional indexes. However, we do feel that the paper does
not rely solely on the indexes, but uses them as a broad indicator of function and breaks down
important phases of the gait cycles / joint mechanics that contributed to the changes in function,
thus providing information as to when important changes happen throughout the gait cycle in
addition to the indexes.
A broader concern, however, is that the joint level analysis does not consider the very likely
possibility of energy transfer among joints via multi-articular linkages. The finding that positive work
is modulated at the ankle does not directly imply that the ankle extensor muscles generated this
power. Indeed, it has been demonstrated in humans and other mammals that positive work
generated by hip muscles is often transferred to the ankle, which makes sense because it allows
the large powerful proximal muscles to contribute work while avoiding large accelerations of the
more massive limb segments. However, the authors have not adequately addressed this issue as a
limitation of their joint-level analysis. While the issue is acknowledged in the limitations section,
the implications of this limitation are not fully addressed. This concern has implications for
interpreting the findings for device design. The appearance of ankle joint work does not imply that
an actuator must be placed there. Energy can be transferred via multi-articular linkages from
actuators located more proximally. A device that tries to replicate joint-level function by putting
actual springs, dampers and actuators at each joint as indicated by the analysis in this paper would
probably be misguided. A more detailed analysis of these energy transfer patterns might allow
design of a prosthetic device that does not directly contribute positive work but instead assists in
developing effectively timed resistance torques (for example, by appropriately tuned passive
springs) to facilitate energy transfer from proximal muscles to distal segments.
As the Editor notes, we are aware of the concept of power transfer through the limb that exists and,
as we note in the manuscript, the inability to identify work that has been transferred is a limitation
of this approach. Most of the points touched on here by the Editor were acknowledged in the
Limitations section of the manuscript but we have added to this in an effort to place more emphasis
on the topic. While the body may use power transferred from proximal muscles as a means of doing
work at distal joints, it does not preclude the usefulness of knowing that work is done at those distal
joints and must be done at those joints to replicate natural gait. We do not claim this analysis to be
a definitive guide to how to apply external assistance – simply that it is useful information in the
process of formulating ideas and that the indexes provide a useful means of fair comparison to
constant speed that cannot be made with raw joint work/moment data. Furthermore, actuators
used for assistance are not constrained to being located on joints or even the leg (e.g. actuators in
a back pack connected by cables to the limb) and thus, unlike muscles, a large actuator may assist
at a joint without adding mass directly to the adjacent segments. Thus, the constraints that have
influenced evolution may not always be the same constraints that are imposed on design. We
therefore believe that the data presented are useful, even in light of some limitations, which we
acknowledge.
2) A number of important details have been omitted from the methods, and these need to be
amended before the paper is suitable for publication.
I agree with the previous reviewers comment that the stride selection criteria are unclear. What
specific event was used to parse the data into strides? A threshold force? Peak force? Minimum
force? Be specific about the type of event used and any specific thresholds, if relevant, as such
information would be necessary to replicate the methods for a similar study. Please also state
software used for this processing (or if the processing was done by hand, if this is the case).
Definitions of gait events that characterised walking and running have been added to section 4.3,
along with details of how events were determined. Data were processed via custom Matlab code
and this has now been mentioned in the same section.
What specific software packages and specific toolboxes (if relevant) were used for the data
processing and statistical analysis? This information is not mentioned anywhere. OpenSiM is
mentioned for the inverse dynamics, but this software is not suitable for the data processing and
statistical analysis steps, to my knowledge.
Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism software – this is now indicated in section
4.5 of the manuscript. All data processing beyond inverse dynamic and kinematic analyses were
performed using Matlab software and a series of custom scripts and functions. This is now indicated
at the end of section 4.2.
How did the authors align and synchronize the QTM and separately collected ATMI force plate data,
and in what software? Did the authors conduct any error/sensitivity analysis on the errors
associated with this process? Did the authors conduct any specific optimization to minimize these
errors? Inverse dynamics is extremely sensitive to the correct alignment of the kinematic and force
data both in time and space, and so it is important that the authors report this information including
the magnitude of potential errors.
We had unfortunately omitted the details that all signals from the instrumented treadmill and the
load cell were logged via the Qualisys system’s A-D board, in the QTM software. The system
synchronises A-D board sampling with camera data via genlock pulses sent by the system’s master
camera at each frame recorded. Thus the data are synchronised at every camera frame, minimising
any chance of de-synchronisation. Additional details of the data acquisition and synchronisation
have been added to section 4.1.
What were the resolution and noise/error characteristics of COP position and how did it compare
between walking and running? Force treadmills can be prone to substantial errors in CoP during
running due to larger vibrations of the treadmill at higher speeds. Did the authors conduct any
sensitivity analysis on potential effects of CoP error?
We have not conducted our own assessment of the noise/error characteristics but have maintained
the treadmill in line with the manufacturer’s recommendations. Measurements when the belts are
not running are the same as for equivalent force platforms but, as the editor notes, noise/error may
increase with locomotor speed. Prior studies have confirmed that data from these treadmills are
appropriate for studying the kinetics of both running and walking ([1, 2]). As the Editor suggests,
the noise may be greater for running vs walking but this should not be an issue for our study design,
as we are not comparing walking and running. Furthermore, running and walking speeds during
acceleration were not different from the respective speeds during the constant speed condition, so
noise due to speed variations should not bias our comparisons.
3) Data availability: It is RSOS policy for all data supporting the findings to be made publically
available either as a supplementary file or on a suitable public repository such as datadryad.org. It
is standard practice to make human subjects data anonymous by assigning a subject ID and
removing any personality identifying information. Therefore the authors do not need specific
ethical clearance to publish the supporting data. The data does not need to be in the ‘raw’ form of
trajectories over time, but should provide all of the values included in the statistical analysis, not
just the group-averaged values.

participant (mean of all of that participant’s strides) in each condition.

Reviewer: 1
The authors have satisfactorily addressed my concerns relating to scientific soundness. I am still
concerned about readability of the result section as well as about the lack of substance in the
discussion section regarding implications for assistive devices. Both concerns have not really been
addressed.
As stated in our prior response, we appreciate the reviewer’s viewpoint and have not dismissed it,
but stand by our decision to include all the results presented as a comprehensive presentation of
the data.
Again, we understand that the reviewer feels that the discussion on implications is limited, but we
believe that we have discussed what can reasonably be discussed using the present analysis. Thus,
we do not feel that we can add to this discussion of the present data without becoming overly
speculative.
