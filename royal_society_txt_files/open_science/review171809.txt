Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_1
The manuscript treats important topics in the effects of saline water and zinc fertilizer on the
growth parameter, element concentration and yield of cotton under greenhouse conditions. The
studies are related to three different saline water and two zinc fertilizer concentrations. The paper
brings new information about the differences in the investigated populations on the basis of their
morphology and essential oils content. However, more new references should be included in the
introduction and used for comparisons with their results. The title and the abstract correctly
describe the content of the manuscript. The methods used are modern, suitable and enough to
prove the tasks posed in the work. In my opinion the sections Results and Discussions should be
divided and more comparisons with literature data has to be included. The manuscript is well
documented and illustrated. The figures are of high quality. Some discrepancies are observed in
the text.
The manner of presentation of the information is sufficient to be accepted for publication in the R.
Soc. open sci. journal after a revision is undertaken in accordance with my suggestions below:

Dear Author
Please take some of the following points in consedration
1. Title of the subject manuscript did not provide the true purpose of the study. Title must be
effective, simple and concise. It should indicate accurately the without question in the title
2. Author should present Results and Discussion section separately
3. Results section does not show any important key findings of the study. It includes material
which does not belong to the results section such as interpretation and discussion; it focuses on
4
the Tables/Fig ,ures representing the results, rather than the results themselves.
4. Author should cite at least 7-8 latest previous studies (e.g., from 2008-2018) and then co-relate
your findings with previous studies in favor as well as in contradiction.
5. At least two years field trials need for these type manuscript. Also they recommend to be ask
assistance by a English speaking person to improve their manuscript.

1. A new phrase has been added at the end of the introduction section to clarify the
original contributions of this work
2. Page 1 Line 42: This line lies in the introduction section where there isn’t any
mention of cotton production. Generally, this work used the dry weight of root,
stem, and bolls to reflect the effect of added materials on cotton production. As
