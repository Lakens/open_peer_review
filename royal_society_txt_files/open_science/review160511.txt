Report
Dear Sir
Respect to the paper Manuscript entitled “Analysis of dispersion and absorption characteristics of
shear waves in sinusoidally corrugated elastic medium with void pores” RSOS-160511, which
sent to me to reviewing it for publication in Royal Society Open Science. The paper investigates
the dispersion and absorption equations derived separately in a closed form using separation of
variable’s method. The study shows that there are two different kinds of wave fronts propagating
in the proposed media. One front is depending upon the modulus of rigidity of the elastic matrix
of the medium and satisfies the dispersion equation of shear waves in an elastic layer sandwich
between two dissimilar half-spaces. The second front is depending upon the change in volume
fraction of the pores. The problem is interesting in this field and the results are important, but, the
paper needs the following points are noted:
1- The presentation of the material is very poor. The English needs serious mending by a
professional text editor
2-More discussion is needed of the new features that obtained from the analytical procedure.
3- Presentation of more graphs without any physical interpretations, the effect of parameters are
not clearly discussed.
In view of all the points given above the paper needs to be modified and then only can be
recommended for publication in the Royal Society Open Science

Review of
Analysis of dispersion and absorption characteristics of shear waves in sinusoidally corrugated
elastic medium with void pores
by Deepak Pandit et al.
Manuscript ID: RSOS-160511
This manuscript is not written properly. Moreover, it contains mistakes and muddled parts
which reduce the confidence in the reliability of the whole study and the mathematical
formulation in particular. Therefore it should be revised fundamentally before being considered
for publication. In the following I give a few examples of the points that the authors should
consider when revising this manuscript.
-Strange English style is used in writing some parts of this manuscript.
-Spelling and grammar mistakes like "intially" should be corrected.
-Badly written sentences should be re-written, e.g.
"It is known that the materials of layer under the Earth are not always elastic or isotropic rather it
may be a sandy medium sometime. A layer containing of sandy particles having no moisture or
water vapor may be referred as dry sandy mantle. Some works on the propagation of surface
wave in dry sandy medium are successfully investigated by Kundu et al."
-In the Appendices \Gamma_11, \Gamma_12 and \Gamma_22 are defined twice. If they are
equal, they should not be defined repeatedly, otherwise there will be ambiguity.
-The figures should be revised. The font size should be increased and more intense fonts and
colors should be used.
-In Eq. 2.2. the authors use cosine in all terms although the function is not necessarily even. If so
we do not need all these terms. The b terms should be sine functions for generality. Anyway, all
this notation jungle is unnecessary as the Fourier series can be put in a very clear and simple form
in just one or two lines with very few symbols. Moreover, if "In this problem, we have considered
the corrugated...etc." means that they use a single cosine term then there is no necessity for the
Fourier series as it reduces to a single term with no need to all these complications.
-The references in bibliography are piled randomly.
-Start all sentences with uppercase.
-Apparently, some tensors are assumed symmetric and hence not all their components are stated.
If so, then this should be stated explicitly and justified physically. Many assumptions which are
generally accepted in fluid mechanics, and hence they may not be stated, do not apply
automatically to solid mechanics.
-Many equations and mathematical expressions are complex. The authors should state clearly
what the real and imaginary parts represent.
-Symbols should be explained when they occur or/and put in a Nomenclature section. There is
no justification in putting them in an appendix. Anyway, there is no need for 4 appendices, a
single appendix should be enough to include all these symbols.
- "Funding" may be in conflict with "Acknowledgment" since some authors benefitted from
financial support.
-"The institute has no objection for the approval of research and animal ethics to the authors."
4
What this means?
-"The data used in the paper has been referenced through an appropriate repository which is
cited in the manuscript."
This should be clarified.
-Such a complex problem examined by such a complex mathematical machinery requires a lot of
validations, checks, justifications, comparisons, etc. At least some analytical and theoretical
analysis of the results should be presented. What is presented in section 8, for instance, is not
sufficient.
-The sectioning of the study is not ideal. Several sections can be merged together.

Dear Sir,
We have now received two reviews on your manuscript "Analysis of dispersion and absorption
characteristics of shear waves in sinusoidally corrugated elastic medium with void pores” RSOS-
160511.
Whilst both reviewers note that the problem is both interesting in the field and the results
important the manuscript requires major revision before being able to be considered for
publications.
First, considerable work needs to be done to improve the presentation of the material. This
includes details of the English, mathematics and figures as well as the overall structure of the
manuscript. Detailed comments and examples are contained in the reviews.
The second point to be addressed is the need for more discussion of the new features in section 8.

paper investigates the dispersion and absorption equations derived separately in a closed form
ng separation of variable’s method. The study shows that there are two different kinds of wave
nts propagating in the proposed media. One front is depending upon the modulus of rigidity of
elastic matrix of the medium and satisfies the dispersion equation of shear waves in an elastic
er sandwich between two dissimilar half-spaces. The second front is depending upon the change
volume fraction of the pores. The problem is interesting in this field and the results are
ortant, but, the paper needs the following points are noted:
1. The presentation of the material is very poor. The English needs serious mending by a
professional text editor.
<U+F0D8> We have tried our best to prepare the proper presentation of material in the revised
manuscript.
2. More discussion is needed of the new features that obtained from the analytical procedure.
<U+F0D8> We have clearly explained the new features pointwise in the conclusion section which is
obtained from the analytical procedure.
3. Presentation of more graphs without any physical interpretations, the effect of parameters
are not clearly discussed.
<U+F0D8> The physical interpretations of each graph have been mentioned in the numerical
discussion section.
iewer 2# Comment: Review
1. This manuscript is not written properly. Moreover, it contains mistakes and muddled parts
which reduce the confidence in the reliability of the whole study and the mathematical
formulation in particular. Therefore it should be revised fundamentally before being
considered for publication. In the following I give a few examples of the points that the
authors should consider when revising this manuscript.
-Strange English style is used in writing some parts of this manuscript.
-Spelling and grammar mistakes like "intially" should be corrected.
-Badly written sentences should be re-written, e.g. "It is known that the materials of layer
under the Earth are not always elastic or isotropic rather it may be a sandy medium
sometime. A layer containing of sandy particles having no moisture or water vapor may be
referred as dry sandy mantle. Some works on the propagation of surface wave in dry sandy
medium are successfully investigated by Kundu et al."
<U+F0D8> The authors have revised the manuscript in a proper way. Spelling and grammatical
mistakes have been corrected.
2. In the Appendices \Gamma_11, \Gamma_12 and \Gamma_22 are defined twice. If they
are equal, they should not be defined repeatedly, otherwise there will be ambiguity.
<U+F0D8> \Gamma_11, \Gamma_12 and \Gamma_22 were defined twice by mistake. They are not
equal. It has been corrected in the revised manuscript.
3. The figures should be revised. The font size should be increased and more intense fonts
and colors should be used.
<U+F0D8> All figures have been revised.
4. In Eq. 2.2., the authors use cosine in all terms although the function is not necessarily even.
If so we do not need all these terms. The b terms should be sine functions for generality.
Anyway, all this notation jungle is unnecessary as the Fourier series can be put in a very
clear and simple form in just one or two lines with very few symbols. Moreover, if "In this
problem, we have considered the corrugated...etc." means that they use a single cosine term
then there is no necessity for the Fourier series as it reduces to a single term with no need
to all these complications.
<U+F0D8> In Eq. 2.2, we have corrected the b terms of the Fourier series expansion as sine function.
In this article, the Fourier series expansion is considered up to first order, hence the
boundary surfaces may be expressed as only one cosine term i.e., f_i(x)=a_i cos(bx). It will
convenient to describe the undulated nature on the propagation and attenuation of shear
waves.
5. The references in bibliography are piled randomly.
<U+F0D8> References have been arranged in revised manuscript.
6. Start all sentences with uppercase.
<U+F0D8> We have corrected the sentences.
7. Apparently, some tensors are assumed symmetric and hence not all their components are
stated. If so, then this should be stated explicitly and justified physically. Many
assumptions which are generally accepted in fluid mechanics, and hence they may not be
stated, do not apply automatically to solid mechanics.
<U+F0D8> According to elasticity theory, the strain-tensor is considered as symmetric (please see
[23]). In Eq. (2.6) <U+F073> ij <U+F03D> <U+F06C><U+F044><U+F064> ij <U+F02B> 2<U+F06D>0eij , the Kronecker delta function ( <U+F064> ij ) and strain
1 <U+F0B6>u <U+F0B6>u j
tensor eij <U+F03D> ( i <U+F02B> ), both are symmetric. Hence, the stress tensor <U+F073> ij is
2 <U+F0B6>x j <U+F0B6>xi
symmetric.
8. Many equations and mathematical expressions are complex. The authors should state
clearly what the real and imaginary parts represent.
<U+F0D8> In this article, the frequency equations have been discussed into real and imaginary parts
separately. The real part represents the dispersion relation which relates the wavenumber
of a wave of its frequency. This relation provides the dispersion curves i.e., phase velocity
with respect to wave number. And, the imaginary part referred as absorption relation. This
relation provides the damping of the wave.
9. Symbols should be explained when they occur or/and put in a Nomenclature section. There
is no justification in putting them in an appendix. Anyway, there is no need for 4
appendices, a single appendix should be enough to include all these symbols.
<U+F0D8> We have merged all appendices in a single appendix.
10. "Funding" may be in conflict with "Acknowledgment" since some authors benefitted from
financial support.
<U+F0D8> We have written separately both the sections as
“Acknowledgments”
The authors are grateful to the Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines),
Dhanbad, India, for providing necessary facilities for research work.
“Funding”
This research meets with no specific grant from any funding agency.
11. "The institute has no objection for the approval of research and animal ethics to the
authors." What this means?
<U+F0D8> This section is not applicable to this article. We have omitted this section.
12. "The data used in the paper has been referenced through an appropriate repository which
is cited in the manuscript." This should be clarified.
<U+F0D8> The datasets used in this work are described in the manuscript which is also cited as
reference no. [24] and [25].
13. Such a complex problem examined by such a complex mathematical machinery requires a
lot of validations, checks, justifications, comparisons, etc. At least some analytical and
theoretical analysis of the results should be presented. What is presented in section 8, for
instance, is not sufficient.
<U+F0D8> All the relations are validated with the classical case introduced by previous authors such
