This study describes circRNAs in the testis of Qinchuan cattle. Generally, this is a suitable paper
for publication in this journal, although it needs some improvements.
1, English is not at the acceptable level, requires a significant improvement.
2, There is currently no information about statistical analyses in this manuscript.
3, Please compare the circRNAs in cattle testis with those in human testis (ref 26), like conserved
circRNAs, etc. This requires an additional figure.

This MS on circular RNAs of Qinchuan cattle testis by Gao and colleagues is a relatively
straightforward study but nevertheless seems likely to be of some value to those working in this
area and to be comparable to other recent work by others, but providing some additional data.
Having said that the MS is still quite unpolished and it would absolutely require extensive
revision for the language and content, preferably by passing it by a native English speaker.
I have some suggestions to improve your manuscript, I will specify lines as follow:
For the Figures, Please change the image or improve the quality, it is not clear in MS.
In abstract section, Line 15, the authors can explain why the authors only use one sample (1 week
3
old and 4 years old testis) in this study. How many repeats of the samples?
Line 16-20, the results that described in this MS were too simple and redundancy. The authors
should focus on describe of function enrichment analysis.
In introduction section, I will not make detailed comments on this section becasue there are too
many issues with the description.
In materials and methods section,
Line 82-83, “The tissues were immersed in dry ice for transportation after dissection and were
immediately preserved in liquid nitrogen until use.” Why not the authors directly preserved the
testis tissues in liquid nitrogen. It is more convenient for transportation and save.
Line 86. “and then was quantified spectrophotometrically” -> and then was quantified by
spectrophotometrically.
Line 91 to -> for
Line 92 into short fragments -> delete
Line 100 rejecting -> exclude
Line 102, aligned ribosome RNA-> aligned to ribosome RNA
Line 103 then-> delete
Line 104, Bos_taurus_UMD_3.1.1 Bos_taurus should italic such as Bos_taurus
“respectively” should delete, this word is not need in here.
Line 105, “unmapped reads were extracted and aligned to the reference genome to find unique
anchor positions” too many inaccurate use of the prep.
Sorry, I stopped correcting it. Still too many things to correct. Please, correct it well by yourself as
I did above. Even after all your correction, if I see again a similar mistake, it won't be accepted.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Andrew Angel):
We have received the reviews of your manuscript and the reviewers have raised points that
require significant consideration and revision of the manuscript before it is suitable for
publication. However, with adequate response and revision, the manuscript should be acceptable
for publication in Royal Society Open Science. Both reviewers highlighted that there was
insufficient discussion of the statistical methods used in the analysis; the language was not to a
sufficient level for publication; and it was not clear in the manuscript how to access any
supporting data, code and materials - it is a condition of publication that these are made
available. The specific comments from each reviewer should also be addressed.

[Comment of Reviewer #1:]
This study describes circRNAs in the testis of Qinchuan cattle. Generally, this is a
suitable paper for publication in this journal, although it needs some improvements.
1. English is not at the acceptable level, requires a significant improvement.
Reply: Thank you for your suggestion. We have sent the paper to the professional language
polishing agency (Enpaper) to improve English level. We have made double checks carefully
and revised some typos and grammar errors in a different color (red) in the revised manuscript.
2. There is currently no information about statistical analyses in this manuscript.
Reply: We are grateful for the suggestion. We have added the detail information of statistical
analysis. This part has been added in the manuscript:
“2.8 Statistical Analysis
Data are shown as mean ± SEM with each measurement repeated thrice. Results were
assessed for statistical significance using Student's t test for normally distributed data or
Mann-Whitney U-test for non-normally distributed data from GraphPad Prism version 6
software (GraphPad Software, La Joya, CA, USA). P values of < 0.05 were considered
significant. (*) P < 0.05; (**) P < 0.01.”
3. Please compare the circRNAs in cattle testis with those in human testis (ref 26), like
conserved circRNAs, etc. This requires an additional figure.
Reply: We are grateful for the suggestion. In the ref 26, the authors did not provide data of
detected circRNAs in human testis. In order to get the data, we have attempted to contact the
authors, however, they were not willing to offer the data of detected circRNAs. We also
consider such comparison is significant as the reviewer, unfortunately, we regret that we
cannot compare the circRNAs in cattle testis with those in human testis.
4. EIcirRNA should be EIciRNA.
Reply: Sorry for the typo. We have checked manuscript and it has been revised as
“EIciRNA”( line 53).
5. It is better to also include some gel images of RT-PCR products for the verifications of
circRNAs in Fig. 4
Reply: Thanks for your precious advice, we have verified the circRNAs by
gel electrophoresis, and added it into Figure 4a. The changes in Figure 4 are listed as follows:
Comment of Reviewer #2:]
Having said that the MS is still quite unpolished and it would absolutely require
extensive revision for the language and content, preferably by passing it by a native
English speaker. I have some suggestions to improve your manuscript, I will specify
ines as follow:
1. For the Figures, Please change the image or improve the quality, it is not clear in MS.
Reply: Thank you for your precious advice, we have improved the quality of all figures.
The revised images are listed as follows (Figure 1 to 4):
2. In abstract section, Line 15, the authors can explain why the authors only use one
sample (1 week old and 4 years old testis) in this study. How many repeats of the
samples?
Reply: Thank you for your comment. In this work, we only have used one testis of 1
week old cattle and one testis of 4 years old cattle. The animal sample collection is
difficult and we could not find more neonatal samples at present, so we did not repeat the
experiment by using other samples. In the future, we will do some deep researches by
collecting more animal samples if possible. Moreover, after opening up of the data, other
researchers may catch up and carry out some significant researches.
3. Line 16-20, the results that described in this MS were too simple and redundancy.
The authors should focus on describe of function enrichment analysis.
Reply: Thanks for your valuable advice. The revised abstract is listed as follow:
“Abstract: Circular RNA (circRNA) is a new class of noncoding RNA that has recently
attracted researchers’ interests. Studies have demonstrated that circRNA can function as
microRNA (miRNA) sponges or competing endogenous RNAs. Although circRNA has
been explored in some species and tissues, the genetic basic of testis development and
spermatogenesis in cattle remains unknown. We performed ribo-depleted total RNA-Seq
to detect circRNA expression profiles of neonatal (1 week old) and adult (4 years old)
Qinchuan cattle testes. We obtained 91112596 and 80485868 clean reads and detected
21753 circRNAs. A total of 4248 circRNAs were significantly differentially expressed
between neonatal and adult cattle testes. Among these circRNAs, 2225 were upregulated,
and 2023 were downregulated in adult cattle testis. Genomic feature, length distribution,
and other characteristics of the circRNAs in cattle testis were studied. Moreover, Gene
Ontology and KEGG pathway analyses were performed for source genes of circRNAs.
These source genes were mainly involved in tight junction, adherens junction, TGFß
signaling pathway, and reproduction, such as PIWIL1, DPY19L2, SLC26A8, IFT81,
SMC1B, IQCG, and TTLL5. CircRNA expression patterns were validated by RT-qPCR.
Our discoveries provide a solid foundation for the identification and characterization of
key circRNAs involved in testis development or spermatogenesis.”
4. In introduction section, I will not make detailed comments on this section becasue
there are too many issues with the description.
Reply: Thanks for the valuable comment. We have sent the paper to the professional
language editing agency (Enpaper) to improve English level. We also strictly and
carefully modified the introduction section as much as possible to avoid mistakes and
make it more precise. All the changes were highlighted in red.
5. Line 82-83, “The tissues were immersed in dry ice for transportation after dissection
and were immediately preserved in liquid nitrogen until use.” Why not the authors
directly preserved the testis tissues in liquid nitrogen. It is more convenient for
transportation and save.
Reply: Thanks for the Reviewer’s comment. The tissues were immersed in dry ice to
ensure that the animal tissues transportation comply with the requirements for China’s
express delivery policy. And the meaning of this sentence is not clearly stated, therefore,
the sentence has been revised as follows:
“The testis samples were immediately preserved in liquid nitrogen until use, and sent to
Gene Denovo Co. (Guangzhou, China) for sequencing in dry ice.”
. Line 86. “and then was quantified spectrophotometrically” -> and then was
quantified by spectrophotometrically.
Reply: Thank you for your comments. We rewrite this sentence in the revised manuscript.
In the revised manuscript, Page 5, Line 85, we replaced “and then was quantified
spectrophotometrically (NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE)” with “Then, spectrophotometrical
quantification was performed by NanoDrop (Wilmington, DE).”
. Line 91 to -> for
Reply: Thank you for your suggestion. The correction has been made (Page 5, Line 90).
. Line 92 into short fragments -> delete
Reply: We are grateful for the suggestion. We have modified the sentence according to
the comment (Page 5, Line 91).
. Line 100 rejecting -> exclude
Reply: Thank you for your comments. We have changed it according to the suggestion
(Page 5, Line 99).
0. Line 102, aligned ribosome RNA-> aligned to ribosome RNA
Reply: Thank you for your suggestion. We have changed it according to the suggestion
(Page 5, Line 101).
11. Line 103 then-> delete
Reply: Thank you for your comments. We have modified it according to the comment
(Page 5, Line 102).
12. Line 104, Bos_taurus_UMD_3.1.1 Bos_taurus should italic such as Bos_taurus
“respectively” should delete, this word is not need in here.
Reply: Sorry for the typo. We corrected the spelling (please see page 5, line 103), and
deleted the word “respectively”.
13. Line 105, “unmapped reads were extracted and aligned to the reference genome to
find unique anchor positions” too many inaccurate use of the prep.
Reply: Thank you for your suggestion. This sentence was rephrased according to the
comment (Page 5, Line 104). The text has been revised as suggest:
“Twenty mers from both ends of the unmapped reads were extracted and aligned
according to the reference genome to find unique anchor positions within the splice site.”
