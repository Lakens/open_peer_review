The paper presents a review of the chronology and lithic technology associated with the Antares I
and II (Orinoco River) phases. I consider the conclusions relevant because there are conclusions
that review previous explanations on the Orinoco River. The editing and the presentation of the
data are very clear and completely correct.
The impact of the conclusions is strong and I think that future work will be very important to
corroborate or refute the conclusions of the article.
I am not an expert in dating methods, but have they analyzed the possibility of alterations due to
concretions of red iron oxide, which could alter the Carbon_14 isotopes?, given the enormous
differences between the results achieved and previous works. It is true that lithic technology is
not a chronological marker due to the long duration of this, but the rest of the evidence
corresponds with the regional soils with older dates than the new dates.
I recommend including numbers and percentages in all cases.
The description of lithic technology is well presented. As in other Neotropical regions the lithic
remains with few changes over millennia, with a predominance of a unifacial technology. It is
true that bifaciality in different regions of northern South America lives on for a long time.
The article proposes the existence of bifacial tools from thinning flakes; to support this hypothesis
would be important to expand the description of the cores, given the relationship between
3
bifaciality and type of core. Some bifacial artifacts have been reported in the region, although it is
a technology not very abundant in the area.
Regarding the assertion that it is a specialized site, I consider that the argumentation of this
affirmation should be expanded. For example, the type of artifact could help to define some type
of activity in relation to the characteristics and settlement pattern of the area. For instance, soils
chemical analysis could at least help to determine the intensity of site use.

Subject Editor comments to Author:
According to our guidelines, I regret that this not appropriate for Royal Society Open Science
biology because there is really no biology in it; it's an archaeological paper. This should have been
picked up when the paper was first submitted, and I apologize for the oversight.
The reviews, unfortunately, will not be of much use to the authors, but I am encouraged that the
referees had few suggestions. I hope you will be able to turn this around for a more suitable
journal, and best of luck.
Associate Editor Comments to Author (Professor Stephen Hesselbo):

Comments to the Author:
Please review the recommendations made by Reviewer 2. In particular the reviewer recommends
minor elaboration on a couple of points, specifically the possibility of alteration of the C-14 ages
by post-depositional processes, and expanded description of the cores.

We are in the process of producing a project monograph, which will include the Culebra site, in both
English and Spanish. In the case of the latter version, it will be released through the IVIC Press
(Caracas). The monograph will therefore be available to our partners and collaborators in Venezuela
for exactly the purposes that Reviewer 1 envisions.

The paper presents a review of the chronology and lithic technology associated with the Antares I

review previous explanations on the Orinoco River. The editing and the presentation of the data are
very clear and completely correct. The impact of the conclusions is strong and I think that future
work will be very important to corroborate or refute the conclusions of the article.
I am not an expert in dating methods, but have they analyzed the possibility of alterations due to
concretions of red iron oxide, which could alter the Carbon_14 isotopes?, given the enormous
differences between the results achieved and previous works. It is true that lithic technology is not a
chronological marker due to the long duration of this, but the rest of the evidence corresponds with
the regional soils with older dates than the new dates.
Regarding the ochre deposits (based on the red colour, likely Fe2O3) encountered at the base of the
excavations and their potential influence over the dating: AMS dating of carbon functions on
measuring the ratio of 13C to 14C in a given archaeological or sedimentary sample. Humin is a class of
organic compounds in soil that do not, to the very best of our knowledge, interact with the ferric
oxides in ochre in a way that would affect this ratio of carbon. Simply put, ochre does not have
carbon to donate to soil organic matter and is therefore incapable of changing SOM (and the
resulting AMS date) in this specific way. Chemically, therefore, this is unlikely to be a problem with
our dating.
Nonetheless, we accept that the presence of ochre concretions could possibly be evidence of post-
depositional processes that have affected the integrity of the archaeological deposit. We have
responded to this by noting in the text that we were cautious when sampling soil to avoid areas
where concretions were abundant. The text already notes the high likelihood that this is a relatively
sealed deposit, based on artefact orientations and the lack of any stratigraphic discontinuities.
Furthermore, the dates are stratigraphically aligned and do not overlap even at 2-sigma calibration,
indicating that our interpretation is likely to be correct for the two areas we sampled.
Regarding the other preceramic sites in the region highlighted in our Figure 1, in these sites the
investigators (e.g. Barse, Scaramelli and Scaramelli) were fortunate to encounter macroscopic
charcoal in association with the cultural deposits. We do not dispute these dates on any grounds.
However, we are careful to argue against the use of extrapolating dates from these sites to
unrelated soil profiles in undated sites such as Culebra. To the best of our knowledge and the reports
of these authors, none have directly dated sediments as we have here.
We do not doubt the antiquity or accuracy of the dates on archaeological material from these sites,
which we state outright. Our goal (as stated in the aims) was to test the association between early
Holocene adaptations and, in this case, brownish-yellow oxisols composed of sandy silt at
approximately ~1 m below the modern surface of the Middle Orinoco. We believe we have shown
that these soils are not necessarily associated with the early Holocene and hence the peopling of the
region. Consequently, we have succeeded in removing a naïve and potentially very deleterious
assumption from the present models of human expansion into the Orinoco. We have established the
baseline for later Holocene stone technology, which we hope future scholars take advantage of to
study these earlier sites in the detail they deserve.
I recommend including numbers and percentages in all cases.
Due to space constraints, we were unable to provide full tabulations of the assemblages from
Culebra in the manuscript itself. However, the results of the lithic analysis in its entirety are included
in the supplementary information for exactly this purpose, with code to reproduce Figure 4. Where
percentages and numbers are germane to the presentation of our argument, we have presented
them in the text.
The description of lithic technology is well presented. As in other Neotropical regions the lithic
remains with few changes over millennia, with a predominance of a unifacial technology. It is true
that bifaciality in different regions of northern South America lives on for a long time. The article
proposes the existence of bifacial tools from thinning flakes; to support this hypothesis would be
important to expand the description of the cores, given the relationship between bifaciality and type
of core. Some bifacial artifacts have been reported in the region, although it is a technology not very
abundant in the area.
We apologise for the lack of clarity regarding the source of potential bifacial thinning flakes in the
assemblage. It was not our aim to suggest cores of raw material as the source of these artefacts, but
rather, that the artefacts (projectile points) that they originated from have been removed from the
site for use elsewhere. The morphology of the cores that we documented make them extremely
unlikely candidates for the origin of this type of flake; they do not have the curve that the profile of a
biface has which produces the distinctive shape of a bifacial thinning flake. The text has been
updated to make this distinction as clear as possible.
Regarding the assertion that it is a specialized site, I consider that the argumentation of this
affirmation should be expanded. For example, the type of artifact could help to define some type of
activity in relation to the characteristics and settlement pattern of the area. For instance, soils
chemical analysis could at least help to determine the intensity of site use.
We welcome this reviewers encouragement to be more assertive our interpretation of the activity
at the Culebra site. In our experience, reviewers tend to be averse to functional interpretations of
stone tool assemblages, and we phrased our interpretation with deliberate caution as a result.
In light of the location of the site adjacent to two major rivers, and the types of technological
strategies identified in the assemblage, we interpret the Culebra site as a fishing station. The text has
been updated to reflect this.
Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
I suggest to use another fond in figure 5. Instead of black, you can use a fond that allows to
appreciatte the lithic artifacts which are hard to understand in the current figure.
As is standard practice in stone tool analysis, we photographed the artefacts on a black velvet
background. Due to the transparency of some of the raw materials, the black velvet background
shows through the artefact. In our opinion, changing the background outside the lithics to a different
colour would cause an effect of incongruity in the image between the black artefacts and the
background of a different colour, and diminish the clarity of the image.
Unfortunately, these artefacts are currently located in storage at the IVIC in Caracas, Venezuela and,
effectively, unavailable for further study as the project fieldwork budget has been expended. We
regret that we cannot re-shoot the artefacts with a non-standard background colour. We have used
widely accepted conventions for presenting the lithics (for example, consistent orientations for each
class, identical lighting angles, standard notation for breakage and use-wear patterns, common
metric scale). We have added this information to the text in the hope that it will help clarify the
nature of the artefacts in Figure 5. We have also added full-scale, high-resolution photos of each
artefact in Figure 5 to the supplementary data. We consider the inclusion of these photos to be at
the discretion of the editor.
