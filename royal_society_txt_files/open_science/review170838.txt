This is an exciting study that begins to investigate the functional significance of micro-reflections
and/or micro-flourescence of small regions of the iris of a small, cryptic marine fish (the triplefin,
Tripterygion delaisi). The authors have identified that this fish has two different colored
reflections/fluorescence from small regions on their irises. They either reflect/fluoresce red
around their iris, or they sometime reflect blue from a reflectance patch on the iris just below the
center of their eye. The authors are building on previous body of research in their lab that
demonstrates that these ‘ocular sparks’ (they are introducing a new term) are produced by a
product of downwelling irradiance passing through the protruding fish lens and concentrating
on the iris rim where it is reflected (or fluoresced in the case of the red spark) outward and is
hypothesized to assist in ‘seeing’ and capturing microfauna. The authors propose that this type
of micro-flashlighting is a form of “active phololocation” which is analogous to how some
animals (bats) use sound waves to locate their prey (echolocation).
To test this hypothesis, the authors conducted a well-constructed experiment that compared the
relative use of blue or red ocular sparks dependent on (a) background color, (b) presence or
absence of prey (copepods) and (c) satiety level of fish. Their study lends support that the fish
actively use ocular sparks in a putatively adaptive fashion as they disproportionately display the
ocular spark color that contrasts more with the background (showing more blue ocular sparks
against a red background and vice versa) and that ocular sparking is increased during conditions
with prey present. By using the non-dominant color from the background, these sparks might
provide contrasting light that will illuminate their small prey at close distances (1-3cm) and
amplify the fish’s detection capabilities.
Overall, the manuscript is very well written and the authors do a thorough job describing the
limitations and possible interpretations of their dataset in the Discussion section. If the authors
are able to clarify one critical methodological issue (see below), and animal use formality, this
study will make a significant and exciting contribution to the field, and the first evidence of active
photolocation in an animal system.
Major clarification needed:
(1) The authors do not specify how their fish were scored for either a “blue’ or a “red” ocular
spark in their study. Was the assignment qualitative (visually scored) or quantitatively (using
RGB values from their photographs)? Explicitly stating their criteria for assigning the presence of
a blue or red ocular spark in their study is critical. Given that the authors are using series of
photographs to assess spark presence, I strongly suggest that they develop a quantitative
criterion for spark presence assignment. This would significantly strengthen the confidence in
their findings.
(2) The other issue involves reporting an ethics protocol. The authors state that since no animals
were injured in the process of their experiment, no ethics permit was required. Yet, in many other
countries (e.g. UK and US), similar experiments would require formal protocol approval. I am
not familiar with the German Animal Care Legislation, and such practices may be customary in
Germany. However, the authors state that they discussed these experimental procedures using
animals housed in aquaria for 6 months with their institutional animal welfare officer. Given the
international readership of Royal Society Open Science, I think it would be beneficial if the
authors could include the name of their institutional animal welfare officer in the manuscript to
provide evidence of institutional oversight on these experiments.

The authors describe a new optical phenomenon in fish they term “ocular sparks” which
describes a small, reflective patch of material beneath the pupil whose reflectance can be
controlled by the animal. The only data presented to describe this new phenomenon are from two
behavioural experiments. Figure 1 is a qualitative presentation of nice pictures of fish eyes with
features that may be used for photolocation, but these are not quantitative data. The behavioural
data clearly demonstrate that the animals change the “ocular spark” occurrence when the
viewing different backgrounds. Clearly the animals responded to something within the
experimental design, however the authors are much too far reaching in their interpretation of
these results. Overall, these data seem preliminary for presenting a new and interesting concept.
At a minimum, this story should include a qualitative description of “ocular sparks” (i.e.
reflectance spectra, absolute radiance spectra from the spark, etc.). Further, I would be interested
to see the optical modelling (such as ray tracing) that supports illumination of the spark patch by
the protruding spherical lens (as the authors suggest without evidence) as well as some
calculations to support that the light to reflected from such a tiny patch, is sufficient to then
reflect off of prey and be absorbed by the fish’s retina. As it is, the authors attempt to push
forward a hypothesis (shallow water photolocation by reef fishes) with very little empirical
foundation.
4
I would definitely consider this manuscript for publication with an overhaul in the framing of the
story and the conclusions drawn from the data. With just a few extra analyses, I feel there is a
very nice story relating the measured radiances and the observed behaviour.
Further comments as the specifically relate to the text are as follows:
Background
P3L36-39: “Eyeshine…but can also play a role in camouflage [15]” : While this is a good summary
of the diversity of function of reflective structures in animal eyes, the authors misinterpret the
literature slightly. The eyeshine described in Feller & Cronin for camouflage is NOT produced
from a tapetum lucidum but by a currently unpublished reflecting structure located at the distal
boundary of the photoreceptors where they meet the the light-focusing, dioptric layer. It is an
unfortunate overlap in the terminology that both the reflectance from a true, sensitivity-
enhancing tapetum and a reflective camouflage found in an eye should both be called “eyeshine”.
In truth these are completely divergent structures and should have different names. Perhaps you
should just decribe the different functions of reflective structures in animal eyes? That would be
more accurate and would create a nice category to introduce ocular sparks.
P3L48: “many fishes have conspicuously bright eyes” – conspicuous to humans yes, but how do
these eyes appear to conspecifics? Predators? Heterospecifics in complex ecological roles (such as
cleaner wrass and cleaner shrimp). Just because something looks interesting to a human does not
mean it has a function in an animal (i.e. the fantastic reflecting structures in a sea mouse, who
spends its life buried in mud; or the beautiful colourations of cleaner shrimp, which they
themselves cannot see).
P4L23: The authors state that ocular sparks are “generated by the protruding spherical lens” but
offer no data or literature to support this claim. Couldn’t light reflected or scattered from the
environment around and below the animal also contribute to the observed flicker of the eye patch
by the human observer?
P5L12: The authors base their entire experimental design on the human qualitative observation
that ocular sparks in T. delaisi are blue and red without any consideration of the reflectance
spectra of the two sparks or the visual sensitivity of the animals.
Methods
P7.L33: Copepod Prey section: why is this section here? The detailed description of the animal,
their eye structure and the details of their culture seem irrelevant to the manuscript. Brief
mention of the copepod species and that they were reared in the laboratory within the fish care
section is sufficient.
P8L53: Experimental setup: it would be nice to have a figure that illustrates the experimental
setup, chambers, and photographs of what the copepods look like on their felt backgrounds. Why
weren’t mock copepods or inedible particles (p.14L29) used as a control to verify they were
indeed motivated by visual predation?
P9L41: Since the fish in the two experiments were not naive, perhaps the unexpected finding in
the satiated fish was due to learning? Why were the fish fed mysids to be satiated and copepods?
These factors could have influenced the behavioural outcome.
Results: these are alarmingly brief. Why is so much data buried in the supplemental materials?
5
Discussion:
The authors go into too much length trying to prop up the hypothesis that ocular sparks are used
for active photolocation. While it would be really nice to see data that support this idea, these
data are not here. At this point, intraspecific communication seems just as likely a candidate for
the varied ocular sparks as active photolocation.
Supplemental Materials:
ESM1: What is the context of this figure? Or the references?
ESM2: why are these figures buried in the SM? Were the radiances measured in air or in water?
Why are your radiance measurements not included in the methods? These data would be perfect
for modelling if there is enough light to detect an object at different viewing distances. See “the
optics of light” by Sonke Johnsen for specific maths.
ESM3: couldn’t the “red spark” just be a “not blue” spark? Perhaps, if they are using the sparks
for photolocation it is just the blue spark and the red is just the light being focused off the
properly reflective patch. The fluorescence is likely just an artefact of the structure of the
pigments in the iris since many ocular pigments are inherently fluorescent without any
consequence to the visual system.
ESM4: Again, why is there so much attention to the copepod eyeshine? If it is part of the story, it
should be framed as such in your intro and discussion.

This manuscript has now been seen by two expert referees, who both find it of interest and
suggested that the work should ultimately be published pending "major revision". This is also my
opinion. Both reivewers point out a number of useful comments, which the authors should
incorporate in a revised version. In addition, they request some further clarifications, e.g. on the
scoring as well as on the experimental set-up, which I am sure the authors will be able to clarify.
Importantly, the authors will need to include a proper ethics statement/approval.

I support the recommendation of the AE. The reviewers clearly like the article but have some
concerns that need addressing, and an R/R decision allows authors more time than a "revise"
decision; in both cases a resubmission will be sent to the original reviewers. The ethics question is
important to address, and if relevant our editorial office will provide you with any RS guidelines
(https://royalsociety.org/journals/ethics-policies/research-ethics/). Thanks for your

Summary: The authors have observed an association between red fluorescent eyes and a
preference for small prey and therefore conclude that these animals must be using active
photolocation. The authors present a behavioral mechanism, the ocular spark, as the means by
which photolocation is achieved in T. delaisi. The frequency with which ocular sparks occur is
compared in a behavioral experiment using live prey presented against different colour
backgrounds. The satiation state of the animals did not affect the frequency of blue vs. red sparks,
though the background colour did.
Comments: The philosophical format of this manuscript is inappropriate given the data
presented. As written in the introduction, the authors present an idea (active photolocation by
red fluorescent irides) they would like to confirm. This is not how an experimental hypothesis
should be framed as it suggests a bias of the researcher. Hypotheses are tested, accepted and/or
rejected, not confirmed. The word confirmed is used repeatedly in this context.
The experiments performed and the data themselves are worth publishing, but not in the current
framing. The story they tell is about ocular sparks, both as a newly described feature of fish
behaviour and as having a possible role in prey detection. It is not a story about red fluorescence
being used for active photolocation. Yes, red fluorescence is involved in making a red spark, but
the behavioral 2x2 experiments do not demonstrate that blue sparks are the "off state" of an
ocular spark (as noted in the abstract). Looking at how bright this iridiphore patch is, I would
think the blue ocular spark would be a better candidate for photolocation than the much dimmer
red one.
Figures 3 and 4 clearly demonstrate that red sparks occur more frequently when visual tasks are
being performed with a blue background, and blue sparks occur more frequently when vision
involves a red background. This finding is interesting! Particularly since the satiation of the fish
does not produce an effect on these results. In its present state, the authors seem to want to
confirm their bias that red fluorescence is used for photolocation during prey capture, despite the
fact that the data don't support this. I would love to see experimental evidence that red
fluorescent eyes are used for photolocation, I just don’t see it in these sets of experiments.
Figure 1 is a figure of nice photographs, but should be in the supplemental materials. The data in
ESM 3 and 4 should be part of the main figures. Perhaps move figure 2 (photos of T. delaisi
sparks) to figure 1, then make EMS 3 & 4 into one, 2-part figure for figure 2.
11
Specific framing of the introduction: First paragraph is fine as is, but then the authors introduce
bioluminsescent deep sea fish as the only known examples of active photolocation, then describe
different types of eyeshine, then mention that reflective eyeshine is only visible to observers that
radiate light from a source close to their own eye as the bioluminescent fish do. This is very
confusing since the ocular sparks, not yet introduced, are the first reflective, eyeshine light
structures proposed to reflect light that the animal can see. After the first paragraph the rest of the
introduction would be clearer and make a solid case for the study if it was framed like this:
- introduce active photolocation by chemoluminscent fish in the deep sea. They have “search
lights” located close to their eye.
- Many fish have reflective structures associated with their eyes that are known to increase
sensitivity in low light conditions (references) as well as provide camouflage (references).
- Then introduce ocular sparks as a sort of hybrid of the two points you just introduced: these are
reflective structures found in close association with the eye and may be a reflective version of
what we see in the red bioluminescent deep sea fishes. This is a novel and interesting thing.
- Then define ocular sparks and state your hypothesis that these interesting features may be
providing an active photolocation role in foraging. Then talk about how you’re going to test this.
- End of introduction
Everything from pg3L49-p4L17 should be in the discussion.
Everything from Intro p4L42-p5L3 should be in the results.
The information about Tigriopus californicus should be in the methods.
Methods:
It is unclear why the authors chose to go into such detail about the copepod prey (section 2.3),
their eye structure, and their aquaculture. Such information about the copepod eye and its
eyeshine would only be useful if the authors were including optical modelling in the study,
which they specifically state they are not including at the moment (in Discussion). Remove this
section, make no more than 2-3 sentences comment on who the prey were, where you got them
from and how you delivered them to the experimental fish.
Results:
should include the quantified data regarding ocular sparks: spectral reflectance, occurance in
nature, etc.
Discussion:
The authors do a decent job of proposing alternate hypotheses for the function of ocular sparks,
but continue to conclude with strong certainty that their data provides evidence for active
photolocation. I do not come to the same conclusion (last paragraph), though I would agree that
something interesting is going on with T. delaisi ocular spark behavior given the experimental
paradigm that requires following up with different experiments.

The authors discovered a new phenomenon, an „ocular spark“ at the ventral part of the iris,
which is found in many different fish species. The idea is that the downwelling light is focussed
as a spot on the lower iris and is redirected, so that a fish can use this light to detect a prey or a
predator.
The authors tested the hypothesis whether the triplefin Tripterygion delaisi used the ocular
sparks which can be shifted to red and blue spots by eye movemnts as a light source when prey is
absent or present in front of a red or blue background. Additionally, they tested whether the
satiation state of the test fish matters in using these sparks.
The experiments are well designed. During experiments they took pictures of each test fish every
2 s with a maximum of 100 pictures per fish. They counted the number of pictures showing the
fish with a red or blue ocular spark in different test situations.
The sample size in Experiment 1 was n = 17. In Fig. 3 however, it seems that there are 18 data (red
ocular spark and under blue background). Please check whether this is the case.
In Experiment 2 only one of 21 test fish was excluded from the analysis. In the analysis, however,
the sample size is N = 19. Was another fish excluded? Please check whether the number of
triangles is correct in Figure 4.
Because the authors counted the number of pictures, it is not correct to state that „Blue sparks
were shown significantly longer against a red background“. Correct is that you got a higher
number of pictures (or a higher proportion of picture) shown the fish with red or blue sparks.
Please change that in the result section and in the figure legends to Fig. 3 and 4. Please use same
range of y-axis in Fig. 3 and 4.
The average number of pictures with a red or blue ocular spark is around 30 or max 40 % (40 of
100 pictures). Why is the proportion relatively low? Did the number of pictures with red or blue
sparks differ between experiments?
In the result section line 26: please write ocular sparks were “on“ significantly….
Please add the result of the second experiment to the abstract.
Because the triplefin can move both eyes independently from each other, was there a case that the
same fish had a red ocular spark on one eye and a blue ocular spark on the other eye?

Summary: The authors have observed an association between red fluorescent eyes and a
preference for small prey and therefore conclude that these animals must be using active
photolocation. The authors present a behavioral mechanism, the ocular spark, as the means by
which photolocation is achieved in T. delaisi. The frequency with which ocular sparks occur is
compared in a behavioral experiment using live prey presented against different colour
backgrounds. The satiation state of the animals did not affect the frequency of blue vs. red sparks,
though the background colour did.
Comments: The philosophical format of this manuscript is inappropriate given the data
presented. As written in the introduction, the authors present an idea (active photolocation by
red fluorescent irides) they would like to confirm. This is not how an experimental hypothesis
should be framed as it suggests a bias of the researcher. Hypotheses are tested, accepted and/or
rejected, not confirmed. The word confirmed is used repeatedly in this context.
The experiments performed and the data themselves are worth publishing, but not in the current
framing. The story they tell is about ocular sparks, both as a newly described feature of fish
behaviour and as having a possible role in prey detection. It is not a story about red fluorescence
being used for active photolocation. Yes, red fluorescence is involved in making a red spark, but
the behavioral 2x2 experiments do not demonstrate that blue sparks are the "off state" of an
ocular spark (as noted in the abstract). Looking at how bright this iridiphore patch is, I would
think the blue ocular spark would be a better candidate for photolocation than the much dimmer
red one.
Figures 3 and 4 clearly demonstrate that red sparks occur more frequently when visual tasks are
being performed with a blue background, and blue sparks occur more frequently when vision
involves a red background. This finding is interesting! Particularly since the satiation of the fish
does not produce an effect on these results. In its present state, the authors seem to want to
confirm their bias that red fluorescence is used for photolocation during prey capture, despite the
fact that the data don't support this. I would love to see experimental evidence that red
fluorescent eyes are used for photolocation, I just don’t see it in these sets of experiments.
Figure 1 is a figure of nice photographs, but should be in the supplemental materials. The data in
ESM 3 and 4 should be part of the main figures. Perhaps move figure 2 (photos of T. delaisi
sparks) to figure 1, then make EMS 3 & 4 into one, 2-part figure for figure 2.
Specific framing of the introduction: First paragraph is fine as is, but then the authors introduce
bioluminsescent deep sea fish as the only known examples of active photolocation, then describe
different types of eyeshine, then mention that reflective eyeshine is only visible to observers that
radiate light from a source close to their own eye as the bioluminescent fish do. This is very
confusing since the ocular sparks, not yet introduced, are the first reflective, eyeshine light
structures proposed to reflect light that the animal can see. After the first paragraph the rest of the
introduction would be clearer and make a solid case for the study if it was framed like this:
- introduce active photolocation by chemoluminscent fish in the deep sea. They have “search
lights” located close to their eye.
- Many fish have reflective structures associated with their eyes that are known to increase
sensitivity in low light conditions (references) as well as provide camouflage (references).
16
- Then introduce ocular sparks as a sort of hybrid of the two points you just introduced: these are
reflective structures found in close association with the eye and may be a reflective version of
what we see in the red bioluminescent deep sea fishes. This is a novel and interesting thing.
- Then define ocular sparks and state your hypothesis that these interesting features may be
providing an active photolocation role in foraging. Then talk about how you’re going to test this.
- End of introduction
Everything from pg3L49-p4L17 should be in the discussion.
Everything from Intro p4L42-p5L3 should be in the results.
The information about Tigriopus californicus should be in the methods.
Methods:
It is unclear why the authors chose to go into such detail about the copepod prey (section 2.3),
their eye structure, and their aquaculture. Such information about the copepod eye and its
eyeshine would only be useful if the authors were including optical modelling in the study,
which they specifically state they are not including at the moment (in Discussion). Remove this
section, make no more than 2-3 sentences comment on who the prey were, where you got them
from and how you delivered them to the experimental fish.
Results:
should include the quantified data regarding ocular sparks: spectral reflectance, occurance in
nature, etc.
Discussion:
The authors do a decent job of proposing alternate hypotheses for the function of ocular sparks,
but continue to conclude with strong certainty that their data provides evidence for active
photolocation. I do not come to the same conclusion (last paragraph), though I would agree that
something interesting is going on with T. delaisi ocular spark behavior given the experimental
paradigm that requires following up with different experiments.

The authors discovered a new phenomenon, an „ocular spark“ at the ventral part of the iris,
which is found in many different fish species. The idea is that the downwelling light is focussed
as a spot on the lower iris and is redirected, so that a fish can use this light to detect a prey or a
predator.
The authors tested the hypothesis whether the triplefin Tripterygion delaisi used the ocular
sparks which can be shifted to red and blue spots by eye movemnts as a light source when prey is
absent or present in front of a red or blue background. Additionally, they tested whether the
satiation state of the test fish matters in using these sparks.
The experiments are well designed. During experiments they took pictures of each test fish every
2 s with a maximum of 100 pictures per fish. They counted the number of pictures showing the
fish with a red or blue ocular spark in different test situations.
The sample size in Experiment 1 was n = 17. In Fig. 3 however, it seems that there are 18 data (red
ocular spark and under blue background). Please check whether this is the case.
In Experiment 2 only one of 21 test fish was excluded from the analysis. In the analysis, however,
the sample size is N = 19. Was another fish excluded? Please check whether the number of
triangles is correct in Figure 4.
Because the authors counted the number of pictures, it is not correct to state that „Blue sparks
were shown significantly longer against a red background“. Correct is that you got a higher
17
number of pictures (or a higher proportion of picture) shown the fish with red or blue sparks.
Please change that in the result section and in the figure legends to Fig. 3 and 4. Please use same
range of y-axis in Fig. 3 and 4.
The average number of pictures with a red or blue ocular spark is around 30 or max 40 % (40 of
100 pictures). Why is the proportion relatively low? Did the number of pictures with red or blue
sparks differ between experiments?
In the result section line 26: please write ocular sparks were “on“ significantly….
Please add the result of the second experiment to the abstract.
Because the triplefin can move both eyes independently from each other, was there a case that the
same fish had a red ocular spark on one eye and a blue ocular spark on the other eye?
Associate Editor's comments:
The revised version of this manuscript has now been re-evaluated by two expert referees, whose
opinions are somewhat mixed. While both referees acknowledge that the experimental approach
and the data themselves are worth publishing, Reviewer #2 raises important concerns about the
general focus of the manuscript, in particular the format of the introduction section; both
reviewers provide a number of additional points that would need to be fixed. In the light of these
reviews, I am not able to recommend acceptance of the manuscript at this stage. However, I
would like to recommend to the authors to take the comments by the referees into full
consideration and to come up with a revised version, in which the introduction section is written
in a more balanced way and contains a hypothesis-driven framework (Reviewer #2 provides
good suggestions how the introduction section could be structured). In addition, the authors
should clarify the points raised by Reviewer #1 regarding sample sizes and the wording; and
shorten the part in which they talk about copepods (see comment by Reviewer #2), or move it to
the supplement.
Subject Editor Comments:
This is the second submission of this manuscript, and regrettably one reviewer still feels that the
authors have not shown adequate evidence for photolocation in this diurnal fish. So there may be
some misunderstanding here that can be cleared up. Could the authors please show that they
have, or please remove or alter discussion of this feature? Because of reviewer fatigue, our AE
will need to judge whether these points have been addressed before deciding to consider the MS
further. Thanks very much for your submission.

mentioning it in the methods as well. Perhaps if you combine the two sub headings for
“Reflectance of blue ocular sparks” and “Radiance from red ocular sparks” under one sub

that point clear in the main body of the text and streamline this section of the paper.

This is an exciting study that begins to investigate the functional significance of micro-reflections and/or
micro-flourescence of small regions of the iris of a small, cryptic marine fish (the triplefin, Tripterygion
delaisi). The authors have identified that this fish has two different colored reflections/fluorescence from
small regions on their irises. They either reflect/fluoresce red around their iris, or they sometime reflect
blue from a reflectance patch on the iris just below the center of their eye. The authors are building on
previous body of research in their lab that demonstrates that these ‘ocular sparks’ (they are introducing
a new term) are produced by a product of downwelling irradiance passing through the protruding fish
lens and concentrating on the iris rim where it is reflected (or fluoresced in the case of the red spark)
outward and is hypothesized to assist in ‘seeing’ and capturing microfauna. The authors propose that
this type of micro-flashlighting is a form of “active phololocation” which is analogous to how some
animals (bats) use sound waves to locate their prey (echolocation).
To test this hypothesis, the authors conducted a well-constructed experiment that compared the relative
use of blue or red ocular sparks dependent on (a) background color, (b) presence or absence of prey
(copepods) and (c) satiety level of fish. Their study lends support that the fish actively use ocular sparks
in a putatively adaptive fashion as they disproportionately display the ocular spark color that contrasts
more with the background (showing more blue ocular sparks against a red background and vice versa)
and that ocular sparking is increased during conditions with prey present. By using the non-dominant
color from the background, these sparks might provide contrasting light that will illuminate their small
prey at close distances (1-3cm) and amplify the fish’s detection capabilities.
Overall, the manuscript is very well written and the authors do a thorough job describing the limitations
and possible interpretations of their dataset in the Discussion section. If the authors are able to clarify
one critical methodological issue (see below), and animal use formality, this study will make a significant
and exciting contribution to the field, and the first evidence of active photolocation in an animal system.
>>> REPLY: Thank you. Detailed replies are following below.
Major clarification needed:
(1) The authors do not specify how their fish were scored for either a “blue’ or a “red” ocular spark in
their study. Was the assignment qualitative (visually scored) or quantitatively (using RGB values from
their photographs)? Explicitly stating their criteria for assigning the presence of a blue or red ocular
spark in their study is critical. Given that the authors are using series of photographs to assess spark
presence, I strongly suggest that they develop a quantitative criterion for spark presence assignment.
This would significantly strengthen the confidence in their findings.
>>> REPLY: Spark type was assessed visually. Due to the fact that fish were free-roaming, each in its
own aquarium, the variation in fish illumination, distance and orientation relative to the camera was
large. Hence, truly automated scoring using fixed settings was not possible. It would have required too
much of (subjective) human input, e.g. selecting pixels and thresholds for each picture. The time needed
for this extra effort would have resulted in a trade-off with the larger amount of data that can be
collected in using fast visual assessment. This explains why we decided against digital image scoring.
Following this decision, we implemented three measures to prevent observer bias:
(1) We used clear definitions for the two ocular sparks based not only on colour, but also shape, position
on the iris, and orientation of the fish and its eye. These criteria are not easily automated and were
selected following years of observation in the lab and in the field. An example of sparks in the blue-light
aquaria has been added as ESM 5 (Video S2).
(2) Students were trained using picture series from the lab and the field.
(3) Picture analysis was randomised and blind to the treatment.
Hence, although biased sampling is a risk in visual assessment of behaviour, we hope we convinced the
reviewer that we controlled it satisfactorily. This issue is now explicitly addressed in the methodology
section as a new section (2.5 Data acquisition).
(2) The other issue involves reporting an ethics protocol. The authors state that since no animals were
injured in the process of their experiment, no ethics permit was required. Yet, in many other countries
(e.g. UK and US), similar experiments would require formal protocol approval. I am not familiar with the
German Animal Care Legislation, and such practices may be customary in Germany. However, the
authors state that they discussed these experimental procedures using animals housed in aquaria for 6
months with their institutional animal welfare officer. Given the international readership of Royal Society
Open Science, I think it would be beneficial if the authors could include the name of their institutional
animal welfare officer in the manuscript to provide evidence of institutional oversight on these
experiments.
>>> REPLY: We follow German and EU animal welfare legislation. As long as animals are not exposed to
pain, suffering or injury, an ethics permit is indeed not required. The requirement that always needs to
be fulfilled, however, is that of appropriate animal husbandry. In the new version of the manuscript, the
ethics statement (following the discussion) has been rewritten, providing more details about legislation
and contact details of the officers in charge.
Minor clarification:
P9, line8: Please change “award” to “reward”
>>> REPLY: Thank you. Changed (not marked.)
P13, line22-23. Please reword the tautology in this sentence: “Even weak, diffuse reflectors can …induce
perceptible reflections in even weak reflectors”.
>>> REPLY: Thank you, this was misleading indeed. The second “weak reflectors” refer to potential
targets, not senders. This has been clarified in the new manuscript (marked in red).
P25. Table 2. Why is Observation day included as a parameter for Red ocular spark, but not Blue ocular
spark? Similarly, why is “fish testing order” a parameter for Blue ocular spark but not for Red? Are these
two terms equivalent?
>>> REPLY: These are two different parameters. As explained in methods-section 2.7 Statistical
analysis, only the final, most parsimonious models are shown. They are the result of first considering the
contribution of all available parameters, followed by backward model selection. The legends of Tables 1
and 2 mention this (“Best models from a series of hierarchical GLMM testing the effect of ….”). The main
parameters (background hue, copepods / satiation status), however, were always kept in the model
because they were main factors in the experimental design. In the footnote of Table 1 and 2, we now
added a further clarification: „All other parameters that were initially in the model were removed
because they did not contribute to the model (See Methods 2.7). “

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_16
The authors describe a new optical phenomenon in fish they term “ocular sparks” which describes a
small, reflective patch of material beneath the pupil whose reflectance can be controlled by the animal.
The only data presented to describe this new phenomenon are from two behavioural experiments. Figure
1 is a qualitative presentation of nice pictures of fish eyes with features that may be used for
photolocation, but these are not quantitative data. The behavioural data clearly demonstrate that the
animals change the “ocular spark” occurrence when the viewing different backgrounds. Clearly the
animals responded to something within the experimental design, however the authors are much too far
reaching in their interpretation of these results. Overall, these data seem preliminary for presenting a
new and interesting concept.
At a minimum, this story should include a qualitative description of “ocular sparks” (i.e. reflectance
spectra, absolute radiance spectra from the spark, etc.).
Further, I would be interested to see the optical modelling (such as ray tracing) that supports
illumination of the spark patch by the protruding spherical lens (as the authors suggest without
evidence) as well as some calculations to support that the light to reflected from such a tiny patch, is
sufficient to then reflect off of prey and be absorbed by the fish’s retina. As it is, the authors attempt to
push forward a hypothesis (shallow water photolocation by reef fishes) with very little empirical
foundation.
I would definitely consider this manuscript for publication with an overhaul in the framing of the story
and the conclusions drawn from the data. With just a few extra analyses, I feel there is a very nice story
relating the measured radiances and the observed behaviour.
>>> REPLY: The reviewer may have misunderstood the goal of this manuscript. Although studying the
plausibility of active photolocation is our research agenda, an exhaustive demonstration of active
photolocation is not the scope of this paper. Our approach is explained in the introduction: (1) Nocturnal
active photolocation is uncontested. (2) Assuming (hypothetically) that daytime active photolocation also
exists somewhere in nature, we speculate on the likely conditions, mechanisms, and systems to look for
it. (3) Weak light sources, short interaction distances, target eyeshine and strong illumination gradients
can all be expected to increase that probability. (4) Hence, small fish living in a highly structured,
benthic microhabitat are a good system to start looking. (5) Here we draw attention to “ocular sparks” in
this context, not to provide the final demonstration of diurnal active photolocation, but as part of our
screening for possible mechanisms that are accessible to experimental and theoretical approaches. (6)
In the discussion we elaborate on how to test this working hypothesis in the future: “Ocular sparks are
adaptive in an active photolocation context”.
Figure 1 merely exemplifies the observations that made us interested in this topic – as explained in the
introduction. It has no bearing on the conclusions drawn from the data.
The requested radiance measurements are presented in the electronic supplements. The decision to put
them there is that they do not contribute to the specific hypothesis being tested. Moreover, they are
(largely) specific for the (monochromatic blue) laboratory conditions of this particular experiment and
therefore lack relevance for assessing the situation under natural conditions with natural prey. By
offering them as electronic supplement, we prevent distraction from the actual message of this
manuscript. We now also added reflectance data for the blue ocular spark to ESM 4 (Figure S2-D), which
were not added to the original submission. For the red ocular spark, radiance (as shown in ESM 4, Figure
S2-C) is a complex interplay between reflectance and fluorescence, as described in detail by Bitton et al.
(2017). The text has been adjusted. If the reviewer still recommends to move these spectral graphs into
the main manuscript, we are prepared to do so – but with the restrictions mentioned.
Further comments as the specifically relate to the text are as follows:
Background
P3L36-39: “Eyeshine…but can also play a role in camouflage [15]” : While this is a good summary of the
diversity of function of reflective structures in animal eyes, the authors misinterpret the literature
slightly. The eyeshine described in Feller & Cronin for camouflage is NOT produced from a tapetum
lucidum but by a currently unpublished reflecting structure located at the distal boundary of the
photoreceptors where they meet the the light-focusing, dioptric layer. It is an unfortunate overlap in the
terminology that both the reflectance from a true, sensitivity-enhancing tapetum and a reflective
camouflage found in an eye should both be called “eyeshine”. In truth these are completely divergent
structures and should have different names. Perhaps you should just describe the different functions of
reflective structures in animal eyes? That would be more accurate and would create a nice category to
introduce ocular sparks.
>>> REPLY: We replaced “tapetum lucidum” by the more general term “reflective layer” and focus on
function more than mechanism. This section has been slightly modified (marked in red in the
manuscript).
P3L48: “many fishes have conspicuously bright eyes” – conspicuous to humans yes, but how do these
eyes appear to conspecifics? Predators? Heterospecifics in complex ecological roles (such as cleaner
wrass and cleaner shrimp). Just because something looks interesting to a human does not mean it has a
function in an animal (i.e. the fantastic reflecting structures in a sea mouse, who spends its life buried in
mud; or the beautiful colourations of cleaner shrimp, which they themselves cannot see).
>>> REPLY: We chose the expression “conspicuously bright eyes” not “conspicuously colourful eyes” for
good reason. Even if most organisms see colour differently than humans do, we can assume that
animals with reasonable vision will be able to perceive brightness differences. Hence, whoever is looking,
the eyes of many fishes should stand out as the brightest structure on their body. The argument may
also apply to the brightness contrasts in cleaner shrimp or iridescent chaetae in polychaetes (who leave
the substrate when reproducing). We fully agree with the reviewer that it is wrong to jump to
conclusions prematurely, but proposing a speculative hypothesis is the first step of any science project,
irrespective of how unlikely it may sound at first.
P4L23: The authors state that ocular sparks are “generated by the protruding spherical lens” but offer
no data or literature to support this claim. Couldn’t light reflected or scattered from the environment
around and below the animal also contribute to the observed flicker of the eye patch by the human
observer?
>>> REPLY: The fact that the spherical lens of fishes protrudes through the pupil, is well documented
and can be seen on countless publicly available photographs taken either frontally or dorsally across fish
families. The ocular spark mechanism follows automatically from this and is indeed as simple as we
describe it: Downwelling light is focused on the iris (or skin) below the pupil by the protruding lens. As
far as we can tell, there is indeed no literature on this - which is surprising. Unfortunately, ocular sparks
are rarely visible on pictures because most photographers use flash photography which overrules such
natural light effects.
Obviously, other light sources (reflected, scattered) will contribute to overall iris radiance. But none of
them can explain the strong focal point or focal triangle with is produced by an ocular spark. We also do
not see any other shapes or patterns that cannot be explained by the focusing mechanism. In the first
seconds of video ESM 3, one can see how focused light first generates a blue ocular spark, and then
moves with eye movement and touches the skin below the eye.
P5L12: The authors base their entire experimental design on the human qualitative observation that
ocular sparks in T. delaisi are blue and red without any consideration of the reflectance spectra of the
two sparks or the visual sensitivity of the animals.
>>> REPLY: Bitton et al. (2017) show that T. delaisi can perceive its own red fluorescence (MWS-LWS
double cones), and has blue-sensitive SWS single cones. There can be no doubt about T. delaisi’s ability
to see and differentiate between both spark types. We shall stress this more explicitly in the revised
manuscript (marked in red). Reflectance spectra of the two sparks are shown in ESM 4 (Figures S2-C
and S2-D).
Methods
P7. L33: Copepod Prey section: why is this section here? The detailed description of the animal, their
eye structure and the details of their culture seem irrelevant to the manuscript. Brief mention of the
copepod species and that they were reared in the laboratory within the fish care section is sufficient.
>>> REPLY: As stated in the Introduction, for daytime active photolocation to work, we predict weak
light sources in the observer, which by implication means that their functionality is probably limited to
detecting reasonably good reflectors in their targets. As is true for many crustaceans, many copepods
have reflective eyes – as demonstrated in ESM 6 and 7. With those data, we want to show that Tigriopus
californicus is a suitable and convenient species with features that coincide with predicted target
properties for active photolocation. We do not emphasize this in the manuscript because the experiment
does not test whether T. delaisi induces and perceives blinking copepod eyes. The choice of our prey
species is now clarified more in the introduction and methods in the manuscript.
P8L53: Experimental setup: it would be nice to have a figure that illustrates the experimental setup,
chambers, and photographs of what the copepods look like on their felt backgrounds. Why weren’t mock
copepods or inedible particles (p.14L29) used as a control to verify they were indeed motivated by visual
predation?
>>> REPLY: We added a picture of the tanks used for this experiment to ESM 4 (Figure S2-A). However,
because they are all together in a wall-to-wall single unit, it is not possible to produce a picture of the
more informative side-view shown schematically in ESM 4 (Figure S2-B). We also did not make pictures
of the copepods on the felt backgrounds in the copepod chambers under the blue conditions under which
the fish saw them, but the appearance of the copepods on a black background in greenish culture water
can be seen in ESM 7.
We fail to see how a treatment with mock copepods or inedible particles adds to our assessment of T.
delaisi being a visual predator, or how this improves or supplements the control treatment with copepod
culture water without copepods. If the question refers to moving prey items compared to non-moving
ones, we can add that fish specifically and strongly respond to movement of either live prey, or frozen
food whirling down in the water current of the aquarium. They ignore non-moving objects (e.g. food on
the ground), but can be trained to respond to food rewards (Kalb et al. 2015, Häderer & Michiels 2016).
If this does not address the reviewer’s query, we kindly ask her/him to rephrase it.
P9L41: Since the fish in the two experiments were not naive, perhaps the unexpected finding in the
satiated fish was due to learning? Why were the fish fed mysids to be satiated and copepods? These
factors could have influenced the behavioural outcome.
>>> REPLY: We are not entirely certain we understand this question. The fish in both experiments were
naïve to the experimental design. New fish were used for the second experiment that included the
satiation treatment. Note that all fish were tested every week, once in a satiated and once in a non-
satiated state. Mysis shrimp are the daily food for all fish in our facilities and it is possible to satiate T.
delaisi with them. Relative to Mysis, however, the copepods are tiny. Fish would need very large
numbers of them to reach satiation. Live copepods, however, elicit a “hunting mode” similar to a cat
being attracted to a moving object even if satiated. Since copepods only occasionally escaped during the
experiment (not quantified), the “reward” effect was minimal.
Despite the fact that each fish was exposed to a test run only once (exp 1) or twice (exp 2, once
satiated, once hungry) each week, they did change their behaviour over time: Observation day affected
red ocular spark usage (not blue ocular spark usage) in experiment 2. Yet, the effect of background
remained highly significant despite correction for observation day in the final model (Table 2). All other
possibly confounding factors did not contribute to the observed effects.
Results: these are alarmingly brief. Why is so much data buried in the supplemental materials?
>>> REPLY: The result section focuses on the data that were collected to test the working hypothesis of
this manuscript. However, because of the many questions that this new system generates (as
exemplified by this reviewer), we have provided extensive background data as ESM in anticipation of
such queries. As explained earlier, we want to prevent an attention shift away from what we are
focusing on in this manuscript.
Discussion:
The authors go into too much length trying to prop up the hypothesis that ocular sparks are used for
active photolocation. While it would be really nice to see data that support this idea, these data are not
here. At this point, intraspecific communication seems just as likely a candidate for the varied ocular
sparks as active photolocation.
>>> REPLY: We draw a clear line between what we can and cannot conclude from the data, offer
alternative explanations, and add an outlook of what is to be tested next. We also highlight features of
ocular sparks that meet the predicted criteria for a possible active photolocation mechanism. We
proposed intraspecific communication as an alternative (non-exclusive) explanation. Yet, if this were the
main reason for using ocular sparks, we would not have expected an effect in our experiment, where
communication was excluded. All this falls within the scope of a scientific paper critically describing a
piece of a complex puzzle.
We edited the discussion to make a clearer distinction between facts and speculation. One paragraph
that speculated on why ocular sparks are increased when prey had presumably already been spotted,
has been removed to shorten the discussion.
Supplemental Materials:
ESM1: What is the context of this figure? Or the references?
>>> REPLY: This figure illustrates the difference between the main reflector types found in natural
systems (excluding iridescence) for non-specialists. The “reference” refers to the main paper as each
ESM is treated as an independent file.
ESM2: why are these figures buried in the SM? Were the radiances measured in air or in water? Why are
your radiance measurements not included in the methods? These data would be perfect for modelling if
there is enough light to detect an object at different viewing distances. See “the optics of light” by Sonke
Johnsen for specific maths.
>>> REPLY: (Now ESM 4 and ESM 6) See earlier replies. All radiances were measured in water – but
with the spectrometer (optics-based Photoresearch Spectrascan PR 740 and PR 670) at the outside of
the tank. Future modelling will be based on natural light fields and targets.
ESM3: couldn’t the “red spark” just be a “not blue” spark? Perhaps, if they are using the sparks for
photolocation it is just the blue spark and the red is just the light being focused off the properly
reflective patch. The fluorescence is likely just an artefact of the structure of the pigments in the iris
since many ocular pigments are inherently fluorescent without any consequence to the visual system.
>>> REPLY: (Now ESM 3, 4 and 5) This question is important and is in fact implicitly tested in this
paper.
The red fluorescence of the iris has been described and tested in several previous papers. The latest
presents a detailed description of the combined effects of long wavelength reflectance and fluorescence
in relation to depth and the ability of T. delaisi to perceive it (Bitton et al. 2017). Red ocular sparks can
indeed form anywhere on the iris – except where there is a blue-white spot (main one at the ventral
edge). But there is no “properly reflective patch”, just different areas with different combinations of
reflectance and presence/absence of fluorescence.
Hence, although a “red spark” is indeed a “not-blue spark”, this does not imply that a red spark is
another kind of “off-state”. Assuming both sparks have a function in active photolocation – we expect
each to perform better under different conditions. This prediction explains the design of this study, and
is supported by the results. Hence, a form of intentionality indeed seems to apply to both ocular sparks.
We are not sure what the reviewer means with “ocular pigments”. The fluorescence in the iris shows
histological and spectral properties that are similar to those found in other species in non-ocular parts of
the body: The red fluorescent component is embedded in hypoxanthin-guanine crystals on the outward
facing side of the iris (Michiels et al. 2008; Wucherer & Michiels 2014). Although its biochemical
properties have not been investigated in full detail, we have no reason to expect them to be similar to
the photopigments in the retina – if this is what the reviewer is referring to.
ESM4: Again, why is there so much attention to the copepod eyeshine? If it is part of the story, it should
be framed as such in your intro and discussion.
>>> REPLY: (Now ESM 6 and ESM 7) Given the overall context, it was important to select a prey
species that meets the basic predicted pattern under the active photolocation hypothesis. But since we
do not specifically test for inducing and detection blinking copepod eyes here, we do not address this in
detail in the main manuscript. These ESM are mainly to confirm that Tigriopus californicus is a suitable
target that meets the requirements for laboratory experiments. Given our previous work, it would make
no sense to pick a prey species with no eyes, or poorly reflecting eyes - even if the experiment is not
directly testing the ability of T. delaisi to see those eyes.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_17
Summary: The authors have observed an association between red fluorescent eyes and a
preference for small prey and therefore conclude that these animals must be using active
photolocation. The authors present a behavioral mechanism, the ocular spark, as the means
by which photolocation is achieved in T. delaisi. The frequency with which ocular sparks
occur is compared in a behavioral experiment using live prey presented against different
colour backgrounds. The satiation state of the animals did not affect the frequency of blue
vs. red sparks, though the background colour did.
>>>>> Neither in previously published papers, nor in this manuscript we ever "conclude" that
"these animals must be using active photolocation". We have made an effort to reduce the
likelihood of such an interpretation in the new version of the ms.
Comments: The philosophical format of this manuscript is inappropriate given the data
presented. As written in the introduction, the authors present an idea (active photolocation
by red fluorescent irides) they would like to confirm. This is not how an experimental
hypothesis should be framed as it suggests a bias of the researcher. Hypotheses are tested,
accepted and/or rejected, not confirmed. The word confirmed is used repeatedly in this
context.
>>>>> Hypotheses propose an explanation based on prior observations. It is not habitual to
call this a "bias". Hypothesis-driven research allows to design experiments effectively, with
the aim to falsify or verify one or more predictions – just as the reviewer explains. Biases can
be problematic when they affect data collection and interpretation. We took great care to
prevent observer bias, both in data collection, analysis and interpretation.
We apologize for missing the subtle difference between "confirmed" and "accepted" in a
context of hypothesis testing. For non-native speakers, this means the same. All occurrences
of "confirmed" or "confirm" have been replaced.
The reviewer missed that we do not test active photolocation in its entirety. Instead, we test
the active use of an ocular light source, not the detection that might follow from it. This is
one part of the puzzle, not the full picture. However, we would not be able to explain the
rationale of our experiments without explaining the overarching concept.
This manuscript also does not focus on red fluorescent irides, but on ocular sparks. Blue
ocular sparks are purely reflective and non-fluorescent. Red ocular sparks are partly
fluorescent, but are also reflective (see Bitton et al. 2017, Roy. Soc. Open Science). This is an
important reason for including figure 1.
We reworded the abstract and introduction to reflect this more clearly.
The experiments performed and the data themselves are worth publishing, but not in the
current framing. The story they tell is about ocular sparks, both as a newly described feature
of fish behaviour and as having a possible role in prey detection. It is not a story about red
fluorescence being used for active photolocation. Yes, red fluorescence is involved in
making a red spark, but the behavioral 2x2 experiments do not demonstrate that blue
sparks are the "off state" of an ocular spark (as noted in the abstract). Looking at how bright
this iridiphore patch is, I would think the blue ocular spark would be a better candidate for
photolocation than the much dimmer red one.
>>>>> As explained above, our manuscript is not "a story about red fluorescence being used
for active photolocation", as should have been clear throughout. Blue ocular sparks are also
not the off state as should have been clear from pictures 2b, c, d, the spectrometric data,
and the icons in the graphs. Blue ocular sparks are indeed a more likely candidate for active
photolocation under shallow-water, sun-exposed conditions, but this is not the scope of this
paper. We rephrased the abstract and introduction in response to these comments.
Figures 3 and 4 clearly demonstrate that red sparks occur more frequently when visual tasks
are being performed with a blue background, and blue sparks occur more frequently when
vision involves a red background. This finding is interesting! Particularly since the satiation
of the fish does not produce an effect on these results. In its present state, the authors
seem to want to confirm their bias that red fluorescence is used for photolocation during
prey capture, despite the fact that the data don't support this. I would love to see
experimental evidence that red fluorescent eyes are used for photolocation, I just don’t see
it in these sets of experiments.
>>>>> Again, this is not about testing a role of red fluorescence, but tests another
mechanism of modulated iris radiance. Given earlier comments, we interpret the
disapproving statement " ... the authors seem to want to confirm their bias ..." into the more
realistic description "... test their prediction ...". We test for the controlled modulation of iris
radiance, not the complete mechanism of active photolocation – which requires more work –
as outlined in the discussion. We agree with the reviewer on this point.
Figure 1 is a figure of nice photographs, but should be in the supplemental materials. The
data in ESM 3 and 4 should be part of the main figures. Perhaps move figure 2 (photos of T.
delaisi sparks) to figure 1, then make EMS 3 & 4 into one, 2-part figure for figure 2.
>>>>> All hypotheses in science follow from initial observations. Our starting observation is
that "bright eyes" are remarkably common among fish, as is illustrated by this panel. It also
has the advantage that it allows readers to compare alternative forms of ocular radiance
(e.g. chemiluminescent suborbital light organs, red fluorescent irides, ocular sparks, corneal
iridescence, etc.). We would like to leave it in the main manuscript as it allows readers to see
e.g. how ocular sparks compare to red fluorescence irides – a point that seems to have
misunderstandings.
Two graphs from ESM 4 (old) have been moved into the results section of the main
manuscript as suggested (new figure 3). ESM 3 was a video.
Specific framing of the introduction: First paragraph is fine as is, but then the authors
introduce bioluminescent deep sea fish as the only known examples of active photolocation,
then describe different types of eyeshine, then mention that reflective eyeshine is only
visible to observers that radiate light from a source close to their own eye as the
bioluminescent fish do. This is very confusing since the ocular sparks, not yet introduced,
are the first reflective, eyeshine light structures proposed to reflect light that the animal can
see. After the first paragraph the rest of the introduction would be clearer and make a solid
case for the study if it was framed like this:
- introduce active photolocation by chemoluminscent fish in the deep sea. They have
“search lights” located close to their eye.
- Many fish have reflective structures associated with their eyes that are known to
increase sensitivity in low light conditions (references) as well as provide camouflage
(references).
- Then introduce ocular sparks as a sort of hybrid of the two points you just
introduced: these are reflective structures found in close association with the eye and may
be a reflective version of what we see in the red bioluminescent deep sea fishes. This is a
novel and interesting thing.
- Then define ocular sparks and state your hypothesis that these interesting features
may be providing an active photolocation role in foraging. Then talk about how you’re going
to test this.
- End of introduction
>>>>> Given that the original text already largely followed the same line of thought, not
many changes were necessary – but we did everything we could to show our willingness to
accommodate the wishes of the reviewer: Parts were deleted, shortened and re-arranged.
However, there seems to be some confusion about the term "eyeshine". In its strict, original
sense, eyeshine refers to (retro)reflective eyeshine, seen as light coming out of a pupil. Iridal
radiance, e.g. from an ocular spark, is therefore not "eyeshine". We now distinguish more
clearly between eyeshine s.s. and iris radiance. We checked the whole manuscript for
consistency. The term "ocular radiance" has been removed, as it can be interpreted as both
eyeshine and iris radiance.
Everything from pg3L49-p4L17 should be in the discussion.
>>>>> It is common practice to mention previous work in the introduction, so readers
recognise where this study fits in, what it is based on. Also, it is crucial to situate ocular
sparks in the context of other forms of ocular/iris radiance. In the new version of the
manuscript this paragraph has been shortened, but not moved.
Everything from Intro p4L42-p5L3 should be in the results.
>>>>> This does not make much sense, as the information described here (blue and red
ocular sparks in this particular species) is the basis for the working hypothesis presented in
the next paragraph. We did not discover the two ocular spark types in this study, but
designed the experiment because we knew about the two ocular sparks (from a series of
unpublished pilot experiments). We shortened this part.
The information about Tigriopus californicus should be in the methods.
>>>>> Done.
Methods:
It is unclear why the authors chose to go into such detail about the copepod prey (section
2.3), their eye structure, and their aquaculture. Such information about the copepod eye
and its eyeshine would only be useful if the authors were including optical modelling in the
study, which they specifically state they are not including at the moment (in Discussion).
Remove this section, make no more than 2-3 sentences comment on who the prey were,
where you got them from and how you delivered them to the experimental fish.
>>>>> We shortened this part. Yet, even if we do not specifically test whether T. delaisi can
induce and perceive eyeshine in copepods, it is important to mention that we used a prey
species with reflective eyes. One might criticise us for being inconsistent if we would not
have done so.
Results:
should include the quantified data regarding ocular sparks: spectral reflectance, occurance
in nature, etc.
>>>>> We moved the spectrometric data for ocular sparks in the laboratory into the results
as suggested by this referee. Observations from the field represent completely different data
sets and are the subject of ongoing work. Our original decision to place the ocular spark
spectral data into the ESM was because they do not directly contribute to the hypothesis
tested in the two experiments. Yet, we decided to follow this request.
Discussion:
The authors do a decent job of proposing alternate hypotheses for the function of ocular
sparks, but continue to conclude with strong certainty that their data provides evidence for
active photolocation. I do not come to the same conclusion (last paragraph), though I would
agree that something interesting is going on with T. delaisi ocular spark behavior given the
experimental paradigm that requires following up with different experiments.
>>>>> Rather than concluding with "strong certainty that their data provides evidence for
active photolocation" we actually explicitly stressed already in the previous version that this
paper does not test for active photolocation. We did our best to make that even clearer in
this version.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_18
The authors discovered a new phenomenon, an „ocular spark“ at the ventral part of the iris,
which is found in many different fish species. The idea is that the downwelling light is
focussed as a spot on the lower iris and is redirected, so that a fish can use this light to
detect a prey or a predator.
The authors tested the hypothesis whether the triplefin Tripterygion delaisi used the ocular
sparks which can be shifted to red and blue spots by eye movements as a light source when
prey is absent or present in front of a red or blue background. Additionally, they tested
whether the satiation state of the test fish matters in using these sparks.
The experiments are well designed. During experiments they took pictures of each test fish
every 2 s with a maximum of 100 pictures per fish. They counted the number of pictures
showing the fish with a red or blue ocular spark in different test situations.
The sample size in Experiment 1 was n = 17. In Fig. 3 however, it seems that there are 18
data (red ocular spark and under blue background). Please check whether this is the case.
In Experiment 2 only one of 21 test fish was excluded from the analysis. In the analysis,
however, the sample size is N = 19. Was another fish excluded? Please check whether the
number of triangles is correct in Figure 4.
Because the authors counted the number of pictures, it is not correct to state that „Blue
sparks were shown significantly longer against a red background“. Correct is that you got a
higher number of pictures (or a higher proportion of picture) shown the fish with red or blue
sparks. Please change that in the result section and in the figure legends to Fig. 3 and 4.
Please use same range of y-axis in Fig. 3 and 4.
>>>>> Samples sizes. Thank you for hinting at this inconsistency, which we checked and
corrected. In both experiments the initial number was 21 (3 x 7 aquaria in a closed-circuit
system).
Experiment 1: n = 18 is correct. This typing error was due to an innocent mistake in the raw
data: We overlooked that a 22nd fish with no data had been entered at the end of the
original raw data file. Although it obviously did not enter any analysis, it led to the erroneous
summary of "4 fish with no data", where there were only 3. Hence, n is not 17 (21 - 4) but 18
(21 - 3), as shown in the plots.
Experiment 2: n = 19 is correct. One individual never cooperated and was immediately
excluded. However, a second individual was removed during later analysis because it
cooperated in only 5 trials (all other individuals in > 10 trials) and never cooperated in the
"satiated" treatments, meaning that because of missing data, it was excluded from the final
analysis. We had forgotten to correct this in the methods.
Pictures as unit, not time? We made the suggested corrections although we do not quite
agree. Taking one image every two seconds means "subsampling time": The sum of pictures
with or without spark is still a reliable proxy of the (relative) time ocular sparks were on or
off. It is as if one were measuring something in 2 s intervals rather than 1 s intervals. It is not
uncommon to measure behaviour in minutes, hours, or even days.
Same y-axis in figs. 3 and 4: Done. The point clouds look slightly different because the
(horizontal) jittering was redone when re-running the R-script.
The average number of pictures with a red or blue ocular spark is around 30 or max 40 %
(40 of 100 pictures). Why is the proportion relatively low? Did the number of pictures with
red or blue sparks differ between experiments?
>>>>> The proportion is quite high: The total number of pictures with an ocular spark was
the sum of both red and blue sparks, which is clearly more than 40%. We would never expect
ocular sparks to be on most of the time.
We did not test for a difference in the number of blue or red ocular sparks between
experiments. These were two independent experiments, with fish from two different
locations, tested in a slightly different paradigm by different people at a different time of the
year. Hence, whether one would expect a difference or not is impossible to predict. And
whatever the outcome, it would be impossible to explain. This is why we only test for effects
within each experiment. We visualise the raw data in the graphs, and provide the data in an
online data repository (dryad), allowing readers to look for such an effect if they think it is
meaningful. We think it is not as it would be an attempt to test an unspecified hypothesis for
which these experiments were not designed.
In the result section line 26: please write ocular sparks were “on“ significantly….
>>>>> Done.
Please add the result of the second experiment to the abstract.
>>>>> Done.
Because the triplefin can move both eyes independently from each other, was there a case
that the same fish had a red ocular spark on one eye and a blue ocular spark on the other
eye?
>>>>> Because fish were recorded with one camera, we only rarely saw two ocular sparks in
one image (counted as a spark in the eye facing the camera most). Experiments with
multiple cameras are in progress and will provide answers to this question.
Associate Editor's comments:
The revised version of this manuscript has now been re-evaluated by two expert referees,
whose opinions are somewhat mixed. While both referees acknowledge that the
experimental approach and the data themselves are worth publishing, Reviewer #2 raises
important concerns about the general focus of the manuscript, in particular the format of
the introduction section; both reviewers provide a number of additional points that would
need to be fixed. In the light of these reviews, I am not able to recommend acceptance of
the manuscript at this stage. However, I would like to recommend to the authors to take the
comments by the referees into full consideration and to come up with a revised version, in
which the introduction section is written in a more balanced way and contains a hypothesis-
driven framework (Reviewer #2 provides good suggestions how the introduction section
could be structured). In addition, the authors should clarify the points raised by Reviewer #1
regarding sample sizes and the wording; and shorten the part in which they talk about
copepods (see comment by Reviewer #2), or move it to the supplement.
>>>>> See replies above.
Subject Editor Comments:
This is the second submission of this manuscript, and regrettably one reviewer still feels that
the authors have not shown adequate evidence for photolocation in this diurnal fish. So
there may be some misunderstanding here that can be cleared up. Could the authors please
show that they have, or please remove or alter discussion of this feature? Because of
reviewer fatigue, our AE will need to judge whether these points have been addressed
before deciding to consider the MS further. Thanks very much for your submission.
>>>>> As explained exhaustively in our reply to reviewer #2 (see above), this paper is not a
test of active photolocation (the complete detection mechanism). This is an ungrounded
interpretation by Reviewer #2 who casts a wrong shade on our actual wording – as can be
checked easily by reading the previous version of the manuscript.
However, we have taken the message seriously and made yet another (third) big effort to
reduce the risk of causing such misunderstandings. Abstract, introduction and discussion
have been re-written and each statement has been checked carefully (relevant changes
marked in red).
