The manuscript is scientifically sound. The proposed 5 step approach to evaluate the safety and
efficacy of silver is consistent and very interesting to the field.
A few minor revisions to improve the text:
1) The text is a bit lenghty. it can benefit from a general revision to reduce the lengh and
eliminate some repetitions
2) Can you provide as a supplementary information how you quantified the Ag+/Ag ratio? Did
you take into account/exclude a possible mass loss in the HF5 channel?
3) pp 15-16: Include a reference to link the Abs spectrum to the calculated size of AgNPs. UV-VIS
spectra is not very sensitive to determine particle size distribution. Even if very useful for Ag and
Au NPs, more sensitive methods to measure particle size and PSD can be applied (and you have
already the information in your data). If possible, I would suggest to add to figure 1 the Rg vs
time over the elution profiles of the AgNPs measured by MALS. You may also show as
supplementary information the PSD determined by NTA and/or by analyzing your TEM images.
4) table 2: how where the Rg and the Rh reported calculated?
4) pp 28 line 34 and fig 10-11: The surface charge of the Ag HEC indicates that both in water and
in DMEM they are neutral (-10 mV <zeta<10 mV= neutral particles, see Smith et al, anal bioanal
Chem, DOI10.1007/s00216-017-0527-z). I would not define the Ag HEC as "positively charged"
but "neutral particles" vs the negatively charged particles (Ag PVP and Ag CIT)

Despite the fact that all the data are original and valuble in the manuscript, some parts in other
articles are exactly the same in the method section. There may have been a confusion or a
mistake, but the authors may need to consider this issue before the full evaluation of the article.

the fiber’s inlet and outlet; during focus–injection, the flow settings are the same described in the
focus step while the sample is introduced into the channel through the inlet and focalized in a
narrow region. Then, in the elution step, the flow of mobile phase enters the channel inlet and
part of it comes out transversely (cross-flow); lastly, during elution–injection, no cross-flow is
applied (the flow is not split anymore), allowing for any remaining sample inside the channel to
be released; also, the flow is redirected in the injection line as well to clean it before the next
injection. The flow conditions for the different HF5 analysis are shown in Table 1. Longitudinal
flow is indicated as Vc, while cross/focus flow as Vx. In flow-injection analyses (FIA) neither
focus nor cross- flow are applied, thus allowing all injected analytes to exit from the channel
without retention."

In the present work, Marassi et al. propose a five-step approach for screening of chemical and
biological properties of silver nanoparticles to evaluate their usefulness in a healthcare setting.
Overall, the results are convincing, and the hypotheses are well supported by the experimental
results. Nevertheless, the novelty of the paper is not strong, as all the methods discussed in the
paper have already been done numerous times in previous literature. The main contribution of
the paper is to present a more comprehensive and systematic approach to evaluate nanoparticles,
which mostly aligns with the existing methodologies. Given the criteria of the Royal Society Open
Science, I recommend the paper to be accepted on the conditions that the following points are
addressed.
The results shown in Figure 1 (left panel) is poorly discussed. Please add a color code, place the
axes, and explain how they provide information regarding the size distribution of the particles.
Please check and correct references. Reference number 3 does not refer to the market value

1) The text is a bit lenghty. it can benefit from a general revision to reduce the lengh and eliminate some

hors’ response:
authors agree with the reviewer. The manuscript has been shortened and a secondary section has been
ved to the Supplementary Information (SI): Cytokine expression.
2) Can you provide as a supplementary information how you quantified the Ag+/Ag ratio? Did you take
into account/exclude a possible mass loss in the HF5 channel?
hors’ response:
nk you for your remark. The procedure was explained in the Material and Methods Section and its
ibility discussed in details in a previously published work [30]. However, a scheme of the procedure
ployed has been added in the Supplementary information. Mass loss was taken in consideration for what
cerns the ability of this system to collect silver ions: a series of injections of known amounts of AgNO3
performed. The collected crossflows were analysed through GFAAS and the recovery was assessed
ween 95 and 103%
3) pp 15-16: Include a reference to link the Abs spectrum to the calculated size of AgNPs. UV-VIS spectra
is not very sensitive to determine particle size distribution. Even if very useful for Ag and Au NPs, more

NTA and/or by analyzing your TEM images.
hors’ response:
ference was added and the UV-Vis data were better explained. The dimensional information contained
able 2 are derived indeed by NTA and MALS calculations, while the UV absorption spectrum was shown
ighlight the difference between the single peak detected by HF5-UV-MALS and the variety of particles
n with TEM. To avoid lengthening the manuscript the Rg vs time profile has been added in the
plementary Information.
4a) table 2: how where the Rg and the Rh reported calculated?
hors’ response:
y are indeed the NTA and MALS derived ones. This has been clarified in the Table caption and in the
n manuscript text.
4b) pp 28 line 34 and fig 10-11: The surface charge of the Ag HEC indicates that both in water and in
DMEM they are neutral (-10 mV <zeta<10 mV= neutral particles, see Smith et al, anal bioanal Chem,

particles" vs the negatively charged particles (Ag PVP and Ag CIT)
hors’ response:
results and discussion (and figures) have been modified to address this remark. Even though the
olute value of Zeta Potential is less than 10, the highlight of a difference between the negative coatings
HEC was considered very relevant and the term “weakly positive” was used for this goal. The PCP set
ction goes towards the choice of a neutral or positive particle also for future applications, and both of
se properties have been included.

USA) operating at a wavelength of 658nm, was used to measure the radius of particles in solution.
An HF5 method is composed of four steps: focus, focus– jection, elution and elution–injection. During
focus the mobile phase is split into two different streams entering from the fiber’s inlet and outlet; during
focus–injection, the flow settings are the same described in the focus step while the sample is introduced
into the channel through the inlet and focalized in a narrow region. Then, in the elution step, the flow of
mobile phase enters the channel inlet and part of it comes out transversely (cross-flow); lastly, during
elution–injection, no cross-flow is applied (the flow is not split anymore), allowing for any remaining
sample inside the channel to be released; also, the flow is redirected in the injection line as well to clean it
before the next injection. The flow conditions for the different HF5 analysis are shown in Table 1.
Longitudinal flow is indicated as Vc, while cross/focus flow as Vx. In flow-injection analyses (FIA) neither
focus nor cross- flow are applied, thus allowing all injected analytes to exit from the channel without
retention."

iewer' Comments to Author: Reviewer #3
In the present work, Marassi et al. propose a five-step approach for screening of chemical and biological
properties of silver nanoparticles to evaluate their usefulness in a healthcare setting. Overall, the results
are convincing, and the hypotheses are well supported by the experimental results. Nevertheless, the
novelty of the paper is not strong, as all the methods discussed in the paper have already been done
numerous times in previous literature. The main contribution of the paper is to present a more
comprehensive and systematic approach to evaluate nanoparticles, which mostly aligns with the existing
methodologies. Given the criteria of the Royal Society Open Science, I recommend the paper to be
accepted on the conditions that the following points are addressed.
The results shown in Figure 1 (left panel) is poorly discussed. Please add a color code, place the axes,
and explain how they provide information regarding the size distribution of the particles.
hors’ response:
re 1 has been relabeled and additional information have been added in the Supplementary Information
ument together with the relevant Reference. Further comments on the left panel of Figure 1 have been
added as part of the discussion section.
Please check and correct references. Reference number 3 does not refer to the market value statement of
silver nanoparticles.
hors’ response:
nk you for your remark and thorough revision. Reference #3 was misplaced and now revised and
rted.
would like to take the opportunity to thank both the Reviewers and the Editor for your time to go
ugh our rebuttal letter. Based on the clarifications provided within this letter, we trust that we have
vided sufficient grounds for you to consider our manuscript acceptable for publication.
king forward to your response.
erely yours,
