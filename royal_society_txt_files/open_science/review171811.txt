This work reported the application of Hf doped TiO2 for lithium as lithium battery anode. The
manuscript is well prepared, it good enough to be accepted for publishing as is. One concern is
that the authors have already published one conference paper on IOP conference series. Part of
the data has already been included in that paper.
One technical question, for Fig. 1b, it clearly shows that the material is composed of hollow
microtubes with nanowires inside. What's the material inside?

In this manuscript, Hf-doped TiO2 was fabricated by using template sol-gel route to improve Li+
storage. The synthesized material was well characterized as well as its electrochemical behavior
as Li-ion battery anode. The idea is interesting and supported well by experiments. It is
suggested to be published.

ar Dr. Thomas Foley,
Thanks a lot for forwarding us the editors’ suggestions and reviewers’ comments on our paper entitled “Effect of
-doping on Electrochemical Performance of Anatase TiO2 as an Anode Material for Lithium Storage”.
anks, also for your willingness to consider further for the publication of a revised manuscript that has addressed
concerns of the editors and reviewers. We are very glad to learn that the reviewers has concluded that the work is
eresting, supported well by experiments, and good prepared. We appreciate positive comments as well as critical
ggestions, which have definitely allowed us to improve the manuscript. We corrected the manuscript (changes are
hlighted in red type in the revised manuscript) and our response to comments are described below.

itors' comments
mment: The editors note that your manuscript bears a high degree of similarity with some of your earlier
blished works (namely, http://www.jmst.org/article/2017/1005-0302/1005-0302-33-6-527.shtml and
p://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/112/1/012016/pdf). The editors are willing to consider a
ision (based on the comments of the referees, below), but they insist that, in your cover letter, you fully address
concern that your work has a high degree of similarity with your earlier work.
sponse: Thanks for your worthy suggestion for the improvement of our manuscript. Indeed, in the initial version
this manuscript we did not discussed our previous data obtained in the area of anatase TiO2 doping and published
Journal of Materials Science and Technology and IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering.
w we include and discussed these results. In order to clarify we note that the paper in J. Mater. Sci. Tech. is
dicated to TiO2 doped with zirconium (0.72 <U+01FA>) (but not hafnium as in this manuscript). In particular, based on
Raman spectroscopy and charge/discharge tests the effect of dopant ionic radius on doped TiO2 electrochemical
havior was established. At the same time, our further study showed that TiO2 doped with Hf4+ (0.71 <U+01FA>) exhibits a
her electrochemical performance: a reversible capacity of 154 mAh g–1 was achieved for Ti0.95Hf0.05O2 after 35
cles at C/10-rate, while Zr-doped TiO2 yielded only 135 mAh g–1. What is the reason for it? Why is Zr
orporates with the maximum Zr/Ti ratio of 0.03, while Hf to Ti ratio up to 0.05 was achieved? Thus, in order to
rify the doping strategy from the point of view of Mn+ ionic radius, the detailed investigation of structural
cluding excellent XRD data), morphological, and electrochemical features of Hf-doped TiO2 was strongly
uired (This paper). Concerning book of conference proceedings (IOP Conference Series) we note that it is only
ort communication briefly described some aspects of synthesis procedure for doped TiO2 anode. At the same time,
s proceeding does not include any significant studies, which would have allowed us to avoid the further detailed
earch (This paper).

mment 2: One technical question, for Fig. 1b, it clearly shows that the material is composed of hollow
crotubes with nanowires inside. What's the material inside?
sponse 2: Thanks for this very important comment. There is not a nanowire inside the microtube in Fig. 1b. This
M-image demonstrate the open-ended microstructure of tube through which another tube (located perpendicularly
tube under test) is observed. Now we change this image as well as Fig. 1a by other one in order to clarify the
llow microstructure of tubes and to avoid the confusion among the readership community of Royal Society Open
ience journal.
