The paper proposes a deep learning framework to explore the visual cues of cityscapes and to
measure their distinctiveness. The author gather 2M photos from Panoramio and label them with
the name of the city they have been taken in (for a total of 18 cities). They then attempt a
prediction experiment by training a DCNN (initialized on ImageNet, as it is commonly done) to
predict the label of the picture from visual cues. The accuracy is ~36%, over a random baseline of
~5%. What the authors focus on is to find out which are the cities with more distinctive visual
patterns and to study the pairs of cities that are misclassified (A is classified as B and vice-versa).
They also extract images and objects that are most distinctive of a given city.
The paper is nicely written and well-grounded in the existing literature of urban science,
multimedia analysis and computer vision. However, the paper has some major limitations:
1) The contribution is quite minor, both in terms of technical advancements and in terms of
findings. The framework proposed is quite standard: classification of pictures using well-
established CNNs for classification and object detection combined with a straightforward error
analysis. I don't think there's any ground for claiming that the main contribution is "a general
framework to explore the visual cues of a place". The framework used existed already and the
authors simply apply it to a specific use case.
2) The specific use case (or, in other terms, the main idea of identifying the distinctive visual cues
of an urban space) is not novel either. Doersch et al. (correctly cited by the authors) already
explored that idea and, even without using deep-learning (which at the time was not yet a
popular and widely available tool) were able to get results that are much more granular and
meaningful than the ones presented here: for example, knowing that a certain type of balcony
gives to Paris a distinctive vibe is much more meaningful than saying that the Eiffel tower is
visually distinctive of Paris. Many others built already on top of that work by exploring the
ambiance of cities and places (indoor and outdoor), among other things -- see the work of Santani
et al., for example (https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2806277,
https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3123402, https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2967261).
3) The way in which the methodology is applied leads to results which are quite expected and, in
my opinion, are not interpreted correctly by the authors. Specifically, the authors are learning the
distinctiveness of the visual patterns of a city by looking at the panoramio photos of that city.
This type of dataset is by definition skewed towards few visual objects and landmarks: those that
are already selected by the crowd as the most interesting (/distinctive) ones. In other words,
panoramio is representative of the popular hotspots in the city. Given this training set, the
network is mainly learning to classify hotspots, it is not learning the visual distinctiveness of the
city as a whole. The results in Figure 5 could be obtained by simply showing representative
pictures of clusters of similar images within the city (using a simple visual similarity metric),
without using deep learning and without comparing cities between each other. In Paris, one
would likely obtain a cluster for the Eiffel Tower and another for Montmartre. This is because in
every city the crowd tends already to capture the most distinctive objects (e.g., red phone boots in
London). So, in the end what this framework does is mainly to surface and compare landmarks in
different cities. An alternative approach would be to use Google street view images instead. By
doing so, the work would resemble the one of Doersch et al. but with a fancier deep learning
framework on top, which would be still quite incremental, in my view.

A few other minor comments:
- "By filtering the initial dataset with a classifier" -> the authors should provide more details on
how this is done. Filtering out some categories of images can skew the findings on image
diversity even further.
- "we perform undersampling of the class with more samples" -> Toronto is the city with the
fewest pictures (58k). Does this mean that the authors are using only 58k pictures per city? This
number proably grows because of cross validation, but it would be fair to report the total number
of pictures that have been used for the classification experiment (which is probably less than 2M).
- Check typos: â<U+02D8>A<U+02C7>Tvehicles
In short, I believe that, although the paper reads nicely and the experiments yield results that are
intuitively meaningful, the novelty of the approach is insufficient and the results presented are
just as good as listing popular objects in different locations and comparing them, which is OK but
hardly novel or surprising.

This paper presents results of the study which refers to training a DCNN model with millions of
images from Panoramio. The goal of this study is to learn the visual knowledge about cities and
made an effort to explore the city-informative scenes and objects in a data-driven and machine
learning manner.
The topic of the paper is very interesting and actual. The paper is technically correct and with
content relevant to the journal readers. Results of this study are scientifically based and well
presented.
The first part of article is very well-written and clearly states the problem, covers the various
related works.

At the end of the paper, the authors listed signi<U+FB01>cance in several aspects of their research results.
The approach the authors presented is very complex. Obviously, a lot of effort has been invested
in the implementation of the proposed solution.
But, because of the complexity, many details of the proposed solution are not seen.
As authors noted in Introduction section, the goal of this study is to build a data-driven
framework to learn and compare the visual appearance of different cities. However, there are no
details about this framework. The paper describes only the method, i.e. work <U+FB02>ow divided into
three steps.

Both reviewers are generally lacking descriptions on the technicalities of the approach. One
reviewer highlights the lack of novelty with respect to a number of works and challenges the
interpretation of the results. I would like to give the authors a chance to answer these comments

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
I do acknowledge the effort of the authors in improving the paper. However, there is little
remedy to add novelty to a contribution which has very little novelty. I am fine in seeing this
paper accepted because it is technically correct but only if the authors agree on explicitly
acknowledging the limitations of their contribution. This would be done with the following two
actions:
1) The workflow is indeed better explained now, which is good. Yet, a better explanation doesn't
make it any more novel. The authors simply don't make a methodological contribution in this
space and this has to be acknowledged. Sentences like "This work makes a contribution to
learning the visual features of places by proposing a DCNN and geo-tagged images based
9
framework" and "The goal of this study is to build a data-driven framework to learn and
compare the visual appearance of different places by exploring place-informative scenes and
objects" need to be either removed or rephrased. What the authors do is to **use an existing
visual processing framework to extract distinctive visual aspects of cities** -- this has to be clearly
stated.
2) I don't think it is sufficient to cite the work of Santani and Doersch. In the related work or in
the introduction (or in any other relevant part of the manuscript) I would like to see one or two
paragraphs discussing explicitly those works, acknowledging how this paper methodologically
builds upon them and highlighting the differences.
I am sorry but I did not understand the purpose of the additional experiment reported. I would
encourage the authors to make an additional effort to motivate it better.
Regarding the application on Panoramio photos vs. other sources: the application on Panoramio
does not make the paper wrong but it limits its interestingness, in my opinion, which will be
probably reflected in a reduced impact of the manuscript in the community. That said, I am fine
with it as long as the potential limitations are mentioned.

and to measure their distinctiveness. The author gather 2M photos from Panoramio and
label them with the name of the city they have been taken in (for a total of 18 cities).
They then attempt a prediction experiment by training a DCNN (initialized on ImageNet,
as it is commonly done) to predict the label of the picture from visual cues. The accuracy
is ~36%, over a random baseline of ~5%. What the authors focus on is to find out which
are the cities with more distinctive visual patterns and to study the pairs of cities that are
misclassified (A is classified as B and vice-versa). They also extract images and objects
that are most distinctive of a given city.
The paper is nicely written and well-grounded in the existing literature of urban science,
multimedia analysis and computer vision. However, the paper has some major
limitations:
1) The contribution is quite minor, both in terms of technical advancements and in terms
of findings. The framework proposed is quite standard: classification of pictures using
well-established CNNs for classification and object detection combined with a
straightforward error analysis. I don't think there's any ground for claiming that the main
contribution is "a general framework to explore the visual cues of a place". The
framework used existed already and the authors simply apply it to a specific use case.
Thank you very much for your constructive comments. We made major revision on the manuscript
according to your comments and suggestions. In the revision, we restructured the whole manuscript,
added a new section to introduce the framework of exploring place-informative objects and scenes,
conducted a follow-up experiment to discuss the new findings about geo-bias in image database,
and added a new discussion section to highlight the findings of this work. We believe that our work
contributes to the following aspects:
1. We proposed a general data-drive framework to learn and compare the visual appearance
of different places, and explore place-informative scenes and objects comprehensively,
which can be applied to places of different types and scales, such as inter-city level,
neighborhood-level, and indoor-level. A deep convolutional neural network is used in the
framework to learn and represent the visual concepts and high-level visual knowledge of
images, which enables the framework to explore a various types of uniqueness of a place.
The framework will provide the opportunities to the research of place formalization and
place semantics, which exhibits great potential for a variety of disciplines.
2. Understanding the uniqueness of a city comprehensively is important, and the focus on
landmark as a single feature reduces the extent the research can be generalized. In the
case study, we explored the city-informative scenes and objects over 18 cities. With the
help of a DCNN model, we identify that other than landmarks, a large number of historical
architecture, religious sites, unique urban scenes, and some unusual natural landscapes
to be the most city-informative scenes. We believe that our results are of importance both
to those working in the urban management and design - in giving an complete overview of
the city features that are unique and distinct from others and develop the brand image of a
city for city development and tourism management - and also to geographers in general,
in throwing light on understanding how a place is formed and shaped for place formalization
in the process of human-place interaction.
3. A follow-up experiment was conducted the geo-bias existed in common image database.
The experiment recognize cities using concatenated image features that extracted from
scene context and scene object image separately. The accuracy of the city classification
task was improve significantly compared to the baseline experiment. We conclude that the
scene objects and scene context typically and complementary constitute a city-informative
scene. They contain different city attribute information and accordingly contribute to the
city recognition task separately. This finding has implications for improving the accuracy of
object detection and recognition task in computer vision by taking scene context
information into consideration.
The methods in this framework, for instance, ranking samples according to models confidence
score to list the most representative samples in the dataset, has been used in the field of machine
learning and computer vision applications. Nevertheless, it is still worth a try to apply this idea to a
more boarder field with a general interest, such as understanding the discrepancy, heterogeneity
and diversity of different places with different scales, which exhibits great potential for a variety of
disciplines. Hence, we propose this general framework to the field with interest of its application
comprehensively.
2) The specific use case (or, in other terms, the main idea of identifying the distinctive
visual cues of an urban space) is not novel either. Doersch et al. (correctly cited by the
authors) already explored that idea and, even without using deep-learning (which at the
time was not yet a popular and widely available tool) were able to get results that are
much more granular and meaningful than the ones presented here: for example,
knowing that a certain type of balcony gives to Paris a distinctive vibe is much more
meaningful than saying that the Eiffel tower is visually distinctive of Paris. Many others
built already on top of that work by exploring the ambiance of cities and places (indoor
and outdoor), among other things -- see the work of Santani et al., for example
(https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2806277, https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3123402,
https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2967261).
Thanks for pointing this out. Doersch et al. did an excellent work in identifying the representative
visual cues of an urban space. We take his study as our major reference but we are of different
objectives. Instead of detecting a landmark of cities and discovering local discriminative patches,
our work aims at analyzing the city identity of various types. Actually, as the Figure (a) shown below,
our model explored not only landmarks, but also historical architecture, religious sites, unique urban
scenes, interesting objects, and unusual natural landscapes. A single type of landmark and
architecture cannot represent the urban identity comprehensively and the symbol of a city should
be diverse and various to make it attracting, active, and vital (Lynch, 1960; Jacobs, 1992). This
result will give an urban designer or urban decision maker a more comprehensive picture to
understand the uniqueness of a city compared to others. Doersch et al.s work first obtained millions
of image patches and employed HOG+color descriptor for clustering and classification. Their
method has advantage in exploring details of architectures and buildings, remain difficulty in
understanding the overall aesthetic, cultural and historical style of a cityscape or streetscape.
Thanks for suggesting the works from Santani et al., the method used and the problem identified
are very inspiring to our study and we have added their works to this manuscript as our reference.

natural landscapes are identified in the experiment.
3) The way in which the methodology is applied leads to results which are quite
expected and, in my opinion, are not interpreted correctly by the authors. Specifically,
the authors are learning the distinctiveness of the visual patterns of a city by looking at
the panoramio photos of that city. This type of dataset is by definition skewed towards
few visual objects and landmarks: those that are already selected by the crowd as the
most interesting (/distinctive) ones. In other words, panoramio is representative of the
popular hotspots in the city. Given this training set, the network is mainly learning to
classify hotspots, it is not learning the visual distinctiveness of the city as a whole. The
results in Figure 5 could be obtained by simply showing representative pictures of
clusters of similar images within the city (using a simple visual similarity metric), without
using deep learning and without comparing cities between each other. In Paris, one
would likely obtain a cluster for the Eiffel Tower and another for Montmartre. This is
because in every city the crowd tends already to capture the most distinctive objects
(e.g., red phone boots in London). So, in the end what this framework does is mainly to
surface and compare landmarks in different cities. An alternative approach would be to
use Google street view images instead. By doing so, the work would resemble the one
of Doersch et al. but with a fancier deep learning framework on top, which would be still
quite incremental, in my view.
Thanks for your constructive comments and suggestions. We totally agree with you that the
Panoramio dataset is skewed and biased, and the representative of this data source for the visual
environment of a city is still need to be discussed, just like almost all of the crowdsourcing data.
From another perspective, Panoramio is an appropriate choice in terms of exploring the unique
objects and scenes of a city. People took pictures because the scenes being in front of them are
beautiful, unique, interesting, or different from other places. If people believe a scene to be boring
and normal, they will rarely want to take a picture and upload to Panoramio. Hence, we believe that
biased or not biased of a dataset depends on what research problems we want to address. We
are agree with you that Panoramio is representative of the popular hotspots in the city, we can
believe that the places in these hotspots are exactly the places we want to focus on, which contains
the most unique scenes in the city. Nevertheless, we still need to focus on how to learn the concepts
and visual features by a model to explore the real significant unique scenes and objects because
there are a lot of noise in the social media dataset. Images from Google Street View are taken on
roads where the Google vehicle can go, so the content of these images is limited. For instance, we
would have difficulty in seeing the scenes shown in Figure (a) from GSV, so we can hardly observe
the scenes like in our findings by using GSV data. In our manuscript, we have added a discussion
on different data sources in the framework section. In conclusion, your suggestions are very
valuable for us and we will consider using images both from the social media and street view
images in our future study.
Doersch et al.s work focuses on exploring the architectural details through local discriminative
patches and proposes an ingenious workflow. Our study focuses on a different scale of the
uniqueness. It will be of significance to observing the spatial distribution of the uniqueness of
different types - historical architecture, religious sites, unique urban scenes and unusual natural
landscapes, which would help urban designers to understand the connections between visual
features and the culture, geography, and historical evolutions of a city, and to develop the brand
image of a city in terms of city development and tourism management.
In terms of clustering vs deep learning, we believe that Figure 5 is hard to be obtained by clustering
with a simple visual similarity metric without deep learning.
On one hand, in Figure 5 we show not only landmarks, but also, historical architecture, religious
sites, unique urban scenes, and unusual natural landscapes of each city. These scenes are hardly
obtained by simply clustering the images with low/mid-level features, such as HOG+color descriptor
used in Doersch et al.s work, because the scenes are complex visual concept and of cultural and
historical styles of places. A deep convolutional neural network is exactly used to model and learn
the concepts and high-level representation of an image and even perform some of high-level
cognitive tasks like human, which will make a difference in our case.
On the other hand, simply clustering will have difficult in handling the images of great diversity and
noise (as Figure (b) shows). A great deal of images with similar low/mid level visual features would
be clustered together, but they are not place-informative. A CNN is always compared with
conventional low/mid-level image features, such as GIST, SIFT, and HOG several years ago. It is
just like one paper you recommended (https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2967261). Over these 2-
3 years, works in computer vision field compare the performance among different CNN models
instead of conventional image features, because a CNN model will usually outperform them to a
large extent.

- "By filtering the initial dataset with a classifier" -> the authors should provide more
details on how this is done. Filtering out some categories of images can skew the
findings on image diversity even further.
Thanks for your comments. We have added more detailed descriptions on noise image filtering in
the revision as your request. In our case, we filter the initial dataset with a DCNN based classifier.
As the Figure (c) shows, we note that the photo types are of great variety, not only including the
outdoor scenes with different scales but also containing indoor scenes, objects (e.g. an apple) and
artificial images (e.g. a logo). In order to remove these non-place relevant images, we trained a
binary-classification model to predict if an image to be an outdoor scene image or not. We
organized the training dataset with image samples from Caltech 101 (a dataset contains object
images) (Li et al. 2007) and Places2 (Zhou et al. 2017) (a dataset contains indoor scenes and
outdoor scenes). We then trained an SVM classifier with Places2 image features and achieved an
accuracy of 97.94%. By filtering the initial dataset with the classifier, 2,084,117 photos were
obtained for the experiments.
Only indoor images, objects and artificial images are removed from the initial dataset, and we
believe this operation will not skew the findings. Thanks for pointing this issue out, we have added
this in the manuscript.

objects and logo, which are non-urban images
A few other minor comments:
- "we perform undersampling of the class with more samples" -> Toronto is the city with
the fewest pictures (58k). Does this mean that the authors are using only 58k pictures
per city? This number proably grows because of cross validation, but it would be fair to
report the total number of pictures that have been used for the classification experiment
(which is probably less than 2M).
Thanks for your reminder. We made a mistake in describing this process. In our finial trial of
experiment, we apply weights to each categories to address the imbalanced issue. The weights
¯
<U+0001D441>
can be calculated by: , where <U+0001D441> ¯ is the average number of samples of all cities, and <U+0001D441><U+0001D456> is the
<U+0001D441><U+0001D456>
number of samples of the <U+0001D456> <U+0001D461>h (i <U+2208> [1,18]) city.

Reviewer 2
This paper presents results of the study which refers to training a DCNN model with
millions of images from Panoramio. The goal of this study is to learn the visual
knowledge about cities and made an effort to explore the city-informative scenes and
objects in a data-driven and machine learning manner.
The topic of the paper is very interesting and actual. The paper is technically correct and
with content relevant to the journal readers. Results of this study are scientifically based
and well presented.
The first part of article is very well-written and clearly states the problem, covers the
various related works.
At the end of the paper, the authors listed signi<U+FB01>cance in several aspects of their
research results.
The approach the authors presented is very complex. Obviously, a lot of effort has been
invested in the implementation of the proposed solution.
But, because of the complexity, many details of the proposed solution are not seen.
As authors noted in Introduction section, the goal of this study is to build a data-driven
framework to learn and compare the visual appearance of different cities. However,
there are no details about this framework. The paper describes only the method, i.e.
work <U+FB02>ow divided into three steps.
We appreciate the positive comments on our manuscript and thanks for these constructive
suggestions. In the revision, we restructured the whole manuscript, added a new section to
introduce the framework of exploring place-informative objects and scenes, conducted a follow-up
experiment to discuss the new findings about geo-bias in image database, and added a new
discussion section to highlight the findings of this work.
We paid more attention to the description of methodology, balancing the detail and abstraction to
make the article available for readers with corresponding interest. Moreover, we add a new section
in the revision to introduce the proposed general data-driven framework of exploring place-
informative objects and scenes from images.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Cecilia Mascolo):
There are still a number of presentation issue related to how the work is positioned and
how the additional evaluation is described which need fixing. I will check that the authors
have fixed this before the paper can be accepted.

Comments to the Author(s)
I do acknowledge the effort of the authors in improving the paper. However, there is little
remedy to add novelty to a contribution which has very little novelty. I am fine in seeing
this paper accepted because it is technically correct but only if the authors agree on
explicitly acknowledging the limitations of their contribution. This would be done with the
following two actions:
1) The workflow is indeed better explained now, which is good. Yet, a better explanation
doesn't make it any more novel. The authors simply don't make a methodological
contribution in this space and this has to be acknowledged. Sentences like "This work
makes a contribution to learning the visual features of places by proposing a DCNN and
geo-tagged images based framework" and "The goal of this study is to build a data-
driven framework to learn and compare the visual appearance of different places by
exploring place-informative scenes and objects" need to be either removed or
rephrased. What the authors do is to **use an existing visual processing framework to
extract distinctive visual aspects of cities** -- this has to be clearly stated.
Thanks for the reviewers comments. We have rephrased the relevant presentation in
the introduction section, namely:
1. From This work makes a contribution to learning the visual features of places by
proposing a DCNN and geo-tagged images based framework,
To This work makes a contribution to learning the visual features of places with a
DCNN and geo-tagged images based method built upon previous studies.
2. From The goal of this study is to build a data-driven framework to learn and
compare the visual appearance of different places by exploring place-informative
scenes and objects,
To The goal of this study is to extract distinctive visual aspect of places by
exploring place-informative scenes and objects.
2) I don't think it is sufficient to cite the work of Santani and Doersch. In the related work
or in the introduction (or in any other relevant part of the manuscript) I would like to see
one or two paragraphs discussing explicitly those works, acknowledging how this paper
methodologically builds upon them and highlighting the differences.
Thanks for the reminder. We have added a detailed description in the introduction
section on the works that are most relevant to this study. Details are shown below:
Similar works have been done in recognizing geo-locations [26-28], detecting
landmarks [11, 12, 29-31], examining ambiance perceptions [32, 33], and
identifying urban identities [4, 5, 34].
The work closest to ours are Doersch (2012) and Zhou (2014). Doersch (2012)
proposed a framework based on discriminative clustering to discover the clusters
of local image patches that make a city distinct. These patch clusters reflect very
local cues about the urban properties, such as windows style or building textures,
while our work focus on higher-level concepts such as scenes and objects. Zhou
(2014) only analyzed distinct scenes across cities using a scene classification
framework, while our work unifies the analysis of scenes and objects.
I am sorry but I did not understand the purpose of the additional experiment reported. I
would encourage the authors to make an additional effort to motivate it better.
Thanks for pointing this out. The additional experiment in the discussion section is about
the way to increase the accuracy of city recognition task. Since the experiment is not
quite relevant to either learning place-informative scenes and objects or measuring
place distinctiveness and similarity, which is the main topic of this paper, after our
careful consideration, we decide to remove this irrelevant discussion.
Regarding the application on Panoramio photos vs. other sources: the application on
Panoramio does not make the paper wrong but it limits its interestingness, in my opinion,
which will be probably reflected in a reduced impact of the manuscript in the community.
That said, I am fine with it as long as the potential limitations are mentioned.
Thanks for the reviewers suggestion. In the revision, we added a subsection to discuss
the potential limitation of this study. Details are shown below:
The performance of the proposed framework depends largely on the
representativeness of the data source used. Crowd-sourced data is always
biased towards a group of people that generates the data. For instance, the
Panoramio dataset used in this study are mainly contributed by tourists and
photographers, who will have a different perspective of a city's visual feature from
the local residents. A single data source is therefore difficult describing the
objective visual aspects of a city. Future studies are expected to integrate
multiple data sources, e.g., Google Street View imagery, to represent the place
comprehensively.
