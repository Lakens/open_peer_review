This is a polemical piece, with somewhat exaggerated and non-scientific arguments about a 'post-
truth' society - eg trust in scientists remains extremely high. But I don't mind about that as it is
clearly an opinion piece, and I agree with its opinion that science should put its own house in
order, particularly by recognising that distortions and exaggerations occur in the literature not
through the obvious financial conflicts, but through scientists advancing their reputations and
personal agendas.
As an polemical opinion piece, I like the paper, but I have no idea if this is what the journal
wants.

This paper deals with a critical issue for society, as well as for society. However, as currently
written it ends much too weakly, in two respects:
1). Although elsewhere the critical importance of new ways of communicating through social
media is emphasized, this point is completely ignored in the recommendations for scientists to
"speak out". The authors may not be active on social media themselves, being of an older
generation. If so, I suggest that they consult with their younger colleagues in order to add
specific suggestions for how scientists should get engaged with new communications tools, in
order not to become increasingly invisible to most of society.
3
2). More surprisingly, the advice for scientists in the last "A Way Forward" is much too brief,
lacking the type of specificity one would expect from the authors, each of whom should have
specific ideas based on their nation's experiences. For example, how are the leading scientists in
India trying to confront that nation's serious problems with new journals? Can such information
and experiences be generalized to make suggestions for other nations?

Dear Dr Matlin:
Title: Fake science and the knowledge crisis: Ignorance can be fatal
Manuscript ID: RSOS-190161
Thank you for submitting the above manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. On behalf of the
Editors and the Royal Society of Chemistry, I am pleased to inform you that your manuscript will
be accepted for publication in Royal Society Open Science subject to minor revision in accordance
with the referee suggestions. Please find the reviewers' comments at the end of this email.
The reviewers and handling editors have recommended publication, but also suggest some minor
revisions to your manuscript. We have considered the points raised by Reviewer 1 and are
satisfied that this type of perspective is suitable for the journal. Therefore, I invite you to respond
to the comments (in particular, those of Reviewer 2) and revise your manuscript.
Because the schedule for publication is very tight, it is a condition of publication that you submit

will expire at 00.00am on this date. If you do not think you will be able to meet this date please let
me know immediately.
To revise your manuscript, log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rsos and enter your
Author Centre, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with
Decisions". Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." You will be unable to make your
revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript
and upload a new version through your Author Centre.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by
the referees and upload a file "Response to Referees" in "Section 6 - File Upload". You can use this
to document any changes you make to the original manuscript. In order to expedite the
processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the
referees.
When uploading your revised files please make sure that you have:
1) A text file of the manuscript (tex, txt, rtf, docx or doc), references, tables (including captions)
and figure captions. Do not upload a PDF as your "Main Document".
2) A separate electronic file of each figure (EPS or print-quality PDF preferred (either format
should be produced directly from original creation package), or original software format)
3) Included a 100 word media summary of your paper when requested at submission. Please
ensure you have entered correct contact details (email, institution and telephone) in your user
account
4
4) Included the raw data to support the claims made in your paper. You can either include your
data as electronic supplementary material or upload to a repository and include the relevant doi
within your manuscript
5) All supplementary materials accompanying an accepted article will be treated as in their final
form. Note that the Royal Society will neither edit nor typeset supplementary material and it will
be hosted as provided. Please ensure that the supplementary material includes the paper details
where possible (authors, article title, journal name).
Supplementary files will be published alongside the paper on the journal website and posted on
the online figshare repository (https://figshare.com). The heading and legend provided for each
supplementary file during the submission process will be used to create the figshare page, so
please ensure these are accurate and informative so that your files can be found in searches. Files
on figshare will be made available approximately one week before the accompanying article so
that the supplementary material can be attributed a unique DOI.
Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to Royal Society Open Science. The
chemistry content of Royal Society Open Science is published in collaboration with the Royal
Society of Chemistry. I look forward to receiving your revision. If you have any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Appendix A
ResponseToReviewers2019a
We are delighted that the reviewers and handling editors have recommended
publication and greatly appreciate the reviewers’ comments.
We thank Reviewer 2 for specific suggestions of ways to strengthen the paper, in
particular by adding specific ideas for how scientists should get engaged with new
communications tools, and by expanding the "Way Forward" section at the end and
giving examples of how scientists, including in India, are confronting problems.
Response:
The final section, re-titled "Ways Forward" (title highlighted in yellow) has been
completely re-written and substantially expanded, with a detailed discussion of how
scientists can help to address both fake news in society and fake science, including
through engaging with new communications tools. Examples of initiatives from a
number of countries, including India, are cited in a significantly expanded reference
list.
An additional sentence has been added to the Summary to reflect these changes and
small modifications in other sections, including some additional insertions of recent
literature, are highlighted in yellow in the revised text and reference list. In particular
(p4) a short addition addresses the variability of public attitudes to scientists and
‘experts’.
