The manuscript deals with the complex scenario of heat transfer of falling film evaporator with
phase change on both the sides. The authors have developed heat transfer correlation for the
evaporation within inner tube and condensation for the annular outside tube and fitted it via
numerical simulation. Subsequently experiments were conducted using saturated ethanol-water
mixture in the tube-side, to be heated through saturated water vapor in the outer annular section.
Results obtained are encouraging as evident from Figs 8 to 11 of the manuscript.
Literature search is reasonably exhaustive where classical references as well as recent important
publications are duly quoted. However following points need to be addressed for betterment of
the manuscript:
1. Its better to use the standard symbols like "t" for time and "T" for temperature to reduce chance
of confusion.
2. Similarly, most of the scientific literature uses "k" as the thermal conductivity and the symbol
used in manuscript "<U+03BB><sub>w</sub>" generally refers latent heat in standard literature.
3. It is reported that the maximum error between theoretical prediction and experimentally
observed findings are within 18%. It will be appropriate to have some comparative account of the
experimental observation with other theoretical models available in the open literature in order to
judge performance of the developed model.
4. Authors have considered modeling of the liquid film using the 2D Cartesian coordinate system,
however the geometry of falling film evaporator clearly indicates it would be appropriate to
consider 3-dimensional polar coordinates.

In this manuscript, the authors studied the heat transfer of falling film evaporation. Temperature
distributions were calculated by empirical heat transfer equations. The heat transfer coefficients
were estimated accordingly, and the relationship between the coefficients and Reynolds number
and Prandtl number was built via correlation.
Finally, experiments were conducted where mixture of ethanol and water at different ratios
flowed downward inside of the evaporator under various pressure. The measured heat transfer
amounts was comparable to the values calculated from the model, which further supports the
author's theoretical analysis. This work provides valuable information for a common scenario
(water-ethanol separation), and the developed correlations would serve as a good reference for
people in the field. I recommend acceptance of this work for publication once the following issues
being addressed.
1. Some English grammars should be corrected. For example,
Page 1, line 31, "have great significance" should be changed to "has great significance"
2. On Page 3, equation 7, please define lamda
3. When listing the equations of temperature distribution, the authors used "t" to represent
temperature. Normally "T" is commonly used character to represent temperature.
4. On Page 3, last sentence, "Equation 8 can be...." should be changed to "Equation 9 can be....".
5. The numerical values of boundary conditions should be provided.
6. In Figure 8 - 11, I suggest using an identical range on all Y axis in order to visualize the change
of heat transfer quantity under different conditions. Also, the authors should dig more info out of
their data. For example, the heat transfer quantity varies with experimental conditions, what is
the mechanism behind this observation?

Appendix A
List of Responses
Dear Editors and Reviewers:
Thank you very much for your letter and for the reviewers’ comments
concerning our manuscript entitled “Establishment of the Falling Film Evaporation
Model and Correlation of the Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient” (ID: RSOS-190135).
Those comments are all valuable and very helpful for revising and improving our
paper, as well as the important guiding significance to our researches. We have
studied comments carefully and have made correction which we hope meet with
approval. Revised portion is marked in red in the paper. The main corrections in the
paper and the responds to the reviewer’s comments are as flowing:
Responds to the reviewer’s comments:
Reviewer 1:
1. Response to comment: Its better to use the standard symbols like "t" for time and
"T" for temperature to reduce chance of confusion.
Response: We changed all the temperature symbols to "T".
2. Response to comment: Similarly, most of the scientific literature uses "k" as the
thermal conductivity and the symbol used in manuscript "<U+03BB>w" generally refers latent
heat in standard literature.
Response: We changed all the thermal conductivity symbols to "k".
3. Response to comment:It is reported that the maximum error between theoretical
prediction and experimentally observed findings are within 18%. It will be
appropriate to have some comparative account of the experimental observation with
other theoretical models available in the open literature in order to judge performance
of the developed model.
Response: We have made correction according to the Reviewer’s comments. We
compared the theoretical models obtained by previous researchers.
4. Response to comment: Authors have considered modeling of the liquid film using
the 2D Cartesian coordinate system, however the geometry of falling film evaporator
clearly indicates it would be appropriate to consider 3-dimensional polar coordinates.
Response: First of all, thanks to the reviewer’s suggestion, we studied the falling film
heat transfer coefficient in a vertical smooth tube, 3D vertical tube is axisymmetric,
the circumferential parameter has little effect on the falling film process and can be
ignored. So we simplifying the falling film process appropriately, and the simplified
model calculation value is not much different from the experimental results. In the
process of research, we will analyze the differences between 3D modeling and 2D
modeling and their respective advantages in the subsequent study.
Special thanks to you for your good comments.
Reviewer 2:
1. Response to comment: Some English grammars should be corrected. For example,
Page 1, line 31, "have great significance" should be changed to "has great
significance"
Response: We changed "have great significance" to"has great significance". And we
found someone whose native language is English to help with the revision of the
manuscript and to amend the question you asked.
2. Response to comment: On Page 3, equation 7, please define lamda
Response: According to the opinions of the first reviewer, We changed all the thermal
conductivity symbols to "k". On Page 3, equation 7, ko is the thermal conductivity of
condensate.
3. Response to comment: When listing the equations of temperature distribution, the
authors used "t" to represent temperature. Normally "T" is commonly used character
to represent temperature.
Response: We changed all the temperature symbols to "T".
4. Response to comment: On Page 3, last sentence, "Equation 8 can be...." should be
changed to "Equation 9 can be....".
Response: We are very sorry for our incorrect writing. We changed "Equation 8 can
be...." to "Equation 9 can be....".
5. Response to comment: The numerical values of boundary conditions should be
provided.
Response: We have made correction according to the Reviewer’s comments. We have
provided all the numerical values of boundary conditions.
6. Response to comment: In Figure 8 - 11, I suggest using an identical range on all Y
axis in order to visualize the change of heat transfer quantity under different
conditions. Also, the authors should dig more info out of their data. For example, the
heat transfer quantity varies with experimental conditions, what is the mechanism
behind this observation?
Response: We have made correction according to the Reviewer’s comments. We dig
more info out of our data.
Special thanks to you for your good comments.
We tried our best to improve the manuscript and made some changes in the
manuscript. These changes will not influence the content and framework of the paper.
And here we did not list the changes but marked in red in the revised paper.
We appreciate for Editors/Reviewers’ warm work earnestly and hope that the
correction will meet with approval.
Once again, thank you very much for your comments and suggestions.
