This paper makes a significant observation about salinity tolerance in aquatic insect insects,
specifically about the Ephemeroptera. However, by focusing only on osmoregulation, the
authors miss another important point, for which there is some data available in the physiology
literature. At same time that the mayflies are osmoregulating, they are also ionoregulating by
controlling the concentrations of individual major ions, such as potassium, calcium, magnesium,
bicarbonate, hydrogen and possibly sulfate in their cytoplasm and hemolymph in addition to
sodium and chloride. So part of the explanation of their results that is not mentioned in the
Discussion, may lie in the concentrations of these ions in the hemolymph and in both the
acclimation water and the test waters.
While it is relatively difficult to measure individual ion concentrations in the hemolymph of these
relatively small animals, many related recent papers have reported the pH and other ion
concentrations of the acclimation water – the treated Sydney tap water – and the test waters with
increasing salts – here supplied by the addition of synthetic marine salts. Can the authors do
more to characterize these water ion concentrations. Also, can the authors also characterize the
salinity of the Hunter River in terms of these individual major ions.
Several more specific comments follow:

Title: The mayfly nymph Austrophlebioides pusillus Harker defies common osmoregulatory
assumptions
3
I like this paper. I thought it was well-designed and implemented. The writing was clear and I
was curious and engaged throughout the paper. The study very nicely illustrated, for at least this
mayfly, that the ionic concentration of haemolymph (measured as osmolality) is maintained
while they are alive. It also showed that ionic and osmotic regulation in this mayfly is tightly
controlled and this mayfly is not an osmoconformer even under severe ionic stress. The results
suggest that mortality from ionic stress in NaCl-dominated water is due to a rather abrupt
discontinuity in iono-regulation or pH regulation for this mayfly.
Osmoregulation, ionoregulation, and pH-regulation are tightly coupled physiological processes.
So, it is a bit of a stretch to say that this mayfly has defied “common osmoregulatory
assumptions.” Indeed less experienced people may assume that it is all about too much or too
little water, and that death means that water or ion concentration would be measurable under
stress. However, this is not necessarily true and very small changes can cause death. Perhaps it
would be more accurate to entitle the paper: “Prior to ionic stress induced lethality, the mayfly
nymph Austrophlebioides pusillus Harker maintains osmoregulatory function.” Not as catchy,
but more accurate.
I appreciated the discussion especially in terms of the rather thin amount of research in insect
ionoregulation. Needless to say mosquitos are not the best model for ionoregulation of mayflies.
I recommend consulting and adding a review on ionoregulation that has recently come out,
probably prior to submission.

Response to Reviewers' comments
We thank the reviewers for their comments that improved our MS. We have numbered each reviewers
comment in our response, in the order which the reviewer made their comment. Line, page, table and
figure numbers refer to those given by the reviewers (in the originally submitted MS) and may not
correspond to the now revised MS. Reviewer suggested additions and edits of the text are provided
below.
Reviewer 1
Comment 1:
While it is relatively difficult to measure individual ion concentrations in the hemolymph of these
relatively small animals, many related recent papers have reported the pH and other ion concentrations
of the acclimation water – the treated Sydney tap water – and the test waters with increasing salts –
here supplied by the addition of synthetic marine salts. Can the authors do more to characterize these
water ion concentrations. Also, can the authors also characterize the salinity of the Hunter River in terms
of these individual major ions.
Author comments: We now report pH measurements and references to research papers that contain
ionic characterization of the test waters. pH is addressed on page 6 line 122, pH was measured daily and
ranged from 7.75 to 7.93 in control aquaria, 7.68 to 7.99 in 1 g/L SMS, 7.76 to 7.94 in 2 g/L SMS, and
7.83 to 7.98 in 4 g/L SMS; page 7 line 156, pH was measured daily and ranged from 7.96 to 8.03 in the
treatment aquaria. A note on pH measurements is not included in the tests where osmoregulation was
not measured.
Test water ionic composition has been addressed by the addition to the following in the Materials and
Methods section (page 5 line 94), “Three series of experiments were conducted, exposing A. pusillus to
increasing concentrations of synthetic marine salt (SMS; for measured ionic proportions of Ocean Nature
see Zalizniak et al. 2006, Sauer et al. 2016) (Ocean Nature, Aquasonic, Wauchope, NSW) …”
Although we did not analyse water samples for major ions from Moonan Flat (the collection site), salinity
in the Hunter River catchment includes ionic composition similar to sea water (Krogh et al. 2013) and
this was noted in the Methods (page 4 line 86). We do have ionic analysis of the waters from a nearby,
downstream tributary (Rouchel Brook). We feel that the relevance of including the Rouchel Brook data is
questionable, but will do so if requested by the editors.
Comment 2:
Page 2, Line 27 and Figure 1 and elsewhere: What are the complete units for the 96 hour LC10, LC50
and LC99, for the X-axis in Figure 2 and elsewhere where the units are reported at g/L? Was it g NaCl/L
or g total salts/L? This needs to be more clear.
Author comments: g/L has been amended to read g/L added synthetic marine salt or g/L SMS in the
following places – page 2 line 27; page 8 lines 166, 168, 176; page 9 lines 187; 188; 198; 202; page 10
line 187; page 11 line 233; page 12 line 277; Table 1; Figure titles 2, 3, 4, 5.
Comment 3:
Page 4, Line 84 and elsewhere: Often electrical conductivity in other freshwater papers has been
reported in µS/cm.
Author comment: We acknowledge that electrical conductivity has been reported in µS/cm. However,
there is no standard convention for reporting electrical conductivity in freshwater research and it is
common for freshwater salinisation researchers reporting in mS/cm (for example see Dunlop et al. 2007,
Horrigan et al. 2007, Mohammed & Agard 2007, Kefford et al. 2011, Kefford et al. 2012). Given this we
would prefer to report in mS/cm as values such as 28.4 mS/cm are more compact than 28400 µS/cm
and the latter implies higher precision of measurements than can be realistically claimed.
Reviewer 2
Comment 1:
Austrophlebioides pusillus Harker maintains osmoregulatory function.”
Author comments: Reviewer 2 suggests that the above title may be a more accurate reflection of the
research. However, we are reluctant to make this change because we are not sure that the mayfly
nymphs are dying from ionic stress as the above title implies. Reviewer 2 acknowledges that there are
competing explanations as to why the animals are dying, and indeed, we suspect that gill damage may
be the problem Komnick et al. 1972). Consequently, we have not altered the title, but will reconsider at
the editors’ request.

Comment 3:

Author comment: Manuscript corrected and now reads “However through a series of experiments

Comment 4:
Page 3, line 47. Large volumes of water do not enter the body though osmosis. In general, external
surfaces are impervious to gain or loss of water throughout the animal kingdom. This is an
oversimplification….perhaps the defied assumption of toxicologists. Delete the sentence or correct the
statement.
Author comments: This sentence has been altered to read “Firstly, large volumes of water enter the
body. For freshwater insects this occurs via drinking (Sutcliffe 1962) and/or cuticular permeability
(Sanguinetti 1980, Bradley 2009).”
Comment 5:
Page 7, lines 157-158. Does it need a comma? Or tense correction? Or the “two” is in the wrong place.
Please clarify or correct.
Author comment: A comma was inserted as follows, “For the Series 2 experiments, two factor analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare treatments (SPSS Statistics 17.0) using the data variables
haemolymph osmolality, treatment and time …”
Comment 6:
Page 11 lines 233-235. Maybe an overstatement. It may be that the ionic changes occur suddenly not
when the haemolymph was measured. It could also be that small changes in ionic/osmolality have
severe effects and are not detected by the sampling method. Maybe add other potential related
mechanisms, ion concentration, pH, membrane integrity…etc.
Author comments: This reviewer suggests two mechanisms; sudden rises in osmolality and change in
the ionic composition, which we will deal with separately. While it may appear possible that the
haemolymph suddenly increases in osmolality prior to death from increased salinity, this would appear
unlikely for two reasons. Firstly, despite making approximately 1300 measures of the osmolality of the
haemolymph of Austrophlebioides pusillus, we did not record a single measurement which was
substantially elevated. It is highly unlikely that we would have missed a sudden rise in osmolality, if it
were occurring. Secondly, there is no reason to expect that the osmolality of the haemolymph of A.
pusillus should rise in the treatments used in the current study. In all cases where osmolality was
measured, the external osmolality was less than the internal osmolality and thus we would not expect A.
pusillus to be under osmotic stress.
This reviewer is correct in that it is quite plausible that the mortality of A. pusillus were due to changes
its internal ionic composition or pH or membrane integrity. And we have added the following to the
internal pH or membrane integrity without the breakdown of osmoregulation. In the absence of data on
such phenomena we will not speculate further.” (page 10 line 227), and “While we did not measure
individual ions, mortality could have been caused by a change in the regulation of single ions (Sutcliffe
1961, Sutcliff 1967, Griffith 2016)”. (page 12 line 265) As we have no data on such mechanisms we
would prefer not to speculate on them further.
