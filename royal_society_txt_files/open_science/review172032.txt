This manuscript is well written and was an interesting read. I have only a few minor suggestions,
detailed below, to improve the ms and bring it in line with the requirements for RSOS.
Abstract:
Page 2, Line 10: Define B.P. here to help the reader?
Page 2, Line 10: Here, and in several other places in the ms (e.g. Page 2, Line 22; Page 3, Line 8)
you use the singular 'pair' when you should use the plural 'pairs'. I'd suggest a global check of
this throughout the ms.
Page 2, Line 15: I'd suggest 'access for breeding penguins' rather than 'access by', but maybe this
preference is an Anglicism?
Introduction:
Page 2, line 52: Give a brief definition of polynya here, to help the reader unfamiliar with the
polar world? E.g. 'polynyas (areas of open water surrounded by sea ice)...'
Page 3, line 6, 8 and 10: Here you use 'nesting pairs' and in the abstract 'breeding pairs'. Either is
fine, but you might want to use one term consistently.
Methods:
Page 4, line 47: Could you briefly explain here why or when the two different test pits (1x1 m and
0.5x0.5 m) were used? Also, no unit was given - are these in metres?
Results:
Page 7, line 49 and Page 8, line 6: The degrees of freedom for the ANOVA are missing from the
test statistics. They should be given as a subscript on the F to meet RSOS's requirements.
Discussion:
Page 10, first paragraph: When discussing the stable isotope results, I think you ought to note two
caveats with your results.
First, analysis of egg-shells indicates the diet of females during the pre-laying period (i.e. when
they are building body reserves ready to lay eggs). During this period, it is conceivable that they
could be foraging well away from their breeding colonies, and possibly outside of the Ross Sea.
And, these results are thus not directly comparable to all of those that you cite, for example --
Lyver et al. 2011. I think this just needs to be acknowledged and noted. Also, if there are studies
that show that the female penguins still partition up their foraging areas by colony during the
pre-laying period, you could note this and cite those studies.
Secondly, your sample sizes for the stable isotope analysis are pretty small, particularly given
that they are based on egg-shells so are non-invasive. This is not necessarily a major concern,
since your results confirm what is known from other studies, but I'd suggest you acknowledge it
as a caveat of the study.

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
This is an interesting paper that relies on fossil records to provide support for the hypothesis that
one of our largest Adélie penguin breeding colonies in west Antarctica was at one point,
substantially bigger than it is today. Considering the idea that Cape Adare might have had
~500,000 breeding pairs is an interesting thought-exercise particularly when you consider both
the current population at Cape Adare (about ½ the historical estimates) and the current growth at
the medium and large penguin colonies on Ross Island that have occurred in the last 10 years
(Lyver et al. 2014). However, I have some concerns about the strength of your conclusions given
they are based on inferences about the geologic history of nesting habitat use at Cape Adare
along a single, perpendicular transect involving only 9 samples. In addition, while you
acknowledge that you don’t really know what conditions would have caused the large increase,
and then subsequent decrease in the Cape Adare breeding population in the last 2000 years, you
make a very strong statement about predicted changes in the next “few decades”. I don’t believe
the data you have presented allows for such certainty, particularly given the Adelie penguin life
history strategy (K-selected) and what we do know about their demographics under both
“typical” as well as difficult or environmental conditions.
Please see specific comments and questions as follows:
1) Pg. 5, line 14-16: It’s confusing to end this sentence with “…..for a total of nine sites” since what
you’ve detailed here are only 5 of the 9 sites, with the other 4 coming from the Ridley Beach
4
mounds that are discussed in the next paragraph. I would suggest ending sentence at
“…excavated in 2016.”
2) Pg. 7, Line 15: Shouldn’t this be “…… tissues collected in 2005 and 2016…..” rather than
“…and 2017”?
3) Pg. 8, 1st paragraph of discussion: Can you really say with such certainty what the exact
historic colonization pattern was of this ~1.6 km2 (Ridley beach + terrace?) breeding colony with
just your 9 samples transect from the beach up the slope? Certainly one hypothesis for the dates
you observed is what you’ve laid out, but saying that “Ridley Beach was completely occupied by
~1200 BP…..” seems like a very strong statement based on 4 samples, particularly when one was
dated at 790 yrs B.P.
4) We don’t really know very much about the dynamics of sub-colonies within the larger penguin
breeding colonies to say for sure how sub-colony size and density affects colonization of
“unused” space.
5) Pg. 9, Line 43-45: So why wasn’t the “upper terrace” colonized first (prior to 2000 yrs B.P.)
relative to Ridley Beach (assuming it was “ice-free” as you suggest).
6) Pg. 10, 1st paragraph: It’s not clear to me what the point of this paragraph is relative to your
findings. Is this discussion of current diet patterns at Hallett, Adare and the Ross Island colonies
supposed to provide some sort of mechanism/explanation for why the Cape Adare colony was
much bigger than it is today? i.e., ~500,000 breeding pairs by ~1200 B.P.? If so, how do current
food resources (types of food and most relevant – amount) relate to conditions ~1200 yr. B.P. that
might have supported such a large colony at Adare?
7) Pg. 10, Line 54: “…….and continuing impacts over time could result in colony decline or
abandonment.” Sure, on the surface this is a true statement, but I think you must be very clear
about what you mean in terms of “time”. In this statement I think you mean “geologic” time
(100’s or 1000’s of years) because this kind of population change when you’re considering a
colony of >1m birds (500,000 breeding pairs) would take multiple penguin generations (20+years)
to occur given the level of habitat disturbance so far discussed (see below).
8) Pg. 11, Line 24-26: “We believe that the penguin colony at Cape Adare is thus highly
endangered and likely will be abandoned by breeding penguins within the next few decades due
to sea level rise and increased impacts of storms and storm surges on nesting penguins.”
9) This is a really strong statement that is not supported by your data, or general Adélie penguin
ecology and demographics. I am most concerned about the reference to this sort of breeding
colony loss occurring “within a few decades” as even given ongoing climate change issues
reported demographic responses of Adelie penguins from don’t support this rapid rate of change
for such a large breeding population (see Ross Island literature: Lescroel et al. 2009, Ballard et al
2010, Dugger et al. 2010, 2014, Lyver et al. 2014).
Based on what you have presented previously in this paper, I think what you might be able to say
is that with predicted sea level rise, the spatial distribution of the current Cp. Adare breeding
colony is likely to change. Birds are currently nesting only on “Ridley Beach”, but given they
have used the “upper terrace” in the past, then isn’t it likely that the first thing that will happen if
the beach (or parts of it) become unusable is that they will move upslope? Thus, within the next
“few decades” just based on nesting habitat availability, breeding population size may not
change, but birds will start moving off the beach to upper terrace areas at Cape Adare
(particularly new recruits to the breeding populations). Complete “abandonment” of the site is
5
going to happen slowly, through attrition (death) of breeding birds and a lack of recruitment by
youngsters. With >200,000 breeding pairs this could take a long time, particularly if “complete”
reproductive failure is “intermittent”. From the Ross Island colonies we know that when
breeding conditions are very difficult for multiple years in a row, a small percentage of breeding
birds will move and try to breed somewhere else; however, that movement rate is surprisingly
low (~3%; Dugger et al. 2010). So as long as it’s only reproductive success that’s at stake (not
survival of the breeder), most breeders continue to stick it out in a bad place. Populations can
and will decline if reproductive success of these die-hards is poor (no new birds recruiting), and
of course through attrition as these breeders begin to die off – but that process is relatively slow.

Associate Editor's comments (Dr Emily Shepard):
Your manuscript on historical changes in Adelie penguin colonies in west Antarctica has now
been reviewed by two experts in the field. While they found the study interesting, both also have
some reservations, with those of reviewer 2 being more substantial. In particular, this reviewer
expresses concern about the use of the results to make inferences about population demongraphy
through time. I feel that it would take substantial revisions to be able to answer this specific point,
however, if you are able to address this then it would be interesting to see a revised manuscript.

I am pleased to see that most of my concerns were easily addressed by re-framing and clarifying
your interpretation of the geologic data as a proposed hypothesis about the population dynamics
of penguins at Cape Adare in the past. Most of my concerns have now been addressed by your
revisions. However, there are still a few places early in the Discussion where I might suggest
softer language, so that it’s clear from the beginning that you are proposing a hypothesis about
11
what might have happened. Your revisions do make this clear later in the Discussion, so I'm just
suggesting some changes to increase consistent throughout.
Here are the specific places I refer to:
Pg. 8: 1st sentence of discussion. Change “indicate” to “suggest” and I think “follows” should
probably be “followed”.
Pg. 8: line 24: Again, use “supported” or “suggested” rather than “indicated” here.
Pg. 8: Line 25: “possibly” not “likely” – again, to clarify that this is one hypothesis
Pg. 8, Line 49: add the capitalized section: “WE HYPOTHESIZE that this “supercolony”
underwent continuous growth……….”
Pg. 9, Line 6: insert “hypothesized” again: “……….events in the Ross Sea at that time may help
explain this HYPOTHESIZED growth at Cape Adare”

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Emily Shepard):
Thank you for your revised manuscript and thorough responses to the reviewers comments. We

are pleased to say that your manuscript is now almost ready for publication. The reviewer has
just suggested some very minor tweaks to help provide consistency in the discussion.
Reviewer comments to Author:
Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author(s)
I am pleased to see that most of my concerns were easily addressed by re-framing and clarifying
your interpretation of the geologic data as a proposed hypothesis about the population dynamics
of penguins at Cape Adare in the past. Most of my concerns have now been addressed by your
revisions. However, there are still a few places early in the Discussion where I might suggest
softer language, so that it’s clear from the beginning that you are proposing a hypothesis about
what might have happened. Your revisions do make this clear later in the Discussion, so I'm just
suggesting some changes to increase consistent throughout.
Here are the specific places I refer to:
Pg. 8: 1st sentence of discussion. Change “indicate” to “suggest” and I think “follows” should
probably be “followed”.
Pg. 8: line 24: Again, use “supported” or “suggested” rather than “indicated” here.
Pg. 8: Line 25: “possibly” not “likely” – again, to clarify that this is one hypothesis
Pg. 8, Line 49: add the capitalized section: “WE HYPOTHESIZE that this “supercolony”
underwent continuous growth……….”
Pg. 9, Line 6: insert “hypothesized” again: “……….events in the Ross Sea at that time may help
explain this HYPOTHESIZED growth at Cape Adare”

ociate Editor's comments (Dr Emily Shepard):
r manuscript on historical changes in Adelie penguin colonies in west Antarctica has now been
ewed by two experts in the field. While they found the study interesting, both also have some
rvations, with those of reviewer 2 being more substantial. In particular, this reviewer expresses
cern about the use of the results to make inferences about population demongraphy through time. I
that it would take substantial revisions to be able to answer this specific point, however, if you are
to address this then it would be interesting to see a revised manuscript.
BELIEVE OUR COMMENTS BELOW AND CHANGES IN THE MS ADEQUATELY ADDRESS
D CLARIFY THIS ISSUE IN MORE DETAIL AND WILL SATISFY THE REVIEWER’S
NCERNS. IN PARTICULAR, NOTE THAT THE MAJOR CONCERN BY REVIEWER #2 IS
TUALLY BASED ON A MISUNDERSTANDING OF OUR DISCUSSION, WHICH HAS NOW
EN CLARIFIED AND CORRECTED.

s manuscript is well written and was an interesting read. I have only a few minor suggestions, detailed
w, to improve the ms and bring it in line with the requirements for RSOS.
tract:
e 2, Line 10: Define B.P. here to help the reader?
E DEFINITION HAS BEEN ADDED.
e 2, Line 10: Here, and in several other places in the ms (e.g. Page 2, Line 22; Page 3, Line 8) you use
singular 'pair' when you should use the plural 'pairs'. I'd suggest a global check of this throughout the
L USES OF THIS WORD HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO PLURAL.
e 2, Line 15: I'd suggest 'access for breeding penguins' rather than 'access by', but maybe this
erence is an Anglicism?
PREFER TO KEEP THIS AS ‘ACCESS BY’ AS THAT SOUNDS CLEARER TO US, BUT CAN
ANGE IT IF THE EDITOR PREFERS ‘ACCESS FOR’
oduction:
e 2, line 52: Give a brief definition of polynya here, to help the reader unfamiliar with the polar
ld? E.g. 'polynyas (areas of open water surrounded by sea ice)...'
IS DEFINITION HAS BEEN ADDED.
e 3, line 6, 8 and 10: Here you use 'nesting pairs' and in the abstract 'breeding pairs'. Either is fine, but
might want to use one term consistently.
HAVE CHANGED ALL TO ‘BREEDING PAIRS’ TO BE CONSISTENT
hods:
e 4, line 47: Could you briefly explain here why or when the two different test pits (1x1 m and 0.5x0.5
were used? Also, no unit was given - are these in metres?
HAVE INDICATED METRICS AND ADDED A BRIEF EXPLANATION FOR PIT SIZE
FERENCES, WHICH WAS BASED MAINLY ON SURFACE CONDITIONS AT EACH SITE
D AMOUNT OF TIME AVAILABLE IN THE FIELD TO COMPLETE AN EXCAVATION.
ults:
e 7, line 49 and Page 8, line 6: The degrees of freedom for the ANOVA are missing from the test
istics. They should be given as a subscript on the F to meet RSOS's requirements.
APOLOGIZE FOR THIS OVERSIGHT AND HAVE ADDED THE DF VALUE AS A
BSCRIPT TO F VALUE.
cussion:
e 10, first paragraph: When discussing the stable isotope results, I think you ought to note two caveats
h your results.
t, analysis of egg-shells indicates the diet of females during the pre-laying period (i.e. when they are
ding body reserves ready to lay eggs). During this period, it is conceivable that they could be foraging
l away from their breeding colonies, and possibly outside of the Ross Sea. And, these results are thus
directly comparable to all of those that you cite, for example -- Lyver et al. 2011. I think this just
ds to be acknowledged and noted. Also, if there are studies that show that the female penguins still
ition up their foraging areas by colony during the pre-laying period, you could note this and cite those
ies.
HAVE ADDED A SENTENCE TO CLARIFY DIETARY STUDIES BASED ON DIFFERENT
SUES, BUT THAT BOTH MODERN AND ANCIENT TISSUES REVEAL SIMILAR DIETARY
ENDS IN THE NORTHERN TO SOUTHERN ROSS SEA.
ondly, your sample sizes for the stable isotope analysis are pretty small, particularly given that they
based on egg-shells so are non-invasive. This is not necessarily a major concern, since your results
firm what is known from other studies, but I'd suggest you acknowledge it as a caveat of the study.
HAVE ADDED THIS CAVEAT, THOUGH THE RESULTS STILL SUPPORT EARLIER
UDIES. WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TESTING FOR THESE DIETARY DIFFERENCES WITH
DITIONAL SAMPLING IN THE FUTURE.
ure Captions:
e 16, line 34: I'd suggest "Error bars are one standard deviation", just for complete clarity.

mments to the Author(s)
s is an interesting paper that relies on fossil records to provide support for the hypothesis that one of
largest Adélie penguin breeding colonies in west Antarctica was at one point, substantially bigger
it is today. Considering the idea that Cape Adare might have had ~500,000 breeding pairs is an
resting thought-exercise particularly when you consider both the current population at Cape Adare
out ½ the historical estimates) and the current growth at the medium and large penguin colonies on
s Island that have occurred in the last 10 years (Lyver et al. 2014). However, I have some concerns
ut the strength of your conclusions given they are based on inferences about the geologic history of
ing habitat use at Cape Adare along a single, perpendicular transect involving only 9 samples. In
ition, while you acknowledge that you don’t really know what conditions would have caused the large
ease, and then subsequent decrease in the Cape Adare breeding population in the last 2000 years, you
e a very strong statement about predicted changes in the next “few decades”. I don’t believe the data
have presented allows for such certainty, particularly given the Adelie penguin life history strategy
selected) and what we do know about their demographics under both “typical” as well as difficult or
ironmental conditions.
ase see specific comments and questions as follows:
Pg. 5, line 14-16: It’s confusing to end this sentence with “…..for a total of nine sites” since what
’ve detailed here are only 5 of the 9 sites, with the other 4 coming from the Ridley Beach mounds that
discussed in the next paragraph. I would suggest ending sentence at “…excavated in 2016.”
IS HAS BEEN DONE.
Pg. 7, Line 15: Shouldn’t this be “…… tissues collected in 2005 and 2016…..” rather than “…and
7”?
S, WE MEANT 2016 AND HAVE CORRECTED THIS.
Pg. 8, 1st paragraph of discussion: Can you really say with such certainty what the exact historic
nization pattern was of this ~1.6 km2 (Ridley beach + terrace?) breeding colony with just your 9
ples transect from the beach up the slope? Certainly one hypothesis for the dates you observed is
t you’ve laid out, but saying that “Ridley Beach was completely occupied by ~1200 BP…..” seems
a very strong statement based on 4 samples, particularly when one was dated at 790 yrs B.P.
CAN NEVER BE ENTIRELY CERTAIN UNLESS WE COULD SAMPLE AND RADIOCARBON
TE EVERY MOUND ON RIDLEY BEACH. WE ARE ONLY HYPOTHESIZING THE
PULATION TREND BASED ON THE DATA ON HAND AND OUR HYPOTHESIS CAN BE
STED WITH ADDITIONAL SAMPLING IN THE FUTURE. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT
NGUINS WOULD NOT HAVE CONTINUED TO OCCUPY CAPE ADARE, AND ESPECIALLY
E UPPER TERRACE AT 300 MASL, UNLESS NESTING SITES ON THE LOWER BEACH
RE NO LONGER AVAILABLE.
We don’t really know very much about the dynamics of sub-colonies within the larger penguin
eding colonies to say for sure how sub-colony size and density affects colonization of “unused” space.
AGREE, BUT AGAIN WOULD HAVE TO SAMPLE AND RADIOCARBON DATE EVERY
UND, BUT WE PRESENT A TESTABLE HYPOTHESIS BASED ON THE SAMPLES WE HAVE.
Pg. 9, Line 43-45: So why wasn’t the “upper terrace” colonized first (prior to 2000 yrs B.P.)
tive to Ridley Beach (assuming it was “ice-free” as you suggest).
IS IS A GOOD QUESTION AND PERHAPS THERE ARE OLDER DEPOSITS SOMEWHERE ON
IS UPPER TERRACE, OR THOSE DEPOSITS WERE REMOVED BY GLACIAL ACTIVITY.
AIN, FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS WARRANTED TO CONTINUE TESTING OUR
POTHESIS.
Pg. 10, 1st paragraph: It’s not clear to me what the point of this paragraph is relative to your
ings. Is this discussion of current diet patterns at Hallett, Adare and the Ross Island colonies
posed to provide some sort of mechanism/explanation for why the Cape Adare colony was much
ger than it is today? i.e., ~500,000 breeding pairs by ~1200 B.P.? If so, how do current food resources
es of food and most relevant – amount) relate to conditions ~1200 yr. B.P. that might have supported
h a large colony at Adare?
S, WE BELIEVE THE HIGH MARINE PRODUCTIVITY AT THE SHELF BREAK PROVIDES
E RESOURCES TO SUPPORT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BREEDING PENGUINS IN
E NORTHERN ROSS SEA. THE DIETARY DIFFERENCES THAT WE AND OTHERS HAVE
CUMENTED BETWEEN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN COLONIES IS WORTHY OF
CUSSION TO HELP INDICATE WHY THE ‘SUPERCOLONY’ COULD HAVE EXISTED IN
E PAST. WHY THIS ‘SUPERCOLONY’ FORMED AND THEN COLLAPSED TO ITS PRESENT
E IS A NEW QUESTION RAISED IN OUR STUDY THAT ONLY FUTURE RESEARCH CAN
DRESS. WE WISH WE COULD PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION FOR THIS, BUT ADDITIONAL
TA ARE NEEDED. WE BELIEVE OUR FINDINGS WILL HELP STIMULATE ADDITIONAL
UDY AND DISCUSSION.
Pg. 10, Line 54: “…….and continuing impacts over time could result in colony decline or
ndonment.” Sure, on the surface this is a true statement, but I think you must be very clear about what
mean in terms of “time”. In this statement I think you mean “geologic” time (100’s or 1000’s of
rs) because this kind of population change when you’re considering a colony of >1m birds (500,000
eding pairs) would take multiple penguin generations (20+years) to occur given the level of habitat
urbance so far discussed (see below).
AGREE AND WE HAVE CLARIFIED TIME HERE BY ADDING ‘GEOLOGIC’.
Pg. 11, Line 24-26: “We believe that the penguin colony at Cape Adare is thus highly endangered
likely will be abandoned by breeding penguins within the next few decades due to sea level rise and
eased impacts of storms and storm surges on nesting penguins.”
This is a really strong statement that is not supported by your data, or general Adélie penguin
logy and demographics. I am most concerned about the reference to this sort of breeding colony loss
urring “within a few decades” as even given ongoing climate change issues reported demographic
onses of Adelie penguins from don’t support this rapid rate of change for such a large breeding
ulation (see Ross Island literature: Lescroel et al. 2009, Ballard et al 2010, Dugger et al. 2010, 2014,
er et al. 2014).
ed on what you have presented previously in this paper, I think what you might be able to say is that
h predicted sea level rise, the spatial distribution of the current Cp. Adare breeding colony is likely to
nge. Birds are currently nesting only on “Ridley Beach”, but given they have used the “upper terrace”
he past, then isn’t it likely that the first thing that will happen if the beach (or parts of it) become
sable is that they will move upslope? Thus, within the next “few decades” just based on nesting
itat availability, breeding population size may not change, but birds will start moving off the beach to
er terrace areas at Cape Adare (particularly new recruits to the breeding populations). Complete
andonment” of the site is going to happen slowly, through attrition (death) of breeding birds and a lack
ecruitment by youngsters. With >200,000 breeding pairs this could take a long time, particularly if
mplete” reproductive failure is “intermittent”. From the Ross Island colonies we know that when
eding conditions are very difficult for multiple years in a row, a small percentage of breeding birds
move and try to breed somewhere else; however, that movement rate is surprisingly low (~3%;
ger et al. 2010). So as long as it’s only reproductive success that’s at stake (not survival of the
eder), most breeders continue to stick it out in a bad place. Populations can and will decline if
oductive success of these die-hards is poor (no new birds recruiting), and of course through attrition
hese breeders begin to die off – but that process is relatively slow.
APOLOGIZE FOR THE CONFUSION AS OUR DISCUSSION WAS MEANT TO CONVEY
ACTLY WHAT THE REVIEWER STATES ABOVE: THAT RIDLEY BEACH WILL BE
ANDONED AND THAT PENGUINS ARE LIKELY TO MOVE TO THE UPPER TERRACE AS
A LEVEL RISE CAUSES ABANDONMENT OF THE BEACH. WE HAVE ADDED A
ARIFICATION IN OUR STATEMENT QUOTED ABOVE THAT WE ARE REFERING ONLY TO
LEY BEACH BEING HIGHLY ENDANGERED AND WILL BE ABANDONED IN THE
TURE. ALSO, WE HAVE REMOVED THE PHRASE ‘OVER THE NEXT ~30 YEARS’ AND
THIN THE NEXT FEW DECADES’ IN REFERENCE TO THIS PREDICTED ABANDONMENT
THIS IS JUST OUR ESTIMATE BASED ON CURRENT SEA LEVEL RISE CITED IN THE
CUSSION. HOWEVER, WE REMAIN CERTAIN THAT THE BEACH WILL BE ABANDONED
THE NEAR FUTURE DUE TO CONTINUING SEA LEVEL RISE. ALSO, OUR SENTENCE
MEDIATELY AFTER THE ONE QUOTED ABOVE DOES GIVE OUR PREDICTION THAT THE
PER TERRACE WILL BE RE-OCCUPIED AS THE LOWER BEACH IS ABANDONED. WE
VE ALTERED THE WORDING OF OUR DISCUSSION TO MAKE THESE POINTS CLEARER.
