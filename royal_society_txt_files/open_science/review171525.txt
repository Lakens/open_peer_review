In this manuscript the synthesis and characterization of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) coated with
dextran is described. NPs have been synthesized by co-precipitation method and morphological
studies have been performed by SEM and TEM for their characterization. DRX has been used in
order to identify magnetite and from the Scherrer’s equation crystallite sizes were obtained. IR
spectroscopy has been used for identifying the presence of the coating. The synthesis conditions
have been previously described by the authors.
As a general remark, the paper is well written and correctly presented. The present work is
3
interesting, original and well structured.
Experiments seem carefully conducted and results seem correct. However, some details are
lacking, dealing with the “Material and Methods” section, especially for the methods used for the
characterization of the iron nanoparticles. In my opinion, these aspects need to be more detailed
in the manuscript. The authors must provide sufficient details to allow the work to be
reproduced.
Moreover, several weaknesses appear also in the experimental results presentation. Indeed, the
discussion of the obtained results must be reinforced based previous studies. So, more detailed
discussion of the experimental results supported by literature is required in order to increase the
scientific quality of the present manuscript.
To conclude, despite the practical relevance, the presented manuscript could be considered for
publication in the Royal Society Open Science Journal only after a major revision.
The authors may like to consider also following points in order to improve the quality of the
manuscript:
• The chemical and morphology characterization showed that the iron oxide nanoparticles were
coated with an organic compound (dextran) with an agglomeration tendency that depends on the
amount of dextran in the coating solution. It is not evident the connection between XRD (Debye
Scherrer), TEM and FTIR analysis. Please improve.
• The average particle size calculated using Debye Scherer’s formula for dextran coated were
2.23, 1.38, and 1.18 nm for DINP 2.5, DINP 5 and DINP 10 respectively. The SEM images
indicated an average nanoparticles diameter of about 7 nm. Which is difference and why?
• Because a lot of work on iron oxide-dextran nanoparticles has been done for MR contrast agent
development, with many discussions of nanoparticles structure, I suggest you to read some more
related literature and to adapt your work in consequence.
• In the abstract of the manuscript the authors indicated that “Synthesis and characterization of
iron oxides nanoparticles coated with a large molar weight dextran for environmental
applications were investigated”. For witch kind of environmental applications the authors
consider to use these iron oxides nanoparticles coated dextran?
In the reviewer opinion an example of application justifying their future possible use for

rewritten the “Conclusions section“as follows:
tran coated iron oxide nanoparticles as DINPs labeled were synthesized in order to be used for
ure environmental applications. Iron oxide nanoparticles were obtained by co-precipitation method
then were coated with various dextran concentrations. The structure, size, morphology and
gnetism of DINPs were studied and the main results are concluded as follows:
SEM investigations highlight a tendency of agglomeration for the iron oxide nanoparticles and
average size of about 7 nm. The size is validated by TEM observations which strengthen that the
tran coating of iron oxide nanoparticles affects the agglomeration tendency: higher the dextran
centration, the better the dispersion of nanoparticles.
The XRD results shows that the crystallinity of iron oxide nanoparticles is only partially
served during the coating process with dextran, but amorphous features became stronger as the
tran concentration increased.
FTIR results have shown that dextran coated the iron oxide nanoparticles surface and
ained on the surface due to a combination of different interactions such as van der Waals force,
rogen bond, and electrostatic interactions.
The composition of the dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticles obtained by EDS has shown
t the amount of Fe decreases as the C concentration increases in the coating solution.
An increase in dextran concentration in the solution results in an increase in particle
persion that improves the dextran coverage on nanoparticles.
The magnetism results prove clearly that the dextran is strongly interacting with magnetite
oparticles changing their magnetic structure mainly at the nanoparticle surface where a strong
gnetic disorder is induced.
The DINPs synthesized in this work will be tested as eco-friendly material using its magnetic,
alytic and sensing properties for future environmental applications.

cording to this suggestion we added 14 references.

Materials and Methods
e synthesis of the iron oxide nanoparticles was carried out using a controlled co-
cipitation method, by mixing ferrous ion (Fe2+) and ferric ion (Fe3+) with alkaline
ution as it was described in our previous work [21], based on the Massart
thod [22]. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes in
er to obtain the final product as a dark brown precipitate (fig. 2). After
ntrifugation, the separation was made using a magnet to hold the powder onto
vial wall and after this the precipitate was washed with distilled water until the
sh solution reached a pH of 7. Then, the collected final product was dried into
en at 60oC.
e dextran solution was prepared by mixing 2.5, 5 and 10 g of dextran with a
lecular weight of 200,000 g/mol with 100 mL of deionized water. The respective
utions were put in contact with 1 g of iron nanoparticles at 100oC for 1 hour in
er to achieve the coating of iron nanoparticles with dextran. After the solutions
oling at room temperature, in order to separate the new synthesized materials,
suspensions were centrifuged at 800 rpm for 15 minutes. The final products
re separated using a magnet and the washed with methanol. The samples were
eled as follows: DINP 2.5 (1 g of iron nanoparticles coated with 2.5 g dextran),
P 5 (1 g of iron nanoparticles coated with 5 g dextran) and DINP 10 (1 g of iron
noparticles coated with 10 g dextran).
e structure, morphology and magnetism of the iron nanoparticles coated with
xtran were carried out using X-Ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy
M), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) , Fourier transform infrared
ectroscopy (FTIR) and Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID)
gnetometry.
e morphology and estimation of the samples size via SEM analysis was
formed using a scanning electron microscope QUANTA INSPECT F type, with
d emission gun. For validation of the SEM results, TEM analysis were carried out
help of a TECNAI F30 G2 high resolution electron microscope with 1Å line
olution equipped with an X-ray dispersive energy (EDS) detector with 133 eV
olution. In order to establish the amorphous or crystalline nature of the samples
X-Ray diffraction analysis was conducted using a PanalyticalX’Pert PRO MPD X-
diffractometer with high-intensity Cu–Ka radiation (<U+03BB> = 1.54065 A) and 2<U+03B8> range
m 10 to 90°.
ncerning the presence of the organic compound on the surface of the iron
noparticles, a FT-IR spectrometer Thermo Fischer Model Nicolet 50 with 0.09 cm-1
olution and variable aperture was used. Also, the samples have been
estigated with respect to their magnetic properties by SQUID magnetometry via
sensitive reciprocal space option (RSO).”

the present manuscript, we studied more detailed the literature and concluded
follow aspects which were also added at the end of the experimental section:
…..According to the literature, natural polymers as dextran influence extensively
stability of iron oxides nanoparticles due to their molecular weight and
ctional groups. Due to their shielding properties, dextran controls the
gradation process, the encapsulation efficiency and release rates [23, 24]

Ps were spherical, with a diameter size around 30 nm [5]. In view of these
servations, our results indicate that nanoparticles with an average size of about 7

cording to the suggestion we reviewed the “Introduction” section and explained
ssible use of this material:
ntroduction
Discharge and disposal of hazardous pollutants are governed by strict regulations. Nowadays, due to
increase in industrial manufacturing, the regulations for the hazardous pollutants discharge undergo
cal changes. A smart approach in the implementation of novel technologies has to transform the
tewater treatment technologies and to establish new criteria and design procedures to meet the ever-
easing demand. Therefore, the development of innovative, safe and cost effective strategies are required
educe toxicity in the rapid industrialization developments of mining, paper, batteries, pesticides and
ilizer industries. Nanotechnology has already proved to be an effective way to treat wastewaters [1, 2].
omaterials possess high adsorptive capabilities and may be used effectively to remove heavy metal ions
m wastewaters. When magnetic nanoparticles are used, they can capture and transport heavy metal ions,
g controlled by an applied magnetic field and acting like efficient vehicles to separate pollutants from
tewaters [3].
Generally, magnetic nanoparticles are synthesized by classical co-precipitation methods, and then coated
h different organic compounds, thus conferring both magnetic and biocompatible properties to the final
duct. The nanoparticles can be used in the environmental engineering, as adsorbent particles for metal
removal [4].
The concern for the environment has become more and more significant in our life, which increased
archers’ responsibility to search for applicable solutions in environmental protection. The
otechnology progress in the field of environmental engineering, especially in the wastewaters treatment,
ned new directions by applying advanced technologies to materials and devices. The removal of heavy
als from wastewaters using iron nanoparticles has been a good solution due to their high efficiency and
cost. Nanoparticles can be introduced into wastewaters that are contaminated with heavy metals, and
ause of their magnetism and nano size, they are able to quickly adsorb the heavy metals on their surface.
recovery of these loaded nanoparticles can be performed by applying non-uniform magnetic field.
The literature indicates only few studies regarding the use of iron oxides nanoparticles coated with
tran for environmental applications. Among these, the main use is as draw solute used for brackish water
alination using forward osmosis as it was indicated by Bai et al. (2011) [5, 6] or as material with magnetic
catalytic properties, especially as nanorods for bacterium detection (Nath et al, 2009)[7].
Although the iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles synthesis has advanced in the past years, their
ility, agglomeration and lose of magnetization are still challenging problems. One of the solutions was
oat iron nanoparticles with a layer impermeable oxygen, assuring that the oxygen does not reach the
oparticles surface and change the magnetic properties [8]. Organic compounds, including surfactants
polymers, represent a good choice for coating the magnetic iron nanoparticles.
Among them, dextran has the advantage of being a biocompatible, biodegradable and a water
ble material [9-13]. Dextran is a complex branched polysaccharide polymer chain unit of various lengths,
m 1000 to 2,000,000 Da. Dextran is a biocompatible material that is extensively used in biomedical
lications for coating nanoparticles to prevent the agglomeration and toxicity of magnetic particles [14,
Dextran has been used to design dextran-coated nanomaterials with defined biological interactions with
mplement system, which are able to either select complement activation pathways or prevent the
oparticles to activate the complement system on a rational basis[16]. In vitro effect of dextran coated
gnetic nanoparticles was tested on human colon cancer cell lines and the results showed that the dextran
ted nanoparticles had better biocompatibility over the un-coated nanoparticles [17].
Because of its biocompatibility properties, dextran was used in wastewater treatment applications to
ease the activity of certain metallic oxides. Flower-like zinc oxide nanostructures were synthesized by
tran-assisted solution technique [18]. This particular flower-like ZnO nanomaterial exhibits higher
tocatalytic activity than ZnO fragments obtained without dextran.
Dextran was used in biodegradable blend membranes of poly (butylene succinate)/cellulose
ate/dextran as an additive to improve hydrophilicity, mechanical strength, biodegradability, and
fouling properties of the membranes used in dairy wastewater treatment of the membranes was
estigated [19]. The reported demonstrated that contact angle was reduced up to 16% with the increase in
dextran concentration from 0 to 2 wt.%, while the amounts of pure water flux and permeate flux of
tewater was improved by 154% and 1543%, respectively.
Dextran has also contributed to the synthesis of novel biopolysaccharide derivatives as eco-friendly
culants, which are needed for environmental protection [20]. Polysaccharide-modified flocculant is a
arkable material in the field of wastewater treatment, which can handle industrial effluent and sanitary
age.
The aim of this study is to synthesize iron oxide nanoparticles (Figure 1), coat them with 200.000 Da
tran and then characterize them for their possible application in the treatment of wastewaters coming
m biomedical field. These wastewaters can be treated using a magnetic module that was developed
ally by our group to selectively remove heavy ions, biological, cations, anions or other elements of
rest from liquids via magnetic separation of nanoparticles [4].
Fig. 1: Illustration of the objectives of the research
novelty of this research consists in obtaining of an eco-friendly material with promising properties for
ronmental applications, combining two types of materials: one used as flocculant (dextran) and the other with
orbent and magnetic properties (iron oxide nanoparticles). Detailed synthesis and characterizations of dextran-
ed iron oxide nanoparticles are presented. Future work will be directed to assess the removal efficiency of certain
eria and others various pollutants.
hope that all our answers are correct and bring significant novelty in research area.
