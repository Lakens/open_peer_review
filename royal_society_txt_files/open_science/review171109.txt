When I read the first part in your first sentence in the abstract, I thought you were going to derive
in a simple manner the Kerr solution in Boyer–Lindquist coordinates. I wonder if your approach
can be generalized to do such.

Please note that Royal Society Open Science will introduce article processing charges for all new
submissions received from 1 January 2018. Charges will also apply to papers transferred to Royal
Society Open Science from other Royal Society Publishing journals, as well as papers submitted
as part of our collaboration with the Royal Society of Chemistry

eneralized transformations and coordinates for static
herically symmetric general relativity
mes M. Hill and Joseph O’Leary
viewer’s Report
The authors claim to have found a new solution to the spherically symmetric vacuum
d equations in general relativity, despite the fact that Birkhoff’s Theorem, whose original
m dates from the 1920s, states that all such solutions are isometric to some submanifold
the maximal extension of the line element usually attributed to Karl Schwarzschild.
ey do this by not taking the usual route of performing a coordinate transformation to
ove the off-diagonal term in the general spherically symmetric metric before solving
vacuum field equations.
Unfortunately, all that does is make one’s task harder: when one does a coordinate
nsformation is not mathematically relevant. In fact, the authors’ claim is completely
ermined by their own comments in sections 4 and 5 of the paper, where they give
rdinate transformations that reduce their claimed new metric to the standard form
Schwarzschild. This means that their solution is isometric to the usual Schwarzschild
ution, or at least some part of its maximal extension. There might be some interest in
king out which part of the maximal extension their new coordinate system covers, but
s is not addressed.
The rest of the paper deals with a claimed generalisation of the Eddington-Finkelstein
Kruskal-Szekeres transformations that allow one to extend the standard Schwarzschild
tric. These did not look to me to be adding anything of interest to the usual treatment
hese transformations.

Dear Alice Power,
Thank you for your email of 23/12/2017. We have carefully considered all the reviewer’s comments
and we have made changes accordingly.
On page 1, in the abstract we have added, “The new solution avoids the coordinate singularity often
associated with the Schwarzschild solution and is achieved by obtaining a more suitable coordinate
chart”.
On page 2, we have clarified which region the newly presented solution covers. This suggests a more
suitable coordinate chart than that of Schwarzschild. This is given in lines 12-17.
On page 5, we added “As inferred by the so-called Birkhoff's theorem, the important question arises
as to whether Eq. (4.4) is locally isometric to the Schwarzschild solution. The answer is in the
affirmative and the specific details are given in Sec. (5). Although the new solution is locally
isometric to the Schwarzschild solution, the authors note the new coordinate chart given by Eq. (4.4)
avoids the coordinate singularity at r=r_0 and allows for radially in/out going particles to pass freely
between this region which is normally associated with Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates”.
On page 8, we have added “Finally, the authors note that this approach can be easily generalised to
the Reissner-Nordstrom solution in GR”.
We trust that these changes now meet with your approval.
Yours sincerely,
Mr. Joseph O’Leary and Prof. James M. Hill.
