The authors developed a new standard reference film for oxygen gas transmission measurement.
The data showed the material itself is indeed stable and can be used as reference film, however,
the problem the authors think they are going to solve may not exist. The fact that they sent their
reference film to 4 CNAS laboratories and got consistent results proved the existing reference
materials were working properly.
1. Reference 7 talked about a novel PLA/PHBV Films and its characterization (including
measuring helium permeability, but not oxygen). It is a little puzzling that the authors used this
to draw a conclusion that there is dispersion in measuring oxygen transmission rates by ASTM.
2. Data source for table 1 is not clear? Did the authors send the same plastic film to various labs
for testing or obtain data from these labs for the same type of material? If it is the later, maybe
they are measuring slightly different materials.
3. Reference 4 didn’t mention anything about results from manometric method are lower than
coulometric method. The fact that these two methods used different mechanism is exactly the
reason why they used calibration films.
Based on 1-3, the problem the authors try to solve may not exist. In fact, any measurement
instruments should ship with consistent and known value reference/calibration material,
otherwise it’s a manufacture issue, not scientific issue.
4. This statement “The standard reference film should be suitable to the calibration and self-
calibration for all instruments” is not correct. And reference 12 is not related to topic.
5. Please check all the references, and make sure they are relevant.

In this work, a reference film was studyed to improve the oxygen gas transmission measurement
accuracy of plastic materials for pharmaceutical packaging. The manometric method and
coulometric method was first used to test oxygen gas transmission rate of candidate reference
film simultaneously. Besides, the homogeneity, stability, jointly determined value and
uncertainty evaluation of the reference film were also discussed. However, some revisions should
be made to make the paper more convincing.
1. Check the writing format carefully to ensure its correctness. At the 35 lines on the first page
and 23 lines on the second page, what is the “(.1)” and “(.2)” mean? You might want to write
“(Figure 1)” and “(Figure 2)”. At the the 43 lines on the second page, “1.01 × 105Pa” need to be
changed to “1.01 × 105Pa”. In addition, you had better to indent the first line and align the two
ends of article.

Comments to the Author(s)
The authors developed a new standard reference film for oxygen gas
transmission measurement. The data showed the material itself is indeed
stable and can be used as reference film, however, the problem the
authors think they are going to solve may not exist. The fact that
they sent their reference film to 4 CNAS laboratories and got
consistent results proved the existing reference materials were working
properly.
Reply: We appreciated the reviewer’s comment. However, with due respect, we
disagree. As stated in our manuscript, the calibration membranes for oxygen
transmittance in the Chinese market are supplied by instrument manufacturers. These
reference membranes can be divided into two categories, calibration membranes for
manometric method instrument and those for coulometric method instrument. Each
membrane is either for the specific manometric method instrument or the specific
calibrating coulometric method instrument only, which causes the different calibration
values and measurement results. This can be evidenced with the inter-laboratory data
comparison among 22 Chinese laboratories organized by CCFDA institute. In this inter-
laboratory test, the oxygen permeability of the same homogeneous plastic film was
measured by either manometric or coulometric method in 22 laboratories. The data
obtained by two methods with different instrument exhibited significant variations and
dispersion (Table 1 and figure 1) due to the inconsistent traceability reference materials.
Therefore, we discussed this instrument traceability problem with the
collaborative laboratories many times, and reached a consensus that the instruments
based on the manometric method and the coulometric method should be calibrated with
the same reference material with the same quantity value. After thorough research, we
selected reference material the calibration membrane for coulometric instruments
produced by Mocon. The data obtained with the instruments of either manometric
method or coulometric method calibrated with the same reference membrane in the
cooperative calibration laboratories exhibited high uniformity and normal distribution.
Therefore, in the present work, we developed a general reference membrane, instead of
popularizing the calibration membrane for coulometric instrument as reference
membrane because: 1. The calibration film is for the coulometric instruments only
because of its specific size that is not universal for all instruments; 2. The uncertainty
of the universal reference membrane developed in our work includes the uncertainties
of both the coulometric method and the manometric method.
1. Reference 7 talked about a novel PLA/PHBV Films and its
characterization (including measuring helium permeability, but not
oxygen). It is a little puzzling that the authors used this to draw a
conclusion that there is dispersion in measuring oxygen transmission
rates by ASTM.
Reply:Thank you for pointing this wrong citation. We have added the closely related
reference to support our statement. ASTM points out in a regulation item that the data
dispersion of oxygen transmittance is large.
2. Data source for table 1 is not clear? Did the authors send the
same plastic film to various labs for testing or obtain data from these
labs for the same type of material? If it is the later, maybe they are
measuring slightly different materials.
Reply:Thank you for your question. The same film samples were sent to different
laboratories after the film passed homogeneity and short-term stability tests. The
homogeneity and the short-term stability tests have excluded the data variations caused
by the unevenness of the sample and transport conditions. Therefore, the dispersion of
data variation obtained in the 22 laboratories (Table 1) is much wider than that caused
by the unevenness of samples and the transport conditions. We also collected
information of the type of instrument used and the traceability calibration membrane
used in each laboratory, and found that the dispersion of data collected in these
laboratories was attributed to the different traceability of instrument. Based statistic
results and the experimental results obtained in our lab with the oxygen transmittance
meters of most popular brands based on different methods, we conclude that the
significantly discrete data of the 22 laboratories is due to the different traceability of
instrument.
3. Reference 4 didn’t mention anything about results from
manometric method are lower than coulometric method. The fact that
these two methods used different mechanism is exactly the reason why
they used calibration films.
Based on 1-3, the problem the authors try to solve may not exist. In
fact, any measurement instruments should ship with consistent and known
value reference/calibration material, otherwise it’s a manufacture
issue, not scientific issue.
Reply:We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. I agree that ref. 4 did not give the exact
conclusion that the results of coulometric method are higher than those obtained with
the of manometric method. However, in the reference 4, the data obtained with the
manometric method are higher than those obtained with the coulometric method. We
also found the same pattern in our daily tests. Technically, the principles and conditions
of the coulometric method and the manometric method are same, and thus reference
materials with the same values should be used. However, different reference materials
are provided by the manufacturers of different instruments based on the measurement
methods. There is a gap between the values of calibration materials of the two methods.
We found that the oxygen transmittance measured by the manometric method is usually
lower than that obtained with the coulometric method, possibly because the oxygen
concentration of the test side is decreased in the late stage of the manometric
measurement. Therefore, it is necessary to unify the traceability of two methods, which
is not only a scientific problem, but also the management problem of the unified
measurement data. Discussing and understanding the measurement principle,
evaluating the consistency of the testing conditions, reliability, and traceability
calibration membrane selection are scientific issues. The administrative management is
mainly focused on the rationality and unification of the test data, the instrument design,
quality control and quality evaluation of the products.
4. This statement “The standard reference film should be suitable
to the calibration and self-calibration for all instruments” is not
correct. And reference 12 is not related to topic.
Reply:Thank you for careful reading. The sentence has been revised in the revised
manuscript. Instrument calibration is used to correct the measurement data. Self-
calibration is used to check the reliability of instrument and operation. We meant to
state that we have developed a universal reference membrane applicable to all oxygen
transmittance gauges, not for a specific method or instrument. We have checked
reference 12 and corrected it.
5. Please check all the references, and make sure they are relevant.
Reply:We have checked all the references to make sure they are relevant to our work,
as suggested by the reviewer.

Comments to the Author(s)
In this work, a reference film was studyed to improve the oxygen gas
transmission measurement accuracy of plastic materials for
pharmaceutical packaging. The manometric method and coulometric method
was first used to test oxygen gas transmission rate of candidate
reference film simultaneously. Besides, the homogeneity, stability,
jointly determined value and uncertainty evaluation of the reference
film were also discussed. However, some revisions should be made to
make the paper more convincing.
1. Check the writing format carefully to ensure its correctness.
At the 35 lines on the first page and 23 lines on the second page,
what is the “(.1)” and “(.2)” mean? You might want to write
“(Figure 1)” and “(Figure 2)”. At the the 43 lines on the second
page, “1.01 × 105Pa” need to be changed to “1.01 × 105Pa”. In
addition, you had better to indent the first line and align the two
ends of article.
Reply:Thank you for your suggestion. We have read the whole manuscript carefully
and corrected the writing format. The first line and the two ends of the manuscript have
been aligned.
2. As for the candidate reference film, how did you prepare your
material? The preparation is just cut the film that you bought? If the
material is not your original, you can’t write “A novel reference
film was developed”.
Reply:Thank you for your questions. For developing such candidate reference film,
we did more than just cutting the film. First, we screened the films various plastic films
on the market with a number of quality indexes including the amount, homogeneity,
and stability of oxygen transmissivity, and the homogeneity of thickness. Once the
candidate films chosen, we optimize the size of film based on the sampling
requirements of universal instruments. The candidate film was then measured and
calibrated based on the ISO guidelines. However, to avoid any misunderstanding, we
have revised the sentence to "A novel reference film was characterized".
3. Please describe your experiment in detail to make sure that
others can repeat your experiment. You could name your prepared
reference film to distinguish between other materials.
Reply:Thank you for your suggestions. We have described the detailed experimental
procedures in the revised manuscript. The candidate reference film is given the name
CCRM195017.
4. In the figure 1, please write the meaning and unit of horizontal
and vertical coordinates.
Reply : Thank you for your careful reading. We have supplemented the unit and
meaning of the horizontal and vertical ordinates in Figure 1 in the revised manuscript.
5. Please show all the experiment data using table or graph,

Comments to the Author(s)
My apology for not fully understanding the issue, it is a little
interesting that ASTM itself would say the interlaboratory variations is
poor for its published standard method. It is useful and meaningful to
characterize a universal reference standard for oxygen gas
transmission measurements. However, there is still a couple of issues
need to be resolved.
1. It is not clear where material CCRM195017 comes from in
the latest version of manuscript, was it the polyester film from Toray
Industries?
Reply: Thank you for the question. Material CCRM195017 is the
polyester film purchased from Toray Industries. Our company can
characterize reference materials but cannot produce membrane
materials. We collected a variety of commercial membrane materials
and screened them for the uniformity. The polyester film produced by
Toray Industries exhibited the best homogeneity for oxygen
permeation. Therefore, it was further characterized as the reference
membrane.
2. It is a little puzzling that initially the authors introduced the
problem of big interlaboratory variations for oxygen gas transmission
rate measurement in both the standard and data they collected from 22
Chinese laboratories. However, when CCRM195017 was sent for
testing, multiple laboratories using both manometric and coulometric
methods gave very consistent results. What happened/changed or am I
missing something here. If multiple laboratories can provide consistent
results for the same material, it means whatever reference they are
using is working properly.
Reply: This is a good question. As stated in our manuscript, based on
the extensive investigation and discussion with other labs, we
concluded that the big interlaboratory variations for oxygen gas
transmission rate measurement in the data we collected from 22
Chinese laboratories were due to the inconsistent traceability reference
materials. We discussed this instrument traceability problem with the
collaborative laboratories and reached a consensus that both
instruments based on the manometric method and the coulometric
method should be calibrated with the same reference material with the
same quantity value. After thorough investigation, we selected
reference membrane for coulometric instruments produced by Mocon
as the universal reference membrane. These laboratories gave very
consistent results with either manometric or coulometric method after
adopting the reference membrane we proposed.
3. What is the advantage of CCRM195017 compare to
reference films from Mocon.
Reply: Thank you for your question. As stated in our manuscript, the
CCRM195017 and reference films produced by Mocon possess similar
oxygen transmission quantity value, but slightly different uncertainty
and significantly different sizes. The differences in uncertainty and size
make CCRM195017 more universal.
1. The uncertainty of CCRM195017 (relative uncertainty is 6.6%)
includes the uncertainty introduced by the manometric method and the
coulometric method. The reference films from Mocon included only the
uncertainty introduced by the coulometric method (relative uncertainty
is 5%). Therefore, CCRM195017 is suitable for calibrating both
instruments of the manometric method and coulometric method. In
contrast, the reference films from Mocon are more suitable for the
calibration of the instrument based on coulometric method.
2. CCRM195017 reference membrane is designed with a large square
shape of 15cm*15cm, which can be cut into different sizes based on the
different gas transmitters. The reference films from Mocon are designed
for the Mocon oxygen transmittance meter only. Their size cannot be
changed, and thus they are more suitable for instruments of Mocon
Company or the instruments with similar test chambers to those of the
Mocon instruments.
