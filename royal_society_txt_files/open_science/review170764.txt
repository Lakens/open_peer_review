In this manuscript, Patel et al describe a one-pot three-component synthesis of 4H-pyrano
quinolinone derivatives from 2-aryl-N-allyl-indole-3-carbaldehydes, active methylene species
and 4-hydroxy quinolin-2(1H)-ones. Using TBAF as the catalyst, the desired heterocycles were
conveniently prepared in good to excellent yields. The pyranoquinoline products might be useful
in the fields of medicinal chemistry because of their biological activities.
In my point of view, the paper could be published after major revisions (see the Comments).
Comments:
1. Some chemical structures in the figures/schemes are distorted. It would be better to check each
structure and adjust it properly.
2. During the study of the effects of different solvents on the reaction, what about the use of
EtOH+H2O (1:9) as the solvent? And have other alcohols such as MeOH and n-BuOH been tested
for the reaction?
3. Could other kind of cyano compound such as phenylacetonitrile be utilized for this
transformation?
4. Do they isolated some intermediates to further prove the proposed pathway during their
investigation?
5. The signals of the C NMR of compound P9 are too weak to recognize. Therefore, this NMR
should be improved.
6. Many minor problems need to be avoided. For examples,
(1) In the Summary, "one pot cyclocondensation reaction" should be "one-pot cyclocondensation
reaction"; and "excellent yield" should be "excellent yields".
(2) In Page 1, paragraph 2, "... privileged heterocyclic ring moieties present in ..." should be read
as "... privileged heterocyclic ring moieties existing in ..."
(3) In Page 1, paragraph 3, "there derivatives" should be "these derivatives"; and "anti
inflammatory" should be "anti-inflammatory".
(4) In Page 2, paragraph 1, "... in order to synthesise ..." should be revised as "... for the synthesis
of ..."; and "three component reactions of ..." should be corrected as "three-component reactions of
...".
(5) In Page 2, paragraph 3, note that all the compound numbers should be written in bold type.
The similar problems in the following sections should also be avoided.

This paper reports on the synthesis of indole-containing pirano quinoline derivatives exploiting a
three-component coupling as well as their biological activity as antimicrobial agents. The
reported process has been previously disclosed although other basic catalysts and aromatic
aldehydes have been used. In this context, the authors fail to provide a satisfactory portrait of
these existing methods which should be appropriately referenced and discussed (see inter alia: J.
Heterocyclic Chem. 2016, 53, 1911; Helv. Chim. Acta, 2016, 99, 724; New. J. Chem. 2015, 39, 4452;
RSC Adv. 2014, 4, 11300; Green Chem. 2013, 15, 3446). Similarly, the mechanism depicted in Fig. 2
is redundant since it has been already reported for the same process and should be deleted being
unnecessary. The antimicrobial activity displayed by the prepared products is interesting and
significant. However, it is not clear to what extent the contribution of the indole ring is important
to the final biological activity. The authors should have provided at least a couple of examples in
which benzaldehydes are used as substrates and tested the corresponding products in order to
evidence the peculiar attributes of the obtained heterocyclic derivatives. Finally, it should be
remarked that the supporting information are rather incomplete. The authors are requested to
provide copies of the 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR for ALL products prepared. This issue is
particularly important and crucial when the target compounds are subjected to biological assays
in order to evaluate their purity and structural consistency.
In summary, the content of this paper deserves publication in Royal Society Open Science but the
manuscript needs for a notable improvement and further experimental integration before
acceptance.

sponse to reviewer 1#
Some chemical structures in the figures/schemes are distorted. It would be
ter to check each structure and adjust it properly.
Sir, we have corrected the figures and schemes and adjusted it properly as per
your suggestions.
During the study of the effects of different solvents on the reaction, what
out the use of EtOH+H2O (1:9) as the solvent? And have other alcohols
h as MeOH and n-BuOH been tested for the reaction?
Sir, the use of other polar protic solvent in contrast to EtOH led to a
gnificant decrease in yield. Also as per your suggestion I have mentioned the
tio of EtOH+H2O (1:9).
n page-3, paragraph 4th, we have rephrased it and also have further explained
ely the reason behind taking Water+ethanol mixture and their ratio as a reaction
dium. As in selecting water as a green solvent was gratifying but it had a
wback that the product used to become sticky, so the best result was obtained
2:8 ratio.
Could other kind of cyano compound such as phenylacetonitrile be utilized
this transformation?
Sir, we didnt tried it yet but as per your suggestion we kept a trial and observed
that on using phenylacetonitrile may be due to steric hindrance of phenyl ring,
after the formation of knoevenagel intermediate futher cyclisation was found to
be difficult and a very low product yield was observed.
Do they isolated some intermediates to further prove the proposed pathway
ring their investigation?
No, since it is an one pot three component reaction it occurs via an in situ initial
formation of the heterylidene nitrile which was monitored and confirmed by
TLC then upon addition of 4-hydroxy-quinoline-2-one the further Michael
attack take place. Hence, isolation of intermediate is in involved.
The signals of the C NMR of compound P9 are too weak to recognize.
erefore, this NMR should be improved.
Has been improved accordingly.
Many minor problems need to be avoided.
In the Summary, "one pot cyclocondensation reaction" should be "one-pot
locondensation reaction"; and "excellent yield" should be "excellent
lds".
We corrected as one-pot cyclocondensation reaction" and "excellent yields".
) In Page 1, paragraph 2, "... privileged heterocyclic ring moieties present
..." should be read as "... privileged heterocyclic ring moieties existing in
"
We have replaced present in by existing in..
) In Page 1, paragraph 3, "there derivatives" should be "these derivatives";
d "anti inflammatory" should be "anti-inflammatory".
Have corrected the above mentioned points.
) In Page 2, paragraph 1, "... in order to synthesise ..." should be revised as
.. for the synthesis of ..."; and "three component reactions of ..." should be
rrected as "three-component reactions of ...".
We have revised the sentences as per your guidance.
In Page 2, paragraph 3, note that all the compound numbers should be
itten in bold type. The similar problems in the following sections should
o be avoided.
Sir, we checked and corrected them to bold type.
sponse to reviewer 2#
Sir, as per our knowledge and your suggestions, we have further included
additional reference indicating one-pot three-component reactions using
different catalysts. Some of the references likewise: [19]-[26].
As per your guidance we have also removed the Fig-2 depicting mechanism.
Sir, as per your comments, we would have reported this catalyst by taking
some basic benzaldehydes but our research group is working on development
of a library of biologically potent scaffolds. As a prolongation of our
investigation on the synthesis of biologically active heterocyclic compounds.
[27-31] we attempted to report an efficient synthesis of pyranoquinoline
derivatives of substituted 2-phenyl-N-allyl-indole scaffold by TBAF. Since,
the molecular manipulation involves an idea to merge the separate
pharmacophoric groups of analogous activity into one compound, hence,
making structural changes in the biological activity. Thus, in continuance to
aforementioned facts, taking different benzaldehydes would not show better
biological activity than indole. As I have already referenced [17] various
substituted indole derivatives show pharmacological properties and are widely
recognized for their drug activities. Hence we are hereby reporting both the
novelty of the organocatalyst as well as the biological results of the compound
using green solvent.
Sir, we have also provided 1HNMR and 13CNMR of all compounds.
