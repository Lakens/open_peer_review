This paper brings new interesting data about the exchange of play-soliciting gestures in two wild
chimpanzee communities. The authors aimed to examine whether chimpanzee are able to adjust
their communication to specific particular attributes of individuals such as age, sex and
relationship. I notably appreciated that the authors defined several important terms they used.
This paper presents considerable work that represents time-consuming observations and analyses
that deserves to be published after minor revision. The paper notably needs to present more
clearly the results obtained from the different GLMMs. I expect then that the authors address all
the following points:
Introduction:
Lines 107-108; p5: what do you mean by “infant-conspecific dyads”? Do conspecifics were adults?
Infants? Both?
Line 111; p5: Do you rather mean “kinship” instead of “familiarity”? This needs to be clarified
along the manuscript and if you are talking about kinship, I suggest you to rather use this term
along the manuscript
Lines 114-116; p5: It seems that some words are missing in this sentence
Lines 105-125; p5: In your assumption concerning the effects of relationships on play-soliciting
gestures, you only speak about kinship and not about affinity relationships as friendship. Why
did you not take into account this type of relationship in your analysis, and, for example
especially between socially close juveniles? I suggest to clarify “relationship” in the whole
manuscript since relationship is a vague term and it could for example refers to different things
as kinship or friendship
Lines 126-137; p6: The third hypothesis that, contrary to self-handicapping gestures, object-
associated gestures would be more used between individuals with a more important difference in
age appears not enough clear. Can you explain a little bit more what did you expect here and
why?
Methods:
Line 173; p8: Correct “Eastern chimpanzees AND AT Gombe” and not “at and”
Line 184; p8: It would be great to add here the characteristics of intentional communication
Line 190-191; p8: I misunderstood something because I thought that the signaller was the infant,
so why signaller’s age and infant age are not the same?
* correct “small capitals” by “upper-case letter”
Line 199; p9: Do you mean “play intensity” for “signal type”?
Lines 205-207: Why did you run nonparametric tests instead of GLMM to test the effect of sex on
intensity of play? In the sake of relevance, it would be maybe more appropriate to use the same
statistical methods to answer all the questions
Line 210; p9: Change “Generalized Mixed” by “Generalized Linear Mixed Models”
ESM2: it would be great to add somewhere in the file the legend of variables
Line 214; p9: Do you mean “fixed effects” instead of “key test predictors”?
3
Lines 208-219: In the sake of clarity, and given that you used the same fixed effects in the three
GLMM, could you assemble this information at the end of the paragraph?
Line 232: This is the first time you used the abbreviation “ID”, please add “identity (ID)” at the
first occurrence
Lines 236-239: Do you mean that you made backward selection of the random effects and/or the
fixed effects based on the LRT for each model? To my mind, the selection has to be made only on
the random effects to then test which fixed effects most influenced the variables. Please precise
Results:
I suggest to add a subtitle for the first paragraph (e.g. “descriptive statistics”)
Line 253; p11: I did not find where are presented the criteria of intentional gestures in the
methods part. You need to present it clearer
Lines 267-268; p11: What are these five group-specific gesture types unique to each community? I
did not find where this interesting information appears
Lines 269-270; p11: Its is difficult to find these information in the tables since in Table S3, it is
written that juveniles/subadults produced 32 gesture types at Kanyawara and 27 at Taï. At which
table line do you refer when writing “In the juvenile/sub-adult class the number decreased, with
a total of 37 gesture types. Finally, the adult age class, including mothers, comprised the smallest
repertoire with a total of 25 gesture types”? The numbers do not match
Line 289: Which tests predictors are you talking about? Did all the fixed effects had an influence
on play solicitation? What were the best fitting models (with which random effects)? On the
whole, these information do not appear very clearly, and notably how you selected the best
models. Moreover, it would be useful to add information concerning lines in bold letters in tables
(1 & 2) in the legends (for highlighting significant effects, you also have to put in bold
Relation[mother] for tactile gesturing and to put in normal letters Site for object-associated)
Figure 4: what do the dots on the graph represent?
Discussion:
Lines 372-374; p16: “Since they are inevitably bound to an understanding of the recipient’s
intention”: This statement seems a little bit premature since intention reading abilities in great
apes is still hotly debated in the literature (For information, see Povinelli & Vonk 2003; Lurz &
Krachun 2011)
Line 376; p16: Please, correct “This result is IN line”
Line 384-385; p16: It seems that there is a mistake in this sentence that would rather be “rule out
that study site had NO significant influence on our results”
Lines 386-388: I think that these results have to be presented clearly in the results part (see my
previous comment in methods) and you could put in bolt letters these lines in the table in
supplemental material.
Line 398; p17: Please, correct “should be considered AS a gesture”
Line 416; p17: Retrieve one of the two “that”
Line 429-430: Could you add here the references you forgot to add?
Line 446; p19: Retrieve the comma after “high-ranking”
Line 453; p19: Retrieve “for” at the end of the sentence
Line 477; p20: It would be maybe more informative to put the age in months instead of years (0.7
years)

This study examines play gestures and compares different types of gestures during play with
different social partners. The authors are very thorough with explaining the research topic with
relevant background information, and include well detailed research questions and predictions.
Methods
Is there a reason that field sites are italicized?
Line 146 Should ‘respectively’ be moved to the end of the statement?
Line 156 What does ‘focal next to a behavior sampling’ refer to? Was one individual observed for
a set period of time or was the focus on videotaping all play behavior that occurred within a
group?
Was video constantly recorded to capture the play initiation videotaped or did videotaping begin
once an infant began playing?
How are chimpanzee age classes defined?
Discussion
Line 429 There is a note to add references here.
5
Line 482 I do not understand the connection between play gestures with objects and later food
acquisition. Could you please elaborate or provide an example of a motor pattern that is used
with these play gestures that can lead to later food acquisition?
Any suggestions as to why Tai chimpanzees produced more self-handicapping behaviors
compared to Kanyawara chimpanzees? Were there more chimpanzees that were older or more
intense play at this location?
Overall, this paper is very well written and very detailed with the descriptions with their
approach and results. The paper does a nice job of first reporting their findings followed with
detailed explanations and justifications with their interpretations of the data.

Dear Mr. Dunn,
Thank you very much for your letter and the response of the two reviewers. We are pleased to
resubmit a revised version of our manuscript RSOS-160278 entitled “Play-solicitation gestures
in chimpanzees in the wild: Flexible adjustment to social circumstances and individual
matrices”. We very much appreciated the detailed and constructive comments of both referees.
We hope to have addressed all of the suggestions pointed out in the decision letter in sufficient
detail.
The most substantial revision concerns the presentation of the statistical analyses carried out
and the results obtained. We reanalysed the variable of play intensity using an additional model
and improved the clarity of the results. Additionally, we addressed all of the minor comments
related to misprints and clarity made by the reviewers.
We thus hope to have produced a paper that is now suitable for being published in Royal
Society Open Science. Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.
Best wishes,
Marlen Fröhlich and Simone Pika
REVIEWERS’ COMMENTS:
Reviewer: 1
1. The paper notably needs to present more clearly the results obtained from the different
GLMMs.
MF & SP: Thank you very much for pointing out this lack of clarity. We conducted an
additional GLMM, in which we included the same fixed effects as for the other models to
investigate the sources of variation in play intensity. Moreover, we rephrased the relevant
sections in the methods part and improved the clarity of the results section. Thus, we hope
to have addressed all concerns related to the presentation of the statistical methods and
results. For details, please see the responses to the related comments below (e.g. 18, 22,
23).
Introduction
2. Lines 107-108; p5: what do you mean by “infant-conspecific dyads”? Do conspecifics were
adults? Infants? Both?
MF & SP: The term “conspecific” refers to all interactional partners that were neither
mothers nor maternal kin, irrespective of age/age class. We now replaced the term with
“infant–non-kin dyads” to make the difference to the other two levels (infant–mother,
infant–maternal kin dyads more clear (please see e.g. page 5, line 108; page 6, line 125;
page 9, line 199).
3. Line 111; p5: Do you rather mean “kinship” instead of “familiarity”? This needs to be
clarified along the manuscript and if you are talking about kinship, I suggest you to rather
use this term along the manuscript
MF & SP: Thank you for this suggestion. We replaced “familiarity” with “kin
relationship” throughout the manuscript (please see e.g. page 1, line 18; page 4, lines 80–
81; page 9, lines 197–198). Please see also our response to comment 5.
4. Lines 114-116; p5: It seems that some words are missing in this sentence
MF & SP: We added the relevant words accordingly: “We predicted that chimpanzees
take these relationships into account by predominantly employing tactile gestures in those
dyads with the most stable association patterns (i.e. mother-infant dyads).“ (please see page
5, line 114–116).
5. Lines 105-125; p5: In your assumption concerning the effects of relationships on play-
soliciting gestures, you only speak about kinship and not about affinity relationships as
friendship. Why did you not take into account this type of relationship in your analysis, and,
for example especially between socially close juveniles? I suggest to clarify “relationship”
in the whole manuscript since relationship is a vague term and it could for example refers to
different things as kinship or friendship.
MF & SP: We did not collect data on grooming or proximity patterns to make
inferences about affiliative relationships overall. Thus, the aspect of social bonds or
„friendship“ could not be tested. However, we tested for the effect of “relationship” in
2
terms of three levels: mother-infant relationship, infant–maternal kin relationship and
infant–non-kin (i.e. neither mother nor maternal kin). Thus, we agree that the term
“relationship” is not the best term to describe the aspect of familiarity, since we do not
have any data on affiliative relationship between infants and their social partners. We
added the following statement to the discussion: „Nonetheless, some unrelated mother-
infant dyads could be very „familiar“ to each other due to their frequent association, which
could have an effect on their communicative exchanges. However, since we did not collect
data on affiliative relationships we cannot test for this potential effect on play solicitation.“
(please see page 20, lines 482–486). The term “kin relationship” (i.e. relatedness) is the
most common term in the scientific literature to describe our distinction, we replaced the
term “relationship” with “kin relationship” throughout the manuscript (please see e.g.
page 1, line 18; page 4, lines 80–81; page 9, lines 197–198). Please see also our response
to comment 3.
6. Lines 126-137; p6: The third hypothesis that, contrary to self-handicapping gestures,
object-associated gestures would be more used between individuals with a more important
difference in age appears not enough clear. Can you explain a little bit more what did you
expect here and why?
MF & SP: Thanks a lot for pointing this out. We now provide a more detailed
explanation of this predictions in the manuscript to increase clarity: “Contrarily, we
expected that gesture-object combinations, which may represent more vigorous and
straightforward strategies than self-handicapping, will be directed preferentially at partners
of the same relative size (i.e. age). “ (please see page 6, lines 134–137).
Methods
7. Line 173; p8: Correct “Eastern chimpanzees AND AT Gombe” and not “at and”
MF & SP: Actually, the “and” needs to be omitted here, since the studies of Eastern
chimpanzees were conducted at these sites. We changed the sentence accordingly (please
see page 8, line 176).
8. Line 184; p8: It would be great to add here the characteristics of intentional communication
MF & SP: Thank you for this suggestion. We now added the specific criteria used in
this study for intentional signalling in the methods sections (“sensitivity to the recipient’s
attentional state, response waiting, apparent satisfaction of the signaller, and goal
persistence“; please see page 8, lines 187–189). Please note that we refer to previous work
for detailed definitions of these criteria.
9. Line 190-191; p8: I misunderstood something because I thought that the signaller was the
infant, so why signaller’s age and infant age are not the same?
MF & SP: In our analyses of play intensity and gesture production our focus was
indeed on infants as signallers. Hence, because we wanted to disentangle within- and
between-subject effects for infants we coded age of the signaller in months. Recipients, on
the other hand, could be of all ages (infant to adults). However, to examine the role of self-
handicapping we included individuals of all ages as potential signallers (“signallers could
be of all age classes”; page 11, line 249). This is why we additionally coded both the
3
signaller’s (and recipient’s) age in years. To make this distinction clear we now rephrased
the relevant sentences in the methods part (please see page 8, lines 195–196).
10. correct “small capitals” by “upper-case letter”
MF & SP: Apparently there is a difference in font between “small capitals” and “all
capitals”, as the former are set at the same height and weight as
surrounding lowercase (small) letters. Hence, we would prefer to leave the term as it stands
now, since it should be technically not wrong.
11. Line 199; p9: Do you mean “play intensity” for “signal type”?
MF & SP: Thank you for pointing out the lack of clarity. What we meant is the
“intentional usage of signal”; we now changed the term accordingly (please see page 9,
line 204).
12. Lines 205-207: Why did you run nonparametric tests instead of GLMM to test the effect of
sex on intensity of play? In the sake of relevance, it would be maybe more appropriate to
use the same statistical methods to answer all the questions
MF & SP: We agree that it would have been more appropriate to use the same
statistical methods throughout the whole paper. We thus added an additional GLMM for
play intensity with the same fixed effects as assigned in the other models. Importantly, the
result in terms of the predictor variable of interest (infant sex) stays the same (please see
page 9, lines 212–215; page 12–13, lines 290–301; ESM 1, Table S4).
13. Line 210; p9: Change “Generalized Mixed” by “Generalized Linear Mixed Models”
MF & SP: We corrected the term accordingly (please see page 9, line 214).
14. ESM2: it would be great to add somewhere in the file the legend of variables
MF & SP: We now added the legend of variables on a second sheet for each data file
(please see sheets “legend of variables” in ESM 2 & 3).
15. Line 214; p9: Do you mean “fixed effects” instead of “key test predictors”?
MF & SP: We followed your suggestion and changed the term accordingly (please see
page 10, line 244).
16. Lines 208-219: In the sake of clarity, and given that you used the same fixed effects in the
three GLMM, could you assemble this information at the end of the paragraph?
MF & SP: We particularly chose this order to first explain how models are “specified”
(in the first step) and subsequently how these were “implemented” in the statistical
software (in the second step; see also Fröhlich et al. 2016a,b). We now added subtitles
(“Model specification” and “Model implementation” to make this distinction more clear
(please see page 9, line 211; page 10, line 231). Nonetheless, the information on the used
datasets was moved to the end of the paragraph as suggested (please see pages 10–11, lines
242–250).
4
17. Line 232: This is the first time you used the abbreviation “ID”, please add “identity (ID)” at
the first occurrence
MF & SP: We now added “ID” after the first time identities were mentioned in the
methods part (please see page 10, line 224).
18. Lines 236-239: Do you mean that you made backward selection of the random effects
and/or the fixed effects based on the LRT for each model? To my mind, the selection has to
be made only on the random effects to then test which fixed effects most influenced the
variables. Please precise
MF & SP: Thank you for pointing out the lack of clarity. We noted that the relevant
sentence describing the method had several misprints which we now corrected (please see
page 10, lines 232–234): Firstly, we tested the overall significance of our key test
predictors (Forstmeier and Schielzeth, 2011). To do so, we compared the full model with
the respective null model comprising only the control predictor (study site) and all random
effects using a likelihood ratio test (Dobson 2002). Secondly, we tested the individual fixed
effects using other likelihood ratio tests (R function drop1 with argument “test” set to
“Chisq”).
Results
19. I suggest to add a subtitle for the first paragraph (e.g. “descriptive statistics”)
MF & SP: We now added a subtitle for the first paragraph of the results section (“Data
set of play-solicitation gestures”; please see page 11, line 254). The title “descriptive
statistics” is in our opinion not characteristic enough since this title also applies to the
subsequent paragraph.
20. Line 253; p11: I did not find where are presented the criteria of intentional gestures in the
methods part. You need to present it clearer
MF & SP: We now added the specific criteria used to identify intentional signal usage
in the methods sections (please see page 8, lines 187–189). Please see also our response to
comment no. 8.
21. Lines 267-268; p11: What are these five group-specific gesture types unique to each
community? I did not find where this interesting information appears
MF & SP: Thanks a lot for providing so useful and constructive comments. We now
added information regarding these five group-specific gestures, and referred to the
respective table showing the results: “We identified five group-specific gesture types head
butt, hide self, present back, present leg, shake head (Kanyawara-unique: N = 4, Taï-
unique: N = 1, see ESM 1, Table S3).” (please see page 12, lines 272–274).
22. Lines 269-270; p11: Its is difficult to find these information in the tables since in Table S3,
it is written that juveniles/subadults produced 32 gesture types at Kanyawara and 27 at Taï.
At which table line do you refer when writing “In the juvenile/sub-adult class the number
decreased, with a total of 37 gesture types. Finally, the adult age class, including mothers,
comprised the smallest repertoire with a total of 25 gesture types”? The numbers do not
match
5
MF & SP: The results we presented summarise the findings for both (i.e. across) field
sites, while the table presents this information for Tai and Kanyawara separately. We now
added the site-specific information for all age classes to increase clarity (please see page
12, lines 274–278).
23. Line 289: Which tests predictors are you talking about? Did all the fixed effects had an
influence on play solicitation? What were the best fitting models (with which random
effects)? On the whole, these information do not appear very clearly, and notably how you
selected the best models.
MF & SP: Please also see our response to comment no. 18. Firstly, we tested the
overall significance of our key test predictors (fixed test effects) age, sex, relationship
(Forstmeier and Schielzeth, 2011). To do so, we compared the full model with the
respective null model which comprised only the control predictor (study site) and all
random effects using a likelihood ratio test (Dobson 2002). Secondly, we tested individual
fixed effects using other likelihood ratio tests (R function drop1 with argument “test” set to
“Chisq”).
24. Moreover, it would be useful to add information concerning lines in bold letters in tables (1
& 2) in the legends (for highlighting significant effects, you also have to put in bold
Relation[mother] for tactile gesturing and to put in normal letters Site for object-associated)
MF & SP: Thanks a lot for these important suggestions. We now added information
regarding the lines depicted in bold letters in the table and also corrected the typeface of
the respective lines (please see page 32, lines 866, 871–872; tables 1 and 2).
25. Figure 4: what do the dots on the graph represent?
MF & SP: These dots represent outliers. We now added this information in the table
legend (please see page 33, line 894–895).
Discussion
26. Lines 372-374; p16: “Since they are inevitably bound to an understanding of the recipient’s
intention”: This statement seems a little bit premature since intention reading abilities in
great apes is still hotly debated in the literature (For information, see Povinelli & Vonk
2003; Lurz & Krachun 2011)
MF & SP: We rephrased the sentence and included a statement regarding the ongoing
debate related to apes’ understanding of intentions: “Since attention-getting gestures might
be linked to an understanding of the recipient’s intention and attention, Tomasello [79] even
argued that this gesture class is particularly novel and complex in the animal kingdom.
[however, note that great apes' abilities to understand other’s intentions is still subject to an
on-going debate; 80, 81].“ (please see page 16; lines 391–395)
27. Line 376; p16: Please, correct “This result is IN line”
MF & SP: We now added missing preposition “in” accordingly (please see page 16,
line 396).
6
28. Line 384-385; p16: It seems that there is a mistake in this sentence that would rather be
“rule out that study site had NO significant influence on our results”
MF & SP: Thank you for pointing out this mistake. We corrected the sentence
accordingly (please see page 17, line 405).
29. Lines 386-388: I think that these results have to be presented clearly in the results part (see
my previous comment in methods) and you could put in bolt letters these lines in the table
in supplemental material.
MF & SP: Please see our response to comment 21. We now added information
regarding these five group-specific gestures, and referred to the respective table S3 in the
ESM showing the results (please see page 12, lines 272–274). In addition, we highlighted
the respective gesture types in bold type (please see ESM 1, Table S3).
30. Line 398; p17: Please, correct “should be considered AS a gesture”
MF & SP: We changed the wording accordingly (please see page 17, line 418).
31. Line 416; p17: Retrieve one of the two “that”
MF & SP: We removed the word “that” accordingly (please see page 18, line 436).
32. Line 429-430: Could you add here the references you forgot to add?
MF & SP: Thank you for pointing out this unfortunate mistake. We now added the
relevant references 80 and 90 (please see page 19, line 449).
33. Line 446; p19: Retrieve the comma after “high-ranking”
MF & SP: We accordingly removed the comma (please see page 19, line 467).
34. Line 453; p19: Retrieve “for” at the end of the sentence
MF & SP: Thanks again for your constructive and detailed review and your “hawk’s
eyes”. We removed the word “for” at the end of the sentence accordingly (please see page
20, line 472).
35. Line 477; p20: It would be maybe more informative to put the age in months instead of
years (0.7 years)
MF & SP: Here we used the age information of the original citation (Koops et al.
2015). To follow your suggestion we transformed this number into months (please see page
21, line 500).
36. Line 578; p23: correct “findingS”
MF & SP: We added the letter accordingly (please see page 24, line 577).
Acknowledgements
37. Line 561: Please, correct: “the Ministère de l’Enseignement Supérieur”
MF & SP: Thank you for pointing out the mistake. We corrected the phrase
accordingly. (please see page 24, line 590).

Methods
39. Is there a reason that field sites are italicized?
MF & SP: We highlighted the field sites in italics to facilitate readability and to stress
the focus on two communities. We used the same style also in previous papers.
40. Line 146 Should ‘respectively’ be moved to the end of the statement?
MF & SP: We changed the wording of this sentence accordingly (please see page 7, line
149).
41. Line 156 What does ‘focal next to a behavior sampling’ refer to? Was one individual
observed for a set period of time or was the focus on videotaping all play behavior that
occurred within a group? Was video constantly recorded to capture the play initiation
videotaped or did videotaping begin once an infant began playing?
MF & SP: We clarified the sentence in relation to our recording method: “We used a
focal next to a behaviour sampling approach, that is one individual was observed for a set
period of time, while play behaviour of non-focal individuals in the immediate proximity
was also recorded.“ (please see page 7, lines 158–160).
42. How are chimpanzee age classes defined?
MF & SP: We defined the age classes according to the work of Boesch and Boesch-
Achermann (2000) on wild chimpanzees (“In terms of age classes, individuals were
categorized as juvenile/subadults if aged between 6 and 13/15 (females/males) years and
adults if aged 14/16 (females/males) years or older“; please see the reference on page 7,
line 168–170).
Discussion
43. Line 429 There is a note to add references here.
MF & SP: Thank you for pointing out this unfortunate mistake. We now added the
relevant references 80 and 90 (please see page 19, line 449).
44. Line 482 I do not understand the connection between play gestures with objects and later
food acquisition. Could you please elaborate or provide an example of a motor pattern that
is used with these play gestures that can lead to later food acquisition?
MF & SP: Our argument here is that play in general (i.e. both social play and solitary
object play) might play a crucial role for different functions later in life, based on our and
findings of other researchers. We rephrased the sentence to increase understanding: “This
8
result strongly supports the view of play as training ground for social interactions in adult
life”; please see page 21, lines 505–505).
45. Any suggestions as to why Tai chimpanzees produced more self-handicapping behaviors
compared to Kanyawara chimpanzees? Were there more chimpanzees that were older or
more intense play at this location?
MF & SP: We found no effect of study site on play intensity (please see page 13, line
300). Moreover, the average age of recorded individuals did not differ substantially
between the study sites (Kanyawara: 9.3 years; Tai South: 10.0 years). Nonetheless, the
community of Tai South is substantially smaller (ca. 30 individuals) than Kanyawara (ca.
55 individuals), hence one could assume that play dyads in this group are more
established: Older Tai individuals might engage more often in play with the same infants
and know that self-handicapping is a reliable communicative strategy to initiate play with
younger individuals. We now added this preliminary statement to the discussion (page 22,
lines 535–540). However, we can only speculate about this finding and need further data
before we could make general conclusions.
