label_comment_1
The perspective article submitted by Mahmood and Sun is intended to be a survey of the
literature on N,N-bidentate nickel pre-catalysts for the synthesis of highly branched polyethylene
elastomers.
In the current state, I regret to not recommend publication of this article for several main reasons:
1) the level of English used in the manuscript is sometimes very poor, which makes it very
difficult to read and understand. In particular the abstract and introduction need rewriting. The
language gets somehow better when the manuscript starts to deal with nickel catalysts though.
The conclusion’s language need to be review too.
2) The perspective is meant to deal with branched polyethylene yet there are various sections (e.g.
paragraphs: 2. introduction, 2. Mechanism of elastomeric behaviour of polyolefin elastomers, 3.2
alpha-olefins co-polymerization, 3.3 homopolypropylene based-thermoplastic elastomer) which
do not deal with polyethylene? This is very confusing. This is also not clear for the reader why
the authors are spending some time talking about block-copolymers when the focus is branched
polyethylene (so a homopolymer)? This will not be understandable by a general readership.
3) The authors need to make a better case as why this new perspective is needed, especially when
other review article on the topic (not that far in time) exists, e.g. “Nickel complex pre-catalysts in
ethylene polymerization: new approaches to elastomeric materials” in Catal. Sci. Technol., 2013,3,
1172-1179 (by the one of the author himself) or “Neutral Nickel Catalysts for Olefin Homo- and
Copolymerization: Relationships between Catalyst Structures and Catalytic Properties” in Chem.
Rev., 2015, 115, 12091. The authors need to be clear about this and signpost better previous
reviews.
4) In particular, as it stands, it is very difficult to get a sense of the significance of the results
presented, for example what is the best results of all in this field? Having the results presented
(including mechanical properties, vs target properties of in the form a table will considerably
enhance the interest of the manuscript.
5) Reading the manuscript, especially the conclusions and future outlook, I could not see any
rational or real “perspective” on the field: what is the state of the field right now? Is it
satisfactory? What are the challenges and what are the different avenues that needs to be
explored? Is there are clear structure/activity relationship that has emerged from the literature? I
believe that a perspective needs to provide some rational for existing results but also giving some
keys to the new reader to understand the field and to potentially get into the area.
Other various comments include:
- Figure 1 needs to be clearer: the stretch state and recovered state are very similar. Regardless,
how does this relate to branched polyethylene?
- What are the target properties for a thermoplastic elastomer, and for branched PE elastomer:
elongation at break etc?
- The authors mention “thermal stability” of the catalysts a lot (I would not qualify 80 degrees C
of “elevated temperature” though but: 1) I did not seen any details on how this stability was
assessed in the literature reviewed 2) what is the most thermally stable catalyst reported? Is it
different from the most active catalyst reported?
- Have there been any computational study trying to rationalise things like steric hindrance and
electronics of the ligand and establish a clear structure/activity relationship?
- Page 11 line 20, there is no complex 58a?

Comments on the manuscript “Highly branched elastomeric polyethylene accessible
via ethylene homo-polymerization using N,N-bidentate chelated nickel pre-catalysts: a survey”
RECOMMENDATION: Accept with minor modification
The authors, Mahmood and Sun, review the current state-of-the art regarding the use of nickel
catalysts as a means of forming thermoplastic polyolefin elastomers by polymerization using a
single ethylene feed. This current approach to materials that resemble commercially important
thermoplastic elastomers represents an area of great potential and indeed offers, in principle, a
more cost-effective approach than the methods currently employed. The importance of ligand
design and the impact of these changes on the mechanism (e.g. chain walking) of the
polymerization is thoroughly discussed and well referenced. Likewise the intrinsic properties of
the polymers that make these materials suitable for target application is well outlined.
Overall, it is my view that this paper is of sufficient interest to merit publication as perspective in
Royal Society Open Science subject to some modifications and in particular in regard to the
numerous grammatical errors (mostly with sections 1 and 2). Some additional proof reading is
warranted.
Some grammatical points that need attention are given below but this list is by no means
exhaustive:
(i) “… most globally use synthetic polymer…”
(ii) “…segments is much speculative to address this …”
(iii) “…can be precisely control by late transition metals catalysts.
(iv) “agnostic”
(v) “…there now a number of successful example…”
(vi) “A large number of late transition metal catalysts developed and used for olefin
polymerization.
(vii) “…to gain this goal attention has drawn …”

Minor point: the use of both ‘bidentate’ and ‘chelated’ in the same title seem unnecessary,
perhaps better: Highly branched elastomeric polyethylene accessible

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_3
This review by Mahmood and Sun focuses on nickel catalyzed olefin polymerization processes
that give thermoplastic polyolefin elastomers. The article discusses select examples of living
polymerization, ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymerization, homopropylene polymerization, and
homoethylene polymerization—the latter topic receiving the most discussion. Overall, I felt that
some sections provided more experimental data than necessary and that more emphasis could be
placed on specific trends or catalyst design principles that could help researchers working in this
field. The future perspective statement in the conclusion paragraph is somewhat generic. I
suggest that the manuscript be edited for grammatical and stylistic errors (there are many). In
summary, I recommend that the authors revise this manuscript taking into account the
suggestions provided.
- Perhaps consider modifying the title to include a-olefin polymerization since it was also
discussed.
- Page 1, Line 48: It is not clear what “statistical copolymer structure” is. Are the authors referring
to the percentage of comonomers, the polymer polydispersity, or something else?
- Page 1, Lines 50-52: the terms “speculation” and “speculative” were not used correctly, please
change. Also correct that use of this term in the rest of the text.
- Figure 1: the “original” and “stretched” state structures look too similar to each other, I
recommend exaggerating the figures a bit more to show contrast.
- Page 2: Can random copolymers show thermoelastic properties or only block copolymers can?
The discussion provided seem to suggest only the latter, which I don’t think is true.
5
- Page 2, Line 58: the final sentence: “To end this, there are many approaches…” is contradictory.
I don't think that the authors mean to imply that researchers are trying “to end” the development
of new methods to make thermoplastics.
- Scheme 1: This scheme is difficult to understand, please simplify for clarity.
- Scheme 2: The bottom left structure after “no chain walking/insertion” looks the same as its
precursor, an additional ethylene unit should be added to the chain.
- Page 6, Line 53: the term “fascinate” is not used properly in this sentence
- Page 7, Line 41: what is “engender factor”?
- Page 8: perhaps providing a table to summarize the properties of the different nickel catalysts
would be helpful to the reader here, otherwise the large amount of data discussed in this section
is quite overwhelming. Also, perhaps emphasizing any specific trends would be more
informative in a review article than listing a lot of specific numbers.

RSC Associate Editor:
Comments to the Author:
Overall, the reviewers were of the opinion that the topic of this review is timely and there is
sufficient interest in the community to warrant coverage of this topic in the journal, but the
execution was a bit off the mark. I suggest the authors revise the manuscript in accordance with
the criticisms raised by the reviewers, particularly with respect to grammar and readability.
In addition, I ask that the authors make substantial modifications to the paragraph immediately
after Figure 11 (the paragraph that begins “Similarly, Chen et al. reported a series….”). In its
7
current form, this paragraph is quite similar to the concluding paragraph in reference 115
(Macromolecules 2017, 50, 6074).

With this revised manuscript, some of my initial criticism towards the manuscript have
somewhat been attenuated. For example the title, abstract and introduction reflects better the
actual scope of this survey (although I am not sure about the use of a scorpio in the graphical
abstract, the ligands reviewed are not what the literature has coined "scorpionate" ligand
(tripodal ligands); I also think that the title should reflect that only alpha olefin are dealt with
here). The added tables are also a definitive imporvement and allow the reader to compare
catalyst performances. I would however recommend to add the mechanical properties of
poly(isoprene). polybutadiene and natural rubber as they are the traditional elastomers which
serves as benchmark in the field (even if they are not poly(alpha-olefin)s).
However, I am sorry to say that the language and structure (transition between parts etc) is still
not to the standard of a Royal Society journal and that it impedes the overall understanding of the
manuscript.
A specific example: it should be clearer why the manuscrip present the living/chain walking
polymerisation mechanism: the start of paragrah 3.1 (please also delete the title 3.1.1 as it is a
non-necessary repetition of 3.1) is a nere repetition of the beginning of section 3?
Also, I was disappointed that although the authors acknowledge that there are some
computational studies rationalise the influence of the steric and electronic factors on the activity
and selectivity of the catalysts, they choose not to include them in the manuscript? I do not agree
with this omission, especially as the only trend identified in
the somewhat very light conclusion is is that "bulky N-aryl ligands complexes are promising
precatalysts".
I unfortunately recommend to reject this paper. In this current state, it is not of the standard of
the Royal Society and of the RSC.

This revised review article is much improved from the previous version. The new summary
tables are helpful to the reader and provide an easy way to compare the different catalysts.
Although I was able to understand the writing for the most part, some sections still required extra
effort to read because of grammar issues. I suggest that the authors consider using a professional
editing service for this and future manuscripts so that the importance of their work is not lost in
translation. Overall, I recommend publication of this article. A few minor issues are listed below.
Page 2 line 30– Perhaps change the title for this subsection to “Characteristics of polyolefin
elastomers.” This section really isn’t about their mechanism.
Page 3 Scheme 1– In the bottom left structure for “Chain Termination,” the polymer has not
double bonds. First, how is that formed from the “Chain Propagation” structure? Second, how it
is react with the nickel catalyst in the subsequent step?
Page 5 line 39: Replace the word “creep” with a suitable term: “The results of creep experiments
proved that…” Do the authors mean rigorous experiments instead?

Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_6
The timeliness of a review on this topic is very good and should become a well-cited and widely
read paper upon publication.
The authors have done an extensive re-write based upon the first round of review comments;
they should be commended for this and the manuscript is much easier to read now.
One aspect the authors, in my opinion, failed to address - despite rewriting the section - was the
idea of providing a true outlook or perspective in their final section. What are the challenges in
the field, what can these Ni catalysts still not do well? Is catalyst recycling a possibility? I agree
with the authors that for homogeneous catalysis, stability in the range of 80-100C is good, but
what conclusions can be drawn from the work of Long et al about what ligand modifications
impart high temperature stability? These types of questions (and hopefully answers) are what is
missing from the manuscript as currently presented and would, in my opinion, really elevate this
work.
However, there still remains many issues with the grammar and spelling which must be
addressed prior to acceptance and publication. I highlight just a few below (as I stopped after the
summary):
please make the following changes,
Summary - change "ingenious" to "judicious"
change "substitutions" to "substituents"
"attention has been focused on the relationship" rather than "attentions have..."
Figure 1, why isn't the "s" in "stretch state" capitalized?
In Scheme 1, fix the n = 0,1,2 on the right hand side
The references need to be thoroughly revised for format purposes, e.g. reference 114 has no page

still find the grammar and readability to be an issue. My own read through of the manuscript
confirms that the poor language severely impedes the understanding of the science. Please
submit another revised manuscript that, in addition to the scientific questions raised by the
reviewers, has been edited for clarity of message and readability. You may want to consider
seeking the assistance of a native English speaker while revising your manuscript.

Comments to the Author(s)
This revised review article is much improved from the previous version. The new summary
tables are helpful to the reader and provide an easy way to compare the different catalysts.
Although I was able to understand the writing for the most part, some sections still required extra
effort to read because of grammar issues. I suggest that the authors consider using a professional
editing service for this and future manuscripts so that the importance of their work is not lost in
translation. Overall, I recommend publication of this article. A few minor issues are listed below.
Page 2 line 30– Perhaps change the title for this subsection to “Characteristics of polyolefin
elastomers.” This section really isn’t about their mechanism.
Page 3 Scheme 1– In the bottom left structure for “Chain Termination,” the polymer has not
double bonds. First, how is that formed from the “Chain Propagation” structure? Second, how it
is react with the nickel catalyst in the subsequent step?
Page 5 line 39: Replace the word “creep” with a suitable term: “The results of creep experiments
proved that…” Do the authors mean rigorous experiments instead?
Tables 1 and 3: What are the R groups in the structures depicted?
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
With this revised manuscript, some of my initial criticism towards the manuscript have
somewhat been attenuated. For example the title, abstract and introduction reflects better the
15
actual scope of this survey (although I am not sure about the use of a scorpio in the graphical
abstract, the ligands reviewed are not what the literature has coined "scorpionate" ligand
(tripodal ligands); I also think that the title should reflect that only alpha olefin are dealt with
here). The added tables are also a definitive imporvement and allow the reader to compare
catalyst performances. I would however recommend to add the mechanical properties of
poly(isoprene). polybutadiene and natural rubber as they are the traditional elastomers which
serves as benchmark in the field (even if they are not poly(alpha-olefin)s).
However, I am sorry to say that the language and structure (transition between parts etc) is still
not to the standard of a Royal Society journal and that it impedes the overall understanding of the
manuscript.
A specific example: it should be clearer why the manuscrip present the living/chain walking
polymerisation mechanism: the start of paragrah 3.1 (please also delete the title 3.1.1 as it is a
non-necessary repetition of 3.1) is a nere repetition of the beginning of section 3?
Also, I was disappointed that although the authors acknowledge that there are some
computational studies rationalise the influence of the steric and electronic factors on the activity
and selectivity of the catalysts, they choose not to include them in the manuscript? I do not agree
with this omission, especially as the only trend identified in
the somewhat very light conclusion is is that "bulky N-aryl ligands complexes are promising
precatalysts".
I unfortunately recommend to reject this paper. In this current state, it is not of the standard of
the Royal Society and of the RSC.
Reviewer: 4
Comments to the Author(s)
The timeliness of a review on this topic is very good and should become a well-cited and widely
read paper upon publication.
The authors have done an extensive re-write based upon the first round of review comments;
they should be commended for this and the manuscript is much easier to read now.
One aspect the authors, in my opinion, failed to address - despite rewriting the section - was the
idea of providing a true outlook or perspective in their final section. What are the challenges in
the field, what can these Ni catalysts still not do well? Is catalyst recycling a possibility? I agree
with the authors that for homogeneous catalysis, stability in the range of 80-100C is good, but
what conclusions can be drawn from the work of Long et al about what ligand modifications
impart high temperature stability? These types of questions (and hopefully answers) are what is
missing from the manuscript as currently presented and would, in my opinion, really elevate this
work.
However, there still remains many issues with the grammar and spelling which must be
addressed prior to acceptance and publication. I highlight just a few below (as I stopped after the
summary):
please make the following changes,
Summary - change "ingenious" to "judicious"
change "substitutions" to "substituents"
"attention has been focused on the relationship" rather than "attentions have..."
Figure 1, why isn't the "s" in "stretch state" capitalized?
In Scheme 1, fix the n = 0,1,2 on the right hand side

The references need to be thoroughly revised for format purposes, e.g. reference 114 has no page
range

r Dr. King,
nk you very much for your kindly sending us your evaluation and the referee’s comments on
submission entitled: “Highly branched elastomeric polyethylene accessible via ethylene
o-polymerization using N,N-bidentate chelated nickel pre-catalysts: a survey” [Manuscript
label_version_3
RSOS-180367]. We have considered in detail the comments and revised the manuscript
ordingly (highlighted in yellow) which we hope will meet with your approval.
oint-by point response to the editorial and referee’s comments are given as follows:
torial comments
Overall, the reviewers were of the opinion that the topic of this review is timely and there is
icient interest in the community to warrant coverage of this topic in the journal, but the
cution was a bit off the mark. I suggest the authors revise the manuscript in accordance with
criticisms raised by the reviewers, particularly with respect to grammar and readability.
hors Response: We thank the editor for their comments. We have considered in detail the
cisms raised by the reviewers, revised the manuscript accordingly and highlighted in yellow.
ddition we have revised the whole manuscript and removed all the grammar mistakes.
In addition, I ask that the authors make substantial modifications to the paragraph
ediately after Figure 11 (the paragraph that begins “Similarly, Chen et al. reported a
es….”). In its current form, this paragraph is quite similar to the concluding paragraph in
rence 115 (Macromolecules 2017, 50, 6074).
hors Response: We have extensively edited the paragraph pointed by the editor and
hlighted in yellow in the revised manuscript. In fact this work reported in paragraph pointed
ditor is an extension of our work reported in 2015 (Polymer 2015, 56, 119-122).
iewer 1:
perspective article submitted by Mahmood and Sun is intended to be a survey of the
ature on N,N-bidentate nickel pre-catalysts for the synthesis of highly branched polyethylene
tomers.
he current state, I regret to not recommend publication of this article for several main
sons:
he level of English used in the manuscript is sometimes very poor, which makes it very
cult to read and understand. In particular the abstract and introduction need rewriting. The
guage gets somehow better when the manuscript starts to deal with nickel catalysts though.
conclusion’s language need to be review too.
hors Response: We have revised the abstract, introduction and conclusion as well as whole
uscript where was necessary to modify (highlighted in yellow).
he perspective is meant to deal with branched polyethylene yet there are various sections
. paragraphs: 2. introduction, 2. Mechanism of elastomeric behaviour of polyolefin
tomers, 3.2 alpha-olefins co-polymerization, 3.3 homopolypropylene based-thermoplastic
tomer) which do not deal with polyethylene? This is very confusing. This is also not clear for
reader why the authors are spending some time talking about block-copolymers when the
s is branched polyethylene (so a homopolymer)? This will not be understandable by a
eral readership.
hors Response: We thank the referee for their comments. Our focus is not only to
marize the hyper branched polyethylene elastomers. This manuscript describes the literature
ted to thermoplastic polyolefin elastomers in which nickel complexes are used as
ymerization catalysts. In addition to the type of catalysts, we have summarized all the
tegies for the synthesis of polyolefin elastomers in which particularly nickel complex
lysts were employed for polymerization. However, we have modified the abstract,
oduction to remove the possible confusion for the readers. Hoping this revised manuscript
give better expression to the readers.
he authors need to make a better case as why this new perspective is needed, especially when
r review article on the topic (not that far in time) exists, e.g. “Nickel complex pre-catalysts
thylene polymerization: new approaches to elastomeric materials” in Catal. Sci. Technol.,
3,3, 1172-1179 (by the one of the author himself) or “Neutral Nickel Catalysts for Olefin
mo- and Copolymerization: Relationships between Catalyst Structures and Catalytic
perties” in Chem. Rev., 2015, 115, 12091. The authors need to be clear about this and
post better previous reviews.
hors Response: We thank the referee for their comments. We agree, some review articles
available describing the nickel catalysts for ethylene polymerizations. The review article
utral Nickel Catalysts for Olefin Homo- and Copolymerization: Relationships between
alyst Structures and Catalytic Properties” in Chem. Rev., 2015, 115, 12091” specifically
marize the neutral nickel complexes which are different from the our collected cationic
el catalysts. Second one is our review article “Nickel complex pre-catalysts in ethylene
ymerization: new approaches to elastomeric materials” in Catal. Sci. Technol., 2013, 3, 1172-
9” only summarize the nickel complexes with respect to the ligand structure and catalytic
ormance for ethylene polymerization. But there is no any example is available in which
hanical properties discussed and compared.
contrast, in current manuscript, we have focused not only the catalysts for ethylene
ymerization; we have summarized all the strategies for the synthesis of polyolefin elastomers
h as olefin copolymerization, propylene polymerization, ethylene polymerization) in which
cifically nickel complexes were employed. Our review presents a comprehensive picture of
el catalysts for thermoplastic polyolefin elastomers. We have revised the introduction which
give better expression and attraction to the readers related to the polymer chemistry.
n particular, as it stands, it is very difficult to get a sense of the significance of the results
sented, for example what is the best results of all in this field? Having the results presented
luding mechanical properties, vs target properties of in the form a table will considerably
ance the interest of the manuscript.
hors Response: We thank the referee for their insightful comments. We have added three
tables. Among them two tales summarized the catalytic activities and polymer properties
h as Molecular weight, MW distributions, melting points of polymer, number of branches.
ther table is added for the comparison for the mechanical properties of commercially
yolefin elastomers and all other polymer. These new tables show easy to understand the
tionship between catalysts structure and their catalytic performance and mechanical
perties.
Reading the manuscript, especially the conclusions and future outlook, I could not see any
onal or real “perspective” on the field: what is the state of the field right now? Is it
sfactory? What are the challenges and what are the different avenues that needs to be
lored? Is there are clear structure/activity relationship that has emerged from the literature?
lieve that a perspective needs to provide some rational for existing results but also giving
e keys to the new reader to understand the field and to potentially get into the area.
hors Response: We have modified the conclusion and future outlook according to the
ree suggestions and highlighted in yellow.
er various comments include:
Figure 1 needs to be clearer: the stretch state and recovered state are very similar.
ardless, how does this relate to branched polyethylene?
hors Response: We have revised the Figure 1 and made more clear difference between
tch and recovered states.
What are the target properties for a thermoplastic elastomer, and for branched PE elastomer:
gation at break etc?
hors Response: The highest ultimate tensile strength and elongation at break for
mercially polyolefin elastomers are reported as 13.62 MPa and 845%. These values are
ieved in one of our article reported (Polym. Chem., 2017, 8, 6416).
hors Response:
he authors mention “thermal stability” of the catalysts a lot (I would not qualify 80 degrees
f “elevated temperature” though but: 1) I did not seen any details on how this stability was
ssed in the literature reviewed 2) what is the most thermally stable catalyst reported? Is it
erent from the most active catalyst reported?
hors Response: We thank the referee for their comments. The temperature reported for
el complexes 80 to 100 °C is considered as elevated temperature. There are many articles in
ch 80 °C is reported as elevated temperature (Macromolecules, Vol. 38, 2005,
anometallics 2015, 34, 582-590).
ave there been any computational study trying to rationalise things like steric hindrance and
tronics of the ligand and establish a clear structure/activity relationship?
hors Response: Yes some computational studies are done to rationalize the steric and
tronic factors of the ligand to establish the structure/activity relationship [(a) J. Polym. Sci.,
A: Polym. Chem., 2004, 42, 4765–4774; (b) Macromol. Chem. Phys., 2015, 216, 1125–
]. But in current manuscript is not included.
age 11 line 20, there is no complex 58a?
hors Response: Complex 58a is typos mistake. Actually, it is complex 36a.
iewer: 2
authors, Mahmood and Sun, review the current state-of-the art regarding the use of nickel
lysts as a means of forming thermoplastic polyolefin elastomers by polymerization using a
le ethylene feed. This current approach to materials that resemble commercially important
moplastic elastomers represents an area of great potential and indeed offers, in principle, a
e cost-effective approach than the methods currently employed. The importance of ligand
gn and the impact of these changes on the mechanism (e.g. chain walking) of the
merization is thoroughly discussed and well referenced. Likewise the intrinsic properties of
polymers that make these materials suitable for target application is well outlined.
verall, it is my view that this paper is of sufficient interest to merit publication as perspective
oyal Society Open Science subject to some modifications and in particular in regard to the
erous grammatical errors (mostly with sections 1 and 2). Some additional proof reading is
ranted.
hors Response: We thank the referee for their comments. We have revised whole
uscript and removed all possible grammatical errors (highlighted in yellow).
ome grammatical points that need attention are given below but this list is by no means
austive:
“… most globally use synthetic polymer…”
“…segments is much speculative to address this …”
“…can be precisely control by late transition metals catalysts.
“agnostic”
“…there now a number of successful example…”
“A large number of late transition metal catalysts developed and used for olefin
merization.
“…to gain this goal attention has drawn …”
hors Response: We have removed all grammatical errors pointed by the referee as well as
other in whole manuscript (highlighted in yellow).
Minor point: the use of both ‘bidentate’ and ‘chelated’ in the same title seem unnecessary,
haps better: Highly branched elastomeric polyethylene accessible via ethylene homo-
merization using N,N-chelated nickel pre-catalysts: a survey
hors Response: We thank the referee for their insightful suggestions. We have modified the
according to the referee’s suggestions in the revised manuscript (highlighted in yellow).

mments to the Author(s)
s review by Mahmood and Sun focuses on nickel catalyzed olefin polymerization processes
give thermoplastic polyolefin elastomers. The article discusses select examples of living
merization, ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymerization, homopropylene polymerization, and
oethylene polymerization—the latter topic receiving the most discussion. Overall, I felt that
e sections provided more experimental data than necessary and that more emphasis could be
ed on specific trends or catalyst design principles that could help researchers working in
field. The future perspective statement in the conclusion paragraph is somewhat generic. I
gest that the manuscript be edited for grammatical and stylistic errors (there are many). In
mary, I recommend that the authors revise this manuscript taking into account the
gestions provided.
Perhaps consider modifying the title to include a-olefin polymerization since it was also
ussed.
hors Response: Yes, some discussion about the a-olefin polymerization is included in the
uscript. We have modified the title accordingly in the revised manuscript.
Page 1, Line 48: It is not clear what “statistical copolymer structure” is. Are the authors
rring to the percentage of comonomers, the polymer polydispersity, or something else?
hors Response: Statistical copolymer structure means properties of copolymer highly
end on the comonomer ratio. If comonomer ratio increases than required limit then it gives
hly ductile material which limits the high temperature processing applications. We have
sed the text to remove the possible confusion in this sentence.
Page 1, Lines 50-52: the terms “speculation” and “speculative” were not used correctly,
se change. Also correct that use of this term in the rest of the text.
hors Response: We have modified the text in the revised manuscript (highlighted in yellow).
Figure 1: the “original” and “stretched” state structures look too similar to each other, I
ommend exaggerating the figures a bit more to show contrast.
hors Response: We have enlarged the figure 1 to differentiate between the original and
tched states.
Page 2: Can random copolymers show thermoelastic properties or only block copolymers
? The discussion provided seem to suggest only the latter, which I don’t think is true.
hors Response: In fact both random and block polymer show elastic properties. We have
uded some literature in which mechanical properties are studied.
Page 2, Line 58: the final sentence: “To end this, there are many approaches…” is
tradictory. I don't think that the authors mean to imply that researchers are trying “to end”
development of new methods to make thermoplastics.
hors Response: We have revised the sentence to remove the possible confusion in the
sed manuscript and highlighted in yellow.
cheme 1: This scheme is difficult to understand, please simplify for clarity.
hors Response: In fact this mechanism is more comprehensive as explaining all the steps of
rdination, insertion propagation and chain termination. However, we have modified the
eme 1 for more clarity in revised manuscript.
cheme 2: The bottom left structure after “no chain walking/insertion” looks the same as its
cursor, an additional ethylene unit should be added to the chain.
hors Response: According to the suggestions we have added more ethylene unit in the
ymer chain.
age 6, Line 53: the term “fascinate” is not used properly in this sentence
hors Response: We have revised the sentence and highlighted in yellow.
age 7, Line 41: what is “engender factor”?
hors Response: We have revised the sentence to remove the any possible confusion in the
sed manuscript.
Page 8: perhaps providing a table to summarize the properties of the different nickel
lysts would be helpful to the reader here, otherwise the large amount of data discussed in
section is quite overwhelming. Also, perhaps emphasizing any specific trends would be more
rmative in a review article than listing a lot of specific numbers.
hors Response: We thank the referee for their insightful comments. We have added two new
es and summarized the catalytic activities and polymer properties such as Molecular weight,
distributions, melting points of polymer, number of branches. This table shows easy to
erstand the relationship between catalysts structure and their catalytic performance.
trust our revised manuscript is now suitable for publication in Royal Society Open Science
look forward to your response in due course.

r Dr. King,
nk you for sending us your evaluation and the referee’s comments on the manuscript entitled:
N-chelated nickel catalysts for highly branched polyolefin elastomers: a survey” [Manuscript
label_version_4
RSOS-180367.R1]. We have considered in detail the comments, revised the manuscript
ordingly (highlighted in yellow) which we hope will meet with your approval.
oint-by point response to the editorial and referee’s comments are given as follows:
iewer 3 (comments to author):
his revised review article is much improved from the previous version. The new summary
es are helpful to the reader and provide an easy way to compare the different catalysts.
ough I was able to understand the writing for the most part, some sections still required
a effort to read because of grammar issues. I suggest that the authors consider using a
fessional editing service for this and future manuscripts so that the importance of their work
ot lost in translation. Overall, I recommend publication of this article. A few minor issues are
d below.
hors Response: We thank the referee for their comments. We have now gone through the
uscript in great detail to remove the mistakes and highlighted some significant changes.
age 2 line 30– Perhaps change the title for this subsection to “Characteristics of polyolefin
tomers.” This section really isn’t about their mechanism.
hors Response: We have modified the title to “Characteristics of polyolefin elastomers” as
gested by the referee.
age 3 Scheme 1– In the bottom left structure for “Chain Termination,” the polymer has not
ble bonds. First, how is that formed from the “Chain Propagation” structure? Second, how it
eact with the nickel catalyst in the subsequent step?
hors Response: We thank the referee for their comments. We have rechecked the
hanism and modified in revised manuscript. In the bottom, left structure in the Scheme 1, the
in termination occurred through chain transfer reaction to the Al species. Then addition of
on led to the saturated polymer. We have revised the mechanism and highlighted in yellow.
age 5 line 39: Replace the word “creep” with a suitable term: “The results of creep
eriments proved that…” Do the authors mean rigorous experiments instead?
hors Response: We have removed the word “creep” and modified the sentence (highlighted
ellow).
ables 1 and 3: What are the R groups in the structures depicted?
hors Response: R groups in the Table 1 and 3 represents alkyl substituents. We have added
description about the R group in the Table 1 and Table 3 in the revised manuscript.
iewer 4 (comments to author):
timeliness of a review on this topic is very good and should become a well-cited and widely
d paper upon publication. The authors have done an extensive re-write based upon the first
nd of review comments; they should be commended for this and the manuscript is much
er to read now.
ne aspect the authors, in my opinion, failed to address - despite rewriting the section - was
idea of providing a true outlook or perspective in their final section. What are the challenges
he field, what can these Ni catalysts still not do well? Is catalyst recycling a possibility? I
ee with the authors that for homogeneous catalysis, stability in the range of 80-100C is good,
what conclusions can be drawn from the work of Long et al about what ligand modifications
art high temperature stability? These types of questions (and hopefully answers) are what is
sing from the manuscript as currently presented and would, in my opinion, really elevate this
k.
hors Response: We thank the referee for their insightful comments. A key issue is the lower
mal stability of these nickel complex catalysts which substantially affect not only the
lytic activities but also the properties of the resultant polyethylene. As a result these
ations in the properties of the polymer affect the mechanical properties of the elastomeric
erials. For instance, on elevating the reaction temperature, the branching content and
ecular weight of the polymer substantially modify the mechanical properties (lower
ecular weights and high number of branches at higher temperatures, lower elastic properties
below room temperature, high ductile materials at elevated temperature etc). As with
perature instability issues, the need to control the mechanical properties at elevated
perature is also key target. Hence, we have revised the conclusion and future outlook and
ed more discussion requested by the referee. We hope our revised outlook will give a better
erstanding and overall impression to the readers of polymer chemistry.
cerning the comment regarding recycling of catalysts, it is unlikely that the nickel pre-
lysts in their current form will lend themselves to recycling. Due to the elastomeric nature of
ltant polymer, catalysts may become embedded inside the polymer hence precluding catalyst
very. Nevertheless, alternative future strategies may lend themselves more effectively to
lyst recycling.
owever, there still remains many issues with the grammar and spelling which must be
ressed prior to acceptance and publication. I highlight just a few below (as I stopped after
summary):
se make the following changes,
mary - change "ingenious" to "judicious"
nge "substitutions" to "substituents"
ention has been focused on the relationship" rather than "attentions have..."
hors Response: We thank the referee for highlighting the grammatical issues. We have now
e through the manuscript in great detail to remove the mistakes and highlighted some
ificant changes.
igure 1, why isn't the "s" in "stretch state" capitalized?
hors Response: It was a typographical mistake. Accordingly, we have now capitalized the
in “stretch state” in the revised manuscript.
n Scheme 1, fix the n = 0,1,2 on the right hand side
hors Response: We have now fixed the “n = 0,1,2…” in revised manuscript.
he references need to be thoroughly revised for format purposes, e.g. reference 114 has no
e range
hors Response: We have rechecked all the references and arranged them according to the
plate. However, reference 114 has a somewhat different template criteria. Every article in this
nal has its own page number which starts from 1.
iewer 1 (comments to author):
With this revised manuscript, some of my initial criticism towards the manuscript have
ewhat been attenuated. For example the title, abstract and introduction reflects better the
al scope of this survey (although I am not sure about the use of a scorpio in the graphical
tract, the ligands reviewed are not what the literature has coined "scorpionate" ligand
podal ligands); I also think that the title should reflect that only alpha olefin are dealt with
e). The added tables are also a definitive imporvement and allow the reader to compare
lyst performances. I would however recommend to add the mechanical properties of
(isoprene). polybutadiene and natural rubber as they are the traditional elastomers which
es as benchmark in the field (even if they are not poly(alpha-olefin)s).
hors Response: We thank the referee for their comments. Based on the suggestion, we have
oved "scorpionate" from the graphical abstract. The title of the manuscript is on purpose
ad so as to cover the content of the work. Therefore, it is our preference to keep the title of the
uscript as it is. With regard to the possible mechanical properties of the poly(isoprene),
ybutadiene and natural rubber, these have now been added in Table 2 in the revised
uscript.
However, I am sorry to say that the language and structure (transition between parts etc) is
not to the standard of a Royal Society journal and that it impedes the overall understanding
he manuscript.
pecific example: it should be clearer why the manuscrip present the living/chain walking
merisation mechanism: the start of paragrah 3.1 (please also delete the title 3.1.1 as it is a
-necessary repetition of 3.1) is a nere repetition of the beginning of section 3?
hors Response: We acknowledge the referee’s comments. We have now made every effort
mprove the language and structure, and highlighted some significant changes. Accordingly,
have tried to remove the repetition highlighted and elsewhere in the manuscript.
Also, I was disappointed that although the authors acknowledge that there are some
putational studies rationalise the influence of the steric and electronic factors on the activity
selectivity of the catalysts, they choose not to include them in the manuscript? I do not agree
this omission, especially as the only trend identified in the somewhat very light conclusion is
at "bulky N-aryl ligands complexes are promising precatalysts". I unfortunately recommend
eject this paper. In this current state, it is not of the standard of the Royal Society and of the
.
hors Response: We acknowledge the referee’s point regarding the absence of cited
putational studies in the area. As a consequence, we have now included the corresponding
rences in the manuscript. In addition, we have revised the conclusion and future outlook and
ed more discussion.
ally, all changes are highlighted in yellow in the text. We hope our revised manuscript is now
able for its publication in Royal Society Open Science.
look forward to your response in due course.
