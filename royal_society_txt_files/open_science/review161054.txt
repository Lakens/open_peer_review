I have only two small remarks:
- literature data should be cited wherever used - for example: Still,
young men from Herzegovina (183.4 cm) are among the very tallest in the world and could be
matched
only by the Dutch (183.8 cm), Montenegrins (183.2 cm) and men from southern Dalmatia (183.7
cm; our
preliminary unpublished data).
- authors should be more cautious in bringing conclusions, especially taking into consideration
study limitations in sampling (representativeness, sample size...) - for example: young men from
Herzegovina (183.4 cm) are among the very tallest in the world.

Interesting study but several aspects of it should be published in other journals.
For example, the discussion of the regional distribution of heights would not be interesting to the
general reader of this journal. that information should be published in a local publication in one
of the countries on which this study focuses. Figure 2 would suffice. (Some of the colors do not
seem to match the legend: 184 cm for instance.
tables 1, 2 with regional information could be deleted and published elsewhere.
Fig 5 is not very interesting.
The body proportions could be published by a biology journal such as the Annals of Human
Biology including Table 3.
Table 4 is not very clear. too much information. yet we do not learn anything about those whose
parents did not have a high school education at all.
Table 6 has too much information. Hard to follow.

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
I have only two small remarks:
- literature data should be cited wherever used - for example: Still,
young men from Herzegovina (183.4 cm) are among the very tallest in the world and could be matched
only by the Dutch (183.8 cm), Montenegrins (183.2 cm) and men from southern Dalmatia (183.7 cm; our
preliminary unpublished data).
The source of the average height in Dutch men is Schönbeck et al. (2012), which is quoted in our previous
study (Grasgruber et al., 2014) that is repeatedly cited in the text. But I added it to the list of references
even in the present study.
The source of the data from Montenegro (S. Popovic – pers. communication) was already listed above,
but I added it again.
- authors should be more cautious in bringing conclusions, especially taking into consideration study limitations in
sampling (representativeness, sample size...) - for example: young men from Herzegovina (183.4 cm) are among
the very tallest in the world.
The sample from Herzegovina is quite large - 983 boys. Pineau et al. (2005) reported even higher values
(185.2 cm) in a sample of 819 Herzegovinian boys, although this result is apparently inflated due to the
reliance on the personal communication with teachers. The high values of height around 184 cm also
have analogies in neighbouring regions of Croatia and Montenegro. To support this conclusion, I added
one sentence and the whole paragraph now looks like this:
„Still, young men from Herzegovina (183.4 cm) are among the very tallest in the world and could be
matched only by the Dutch (183.8 cm; [13]), Montenegrins (183.2 cm; S. Popovic – pers. communication)
and Dalmatians (~183.5 cm; our preliminary unpublished results). The data that we have available show
that very tall statures around 184 cm occur in a belt stretching across the territory of three West Balkan
countries - from the western and northern municipalities of Montenegro through Herzegovina to the
Croatian counties of Dubrovnik-Neretva, Split-Dalmatia and Šibenik-Knin.”
I add that I purposely avoid listing any concrete values from Montenegro, because the study of our
Montenegrin colleagues has not been published yet.

Interesting study but several aspects of it should be published in other journals.
For example, the discussion of the regional distribution of heights would not be interesting to the general
reader of this journal. that information should be published in a local publication in one of the countries on
which this study focuses.
Figure 2 would suffice. (Some of the colors do not seem to match the legend: 184 cm for instance.
tables 1, 2 with regional information could be deleted and published elsewhere.
I am afraid that we cannot come to an agreement in these matters, because the description of the
regional differences in height in the Western Balkans was de facto the main purpose of this study. It is
emphasized both in the introduction and in ‚Methods‘ section.
Besides the extraordinary averages of body height, the large difference in regional means is another
integral aspect of the anthropological research in the West Balkan region. The differences within BiH
reach 5 cm, which has hardly any analogy in Europe, and the difference across the borders of
Montenegro/Albania is 9 cm, which is the largest height gap between two neighbouring countries in the
world (together with USA/Mexico and North Korea/South Korea).
Therefore, I must ask for understanding with regard to all non-technical issues related to the perceived
importance of data or to the article’s length. The benefits of publishing in RSOS lie just in the absence of
any limitations in these matters. See also my comments below on the inclusion/exclusion of body
proportions or the reduction of the text.
As for colors in the figure 2, there are averages in individual towns, which can sometimes be higher than
the average of the whole region. For example, the average of Livno is 184.4 cm and the average of
Tomislavgrad is 184.6 cm, but boys from these two towns make up only 62% of the total sample in the
canton Livno/10, whose mean is 183.7 cm.
Fig 5 is not very interesting.
OK. I put it to the supplementary file.
In the meantime, I added Figure 4a (maize production). The statistical relationship in this figure is barely
significant and it may not be so interesting at first glance, but maize production has a significant
explanatory power in the regression analysis. I don’t insist on publishing this figure in the main text, but I
think that it would be better to have both two significant nutritional predictors together.

The body proportions could be published by a biology journal such as the Annals of Human Biology including
Table 3.
Personally, I can imagine this paper without these data, but before the submission to RSOS, a shortened
version of this article focusing on socioeconomic predictors of height in Bosnia and Herzegovina was
submitted to Economics and Human Biology. The article was not accepted, because the amount of
available statistical data was not sufficient for a meaningful detailed analysis, but it is noteworthy to
mention a response that we got from one reviewer:
„Page 6: 'The data of sitting height will be published in a separate paper'.
Nevertheless, it might still be interesting to know something of these data. It's clear that these Bosnian
boys are very tall by contemporary standards, but is this because they have longer legs, longer torsos or
both? It may be worth comparing the answer with Tanner et al.'s well-known paper on the secular
trend in the heights of Japanese children during the twentienth century.“
As you can see, the view of importance of these data may differ from person to person. We wanted to
publish these data separately, because we thought that they wouldn’t be interesting for a specialized
socioeconomic journal, but the reviewer recommended to include them in the article. Actually, what this
reviewer noted is reflected by the data: Herzegovinian boys are taller than boys from Bosnia, mainly
because they have longer legs. The values of body proportions also differ by age, which indicates that at
the age of 17-18 years, the growth of some boys is not finished yet. These are all quite interesting pieces
of information.
I think that this case illustrates that it would be better to include all major findings (regional differences in
height + sitting height) in a single article. It also shows that if we wanted to publish some data separately,
they might not be sufficiently interesting for specialized journals. Therefore, I would want to avoid
chancing luck in another journals, because it can take many months and it is quite possible that
eventually, these data would not be published at all. Readers, who are uninterested in this information
can always skip several paragraphs, while other readers would have to look for it in another journal, and it
is also quite likely that this journal would not be publicly accessible.
Table 4 is not very clear. too much information. yet we do not learn anything about those whose parents did
not have a high school education at all.
I admit that the description to this table was not sufficiently clear. In the meantime, I realized it, too. Let
me know, please, if it is already clearer.

Page 15: To the discussion about ethnic differences in Mostar, I added the following sentence and footnote:
Because Serbs and Montenegrins consume a lot of pork4, it is possible that the same nutritional factors
influence differences in height between (Bosniak) Sarajevo and (Serbian) Istocno Sarajevo.
Footnote: 4 According to the FAOSTAT database (http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/CL), the mean consumption of
pork protein in Serbia & Montenegro between 1993-2005 was 15.4 g/day, which was the third highest value in Europe
after Austria and Spain. During the same period, the mean consumption of pork protein in Croatia (4.9 g/day) and
Bosnia & Herzegovina (1.5 g/day) was very low.
The difference between the Bosniak city of Sarajevo (181.8 cm) and the Serbian part - Istocno Sarajevo (184.0
cm) is even larger than between Croats and Bosniaks in Herzegovina.
Table 6 has too much information. Hard to follow.
During our previous submissions to Economic and Human Biology, we were expressly advised to present
all regression models in such tables to show, how the strength of models (adjusted R2 values) changes
with various combinations of explanatory variables.
But to make it clearer, I deleted b*-values, because partial correlations (r-values) are quite sufficient. I
also added the words „Strength of models“ to the penultimate row.

I think that the study should be condensed to about half of its current size for publication by the Royal Society.
While I admit that technical issues are objective, we are again dealing with opinions on length or
importance, which are often subjective. As I already explained above, I am convinced that we should
rather retain the data intact, because other readers may view these issues differently. The article has
about 5800 words, which may be more than average, but it is certainly not extremely long. A lot of
information would have to be excluded, if we wanted to reduce the text by half. Therefore, I am again
asking for understanding with regard to these issues.
There are publications cited for the Y haplogroup I-M170 distribution. But it is not clear to me how fine grained
this information is and how much of it pertains to the region studied. why is it not included in Table 6, for
instance. Not available for the cantons?
Unfortunately, this information is still very fragmentary. Here, I am sending locations sampled in Croatia
by Barac et al. (2003).
Here are locations sampled in Bosnia and Herzegovina by Marjanovic et al. (2005). The authors list data
for the three main ethnic groups. They also display all individual towns, from which the sampled
individuals came, but the samples would be very small (few individuals from each town).
These are locations from Pericic et al. (2005), partly taken from Barac et al. (2003).
So at best, there would be three towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina that would be useable. In Dalmatia,
there would be at least three additional locations, but we still haven’t finished our research in Dalmatia
and we have data on body height only from Dubrovnik. Therefore, such a regional comparison would be
meaningful only after finishing the work in Dalmatia. I am also trying to get some regional averages of Y
haplogroup frequencies from Montengro.
Another study that shows that Croats were very tall relative to neighboring countries is John Komlos,
“Anthropometric Evidence on Economic Growth, Biological Well Being, and Regional Convergence in the
Habsburg Monarchy, 1850 – 1910,” Cliometrica, 1 (2007), no 3, pp. 211-237.
This work was quoted in our previous study published in Economics and Human Biology (Grasgruber, P.,
Cacek, J., Kalina, T., & Sebera, M. (2014). The role of nutrition and genetics as key determinants of the
positive height trend. Economics & Human Biology, 15, 81-100). It is quite certain that it will be again
cited in our future paper dealing with Dalmatians.
