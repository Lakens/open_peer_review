General comments
In this interesting and timely study, Graham and colleagues investigate harbour porpoise
responses to pile driving over a period of several months, and explore the factors that may
contribute to the likelihood of responding. Results are important for the management of these
developments and for devising appropriate strategies to minimize impacts during construction.
The sampling design is robust, and results are presented clearly and concisely. I particularly
appreciated the extensive discussion of the practical implications of these findings. I have a
couple of general comments, and a few more detailed ones that I list below.
Throughout the manuscript, I found that indications of the uncertainty in model results and
predictions were lacking. For example, the distances at which the expected response is 50% or the
percentages of individuals displaced within a 26-km radius are presented as single numbers. This
carries the danger of these numbers being used as fixed truths in future policies (just as the 26 km
radius is used now). Rather than reporting single expected values, I would refer to the confidence
intervals.
I found the description of the approach used to define a response slightly confusing (as I detail
below). Overall, I like the solution the authors have devised, but it took a while to wrap my head
around it, so I suggest rethinking the presentation of the methods to improve clarity (below I
suggest using a sample timeline with the indication of the various periods).
Finally, I have some concerns on the use of proportional changes in occurrence as a measure of
response. This should in theory account for any seasonal variability in occurrence, but, if
occurrence is very low in some periods of the year, proportions likely become noisier, and a
temporal trend in the response becomes harder to tease apart from the temporal trend in
occurrence (see also my comment below on the short reference window used). Another
complication of using proportional change is that it cannot disentangle permanent changes in
occurrence; in other words, it is currently assumed that a 96-h interval is sufficient for the
occurrence to return to baseline, but porpoises could be leaving and not returning. Remaining
individuals may be less responsive (as the authors briefly discuss) and more responsive
individuals could be simply kept away from these locations because the interval between events
is not sufficient for them to return. This would therefore not be an indication of diminishing
response or tolerance/habituation (as implied in most of the manuscript, including the title), but
rather of an intense, prolonged effect. I think it is worth checking whether there is any indication
of these processes occurring, for example by repeating the analysis only using events separated
by longer gaps (192 h?), or investigating any temporal trend in occurrence in baseline periods
(and comparing this trend with the trend in responses). These checks could be included in the
Supplementary material.
Detailed comments
Line 16: I would clarify that ‘location’ refers to the location of piles being driven; this only became
clear after reading the Methods section.
3
Line 37: Please cite the recent review of the population consequences of disturbance framework
(Pirotta et al. 2018, Ecology and Evolution, https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.4458).
Line 42: You could cite the work by Miller et al. 2014 (JASA, doi: 10.1121/1.4861346) on killer
whale dose-response analysis. Also, it is worth mentioning the study by Moretti et al. 2014 (PLoS
One; doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0085064) in this section; they have also used passive acoustics to
quantify group-level risk functions.
Lines 85-90: You currently do not list your assessment of the effects of shipping traffic among the
aims, which I find as important as the ADD analysis.
Lines 113-116: You may be aware that updated weighting functions have recently been published
by Southall et al. (2019; Aquatic Mammals, doi: 10.1578/AM.45.2.2019.125). I don’t think it’s
necessary to rerun the entire analysis, but it would be interesting to compare how the weighting
differs in the updated version.
Lines 126-129: A few aspects are unclear in this section: 1) How did you compute DPH (which
you define as detection positive hours per day) over a 12-h period? 2) Why is the 48-h baseline
period calculated from the start of piling for 24 h analysis, and from the end of piling for the 12 h
analysis? This seems like an important detail but I struggle to see a justification. 3) Do I
understand correctly that a 12-h period is used as a baseline for the 12-h analysis, and a 24-h
period for the 24-h analysis? In general, it might help to have a schematic representation of the
timeline for one piling event, identifying the two response and the two baseline periods.
Line 135-136: The description of how this baseline variation was computed and used only became
clear after reading the Supplementary material. I would consider bringing that section (Figure S1)
into the main text, for clarity. Also, I understand your rationale, but this approach implicitly
assumes that the proportional change in occurrence in those two weeks in March is
representative of proportional changes over an entire year. This could be true, but I could also
imagine a scenario where the proportional change in occurrence varies seasonally (if, for instance,
porpoises use the area more transiently in one season and more consistently in another). I think
this assumption is quite important, and should be mentioned in the Discussion. Also, the baseline
proportional change is only calculated for a 24-h period. I’d be curious to know if the 99th
percentile change remains the same when considering 12-h windows.
Line 146: From Table S1 and the Discussion, I gather there was only one event where no ADD
was used. I agree this is still an important piece of information, and it should be reported.
However, with one sample, you cannot rule out the option that some other confounding factor
has contributed to porpoises reacting less on that day. I think you should discuss this carefully
and tone down your statements regarding the use of ADDs throughout the manuscript. This is an
important preliminary observation, but at the moment it is highly correlative.
Line 149: I assume that by ‘response period’, you mean the 12-h and 24-h windows, and not the
period of piling, correct?
Line 152: You should probably test for any remaining autocorrelation in model residuals.
Line 154: Did you use REML to fit your mixed-effects models in lme4? If so, you cannot use AIC
to compare models with different fixed-effects components (see here, for example:
https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/131272/lme4-why-is-aic-no-longer-displayed-when-
using-reml). The models must be refitted using ML for comparison between different fixed-effect
4
structures (the function extractAIC should do that automatically). In my experience, results often
do not change much.
Line 175: ‘Highly significant’ implies the use of some hypothesis test, of which I could not find
any mention in the text. Also, if this is indeed statistical significance, I would remove the word
‘highly’: after choosing a significance level, a result is either significant or not.
Line 216: Again, I suggest citing Moretti et al. 2014 here.
Line 269: And I would cite Pirotta et al. 2018 here.

nuscript is a welcomed addition of results to a highly relevant area for management and conservation.
aith and hope is currently being put into agent based modelling to supply answers needed for tough
ns, but as always with models the quality of these answers depends critically on the quality of the input
the study confirms results from previous studies with similar setups, showing reaction distances to pile
in the range of tens of kms, but adds to our understanding of the temporal development of the
e (possible habituation) and relative importance of the different noise sources (pile driving and ADDs).
dy is well designed. While there is no reason to expect issues with analysis of sound recordings and
ng of sound exporures, not enough details are provided to judge this. Same could be said about the C-
ta, but here analysis seems to follow de facto standards for this type of studies. There are some issues
erpretation if the results, as outlined in the detailed comments below.
The word dose-response curve should be reserved to responses in individual animals. As the authors
emselves in the main text, the reduced reaction distance with time could be due to a displacement of
nsitive individuals (a form of survivor bias), which means that the dose-response curves of the
als could remain constant, but the composition of animals change.
It is clear that ADDs can cause reactions in porpoises at tens of km distance, but no-one has shown or
ggested that vessel noise could have such far-reaching effects.
2-108. Details about analysis of the acoustic measurements are missing. What acoustic metrics were
ed and with what temporal resolution? How much of the data was analysed? All of it, or smaller
s considered statistically representative? If the latter, how was that justified? information about the
ng of sound propagation is lacking completely. Which type of model was used and what software
entation? What was the frequency resolution of the modelling and what environmental layers were
ll of this must be described in some detail (perhaps in supplementary material), if the reader is going to
y faith in the modelled map on figure 2. How was the measured data used in the modelling and how
s the model able to predict measured levels?
3-116. How was the audiogram-weighting function derived from Kastelein et al 2002 different from the
ised NOAA-curve (derived from the same data)? Was the uncorrected data from Kastelein 2002 used, or
rected data from Kastelein et al (2010)? The uncorrected 2002 data are wrong and should not be used.
or an equation for the audiogram-weighting should be given, in order for others to replicate the
.
1-146 (and later). It is an inherent limitation of studies with this design that distance to source is
nded with received source level. This is mentioned by the authors, but perhaps should be made even
ear to the reader.
6-189. Although mentioned later in the discussion, it should be clear already here that a decrease in
e detections in the presence of vessels could indicate either a response of porpoises, a masking of
ons of the C-POD by the vessel noise, or both. At the moment, it is not possible to tell the two effects
nd great care should be taken in interpretation of these results.
4. As stated above, there are two issues with using dose-response curve in this context: the distance-
mbiguity and the fact that you are not evaluating responses of individuals, but evaluating the proportion
ocal population that reacts.
8-200. There are at least two problematic issues with the interpretation of the ADD result:
There is only one exposure of each type, which means that from a purist point of view the conclusion is
not valid. Strictly, it can only be said that the animals reacted less to piling #62 than #61, but without
replicates it could be a coincidence. I don’t think so, but you have not demonstrated it convincingly.
See Dähne et al (2017) for support for the conclusion, but in any case you must argue more
convincingly. Even though there are no replicate exposures, there are replicate measurements. They
are pseudoreplications in relation to the stimulus (you don’t know whether it really is the ADD or
something else), but true replicates with respect to the response itself.
When comparing the noise level from the two exposures are you then evaluating the weighted level of
the ADD signal or the pile driving noise? If the assumption is that they respond to the ADD, it should be
the level of that sound which is used, not the pile driving noise. In any case, it would be useful to have
both measures of ADD and pile driving noise.
7-208. This sentence does not really make sense, for several reasons. First, dose-response (in my
) relates to individuals, not populations. Such dose-response relationships can only be determined by
tion, and serve as input to the models, not output. Second, there can be legitimate reasons for
ng based on habitat loss (even if temporary), when it comes to protected or otherwise sensitive areas.
se areas minimizing habitat loss may be a goal in itself, even if the long-term survival of the population
kely to be compromised directly.
4. Why potential disturbance? You (as many others before you) are measuring actual disturbance, not
al.
3-227. You should also consult the studies on bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, e.g. Bejder, L., A.
s, H. Whitehead, and N. Gales. 2006. Interpreting short-term behavioural responses to disturbance
longitudinal perspective. Animal Behaviour 72:1149-1158. Responses in naive porpoises from Moray
ay or may not be transferable to porpoises in the southern North Sea. Little is known about both
ions, but differences in prior exposure (as mentioned), but also how local or wide roaming the
ions are, are important to keep in mind when transferring conclusions from one area to the other.
2-258. Why is it less likely that they change vocal behaviour?. There are results from German wind farms
ow that porpoise detections reappear close to the piling size so fast after end of the pile driving that it is
ble that they could have swam back. They must have been there all the time, just less detectable
cally (and from aerial surveys). Anyways, cessation of vocalisations is as much a response as fleeing, so
inction does not invalidate the results. One can in fact argue that the impact on the animals is larger if
main more or less motionless in the area, compared to fleeing to somewhere else, where they can
feeding.
2. How can you claim that 5E-4 animals/km2 is a relatively high density? This is a density corresponding
han 5 porpoises in the entire Moray Firth. Detection conditions in the Baltic are very different from the
ea, not just because of fewer animals, but also because of the low salinity. The logic simply isn’t there
re is no experimental evidence to support the claim that environmental conditions did not affect
on probabilities. The key question is whether any effects could be large enough to affect your
ions.
1-312. Do not add new results in the discussion. Please describe these results in the results section
r with the other ADD results.
8-322. It is important that you qualify this statement about vessel noise further. Are you implying that
es responded to the vessels around the piling site at distances comparable to the pile driving noise and
D? Or is this a local response to service boats to and from the wind farm, passing by the C-PODs far away
e wind farm? The first claim requires substantially better support from data than what you have
ed. The second claim may be valid, but less relevant to the discussion of effects of the pile driving per

Appendix B
We thank both Reviewers for all their time and effort in reviewing our paper. Although the comments were
extensive, they were supportive and entirely constructive. We therefore found ourselves in an unusual position
where we were genuinely happy to take action on all the comments, and we appreciate the improvement the
comments should have made to the manuscript.
Underlined text (in this Response) indicates the action we have taken in response to the Reviewers’ comments. We
have uploaded a version of the manuscript with the changes tracked
