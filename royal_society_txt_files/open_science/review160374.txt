label_comment_1
The authors report a new procedure for the homologation of aldehyde into enals, using
the reagent DualPhos designed by the same group. They show that the latent aldehyde function
can be carried through numerous steps under demanding conditions, making this method really
useful in organic synthesis. Indeed, they elegantly apply it to the total synthesis of phomolide G.
The manuscript is concise and well written. I have only one correction; fifth line of results and
Discussion section, it should be "suitable bases".
However, the supporting information needs a little more work. In my view, it is not
necessary to describe the synthesis of known compounds (such as the Nagao auxiliary for
example) and the experimental procedures and spectra for these compounds should be removed
and replaced by adequate references. The melting point of the final product is missing. Finally,
some NMR spectra show impurities and should be replaced by spectra of clean compounds if
possible (11, 13, 15a, 18, 21 and 30).
In light of these comments, I recommend publication of this manuscript in Royal Society
Open Science when the revisions mentioned above have been made.

The manuscript describes advances on the use of the 2-pinacolacetal-tripropylphosphonium salt
DualPhos as a general reagent for the two-carbon aldehyde to alkenal homologation and a
chemoselective iron (III) chloride mediated deprotection. This is a simple Wittig coupling, and no
any novel chemistry was found. Therefore, the reviewer does not recommend publication.

McNulty and coworkers demonstrated the use of 2-pinacolacetal-tripropylphosphonium salt
DualPhos as a general reagent for the two-carbon homologation of aldehydes leading directly to
latent (E)-alkenals. Olefination of sensitive, enolisable aldehydes can be conducted efficiently
under non-aqueous conditions. A chemoselective iron (III) chloride mediated deprotection was
also developed. This strategy allows isolation of the latent-alkenal intermediates or direct
hydrolysis to (E)-alkenals. The robust chemical stability of the latent alkenals was also
demonstrated in a total synthesis of the macrolactone phomolide G.
Although the same group has already reported the use of DualPhos in aqueous Wittig reactions
of aldehydes in Green Chemistry (ref 3a). In this paper, they have expanded the substrate scope
from non-enolisable aromatic aldehydes to more sensitive enolisable aldehydes. And this new
methodology has been successfully applied to simply the total synthesis of macrolactone
phomolide G. This paper is well organized and written, the citation of literatures is proper, the
characterization of compounds is complete. The referee would recommend this paper to be
accepted by Royal Society Open Science after minor revisions.

Dear Dr. Niitsoo
We attach the revised version of our manuscript entitled “ DualPhos: a versatile, chemoselective
reagent for two-carbon aldehyde to latent alkenal homologation application in the total synthesis of
phomolide G”, recently accepted for publication at RS Open Science.
Manuscript ID: RSOS-160374,
We have uploaded the files as requested.
The main body of the manuscript now incorporates all suggested information including Data
accessibility, Competing interests, Authors’ contributions and Funding statement. All referee
comments have also been taken into account as summarised below.
Reviewer: 1
All compounds (Nagao auxiliaries, Garner aldehyde etc) that have previously been reported in the literature have
been removed and referenced only.
Final compound is a non-crystalline amorphous solid, Wording has been changed accordingly.
Compounds containing trace geometrical isomers (e.g. 11 and 13) are described as such in the text. Spectra of
compounds 21 and 30 (approx. 95% purity) are of somewhat unstable allylic-alkenals that are used immediately.
In light of these comments, I recommend publication of this manuscript in Royal Society Open Science
when the revisions mentioned above have been made.
Reviewer: 2
N/A
Reviewer: 3
Last page numbers inserted. “And” has been removed from between last two author names.
Scheme has been modified and spelling mistakes corrected.
All of the above corrections have been made in the SI .
We look forward to hearing from you on the status of our submission in the near future.
Sincerely,
Jim McNulty (on behalf of co-author)
