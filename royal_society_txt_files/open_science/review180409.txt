This paper explains that the transport speed of Novomessor ants during collective carry declines
predictably with the size of the group carrying the load. The explanation is consistent with
statistical expectations given a normal distribution of ant speeds given that the load moves at the
speed of the slowest individual. The prediction is confirmed using experiments with mobile
robots. It’s a very nice use of a simple model, verified with robotic experiments, to explain a
biological phenomenon.
The paper is well-written, interesting, and an excellent contribution. Terms, equations and figures
are explained clearly and concisely. There is a nice balance between the ant and robot focus. The
setup with the force-resistor and fiducial tag for tracking is an excellent one for testing the
hypothesis in the paper.
However, there are two issues that I think should be addressed.
First, lines 194 – 221 are a bit confusing and almost seem contradictory. It’s stated that significant
rotation of the load is not observed in ant experiments. But the robot solution appears to rely on
perceived rotation of the load. Is this purported to be the case for ants, and if so, why isn’t
rotation of the load observed? I think the authors are suggesting that small corrections occur
before the load rotates a large amount (that’s what is implied about robot movement in 212 – 221,
but again it’s not completely clear). It would help to completely explain what is hypothesized for
ants (line 209) before beginning the explanation of robot experiments. Is it assumed that ants
given knowledge of the location of the goal can sense small rotations away from that goal? Is it
also assumed that they sense changes in force, allowing immediate corrections in speed without
requiring large rotations of the load?
Second, the role of the simple ML routine isn’t clear. Is there not a simpler mechanism that would
allow ants to detect rotation and adjust speed accordingly. Line 253 – 256 seems to justify why the
ML approach is required (rather than a much more simple feedback mechanism based on
rotation of the load, but it’s not clear to me that they would get stuck in loops (ie could a small
random perterbuation more simply address the problem of loops?). It would be helpful to see a
demonstration of why a simple feedback mechanism (slow if rotating) is not effective. Such an
explanation would justify why the procedure in Fig 6 is necessary for ants or robots.
Minor comments:
- The concept of stigmergy is mentioned several times, but explained only the third time it is used
in the paper.
- When the neural network is introduced, it was not that clear to me what the rewards and
penalties to the robots were.

This modelling and robotics paper is an excellent addition to the experimental work that is
already submitted to PLoS ONE. Attempting to explain the counter-intuitive result that
cooperatively transported loads move slower as more ants join the moving team, the authors
propose two models and test these models in a collective robotics system. In doing so they not
only provide evidence that the collective speed conforms to the speed of the slowest team-mate,
but also provide valuable control algorithms for teams of robot movers. The experimental design
is excellent, and the manuscript is well written. My recommendation is for acceptance after minor
revision.
Reading through the manuscript, it seemed obvious to me that if rapid transport of food items
back to the nest is valuable, there would be a strong evolutionary pressure to select for a simple
rule – ants sensing they are the slowest transporters should disengage from transport. This would
lead to faster transport times and could be accomplished using the mechanisms proposed in this
manuscript. The authors propose the logical ultimate explanation of enhanced robustness of
transport in the final parts of the discussion, however I feel that transport speed vs robustness
should be a stronger theme that runs through the manuscript. To this end, it would be very
useful if the authors could provide any observations of this behaviour during ant transport – did
ants ever disengage from transport, and was this behaviour more likely for slow-transporting
ants? It may be that this data appears in Reference 13.
In Figure 3, we see a trend of decreasing velocity with increasing group size. In the single-ant-
transport scenario, we see a large variation in absolute velocity, but what was the individual
transport speeds of the ants in the >1-transporter scenarios? If slower ants are over-represented in
these group-transport scenarios, then we could expect to see decreasing load velocities simply as
an average of individual transporter speeds, rather than the proposed mechanism of social
conformation to the slowest transporter. Presumably this data appears in Reference 13, and if so,
the group compositions need further explanation here.
Basic statistical tests are completely absent in the manuscript, and need to be provided for the
data in Figures 3, 7 and 8. For instance in Figure 3, we see a decreasing trend, but there is no
explanation of statistical significance of comparisons of each group. Similarly in Figures 7 and 8,
simple tests such as an ANOVA would provide statistical reassurance that indeed mean load
velocity does not vary with the addition of extra robots and out-of-phase stepping. A lack of
descriptive statistics is normally grounds for rejection, but I do not believe that in this case the
necessary statistical reporting will change the results or discussion.
The authors provide a link to a Github repository, however it appears broken and needs to be
4
fixed (I received a 404 error when I clicked on the link).
Other than these minor points, I think this is an excellent manuscript and a very worthy addition
of knowledge to the field.

We are happy to receive positive reviews for this manuscript. We understand the issues
brought up by you and the reviewers, and we hope that this cover letter combined with
the new revision will address them adequately and make this a stronger manuscript

Response to Associate Editor Comments
‘‘I am happy to report that the reviewers’ comments came back favourable overall, with
minor suggestions for improvement. Please address the points made by the reviewers;
these will greatly clarify your manuscript and im prove its contribution to your field.
Most importantly, please address the questions with regards to the status of the related
PLoS One submission and Github repository link.’’
We are very pleased that this work was well received. We have addressed the
reviewers’ comments below.
The PloS One manuscript is still under review, after several rounds of revision in
response to referee comments. Based on the editor’s feedback, we are optimistic about
the outcome and expect a decision very soon. In the meantime, we can either cite the
manuscript as under review, if Scientific Reports allows that, or we can delay
publication of the current paper until the status of the PLoS One paper is resolved.
The Github repository link did not work because a LaTeX error added extra symbols.
This link has now been corrected and verified to work.
Again, we appreciate the feedback on this manuscript to make it a better contribution
to the community.
Response to Reviewer #1
‘‘This paper explains that the transport speed of Novomessor ants during collective

is consistent with statistical expectations given a normal distribution of ant speeds
given that the load moves at the speed o the slowest individual. The prediction is

are explained clearly and concisely. There is a nice balance between the ant and robot
focus. The setup with the force-resistor and fiducial tag for tracking is an excellent one
for testing the hypothesis in the paper.
However, there are two issues that I think should be addressed.’’
Thank you for the kind words about this work. We address the specific changes made
to address your concerns below.
‘‘First, lines 194-221 are a bit confusing and almost seem contradictory. It’s stated that
significant rotation of the load is not observed in ant experiments. But the robot
solution appears to rely on perceived rotation of the load. Is this purported to be the
case for ants, and if so, why isn’t rotation of the load observed? I think the authors are
suggesting that small corrections occur before the load rotates a large amount (that’s
what is implied about robot movement in 212-221, but again it’s not completely clear).
It would help to completely explain what is hypothesized for ants (line 209) before
beginning the explanation of robot experiments. Is it assumed that ants given
knowledge of the location of the goal can sense small rotations away from that goal? Is
it also assumed that they sense changes in force, allowing immediate corrections in
speed without requiring large rotations of the load?’’
These are all good points that needed further clarification. We are indeed hypothesizing
what you suggest: that ants detect small rotations or rotational forces, and act to
reduce these before they become large. We have included this assumption in lines 212-
214 of the revised manuscript. We have also added another assumption about the ants
in lines 214-219 (see our response to your next comment).
‘‘Second, the role of the simple ML routine isn’t clear. Is there not a simpler mechanism
that would allow ants to detect rotation and adjust speed accordingly. Line 253-256
seems to justify why the ML approach is required (rather than a much more simple
feedback mechanism based on rotation of the load), but it’s not clear to me that they
would get stuck in loops (i.e. could a small random perturbation more simply address
the problem of loops?). It would be helpful to see a demonstration of why a simple
feedback mechanism (slow if rotating) is not effective. Such an explanation would
justify why the procedure in Fig 6 is necessary for ants or robots.’’
As we now describe in lines 214-219, we assume that the ants do not know their
positions on the payload relative to its center of mass (COM). Thus, they do not know
the effect of their acceleration on the rotation of the load, and therefore cannot use a
simple feedback control scheme. To illustrate, for the configuration in Figure 1a, the ant
at the bottom must speed up to negate a counterclockwise rotation of the load,
whereas the ant at the top must slow down. However, because we assume that the
ants do not know their positions relative to the load’s COM, they do not know whether
speeding up or slowing down will negate the load’s rotation. The machine learning (ML)
algorithm enables the robots, which also do not know their positions relative to the
load’s COM, to determine the effect of their acceleration on the load’s rotation and then
implement an appropriate feedback controller to cancel this rotation.
We have rephrased our explanation of “robots getting stuck in loops” in lines 269-275.
‘‘Minor comments:
The concept of stigmergy is mentioned several times, but explained only the third time
it is used in the paper. We have now defined stigmergy the first time it appears in the
paper (lines 11-12). We have also clarified the type of stigmergic feedback that is used
in our robot controllers (lines 201-203).
When the neural network is introduced, it was not that clear to me what the rewards
and penalties to the robots were.’’
We have added three sentences below the reward function in Equation (14) that
explain the rewards and penalties defined by this function.
Response to Reviewer #2
‘‘This modeling and robotics paper is an excellent addition to the experimental work
that is already submitted to PLoS ONE. Attempting to explain the counter-intuitive
result that cooperatively transported loads move slower as more ants join the moving
team, the authors propose two models and test these models in a collective robotics
system. In doing so they not only provide evidence that the collective speed conforms
to the speed of the slowest teammate, but also provide valuable control algorithms for
teams of robot movers. The experimental design is excellent, and the manuscript is

We are glad that you find the work contained in this paper worthwhile and
wellpresented. We address your comments below.
‘‘Reading through the manuscript, it seemed obvious to me that if rapid transport of

to select for a simple rule - ants sensing they are the slowest transporters should
disengage from transport. This would lead to faster transport times and could be

the logical ultimate explanation of enhanced robustness of transport in the final parts of
the discussion, however I feel that transport speed vs robustness should be a stronger
theme that runs through the manuscript. To this end, it would be very useful if the
authors could provide any observations of this behaviour during ant transport - did ants
ever disengage from transport, and was this behaviour more likely for slow-
transporting ants? It may be that this data appears in Reference 13.’’
Transporting ants certainly do let go of the load sometimes (Buffin & Pratt 2016), but
we are not proposing disengagement from the load as a solution to slow ants. The
problem with this solution is that the smaller team would then have a higher per capita
burden, which would slow the team down, unless the disengaged ant was sufficiently
slow. Instead, we explore speed adjustment assuming a constant team composition.
We do not yet have relevant observations to determine whether slow ants are more
likely to disengage from transport, because we have not identified the intrinsically slow
ants in a given transport team. That would require new experiments with marked ants
whose transport histories and typical speeds are known.
‘‘In Figure 3, we see a trend of decreasing velocity with increasing group size. In the
single-ant-transport scenario, we see a large variation in absolute velocity, but what
was the individual transport speeds of the ants in the >1-transporter scenarios? If
slower ants are over-represented in these group-transport scenarios, then we could
expect to see decreasing load velocities simply as an average of individual transporter
speeds, rather than the proposed mechanism of social conformation to the slowest
transporter. Presumably this data appears in Reference 13, and if so, the group
compositions need further explanation here.’’
These are interesting questions, but we do not yet have this kind of data for the ants.
As noted in our response above, we do not know the intrinsic speeds of the team
members. What we have shown here is that, assuming variation in intrinsic speed, a
mechanism of the sort that we model might explain the ants’ behavior. In future
research, the kinds of measurements suggested here will have to be obtained.
‘‘Basic statistical tests are completely absent in the manuscript, and need to be
provided for the data in Figures 3, 7 and 8. For instance in Figure 3, we see a
decreasing trend, but there is no explanation of statistical significance of comparisons
of each group. Similarly in Figures 7 and 8, simple tests such as an ANOVA would
provide statistical reassurance that indeed mean load velocity does not vary with the
addition of extra robots and out-of-phase stepping. A lack of descriptive statistics is
normally grounds for rejection, but I do not believe that in this case the necessary
statistical reporting will change the results or discussion.’’
We have added Tukey range tests (lines 103-107) for the data in Figure 3 and ANOVA
tests (lines 335) for the data in Figure 8. In the first row of Figure 7, which shows the
mean load velocity during the robot experiments with the learning algorithm, we have
changed the light blue shaded region in the three plots to show the 95% confidence
interval rather than the standard deviation. As we now point out in lines 318-320, this
interval contains the maximum speed of the slowest transporter in the team, which is 4
cm/s, for all three robot team sizes.
‘‘The authors provide a link to a Github repository, however it appears broken and
needs to be fixed (I received a 404 error when I clicked on the link).’’
There was a LaTeX error that added more symbols to the hyperlink. The link has now
been corrected and verified.
‘‘Other than these minor points, I think this is an excellent manuscript and a very
worthy addition of knowledge to the field.’’
Thank you, we appreciate the time and effort put into reviewing this work.
