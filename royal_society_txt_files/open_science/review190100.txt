The authors of the manuscript “Ultra bright emission from Sr doped TiO2 nanoparticles through
r-GO conjugation” have discussed the enhancement of defect-related PL emission after doping
and rGO conjugation. I do not recommend the acceptance of the manuscript based on the
following points.
1. The authors have prepared TiO2 at a calcination temperature of 400 oC. They got a mixture of
three peaks; anatase, rutile and brookite. It is understood that anatase and brookite are the
metastable phases and can be formed at low calcination temperature and in a low reaction
temperature too. But, the formation of rutile phase needs to be supported with proper evidence.
Rutile being the most stable form of TiO2 are usually formed at high calcination temperature.
2. The line "Sr facilitate the brookite phase might be due to polycrystalline nature of Sr related
compounds". It is not clearly presented. What types of compounds ? SrO, SrCO3 or what ?
Similarly, graphene helps in the rutile phase formation. Similarly, Graphene helps in the rutile
phase formation. The reason provided as due to "..rutile phase owing to the reduction in
crystallite size". How is it so ?
3. The authors have mentioned that the location of Sr2+ is not clear. This can be understood since
one may need several other techniques to verify this. However, the authors can provide some
more insights, such as they should mention the ionic size of the dopant and host lattice ions. TiO2
has TiO6 as the basic unit. Sr2+ has a sufficiently large ionic radii in 6 coordination which is
nearly 132 pm. Ti4+ in 6 coordination has radii of approx. 74 pm. It is quite evident that it would
be hard for Sr2+ to replace Ti4+. Thus, instead of Sr2+ on Ti4+ it might be on the interstitial site
also. Furthermore, a difference in the charge on Sr and Ti might also create oxygen vacancies in
the system for charge balance. The authors need to consider these points because finally they
have related PL with oxygen defects.
4. There is a difference between band-to-band absorption and band gap absorption ? The authors
have claimed 300 nm is the band gap absorption of TiO2 which correspond to 4.13 eV. However,
the band gap as they measured from the Tauc plot gives a band gap of 3.75 eV. Is it the direct or
indirect band gap they are calculating ?
5. The authors have drawn a line on the absorption edge on the X-axis with Y=0, and mentioned
that to be absorption limit ? What is the meaning of this ? Usually, the line drawn on the
absorption edge on the X-axis with Y=0 gives an idea of the band gap of the samples. Are they
trying to mean this or what ? If that is the case a matching between Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 might
happen if the (ahv)1/2 is considered. The authors have to be clear on this.
6. They have mentioned that the absorption at 300 nm is due to recombination of careers. What I
understand, the photoexcited careers recombine radiatively or nonradiatively giving light or heat.
Now, the recombination process should give emission. Although they have have mentioned that
in the last line of the PL study that PL is obtained by UV excitation at 300 nm, They have
mentioned that recombination is the result for the absorption at 300 nm. How is it so ???
7. They have mentioned that the indirect band gap of TiO2 does not allow a bandgap emission.
Thus, the authors need to be more clear now to support that the band gap they have calculated in
Fig. 5 is direct or indirect.
8. The authors have mentioned that after Sr addition the PL intensity of TiO2 is intensified. They
surmised that a higher recombination rate is beneficial for high photocatalytic activity. Now,
photocatalytic activity requires available electron and holes. If the recombination rate is faster, the
electrons and holes will not be available for participation in photocatalysis leading to poor
photocatalytic activity. They should be more clear on this line ?
9. Why is the enhancement in PL after rGO addition ? Is it because of the fluorescence
contribution from rGO or due to enhancement of oxygen vacancies ?
NOTE: The figures are poorly formatted which makes it difficult to derive any meaning from the
figure. The authors need to improve the resolution and clarity of the figures and verify the pdf
generated before final submission.

The authors of the manuscript “Ultra bright emission from Sr doped TiO2 nanoparticles through
r-GO conjugation” have modified the manuscript. There is still one important point which is left
uncorrected. This must be corrected before arriving at a final decision.
Comment: The authors have commented “Therefore, it can be predicted that Sr2+ ions are not
substitute in TiO2 but strontium replaced Ti 4+ site and replacement of each Ti 4+ ion via a Sr2+
ion generated two...” on page 2, lines 54-57.
This line will confuse the reader. Authors should understand that “substitute” and “replace” bear
8
a similar meaning. They have mentioned that Sr2+ is not substituting TiO2. You should be clear
that Sr2+ is added to TiO2 lattice; it cannot replace or substitute TiO2. The ion it will substitute or
replace is Ti4+. But what I commented that because of large ionic radii of Sr2+ it might sit on the
surface or move to the interstitial position. The presence of SrCO3 in XRD directly proves that a
large fractions of Sr2+ are on the surface which interact with surface bound ions and oxidized to
different phases.
Therefore, the authors should add the following sentence-
“Considering the large size of Sr2+, we suppose that besides Sr2+ at the Ti4+ sites, a large fraction
of ions might stay on the surface or move to the interstitial position.”
Finally, replace the line mentioned in my comment with this one-“Furthermore, the substitution
of Ti4+ on Sr2+ will generate two oxygen vacancies for charge neutrality in the lattice.”

Reviewer: 1
Mondal et al have investigated the comparative study of TiO2, TiO2: Sr and
TiO2: Sr/r-GO (reduced graphene oxide) nano-composites for their optical
and structural properties for photocatalytic and antibacterial applications.
The study is interesting and can be accepted in this journal after a careful
revision: The comments are as below:
1. The authors have discussed the possible applications in photocatalytic and
antibacterial applications but in the introduction the appropriate references
are missing
(https://doi.org/10.1116/1.4904503, https://doi.org/10.1116/1.4904729).
TiO2 is being used in various applications so include one paragraph by
highlighting the same.
Reply: Authors are thankful to reviewer for giving good suggestion. It can also
be useful in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), photocatalysis, gas sensor,
lithium batteries and biosensors. TiO2 photocatalyst have vast applications in
air and water purification as well as in deodorization, sterilization and soil
proof. Although, for good photocatalytic activity, the recombination of
photo-generated electron hole pairs should be very slow. However, for TiO2
photocatalyst recombination rate is fast which limits its applications. Again,
band gap of TiO2 falls in UV-range and for a good photocatalyst, its
absorption should be in visible region. The same is incorporated in first
paragraph, introduction part.
2. Figure 1 is very busy and the vertical lines are not clear so please
replace the graph with higher resolution. Figure 2 has also same issue.
Reply: As per the suggestion, we have tried our best to enhance the
resolutions of the Figure 1 and 2.
3. Author should estimate crystalline size of TiO2:Sr and its nanocomposite
with r-GO. The crystalline size compare with TEM particles size.
Reply: We have taken this comment as the opportunity to enhance the
influence of the TEM study and given crystalline size and TEM particles size.
We have incorporated the same in page 3 and 4 of the revised manuscript.
4. FTIR spectra of nanocomposite given in figure 3 shows variation in
transmittance for TiO2, TiO2:Sr, TiO2:Sr/r-GO. Author should explain variation
in intensity of Transition and include shift observed in wavenumber for
nanocomposites.
Reply: We are thankful to the reviewer for such constructive comment which
will definitely enhance the impact of our manuscript. As suggested we have
tried to explain the variation of FTIR intensity and shift with proper reference
as follows:
“The intensity of these two vibrational bands is higher in TiO2: Sr/r-GO
nanocomposites. Such bands are also seen in TiO2 and TiO2: Sr which might
have attributed to the residual carbon content introduced from some
precursors such as polyvinylpyrrolidine. Moreover, the intensity and the
position of the vibrational peaks between 1000 and 500 cm-1 enhanced and
shifted slightly to the lower wavenumber in case of TiO2: Sr/r-GO
nanocomposites, which might be due to the interaction between r-GO and
TiO2 nanoparticles”. These are included and marked in page 4 of the revised
manuscript.
5. In Ellipsometry data, I would suggest author should fit it with suitable
equation to explain variation in refractive index (n) and wave vector (k) with
wavelength.
Reply: According to reviewer suggestion, we have done fitting of ellipsometry
data with suitable equation and added fitted parameters in revised
manuscript. Fitted figures are included in page number 7 of manuscript.
6. Author should add some recent references to compare their finding
with references.
Reply: We are thankful to reviewer for his valuable suggestion. We have
added some recent references in appropriate place and mentioned below:

Reviewer: 2
The authors of the manuscript “Ultra bright emission from Sr doped TiO2
nanoparticles through r-GO conjugation” have discussed the enhancement of
defect-related PL emission after doping and rGO conjugation. I do not
recommend the acceptance of the manuscript based on the following
points.
1. The authors have prepared TiO2 at a calcination temperature of 400 oC.
They got a mixture of three peaks; anatase, rutile and brookite. It is
understood that anatase and brookite are the metastable phases and can be
formed at low calcination temperature and in a low reaction temperature
too. But, the formation of rutile phase needs to be supported with proper
evidence. Rutile being the most stable form of TiO2 are usually formed at
high calcination temperature.
Reply: We are very much thankful to the reviewer for finding out such
important fact. We have done a thorough literature review for answering this
and we tried our best to explain our survey in support to our findings which
are as follows: “A good number of research directed the formation of mixed
phase TiO2 (anatase and rutile) at low temperature below 450°C, reported so
far. For example, Wang et al. produced rutile nanorods via the direct
hydrolysis of TiCl4 ethanolic solution in water at as low as 50 °C. Fischer and
co-workers produced a mixture of TiO2 nanoparticles via low-temperature
(130oC) dissolution-precipitation on a microfiltration PES membrane with
mixed phase compositions of anatase, brookite, and rutile. Lijuan Bu et al.
synthesized rutile TiO2 nanoparticles via treating anatase TiO2 with
concentrated HNO3 under the hydrothermal conditions operated at 180oC for
24 h. According to the above discussion, it can be concluded that the
formation and the transformation of rutile phase is mainly dependent upon
the precursor materials and synthesis conditions.” The above justifications
are added in the main manuscript in page 2 to 3 with proper references.
2. The line "Sr facilitate the brookite phase might be due to polycrystalline
nature of Sr related compounds". It is not clearly presented. What types
of compounds ? SrO, SrCO3 or what ? Similarly, graphene helps in the rutile
phase formation. Similarly, Graphene helps in the rutile phase formation. The
reason provided as due to ".. ". How is it so?
Ans: After incorporating Sr to TiO2 host, small peaks due to the presence of
SrCO3 are observed in XRD data as seen in the Figures 1(b) and 1(c). The
formation of SrCO3 may be due to the decomposition of SrNO3 into SrO on
the surface of TiO2, which later converted to SrCO3 after reacting with CO2
during the annealing at 400°C. The as formed polycrystalline SrCO3 might be
responsible for the formation of brookite phase (Fig. 1(b).
It is reported that the anatase to rutile phase transformation is extremely a
size dependent effect and graphene usually prevents the growth of
grains/crystallites. The particle agglomerations get prevented on the surface
of graphene. Reportedly, during the formation of graphene nano-composite,
graphene is formed in situ where it acts as the thin base material for the
other coexisting components and keep them in dispersed form [ref.
10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.06.087].
The above text has been added in the revised manuscript page 2-3, along
with appropriate reference.
3. The authors have mentioned that the location of Sr2+ is not clear. This
can be understood since one may need several other techniques to verify
this. However, the authors can provide some more insights, such as they
should mention the ionic size of the dopant and host lattice ions. TiO2 has
TiO6 as the basic unit. Sr2+ has a sufficiently large ionic radii in 6 coordination
which is nearly 132 pm. Ti4+ in 6 coordination has radii of approx. 74 pm. It is
quite evident that it would be hard for Sr2+ to replace Ti4+. Thus, instead of
Sr2+ on Ti4+ it might be on the interstitial site also. Furthermore, a difference
in the charge on Sr and Ti might also create oxygen vacancies in the system
for charge balance. The authors need to consider these points because finally
they have related PL with oxygen defects.
Reply: Authors are very much thankful for suggesting such positive approach
to enhance the quality of our study. As per the literature review, we think
that the replacement of a lower sized Ti4+ ion via a larger sized Sr2+ generates
volume compensating oxygen vacancies, which altered the atomic distances
that led to distortion of the structure and favoured the brookite structure to
be formed [ref. DOI: 10.1039/c6ra26012h]. It is difficult to substitute smaller
radius Ti4+(0.75 Å) via a larger radius Sr2+ ion (1.18 Å). Therefore, it can be
predicted that Sr2+ ions are not substitute in TiO2 but in our case strontium
replaces Ti4+ site and replacement of each Ti4+ ion via a Sr2+ ion generated
two oxygen vacancies. The above text has been added in the revised
manuscript page 2, along with appropriate reference.
4. There is a difference between band-to-band absorption and band gap
absorption ? The authors have claimed 300 nm is the band gap absorption of
TiO2 which correspond to 4.13 eV. However, the band gap as they measured
from the Tauc plot gives a band gap of 3.75 eV. Is it the direct or indirect
band gap they are calculating ?
Reply: We are very much thankful to the reviewer for his valuable comment.
We are very sorry for the misinterpretation. There is no difference between
band-to-band absorption and band gap absorption. Generally for bandgap
calculation the band edge is considered where the absorption starts to
decrease. Here in our case, the absorbance of all the samples decreased in
the range of 330 to 400 nm and shift of the absorption edge towards longer
wavelengths is observed in TiO2: Sr and TiO2: Sr/r-GO. We have used Wood
and Tauc equation to calculate the band gap from UV-VIS absorption spectra.
The equation is estimated as ah<U+03BD> = K , where a -absorption
coefficient, <U+03C5> -frequency of absorbed photon, h -Planck constant, and -
optical band gap. Exponent n value chosen for type of optical transition n= ½
and 2 for direct allowed and indirect allowed transition respectively. TiO2
have both direct and indirect band gap but here in our observation good
fitting observed for n=2 as well as the bandgap value found out after the
fitting is for direct allowed transition. Therefore, band gap was calculated for
direct allowed transition of TiO2. This is mentioned in the revised manuscript.
By using the Tauc’s plot between photon energy (hv) (plotted along x-axis)
and (ahv)2 (plotted along y-axis) and by finding out the point where the
tangent drawn to the plot cuts the energy axis, we found out the band gap
of TiO2 as 3.75 eV which is given in Figure 6.
5. The authors have drawn a line on the absorption edge on the X-axis
with Y=0, and mentioned that to be absorption limit? What is the meaning of
this? Usually, the line drawn on the absorption edge on the X-axis with Y=0
gives an idea of the band gap of the samples. Are they trying to mean this or
what? If that is the case a matching between Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 might happen if
the (ahv)1/2 is considered. The authors have to be clear on this.
Reply: We have drawn on the absorption edge on the X-axis with Y=0 and
this line referred to absorption limit. Since TiO2 band gap is generally found
in 320-400 nm range and for band gap calculation absorption band edge is
taken into consideration. Absorption in this range indicate that if radiation of
this wavelength is incident on sample then it will absorb those radiation and
after that the absorption value abruptly decreases (around 400 nm) and its
value then unchanged for further higher wavelength. So we have mentioned
that value absorption limit after which absorption is nearly constant. The
band gap is found by using Wood and Tauc equation in figure 6 by plotting
graph between (ahv)2 and photon energy (hv).
6. They have mentioned that the absorption at 300 nm is due to
recombination of careers. What I understand, the photoexcited careers
recombine radiatively or nonradiatively giving light or heat. Now, the
recombination process should give emission. Although they have mentioned
that in the last line of the PL study that PL is obtained by UV excitation at 300
nm, They have mentioned that recombination is the result for the absorption
at 300 nm. How is it so ???
Answer: We are very sorry for this big mistake. Yes it is very well understood
that recombination of photoexcited careers gives emission and here in our
case we have shown the photoluminescence in visible range i.e. from 575 to
700 nm. According to the detail literature review, we have changed the text
in the revised manuscript as follows: “The photoluminescence emission
results of the synthesized samples revealed the charge separation efficiency
of the prepared materials. All samples showed strong absorbance around
266 nm which has been attributed due to the exciton absorption band. It can
be seen that all the samples exhibit intense and broad emission band peaked
at around 647nm, and the intensity increased significantly with the addition
of strontium and r-GO.”
The above text was added on page number 6 in revised manuscript.
7. They have mentioned that the indirect band gap of TiO2 does not allow
a bandgap emission. Thus, the authors need to be more clear now to support
that the band gap they have calculated in Fig. 5 is direct or indirect.
Reply: We are thankful to reviewer for bringing our attention on optical band
gap. We have calculated the band gap by considering direct allowed optical
transition.
8. The authors have mentioned that after Sr addition the PL intensity of
TiO2 is intensified. They surmised that a higher recombination rate is
beneficial for high photocatalytic activity. Now, photocatalytic activity
requires available electron and holes. If the recombination rate is faster, the
electrons and holes will not be available for participation in photocatalysis
leading to poor photocatalytic activity. They should be more clear on this line
?
Reply: We are very thankful to the reviewer for this critical comment as well
as we are very sorry for our serious mistake. Normally, during
photoluminescence, photo-induced electrons are prohibited to form free or
binding excitons owing to the binding via the oxygen vacancies and defects.
Because of this, the PL emission occurs. Therefore, with the increase in
oxygen vacancies or defects, the PL emission intensity also enhances usually.
However, in photocatalytic reactions, oxygen vacancies and PL related
defects normally capture photo-induced electrons, which inhibits the
recombination of such photo-induced electrons and holes benefiting the
photocatalytic reactions. Simultaneously, oxygen vacancies are advantageous
in promoting the oxygen adsorption. Such adsorbed oxygen later interacts
strongly with the photo-induced electrons bound by oxygen vacancies.
Hence, oxygen vacancies and defects usually favour the photocatalytic
reactions in which oxygen dynamically promotes the oxidation of organic
materials.
The above discussion is added in the revised manuscript (page 7) along with
proper references.

9. Why is the enhancement in PL after rGO addition? Is it because of the
fluorescence contribution from rGO or due to enhancement of oxygen
vacancies?
Reply: The PL intensity of TiO2: Sr/r-GO and TiO2: Sr are appreciably higher
than that in TiO2. This result is very similar with a reported result where the
enhanced intensity is reported for TiO2/r-GO [ref. Appl. Surf. Sci. 319, 8].
According to this report, TiO2: Sr/r-GO and TiO2: Sr can produce more
photogenerated electron-hole pairs, which are responsible for the enhanced
PL intensity in TiO2: Sr/r-GO and in TiO2: Sr than that in TiO2. During
photoluminescence, photo-induced electrons are prohibited to form free or
binding excitons owing to the binding via the oxygen vacancies and defects.
Because of this, the PL emission occurs. Therefore, with the increase in
oxygen vacancies or defects, the PL emission intensity also enhances usually.

Reviewer 2:
The authors of the manuscript “Ultra bright emission from Sr doped TiO2 nanoparticles through r-
GO conjugation” have modified the manuscript. There is still one important point which is left
uncorrected. This must be corrected before arriving at a final decision.
Comment: The authors have commented “Therefore, it can be predicted that Sr2+ ions are not
substitute in TiO2 but strontium replaced Ti 4+ site and replacement of each Ti 4+ ion via a Sr2+
ion generated two...” on page 2, lines 54-57. This line will confuse the reader. Authors should
understand that “substitute” and “replace” bear a similar meaning. They have mentioned that Sr2+
is not substituting TiO2. You should be clear that Sr2+ is added to TiO2 lattice; it cannot replace or
substitute TiO2. The ion it will substitute or replace is Ti4+. But what I commented that because of
large ionic radii of Sr2+ it might sit on the surface or move to the interstitial position. The presence
of SrCO3 in XRD directly proves that a large fractions of Sr2+ are on the surface which interact with
surface bound ions and oxidized to different phases. Therefore, the authors should add the following
sentence-“Considering the large size of Sr2+, we suppose that besides Sr2+ at the Ti4+ sites, a large
fraction of ions might stay on the surface or move to the interstitial position.” Finally, replace the
line mentioned in my comment with this one-“Furthermore, the substitution of Ti4+ on Sr2+ will
generate two oxygen vacancies for charge neutrality in the lattice.”
Answer: We are very thankful to reviewer for his valuable suggestion. We have made correction in
revised manuscript and added modified sentence “Furthermore, the substitution of Ti4+ on Sr2+ will
generate two oxygen vacancies for charge neutrality in the lattice. Considering the large size of Sr2+,
we suppose that besides Sr2+ at the Ti4+ sites, a large fraction of ions might stay on the surface or
move to the interstitial position.”
These lines added in result and discussion section (second paragraph) page number 2.
