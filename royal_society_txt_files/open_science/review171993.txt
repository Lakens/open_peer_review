This is an interesting study that details the use of 4 cameras on a BRUVs system compared to the
traditional single camera. The study design appears sound with good replication and data
interpretation is reasonable and presented well. I feel the text could be tightened up, particularly
the discussion, and have the following suggestions below:
Lines 90-110: The last two paragraphs in the Introduction are very similar and repetitive, and the
first paragraph (90-101) was confusing to read. Shorten and merge the two paragraphs together
with a brief background of what is knowledge is lacking and then lead into the objectives of your
study to address these.
Line 109: Delete ‘plan to’.
Line 148: Regarding the shy species, was this across just the 4 cameras on the BRUV or across all 4
replicates (16 cameras)?
Line 153-160. A lot of use of the term ‘…was chosen…’! Modify and shorten lines 154-160.
Line 169: Provide a reference to support the use of transforming data by dispersion weighting.
Line 185: How was current direction actually determined? If this paper is assessing impacts of
current direction, how was it accurately determined what direction the current was flowing? Was
a scientific instrument deployed to record current or was it an observer estimate?
Line 236: I would suggest ‘mild’ is replaced with either ‘minor’ or ‘small’.
Line 295: No need for the word ‘possible’
Line 313-325: Is it really just current that is influencing this? What about the effects of ‘secondary
attraction’? This is where species are potentially drawn to the BRUV because of the large
numbers of fish aggregating around it, see Taylor (2013) and Harasti et al (2015) that discuss this.
Did you look to see if increased numbers of fish around the BRUV was more likely to attract the
shy or infrequently seen species? It may not actually be the bait plume/current direction that is
driving this; it could potentially be the secondary attraction factor where shy/rare fish are
curious to see what the large schools of fish are looking at! This could easily be assessed by
comparing number of individual fishes on BRUVs across all 4 camera’s and relate to number of
shy/infrequently seen species and see if there is a relationship. Having the 4 camera coverage is
the only study I know of that would allow this analyse, and would be of interest to BRUV
researchers. Is it possible to assess this relationship?
Line 322: Delete the ).
Line 343-344: Regarding the comment ‘where researchers may wish to detect any abundance
differences between closed and open areas.’ Comparisons in differences of abundances between
fished and non-fished areas is one of the most frequently reported observations in numerous
BRUV papers! Relative abundance comparisons are common, if the authors believe that the 4
camera MaxN is better than just single camera MaxN then there needs to be better justification for
its use. What about the negativity for use of four cameras? Using 4 cameras’ increases the costs
through the actual requirement of more cameras and also the additional video analysis time. This
is mentioned in the section labelled ‘recommendations’ at the end of the discussion, but would be
more appropriate to discuss in the actual discussion section when talking about the Pros and
Cons of the four camera system.
3
Line 376: I suggest getting rid of the subheading ‘recommendations’ and instead merge this
information into paragraphs with the conclusion section. There is no requirement in this journal
to have a ‘recommendations’ section and they don’t need to be stand along points. Incorporate
these points into the discussion and summarise in the conclusion, particularly as the existing
conclusion section is already repeating points made in the recommendations section.

Overall
I think this paper is publishable eventually and with some more care put into defining some of
the methods. For instance camera orientation seems to be focused on but and upstream
downstream is sort of an afterthought in describing methods. Additionally it’s unclear how 360
counts were truly derived synchronized cameras or sums of MaxN counts. The paper seems to
be lacking in terms of really delving into the literature. There is a lot out there historically per the
effect of bait, yet the author deems it as being lacking, whereas this has been fairly well described
and investigated in fact. The writing seems to not target a scientific audience and relies on many
colloquial terms which is fine if you’re trying to relate scientific findings to non-scientific
audiences, but it’s not for a scientific journal. There is an opportunity for more analysis
concerning the relationship between field of view and abundance that appears to have been
missed. I think the analyses concerning abundance would benefit from a GLM or GAM approach
that would allow for a more formal approach to understand how abundance is being impacted.
Multivariate approach is good for the assemblage/community analysis. There is no treatment of
current speed and how this might have impacted these results either. Paper needs quite a lot of
work for it to be ready for publication.

Abstract
Abstract needs work.
15 – As a stand-alone piece of information this makes very little sense. What does front-facing
camera mean? Keep in mind at this point a reader hasn’t digested your methods. Without
information about orientation to current/habitat/bait this makes zero biological sense.
16-18 – Remove the parenthetical statement and just state this. Shy/infrequently species were
seen up to 60% more often given 360 views.
19-20 – The reasons you typically use cameras are that scuba or some other method is
unavailable. Drop cameras are nice to avoid these difficulties. However deployment of drop
cameras with a specific orientation is next to impossible. I think a better recommendation is
collecting current information so that you can model that effect in your abundance is far more
achievable. Additionally If you don’t need stereo 360 systems are now being built in the 500$
range, so in fact they’re just as cheap.
21 – I think there are multiple accepted spellings for focussing (US spell check catches this
spelling), but may want to check.
20-22 – So you suggest that 360 cameras are good for shy or infrequent (low count) fish or for
abundant fish. My experience has been that this is not a piece of information you’ll know in
advance (high counts in particular), so why wouldn’t you err on the side of 360?
Introduction
29-31 – I’d say with traditional fishing gears you have few ways to address biases due to the
inherent ‘blindness’ about their deployment. Juxtaposed against cameras which can give you
additional information concerning any particular deployment (e.g. habitat or current data).
33-39 – True for count data but I can think of a many other types of biases (e.g. size selectivity of
gear, research designs themselves, seasonality of deployment). So really your talking specifically
about detection.
40-41 – The used detection probabilities to understand detection bias? This sentence needs
sorting out.
40-46 – I would say that these are all accurate however they’re sort of left as stand-alone items
with no development of thought or coherent relationship to the problem. They need to be
connected to your problem better. Paragraph needs development.
48-52 – As with the end of the last paragraph, these two sentences are more or less independent
thoughts. I’d almost just ditch the first sentence, simply because of all the fisheries gears out there
optics have allowed for probably the most intensive scrutiny due to their nature. Whereas
hooking gears everybody just sort of tacitly accepts without thinking all that thoroughly about
them.
53 – Changes community-wide to just ‘community’
64 – Find a more appropriate term than ‘scared off’. Avoid, avoidance behavior, etc
64 – e.g. due to increased predation risk
5
66 – ‘can be missed’ change to ‘might not be observed’
67-68 – ‘fish based bait’ implies then that fish attracted to the area are piscivorous. Carnivorous is
probably fine but the other term is more appropriate.
67 – what exactly is a non-carnivorous species? Herbivorous? Planktivorous?
71 – ‘Along with biases related to the ability to detect species’ … change to read ‘along with
detection biases’
76 – Models have demonstrated this (Schobernd), this wasn’t modeled as camera saturation, it
was modeled as time spent on camera as a function of movement speed. Abundance or camera
saturation wasn’t explicitly tested.
It appears as though the only empirically derived estimate (Stobart) actually says that both MaxN
and MeanCount underestimate at high abundance?
80 – Take a look at the following publication that’s come out. It appears as though MeanCount
might not actually resolve the non-linearity issue.
Kilfoil, James P., et al. "Baited Remote Underwater Video surveys undercount sharks at high
densities: insights from full-spherical camera technologies." Marine Ecology Progress Series 585
(2017): 113-121.
80 – Alternatively you could describe this as decreased detection probability.
84 – Bacheler et al have described this in several spots I believe. Not too mention this is a frequent
topic for BRUVS in deep water. Trenkel et al. has a few as well. Check out:
Bacheler, Nathan M., et al. "Environmental conditions and habitat characteristics influence trap
and video detection probabilities for reef fish species." Marine Ecology Progress Series 517 (2014):
1-14.
Trenkel, Verena M., and Pascal Lorance. "Estimating Synaphobranchus kaupii densities:
contribution of fish behaviour to differences between bait experiments and visual strip transects."
Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers 58.1 (2011): 63-71.
92-94 – Reader knows nothing about your methods or setup at this point so your referencing
something without explanation and this will likely be confusing.
97-98 – How could you possibly always orient the cameras so that current is always downstream
of the orientation when the camera is viewing the bait bag? These are drop cams correct? Seems
to me you probably have a 25% chance or so of this actually happening the way you describe.
108 – Objective 4 needs clarification. Maximize MaxN estimates? How so? Precision, total
count?
Methods
121 – change ‘across’ to ‘at’
125 – I’m not certain I understand what you mean by ‘fishing replacement’? Was the other
location protected from fishing at some point in time?
6
132 – Might need to say models 3+ or 4 were mounted. Might be fine the way it is, but there is no
model 3+/4 and that’s how it reads. There are differences in camera FOV, speed, light settings
between the two versions. Did you ensure they were on equivalent settings. If they weren’t did
you randomize where the 3’s vs the 4’s were located ? Detection by different camera types,
especially with differing field of views (which is essentially you overall test with 360) can make a
difference.
138 – There are probably studies out there that will tell you a bit about spatial autocorrelation, or
you can just test it here as a part of a statistical model.
142-143 – you have the ability to track and understand individual fish? I don’t believe this
statement.
157 – avoid these colloquial descriptions. Please use scientific terminology.
158-160 – I don’t understand what you imply here. I think what you mean is that there might be
a relationship between either size, or spatial distribution of these shark that would create the non-
linearity at low abundance for this species. Again, please describe this in scientific terms.
185-188 – is this assemblage or abundance data? I don’t understand the data being tested and
how that necessarily fits into a chi square test. Further I don’t believe this is an entirely fair test of
the effect of current. The chi square would only test whether current direction had an effect on
camera orientation? But you connected this to species/abundance information in this sentence. I
would’ve thought a GLM or a GAM with orientation information would’ve made far more sense
in particular with T1 or abundance data.
One thing that isn’t entirely clear to me is how do you generate 360 counts? If that is a MaxN
over fully synchronized and simultaneously observed cameras I think you’re ok. However if you
are simply summing the MaxN values over the four separate reads, that are in fact not synched
and viewed simultaneously, then in fact the reads themselves (counts) are interrelated. You’ve
likely accounted for the same fish in several views depending on how your MaxN value worked
out in time. This needs to be abundantly clear per how this value is derived.
Results
202-203 – not unanticipated in my opinion. The effect of the bait isn’t fundamentally changing
the community composition because the bait plume and deployment time don’t operate on a
larger spatial scale than the community. Perhaps this would be the case where you have very
small patch reefs and you are attracting sand species into an otherwise reef community, but that
likely would be the case with or without the extra view points.
212 – total abundance (within or pooled species?).
215 – lay? I’m not certain I understand what this means statistically.
218 – So the assemblages between these two sites were different between them or these two are
different from all the other sites.
226 – Given the sample size I’d say this is unlikely to be significant … and it wasn’t.
223-231 – In all of this I see no real information on current strength. Perhaps some of the ‘non-
result’ on current is associated with differential currents at drops, plus low samples?
7
236 – Mild? Please discontinue the colloquial terms. This is in fact a 20% increase in the estimate.
Not all that mild especially you’re ramping up sample, that would be easily detectable.
240 – Unsurprising.
240-249 – Upstream and downstream. Front/back, Left/right. I think you need to more
explicitly define this in methods. Upstream downstream is almost an afterthought as a
parenthetical statement at the very end of the methods, but in my mind is actually the critical
thing to understand as this actually has the impact on your viewing. These also feel like the more
important results. You don’t get much difference in composition or abundance regardless of
left/right/back/front … however you do see differences when you ask the question of how was
the bait bag oriented up or down stream of the current. Trenkel demonstrates this pretty
effectively as too why this result would happen.
263 – these species were less likely to be mobile, so really, this is a habitat effect. Did you land on
their house or not?
266-272 – Figure 6a … this nonlinearity is what’s being referred to by Schobernd et al. The fact
that at low abundances fits with Campbell et al who suggest that for species that generally have
low counts, the non-linearity is basically a non-issue. I would actually test these in a GAM to
evaluate fit when you apply smoothing terms. Does the fit improve when you smooth a term (i.e.
allow the spline to bend to the shape of the curve) versus if it were a linear fit. I’d say this is
evidence that increasing field of view allows for examination of the relationship suggested in
Campbell et al. I’d suggest that you expand on the analysis with this data.
Discussion
278-279 – especially for highly abundant schooling species and shy guys. So if it’s equivalent in
other regards this is a better approach. Think you need to emphasize that.
284 – Only in a couple of habitat types for whatever reason, which could be explained by other
things. You’ve detailed this as a species specific kind of a result owing to the presence of the
leatherjacket. But that’s really an argument about abundance and not assemblage. Assemblages
you’ve shown repeatedly no significant difference. I think you’re mixing results a bit here.
Needs to be cleaned up.
287 – delete mill around.
300-302 – seems to be the strongest argument as to why you would want to have 360 views. You
can’t control the drop (25% chance of orientation in 1-4 positions). Therefore if current is
modifying spatial distributions of the fish you are underestimating abundance 25-50% of the time
depending on the field of view of the camera.
300-311 – I definitely agree. What about orientation of the cameras relative to structure? Shy
species etc might be impact by this as well. Really I’d define most of this as ‘aggregating factors’.
Bait, habitat, current, and schooling. Theoretically these would all have a similar impact on data
abundance in particular.
330 – work on the colloquial language throughout.
338 – nonlinearity in 6a. Leatherjackets. You could test fit in a GAM by inclusion or exclusion of
a smoothing term. Look up Simon Woods work on this.
8
335-349 – there is also a critical link to stock assessment. The goal is to understand whether a
population is increasing or decreasing. This would increase the ability of MaxN estimates to
detect increases in population size, that otherwise are nonlinear at high abundance (i.e.
diminished ability to detect this increasing trend). Good news is that at least the MaxN estimate
is still on the conservative side.
356 – See Kilfoil et al. This is being done.
381 – 383 – not if they’re synched into a landscape or composite 360 view. Disagree that they
provide little benefit. You can understand current, habitat location, relative to bait, improved
detection of rare and abundant species. There is much to be gained.
388 – Or just put a 360 camera in the water. There are also versions that spin on a pedestal.
Figure 1. I’d orient the pictures so that front and front are the same across images. You could
pretty much make this a single picture rather than two.

To estimate species abundance with video-based methods will become more an more relevant as
the cost for underwater equipment is going down. Your research is focusing on the tradeoff
between accuracy in the measurement and the effort to analyse the data when increasing the
number of cameras, which is a relevant topic for the community.
Let me give you some comments that could help to improve the paper:
* As stated in your introduction, your work is relying on BRUVS. For not-baited video stations
9
the you probably would end up with other results. This restriction shoukd be clearly stated in
your abstract, conclusions and maybe in teh title as well.
* A lot of progress has been made on automatic detection, identification and tracking of fish in
video sequences. Those new tools can dramatically cut down costs in video analysis. Maybe you
can revise your recommendations with this trend in mind.
* Is there a chance to check your method agoianst ground truth data? Maybe in a large aquarium
where the correct abundance of each species is known?
* It would be helpful for the user to get more information on the BRUVS: 1. The opening angle of
the cameras? 2. Use of artificial light?
* The provided XLS file is already a derived result. Do you grant access to the raw material of the
video cameras?

camera mean? Keep in mind at this point a reader hasn’t digested your methods. Without
information about orientation to current/habitat/bait this makes zero biological sense.
16-18 – Remove the parenthetical statement and just state this. Shy/infrequently species were
seen up to 60% more often given 360 views.
19-20 – The reasons you typically use cameras are that scuba or some other method is
unavailable. Drop cameras are nice to avoid these difficulties. However deployment of drop
cameras with a specific orientation is next to impossible. I think a better recommendation is
collecting current information so that you can model that effect in your abundance is far more
achievable. Additionally If you don’t need stereo 360 systems are now being built in the 500$
range, so in fact they’re just as cheap.
21 – I think there are multiple accepted spellings for focussing (US spell check catches this
spelling), but may want to check.
20-22 – So you suggest that 360 cameras are good for shy or infrequent (low count) fish or for
abundant fish. My experience has been that this is not a piece of information you’ll know in
advance (high counts in particular), so why wouldn’t you err on the side of 360?
Introduction
29-31 – I’d say with traditional fishing gears you have few ways to address biases due to the
inherent ‘blindness’ about their deployment. Juxtaposed against cameras which can give you
additional information concerning any particular deployment (e.g. habitat or current data).
33-39 – True for count data but I can think of a many other types of biases (e.g. size selectivity of
gear, research designs themselves, seasonality of deployment). So really your talking specifically
about detection.
40-41 – The used detection probabilities to understand detection bias? This sentence needs
sorting out.
40-46 – I would say that these are all accurate however they’re sort of left as stand-alone items
with no development of thought or coherent relationship to the problem. They need to be
connected to your problem better. Paragraph needs development.
48-52 – As with the end of the last paragraph, these two sentences are more or less independent
thoughts. I’d almost just ditch the first sentence, simply because of all the fisheries gears out there
optics have allowed for probably the most intensive scrutiny due to their nature. Whereas
hooking gears everybody just sort of tacitly accepts without thinking all that thoroughly about
them.
53 – Changes community-wide to just ‘community’
64 – Find a more appropriate term than ‘scared off’. Avoid, avoidance behavior, etc
64 – e.g. due to increased predation risk
14
66 – ‘can be missed’ change to ‘might not be observed’
67-68 – ‘fish based bait’ implies then that fish attracted to the area are piscivorous. Carnivorous is
probably fine but the other term is more appropriate.
67 – what exactly is a non-carnivorous species? Herbivorous? Planktivorous?
71 – ‘Along with biases related to the ability to detect species’ … change to read ‘along with
detection biases’
76 – Models have demonstrated this (Schobernd), this wasn’t modeled as camera saturation, it
was modeled as time spent on camera as a function of movement speed. Abundance or camera
saturation wasn’t explicitly tested.
It appears as though the only empirically derived estimate (Stobart) actually says that both MaxN
and MeanCount underestimate at high abundance?
80 – Take a look at the following publication that’s come out. It appears as though MeanCount
might not actually resolve the non-linearity issue.
Kilfoil, James P., et al. "Baited Remote Underwater Video surveys undercount sharks at high
densities: insights from full-spherical camera technologies." Marine Ecology Progress Series 585
(2017): 113-121.
80 – Alternatively you could describe this as decreased detection probability.
84 – Bacheler et al have described this in several spots I believe. Not too mention this is a frequent
topic for BRUVS in deep water. Trenkel et al. has a few as well. Check out:
Bacheler, Nathan M., et al. "Environmental conditions and habitat characteristics influence trap
and video detection probabilities for reef fish species." Marine Ecology Progress Series 517 (2014):
1-14.
Trenkel, Verena M., and Pascal Lorance. "Estimating Synaphobranchus kaupii densities:
contribution of fish behaviour to differences between bait experiments and visual strip transects."
Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers 58.1 (2011): 63-71.
92-94 – Reader knows nothing about your methods or setup at this point so your referencing
something without explanation and this will likely be confusing.
97-98 – How could you possibly always orient the cameras so that current is always downstream
of the orientation when the camera is viewing the bait bag? These are drop cams correct? Seems
to me you probably have a 25% chance or so of this actually happening the way you describe.
108 – Objective 4 needs clarification. Maximize MaxN estimates? How so? Precision, total
count?
Methods
121 – change ‘across’ to ‘at’
15
125 – I’m not certain I understand what you mean by ‘fishing replacement’? Was the other
location protected from fishing at some point in time?
132 – Might need to say models 3+ or 4 were mounted. Might be fine the way it is, but there is no
model 3+/4 and that’s how it reads. There are differences in camera FOV, speed, light settings
between the two versions. Did you ensure they were on equivalent settings. If they weren’t did
you randomize where the 3’s vs the 4’s were located ? Detection by different camera types,
especially with differing field of views (which is essentially you overall test with 360) can make a
difference.
138 – There are probably studies out there that will tell you a bit about spatial autocorrelation, or
you can just test it here as a part of a statistical model.
142-143 – you have the ability to track and understand individual fish? I don’t believe this
statement.
157 – avoid these colloquial descriptions. Please use scientific terminology.
158-160 – I don’t understand what you imply here. I think what you mean is that there might be
a relationship between either size, or spatial distribution of these shark that would create the non-
linearity at low abundance for this species. Again, please describe this in scientific terms.
185-188 – is this assemblage or abundance data? I don’t understand the data being tested and
how that necessarily fits into a chi square test. Further I don’t believe this is an entirely fair test of
the effect of current. The chi square would only test whether current direction had an effect on
camera orientation? But you connected this to species/abundance information in this sentence. I
would’ve thought a GLM or a GAM with orientation information would’ve made far more sense
in particular with T1 or abundance data.
One thing that isn’t entirely clear to me is how do you generate 360 counts? If that is a MaxN
over fully synchronized and simultaneously observed cameras I think you’re ok. However if you
are simply summing the MaxN values over the four separate reads, that are in fact not synched
and viewed simultaneously, then in fact the reads themselves (counts) are interrelated. You’ve
likely accounted for the same fish in several views depending on how your MaxN value worked
out in time. This needs to be abundantly clear per how this value is derived.
Results
202-203 – not unanticipated in my opinion. The effect of the bait isn’t fundamentally changing
the community composition because the bait plume and deployment time don’t operate on a
larger spatial scale than the community. Perhaps this would be the case where you have very
small patch reefs and you are attracting sand species into an otherwise reef community, but that
likely would be the case with or without the extra view points.
212 – total abundance (within or pooled species?).
215 – lay? I’m not certain I understand what this means statistically.
218 – So the assemblages between these two sites were different between them or these two are
different from all the other sites.
226 – Given the sample size I’d say this is unlikely to be significant … and it wasn’t.
16
223-231 – In all of this I see no real information on current strength. Perhaps some of the ‘non-
result’ on current is associated with differential currents at drops, plus low samples?
236 – Mild? Please discontinue the colloquial terms. This is in fact a 20% increase in the estimate.
Not all that mild especially you’re ramping up sample, that would be easily detectable.
240 – Unsurprising.
240-249 – Upstream and downstream. Front/back, Left/right. I think you need to more
explicitly define this in methods. Upstream downstream is almost an afterthought as a
parenthetical statement at the very end of the methods, but in my mind is actually the critical
thing to understand as this actually has the impact on your viewing. These also feel like the more
important results. You don’t get much difference in composition or abundance regardless of
left/right/back/front … however you do see differences when you ask the question of how was
the bait bag oriented up or down stream of the current. Trenkel demonstrates this pretty
effectively as too why this result would happen.
263 – these species were less likely to be mobile, so really, this is a habitat effect. Did you land on
their house or not?
266-272 – Figure 6a … this nonlinearity is what’s being referred to by Schobernd et al. The fact
that at low abundances fits with Campbell et al who suggest that for species that generally have
low counts, the non-linearity is basically a non-issue. I would actually test these in a GAM to
evaluate fit when you apply smoothing terms. Does the fit improve when you smooth a term (i.e.
allow the spline to bend to the shape of the curve) versus if it were a linear fit. I’d say this is
evidence that increasing field of view allows for examination of the relationship suggested in
Campbell et al. I’d suggest that you expand on the analysis with this data.
Discussion
278-279 – especially for highly abundant schooling species and shy guys. So if it’s equivalent in
other regards this is a better approach. Think you need to emphasize that.
284 – Only in a couple of habitat types for whatever reason, which could be explained by other
things. You’ve detailed this as a species specific kind of a result owing to the presence of the
leatherjacket. But that’s really an argument about abundance and not assemblage. Assemblages
you’ve shown repeatedly no significant difference. I think you’re mixing results a bit here.
Needs to be cleaned up.
287 – delete mill around.
300-302 – seems to be the strongest argument as to why you would want to have 360 views. You
can’t control the drop (25% chance of orientation in 1-4 positions). Therefore if current is
modifying spatial distributions of the fish you are underestimating abundance 25-50% of the time
depending on the field of view of the camera.
300-311 – I definitely agree. What about orientation of the cameras relative to structure? Shy
species etc might be impact by this as well. Really I’d define most of this as ‘aggregating factors’.
Bait, habitat, current, and schooling. Theoretically these would all have a similar impact on data
abundance in particular.
330 – work on the colloquial language throughout.
17
338 – nonlinearity in 6a. Leatherjackets. You could test fit in a GAM by inclusion or exclusion of
a smoothing term. Look up Simon Woods work on this.
335-349 – there is also a critical link to stock assessment. The goal is to understand whether a
population is increasing or decreasing. This would increase the ability of MaxN estimates to
detect increases in population size, that otherwise are nonlinear at high abundance (i.e.
diminished ability to detect this increasing trend). Good news is that at least the MaxN estimate
is still on the conservative side.
356 – See Kilfoil et al. This is being done.
381 – 383 – not if they’re synched into a landscape or composite 360 view. Disagree that they
provide little benefit. You can understand current, habitat location, relative to bait, improved
detection of rare and abundant species. There is much to be gained.
388 – Or just put a 360 camera in the water. There are also versions that spin on a pedestal.
Figure 1. I’d orient the pictures so that front and front are the same across images. You could
pretty much make this a single picture rather than two.
Reviewer: 3
Comments to the Author(s)
To estimate species abundance with video-based methods will become more an more relevant as
the cost for underwater equipment is going down. Your research is focusing on the tradeoff
between accuracy in the measurement and the effort to analyse the data when increasing the
number of cameras, which is a relevant topic for the community.
Let me give you some comments that could help to improve the paper:
* As stated in your introduction, your work is relying on BRUVS. For not-baited video stations
the you probably would end up with other results. This restriction shoukd be clearly stated in
your abstract, conclusions and maybe in teh title as well.
* A lot of progress has been made on automatic detection, identification and tracking of fish in
video sequences. Those new tools can dramatically cut down costs in video analysis. Maybe you
can revise your recommendations with this trend in mind.
* Is there a chance to check your method agoianst ground truth data? Maybe in a large aquarium
where the correct abundance of each species is known?
* It would be helpful for the user to get more information on the BRUVS: 1. The opening angle of
the cameras? 2. Use of artificial light?
* The provided XLS file is already a derived result. Do you grant access to the raw material of the
video cameras?

This was a vast improvement in terms of grammar etc, focusing language and being descriptive
in regards to methods however there are still grammatical issues in the paper that were not
cleaned up after round one. More importantly I still have an issue with the statistical approach
and the answer to that particular question:
‘With regards to the proposed GLM or GAM approach, the graphs we present convincingly show
non-linearity confined to the highest total abundances. We feel that there is no requirement to
further model that relationship using either GLM or GAM because it is a rather minor point in
our argument that does not require further mathematical description. In fact, the cost in journal
space to describe, report, interpret and reference that extra but minor component would blow out
the length of this manuscript. Hence we choose to not adopt the suggestion for the little extra it
would bring to this paper.’
I strongly disagree on this statement. PRIMER is a piece of software that is most useful for
multivariate/community analysis. So the approach is appropriate for the community analysis.
However, for the univariate analysis this is not the best nor most powerful approach. The power
in using a GAM/GLM is that you can actually test whether there is an improvement over a linear
model. Further, describing that you use a different statistical test would not make this paper
exceedingly long (a sentence at best), these are common statistical approaches found throughout
the literature and as always, the best statistical method is always the best answer. There are
many available open source programs that are well suited/vetted to conduct the analysis. Figure
6 graph-a is not ‘convincingly’ linear. Hence the suggested use of other distributions that can test
this question. Use of a GLM/GAM can also better frame your ‘convincingly’ linear statement on
the other 3 species your testing for which it does appear to be linear (e.g. use of information
criteria, AIC for instance, to evaluate model fits by the addition of a smoothing term).
Additionally given that there are now single unit spherical cameras on the market that offer
cameras in the 500 dollar range, don’t increase the amount of effort to annotate video etc. The
entire argument about cost here is just not holding water and should be dropped.
Further edits
Abstract
Line 11-13. Perhaps true in Australia but in the US this isn’t really the case at all. AFSC survey of
Alaskan reefs uses no bait on their drop cam and drift cam surveys, SEFIS survey in the South
Atlantic is bidirectional, State of Florida survey (FWC) in the Gulf uses bidirectional cameras,
SEAMAP gulf of mexico uses 4 orthogonally placed cameras (possibly spherical systems now),
Florida State University uses a camera that rotates on an axis.
Modify this statement to reference ‘some’ or ‘most Australian’.
Line 19. Costs are coming down significantly. Kodak 360 view camera, Nikon Key Mission,
Samsung 360 all cost around 500 bucks US. Just not accurate that this costs more. Pacific Islands
Fisheries Science Center is currently deploying the Kodak camera with their BotCam camera.
Therefore costs are essentially the same as a single axis 70 degree field of view of GoPros.
Line 36. Change from ‘currents’ to oceanographic conditions (e.g. water clarity and currents)
20
Line 50. Delete ‘also’
Line 51-53. People have spent careers studying things like selectivity and catchability for all
kinds of gears. There is a long history of people trying to understand exactly what a gear is
collecting. Doesn’t mean that they’ve always had the answer, but it’s certainly not for lack of
effort. Restructure this sentence.
Line 108-109. Every single NMFS science center in the US has some optically based survey. I
think I’d just delete the part on ‘speeding up the uptake’. BRUV and other optically based
surveys have matured and are accepted routinely at assessments since the early 2000’s. I’d
redirect this towards a bigger question of how will laboratories keep up with and deal with ever
changing technology. Fisheries gears are stuck back in the 80’s, whereas cameras and acoustics
continue to improve ever single year. Probably would be more on point given your topic on this
paper.
Line 109. Delete either thus or therefore.
Line 101. Add ‘species’ before richness.
Methods
Line 152. Change ‘replicates’ to ‘sites’.
169-173. How did you synch the cameras so that video ties for MaxN were the same across all
cameras and thus additive.
Line 220. ‘not very distinct differences’. Change this language. Suggest. No distinct differences
Line 224-5. ‘result for taxonomic composition alone was also not significant’. Change language,
suggest ‘ no significant differences were detected for taxonomic composition’.
Line 229. Change ‘individuals’ to ‘counts’.
Discussion
Line 324. Delete ‘often’.
Line 327-328. Delete ‘(see Results, species richness)’. Hopefully readers had the sense to read the
results section, no need to reference it here.
Line 330-333. Combine these two thoughts/sentences. No need to separate this into two
thoughts. These are all solutions to the same issue.
Line 363. Change ‘more individuals cannot fit within the field of view’ … ‘when field of view is
saturated’.
370-372. So Bacheler et al are wrong? MaxN has been shown to be non-linear to increasing
population size. As population increases MaxN cannot detect this change and theoretically this
could either be due to your metric or because in fact it didn’t change. Seems to me there would
still be a concern especially if a species is thought to be recovering.
380-384. This is being done. Kilfoil et al put videos into a landscaped 360 view and derived
21
counts simultaneously according to their methods. If you do have to derive counts on individual
cameras then you’d be right.
380-395. Mentioned before these cameras now are coming in single packages. Nikon, Kodak,
Samsung among many other manufacturers have put together units that cost approximately 500$.
Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center is deploying them. Single pass on the video annotation,
not as you say 4x the number of cameras.
Several papers have now come out stating that MaxN methods underestimate shark abundance.
415-416. So you say that expense and time with viewing has to be balanced against getting more
deployments instead of more cameras. Except what you have effectively done is created more
video to read and more time and expense. This doesn’t seem logical to me.
The whole expense part of the argument should just be dropped.
416-420. This is a problem for any optical based survey, not just for 360. The bottleneck has
always been manual processing of data.

entire argument about cost here is just not holding water and should be dropped.

Abstract
Line 11-13. Perhaps true in Australia but in the US this isn’t really the case at all. AFSC survey of
Alaskan reefs uses no bait on their drop cam and drift cam surveys, SEFIS survey in the South
Atlantic is bidirectional, State of Florida survey (FWC) in the Gulf uses bidirectional cameras,
SEAMAP gulf of mexico uses 4 orthogonally placed cameras (possibly spherical systems now),
Florida State University uses a camera that rotates on an axis.
Modify this statement to reference ‘some’ or ‘most Australian’.
Line 19. Costs are coming down significantly. Kodak 360 view camera, Nikon Key Mission,
Samsung 360 all cost around 500 bucks US. Just not accurate that this costs more. Pacific Islands
Fisheries Science Center is currently deploying the Kodak camera with their BotCam camera.
Therefore costs are essentially the same as a single axis 70 degree field of view of GoPros.
Line 36. Change from ‘currents’ to oceanographic conditions (e.g. water clarity and currents)
Line 50. Delete ‘also’
Line 51-53. People have spent careers studying things like selectivity and catchability for all
kinds of gears. There is a long history of people trying to understand exactly what a gear is
collecting. Doesn’t mean that they’ve always had the answer, but it’s certainly not for lack of
effort. Restructure this sentence.
Line 108-109. Every single NMFS science center in the US has some optically based survey. I
think I’d just delete the part on ‘speeding up the uptake’. BRUV and other optically based
surveys have matured and are accepted routinely at assessments since the early 2000’s. I’d
26
redirect this towards a bigger question of how will laboratories keep up with and deal with ever
changing technology. Fisheries gears are stuck back in the 80’s, whereas cameras and acoustics
continue to improve ever single year. Probably would be more on point given your topic on this
paper.
Line 109. Delete either thus or therefore.
Line 101. Add ‘species’ before richness.
Methods
Line 152. Change ‘replicates’ to ‘sites’.
169-173. How did you synch the cameras so that video ties for MaxN were the same across all
cameras and thus additive.
Line 220. ‘not very distinct differences’. Change this language. Suggest. No distinct differences
Line 224-5. ‘result for taxonomic composition alone was also not significant’. Change language,
suggest ‘ no significant differences were detected for taxonomic composition’.
Line 229. Change ‘individuals’ to ‘counts’.
Discussion
Line 324. Delete ‘often’.
Line 327-328. Delete ‘(see Results, species richness)’. Hopefully readers had the sense to read the
results section, no need to reference it here.
Line 330-333. Combine these two thoughts/sentences. No need to separate this into two
thoughts. These are all solutions to the same issue.
Line 363. Change ‘more individuals cannot fit within the field of view’ … ‘when field of view is
saturated’.
370-372. So Bacheler et al are wrong? MaxN has been shown to be non-linear to increasing
population size. As population increases MaxN cannot detect this change and theoretically this
could either be due to your metric or because in fact it didn’t change. Seems to me there would
still be a concern especially if a species is thought to be recovering.
380-384. This is being done. Kilfoil et al put videos into a landscaped 360 view and derived
counts simultaneously according to their methods. If you do have to derive counts on individual
cameras then you’d be right.
380-395. Mentioned before these cameras now are coming in single packages. Nikon, Kodak,
Samsung among many other manufacturers have put together units that cost approximately 500$.
Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center is deploying them. Single pass on the video annotation,
not as you say 4x the number of cameras.
Several papers have now come out stating that MaxN methods underestimate shark abundance.
415-416. So you say that expense and time with viewing has to be balanced against getting more
27
deployments instead of more cameras. Except what you have effectively done is created more
video to read and more time and expense. This doesn’t seem logical to me.
The whole expense part of the argument should just be dropped.
416-420. This is a problem for any optical based survey, not just for 360. The bottleneck has
always been manual processing of data.

Appendix A
Associate Editor's comments (Dr Michael Tobler):
We have received two reviews for the manuscripts. Overall, the reviewers agreed
that this was an interesting and meritorious study that warrants publication.
However, both reviewers identified a number of issues that need to be addressed
before the manuscript is acceptable for publication. In particular, the writing needs
to be improved through the paper, and one reviewer has provided an extensive list
of constructive comments that will help to improve the current version.
Following recommendations by the three reviewers, we expanded on the importance
of current; clarified our recommendations and conclusions, expanded on the growing
use of automated software for video processing, conducted additional suggested
analyses for investigating the secondary attraction hypothesis and improved and
clarified the writing throughout. We feel these changes have substantially improved
our manuscript.
All other minor proposed changes were also abided by as specified in the detailed
response to reviewers’ comments below.
Please see the reviewer comments in bold and our responses in italics.
Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
This is an interesting study that details the use of 4 cameras on a BRUVs
system compared to the traditional single camera. The study design appears
sound with good replication and data interpretation is reasonable and
presented well. I feel the text could be tightened up, particularly the
discussion, and have the following suggestions below:
We thank the reviewer for his/her comments which have helped improve our
manuscript. We have addressed each specific comment below.
Lines 90-110: The last two paragraphs in the Introduction are very similar and
repetitive, and the first paragraph (90-101) was confusing to read. Shorten and
merge the two paragraphs together with a brief background of what is
knowledge is lacking and then lead into the objectives of your study to address
these.
The two paragraphs have been merged and additional background about the
knowledge gap has been added. The paragraph now reads:
“The issues surrounding the potential for counting errors and biases with BRUVS
may hinder the uptake of this method by some researchers or cause widespread
biases within monitoring datasets. The use of additional cameras, facing in directions
other than toward the bait, could increase species richness from observations of shy
individuals typically reluctant to approach the bait or through increased abundance
estimates due to a greater field of view than with one camera only. This increase in
field of view also allows the downstream current direction to be observed, which
may lead to sighting more individuals and species as they are likely to swim
upstream towards the bait. By increasing the chances of sighting more individuals
and species, this modification to BRUVS may help to address some inherent biases
and speed up its uptake among the scientific community. Thus, the objective of this
study is therefore to test whether additional cameras can increase abundance and
richness estimates compared to using a single viewpoint. We aim to 1) study how
communities observed on the additional viewpoints differ from the front (bait-
facing) viewpoint, and determine whether additional cameras can increase 2) the
observed species richness, 3) the sightings of shy or infrequently-seen species, and 4)
the ability to detect differences in abundance by maximising MaxN estimates, e.g.
when screen saturation occurs or by counting individuals not sighted on the bait-
facing camera. We also investigate whether our findings are consistent across current
directions and different locations.”
Line 109: Delete ‘plan to’.
We have made this change
Line 148: Regarding the shy species, was this across just the 4 cameras on the
BRUV or across all 4 replicates (16 cameras)?
We have clarified this in-text to make it clearer for the reader:
“‘Infrequently-seen’ species were classified as species observed fewer than three
times across all replicate videos and viewpoints”
Line 153-160. A lot of use of the term ‘…was chosen…’! Modify and shorten
lines 154-160.
We have changed this paragraph to cut down on the use of ‘was chosen’:
“These species were selected as they were either abundant, schooling species that
aggregated in large numbers to feed on the bait (T. degeni and Pseudocaranx spp,),
commonly observed to feed and mill around the BRUVS (C. auratus), or in the case
of H. portusjacksoni, have low MaxN, but present in higher number than MaxN
based on the ability to identify individuals using colour patterns and size.”
Line 169: Provide a reference to support the use of transforming data by
dispersion weighting.
A reference is already supplied in the text:
“Multi-species assemblage data were transformed using dispersion weighting (by
Site; 30)”
30. Clarke, K., Chapman, M., Somerfield, P., Needham, H. 2006 Dispersion-
based weighting of species counts in assemblage analyses. Mar. Ecol. Prog.
Ser. 320, 11-27. (10.3354/meps320011)
Line 185: How was current direction actually determined? If this paper is
assessing impacts of current direction, how was it accurately determined what
direction the current was flowing? Was a scientific instrument deployed to
record current or was it an observer estimate?
Estimates by the same observer. Current direction was determined based on particle
movements observed on the BRUVS footage. This was deemed a better method than
surface current observations which might have been different from current direction
on the seabed where the BRUVS were deployed. We have modified the text to make
this clearer:
“To assess the influence of current on the assemblages observed, current direction
was determined based on the flow of particles and marine plants in front of the
cameras.”
Line 236: I would suggest ‘mild’ is replaced with either ‘minor’ or ‘small’.
We have removed the word minor following reviewer #2’s recommendations.
Line 295: No need for the word ‘possible’
Possible was removed from this sentence
Line 313-325: Is it really just current that is influencing this? What about the
effects of ‘secondary attraction’? This is where species are potentially drawn to
the BRUV because of the large numbers of fish aggregating around it, see
Taylor (2013) and Harasti et al (2015) that discuss this. Did you look to see if
increased numbers of fish around the BRUV was more likely to attract the shy
or infrequently seen species? It may not actually be the bait plume/current
direction that is driving this; it could potentially be the secondary attraction
factor where shy/rare fish are curious to see what the large schools of fish are
looking at! This could easily be assessed by comparing number of individual
fishes on BRUVs across all 4 camera’s and relate to number of shy/infrequently
seen species and see if there is a relationship. Having the 4 camera coverage is
the only study I know of that would allow this analyse, and would be of
interest to BRUV researchers. Is it possible to assess this relationship?
Based on the recommendation by this reviewer, we added the proposed references to
the Discussion and conducted the proposed analysis and compared the number of shy
and infrequently-seen species to the number of fish around the BRUVS. Pearson
correlations and Bonferroni probabilities showed that neither shy species (r = 0.005
and p = 0.983) nor infrequently-seen species (r = -0.463 and p = 0.053) were
significantly correlated with fish abundance around the BRUVS. We have added a
sentence in our results to reflect this:
“Pearson correlations and Bonferroni probabilities showed that neither shy species (r
= 0.005 and p = 0.983) nor infrequently-seen species (r = -0.463 and p = 0.053) were
significantly correlated with total fish abundance around the BRUVS.”
Line 322: Delete the ).
We have made this change
Line 343-344: Regarding the comment ‘where researchers may wish to detect
any abundance differences between closed and open areas.’ Comparisons in
differences of abundances between fished and non-fished areas is one of the
most frequently reported observations in numerous BRUV papers! Relative
abundance comparisons are common, if the authors believe that the 4 camera
MaxN is better than just single camera MaxN then there needs to be better
justification for its use. What about the negativity for use of four cameras?
Using 4 cameras’ increases the costs through the actual requirement of more
cameras and also the additional video analysis time. This is mentioned in the
section labelled ‘recommendations’ at the end of the discussion, but would be
more appropriate to discuss in the actual discussion section when talking
about the Pros and Cons of the four camera system.
The recommendation section was removed from the manuscript following reviewer
#1’s comment (see below), with some of the pros and cons moved to this section as
suggested:
From line 396
“Comparatively, to fully analyse the videos using standard analysis techniques with
non-automated software, each additional camera increases video processing time.
The additional cameras also add extra capital cost to the project for equipment and
are logistically more challenging to organise in the field.”
Line 376: I suggest getting rid of the subheading ‘recommendations’ and
instead merge this information into paragraphs with the conclusion section.
There is no requirement in this journal to have a ‘recommendations’ section
and they don’t need to be stand along points. Incorporate these points into the
discussion and summarise in the conclusion, particularly as the existing
conclusion section is already repeating points made in the recommendations
section.
The conclusions section was modified and recommendations section was removed:
“In conclusion, the additional cameras enabled us to better understand the biases
associated with counting abundance and richness from a single viewpoint. We were
able to reduce the effect of one type of counting error, false negatives, by observing
additional species and individuals not present on the front viewpoint. In particular,
the extra viewpoints are useful for observing infrequently-seen and shy species
through the ability to view the downstream current direction and viewpoints not
containing the bait and associated activity. There is, however, a high cost in terms of
capital outlay for equipment and analysis time accompanying the additional
viewpoints, so we recommend that researchers think carefully about this methods
applicability to the desired study and whether additional deployments should be
undertaken instead to increase the power to detect small differences. Studies which
may particularly benefit from use of this technology are those capable of running
automated video analyses that dramatically cut down video processing time (e.g.,
through machine learning), those which are likely to have a high saturation of
individuals on the front camera, and studies requiring species list and diversity
estimates as comprehensive as possible.”
Reviewer: 2
I think this paper is publishable eventually and with some more care put into
defining some of the methods. For instance camera orientation seems to be
focused on but and upstream downstream is sort of an afterthought in
describing methods. Additionally it’s unclear how 360 counts were truly
derived synchronized cameras or sums of MaxN counts. The paper seems to
be lacking in terms of really delving into the literature. There is a lot out there
historically per the effect of bait, yet the author deems it as being lacking,
whereas this has been fairly well described and investigated in fact. The
writing seems to not target a scientific audience and relies on many colloquial
terms which is fine if you’re trying to relate scientific findings to non-scientific
audiences, but it’s not for a scientific journal. There is an opportunity for more
analysis concerning the relationship between field of view and abundance that
appears to have been missed. I think the analyses concerning abundance
would benefit from a GLM or GAM approach that would allow for a more
formal approach to understand how abundance is being
impacted. Multivariate approach is good for the assemblage/community
analysis. There is no treatment of current speed and how this might have
impacted these results either. Paper needs quite a lot of work for it to be
ready for publication.
We thank the reviewer for his/her thorough comments, which have greatly improved
our manuscript. We have addressed below each specific comment and provided more
information about how 360 degree counts were derived, more literature on the effects
of current on bait plume dispersal, tightened up the terminology used, and provided
clarification about how we measured current direction but the lack of current speed
information.
With regards to the proposed GLM or GAM approach, the graphs we present
convincingly show non-linearity confined to the highest total abundances. We feel
that there is no requirement to further model that relationship using either GLM or
GAM because it is a rather minor point in our argument that does not require further
mathematical description. In fact, the cost in journal space to describe, report, interpret
and reference that extra but minor component would blow out the length of this
manuscript. Hence we choose to not adopt the suggestion for the little extra it would
bring to this paper.
Abstract
15 – As a stand-alone piece of information this makes very little sense. What
does front-facing camera mean? Keep in mind at this point a reader hasn’t
digested your methods. Without information about orientation to
current/habitat/bait this makes zero biological sense.
We have changed the text to clarify the viewpoint as bait-facing for the abstract and
introduction until we define our terms in the methods section:
“…previously only assessed fishes using a single bait-facing viewpoint.” and “…but
the bait-facing viewpoint recorded the highest fish abundance.”
16-18 – Remove the parenthetical statement and just state
this. Shy/infrequently species were seen up to 60% more often given 360
views.
We have reworded the sentence to improve clarity:
“Sightings of infrequently-seen and shy species increased with the additional
cameras and the extra viewpoints also allowed the abundance estimates of highly-
abundant schooling species to be up to 60 % higher.”
19-20 – The reasons you typically use cameras are that scuba or some other
method is unavailable. Drop cameras are nice to avoid these
difficulties. However deployment of drop cameras with a specific orientation
is next to impossible. I think a better recommendation is collecting current
information so that you can model that effect in your abundance is far more
achievable. Additionally If you don’t need stereo 360 systems are now being
built in the 500$ range, so in fact they’re just as cheap.
The sentence has been reworded to refocus our recommendations given that
researchers may find it hard to specifically orient a BRUVS. We still feel that 360
degree cameras do pose additional cost even in term of processing time and have thus
left this fact in the abstract:
“Due to the equipment and processing time costs of adding extra cameras, we
recommend the use of additional cameras for studies focusing on shyer species or
those particularly interested in increasing the sensitivity of the method by avoiding
saturation in highly-abundant species. Studies may also benefit from using additional
cameras to focus observation on the downstream viewpoint.”
21 – I think there are multiple accepted spellings for focussing (US spell check
catches this spelling), but may want to check.
Both spellings appear acceptable on their own, but we have changed it to focusing
throughout to ensure consistency
20-22 – So you suggest that 360 cameras are good for shy or infrequent (low
count) fish or for abundant fish. My experience has been that this is not a
piece of information you’ll know in advance (high counts in particular), so why
wouldn’t you err on the side of 360?
While it is not possible to predict MaxN for all species prior to undertaking the study,
scientists should know the aims and focus of their study and thus relative importance
of collecting a comprehensive list of species or likelihood of encountering schooling
species that may saturate the screen. If these are critical to the study, we recommend
that 360 degree BRUVS are used. However, we argue that the increased equipment
cost and processing time does not justify using 360 degree BRUVS in all situations, and
that scientists should instead gauge whether 360 degree BRUVS should be used
depending on their study aims
Introduction
29-31 – I’d say with traditional fishing gears you have few ways to address
biases due to the inherent ‘blindness’ about their deployment. Juxtaposed
against cameras which can give you additional information concerning any
particular deployment (e.g. habitat or current data).
We have added a sentence about these differences:
“In particular, many traditional sampling methods such as using fishing gear in the
marine realm have limited ways to address potential biases compared to more
modern camera-based methods which can provide additional information such as
behaviour, habitat, and current information.”
33-39 – True for count data but I can think of a many other types of biases
(e.g. size selectivity of gear, research designs themselves, seasonality of
deployment). So really your talking specifically about detection.
We have clarified this to make it clearer to the reader:
“The most likely way in which detection biases are incorporated into ecological data
occurs…”
40-41 – The used detection probabilities to understand detection bias? This
sentence needs sorting out.
We have reworded the sentence to make it clearer:
“For example, biases related to species richness estimates within avian communities
have been assessed using detection probabilities to determine the number of visits
and grid size required to record rare and common species (5).”
40-46 – I would say that these are all accurate however they’re sort of left as
stand-alone items with no development of thought or coherent relationship to
the problem. They need to be connected to your problem better. Paragraph
needs development.
We have modified the paragraph as shown
“Some studies have previously attempted to address such biases. For example, biases
related to species richness estimates within avian communities have been assessed
using detection probabilities to determine the number of visits and grid size required
to record rare and common species (5). In the marine realm, studies have addressed
biases associated with fish behaviour during scuba-diving underwater surveys by
using bubble-free equipment, i.e. rebreathers (6). Point-independence analysis has
also been used to assess the detectability of penguins during ship-based surveys
using mark-recapture methods compared to standard strip transects (7). However,
other novel methods have not had the same level of scrutiny with regards to potential
biases inherent to the equipment or experimental design used.”
48-52 – As with the end of the last paragraph, these two sentences are more or
less independent thoughts. I’d almost just ditch the first sentence, simply
because of all the fisheries gears out there optics have allowed for probably
the most intensive scrutiny due to their nature. Whereas hooking gears
everybody just sort of tacitly accepts without thinking all that thoroughly
about them.
The first sentence was modified to relate to previous paragraph (shown above), which
now flows better and provides a more cohesive argument for both paragraphs
53 – Changes community-wide to just ‘community’
We have made this change
64 – Find a more appropriate term than ‘scared off’. Avoid, avoidance
behavior, etc
We have changed the term to “exhibit avoidance behaviour”
64 – e.g. due to increased predation risk
We have made the following change:
“For example, shy species might exhibit avoidance behaviour (e.g. due to increased
predation risk) as a result of the fish activity surrounding the bait (13).”
66 – ‘can be missed’ change to ‘might not be observed’
We have made this change
67-68 – ‘fish based bait’ implies then that fish attracted to the area are
piscivorous. Carnivorous is probably fine but the other term is more
appropriate.
We have modified the sentence as shown:
“Rare or uncommon species might not be observed on the BRUVS, particularly if
they are not piscivorous (13), as non-piscivorous (e.g. herbivorous or planktivorous)
species are generally less likely to be attracted to the usually fish-based bait.”
67 – what exactly is a non-carnivorous species? Herbivorous? Planktivorous?
See the changes made above
71 – ‘Along with biases related to the ability to detect species’ … change to
read ‘along with detection biases’
We have made this change
76 – Models have demonstrated this (Schobernd), this wasn’t modeled as
camera saturation, it was modeled as time spent on camera as a function of
movement speed. Abundance or camera saturation wasn’t explicitly tested.
It appears as though the only empirically derived estimate (Stobart) actually
says that both MaxN and MeanCount underestimate at high abundance?
We have clarified this section as follows:
“MaxN has been shown under some circumstances to be non-linearly related to true
abundance, such as when abundances at the bait are great but more fish cannot
physically fit within the video frame (referred to as screen saturation) (17). Other
metrics have been suggested as alternatives to MaxN, e.g. MeanCount (18), but they
also have their own associated biases (e.g. decreased detection probability, 19) and
have been shown to be similarly non-linearly related to true abundance and cause
underestimations for highly-abundant species (20).”
80 – Take a look at the following publication that’s come out. It appears as
though MeanCount might not actually resolve the non-linearity issue.
Kilfoil, James P., et al. "Baited Remote Underwater Video surveys undercount
sharks at high densities: insights from full-spherical camera technologies."
Marine Ecology Progress Series 585 (2017): 113-121.
This publication was not available when our manuscript was submitted, hence why we
did not cite this paper in our original submission. We have now cited the paper in
numerous locations of our manuscript (e.g. see the above response (Ref #20)).
80 – Alternatively you could describe this as decreased detection probability.
See the changes shown above
84 – Bacheler et al have described this in several spots I believe. Not too
mention this is a frequent topic for BRUVS in deep water. Trenkel et al. has a
few as well. Check out:
Bacheler, Nathan M., et al. "Environmental conditions and habitat
characteristics influence trap and video detection probabilities for reef fish
species." Marine Ecology Progress Series 517 (2014): 1-14.
Trenkel, Verena M., and Pascal Lorance. "Estimating Synaphobranchus kaupii
densities: contribution of fish behaviour to differences between bait
experiments and visual strip transects." Deep Sea Research Part I:
Oceanographic Research Papers 58.1 (2011): 63-71.
These references have now been added to the paragraph that has been modified as
shown below:
“Currents may also affect fish assemblages observed using BRUVS but there has
been little published work investigating their influence on the assemblages observed,
despite recommendations for such work to be carried out (21). Of the research that
has been conducted, studies have shown the bait plume will travel downstream and
act as an attractant, so that fish will then travel upstream towards the source of the
plume (22, 23). Trenkel and Lorance (23) also found that individuals had differing
reactions when encountering a bait plume which may further complicate the ability
to understand the effect of plume dispersal on fish assemblages. Thus, the direction
that the BRUVS faces may influence the number of species observed and so bias
abundance estimates through missing individuals or species. ”
92-94 – Reader knows nothing about your methods or setup at this point so
your referencing something without explanation and this will likely be
confusing.
The paragraph was modified according to reviewer #1’s comments and clarified this
for the reader (see response to reviewer #1 lines 90-110).
97-98 – How could you possibly always orient the cameras so that current is
always downstream of the orientation when the camera is viewing the bait
bag? These are drop cams correct? Seems to me you probably have a 25%
chance or so of this actually happening the way you describe.
The use of additional cameras facing in different directions will allow the downstream
current direction to be determined. Following reviewer #1’s comments, we added some
information about the method used to record current direction (see response to
reviewer #1 lines 90-110)
108 – Objective 4 needs clarification. Maximize MaxN estimates? How
so? Precision, total count?
This aim was modified to clarify what we meant by maximising MaxN estimates (see
response to reviewer #1 lines 90-110)
Methods
121 – change ‘across’ to ‘at’
We have made this change
125 – I’m not certain I understand what you mean by ‘fishing
replacement’? Was the other location protected from fishing at some point in
time?
We have clarified this sentence to make it clearer to the reader
“Sampling was conducted at five sites within four habitat types of Gulf St Vincent
(Online Resource 1). Aldinga Reef is a high-profile reef system with depths ranging
from 4 to 20 m. Long Spit is a shallow (~7 m) sand bank with abundant seagrass
meadows (Posidonia spp.). The Zanoni (a historically-significant shipwreck, sunk in
1865, protected from fishing) and The Barge (vessel purposely sunk 1.85 km south
of the Zanoni to provide an artificial reef where fishing is allowed, alleviating illegal
fishing pressure on the Zanoni) are wrecks in deep (18–20 m) soft-sediment habitats,
and a site called Near Zanoni (15 m) is situated in soft-sediment habitat 2 km away
from the Zanoni, outside the influence of these wrecks and open to fishing.”
132 – Might need to say models 3+ or 4 were mounted. Might be fine the way
it is, but there is no model 3+/4 and that’s how it reads. There are differences
in camera FOV, speed, light settings between the two versions. Did you ensure
they were on equivalent settings. If they weren’t did you randomize where the
3’s vs the 4’s were located ? Detection by different camera types, especially
with differing field of views (which is essentially you overall test with 360) can
make a difference.
We have modified the text to make this clearer to the reader and stated we tested for
differences in the FOV which were negligible:
“Custom-built BRUVS units were used, which consisted of a trapezoid metal frame
upon which four GoPro Hero 3+ or Hero 4 cameras (set to equivalent settings and
tested for field of view differences) were mounted. Each camera faced one of four
directions, to the Front (facing the bait bag), each side (Left and Right), and to the
Back (Fig. 1),…”
138 – There are probably studies out there that will tell you a bit about spatial
autocorrelation, or you can just test it here as a part of a statistical model.
Only recently have researchers recognised the need to correct for spatially induced
overdisperison by explicitly accounting for spatial autocorrelation (Bacheler and
Shertzer 2015). Issues of spatial autocorrelation in studies assessing fish assemblages
have previously been addressed through various methods. Most studies deploy BRUVS
within a minimum distance of 250–300 m to avoid individuals travelling between
replicates within the 60-min soak time (e.g. Heyns-Veale et al 2016). Other studies
have used spline correlograms (Rees et al 2014) or tested model residuals through
Moran’s I to rule out spatial autocorrelation (Yates et al 2016) and if present employed
generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) to account for the hierarchical spatial
structure of the sampling design allowing ‘location’ to be included as a random effect.
In our study, BRUVS were deployed at least 250 m from each other. In addition, large
and mobile species that are most likely to travel among BRUVS (e.g. smooth
rays, Dasyatis brevicaudata) were seen at only one BRUVS. We also checked
individuals of other large species which could be individually identified through
marking and scars (e.g. Port Jackson sharks, Heterodontus
portusjacksoni, snapper, Chrysophrys auratus, and fiddler rays, Trygonorrhina
dumerilii), for which we found no evidence of movement between replicates. Previous
studies using BRUVS assessing juvenile white sharks (Harasti et al. 2016) and using
vertically close-spaced benthic and pelagic BRUVS (Clarke et al. In review) similarly
found no evidence of movement between replicates. These suggests minimal
movement of individuals between replicates and that the 250 m distance between
BRUVS is sufficient to avoid spatial autocorrelation between replicates.

142-143 – you have the ability to track and understand individual fish? I don’t
believe this statement.
To investigate whether individuals were swimming between replicates, we looked for
species with identifying marks (such as Port Jackson sharks) and checked whether
identifiable individuals were observed on closely-spaced replicates. For large species
such as sharks, rays and large teleost fishes, we also investigated times that species
appeared on the various replicates to assess if it was possible for individuals to swim
between replicates.
157 – avoid these colloquial descriptions. Please use scientific terminology.
Mill is a scientific term to describe a specific behaviour and is commonly used in
association with other species such as dolphins (e.g., Shane et al 1986; Zanardo et al
2017)

158-160 – I don’t understand what you imply here. I think what you mean is
that there might be a relationship between either size, or spatial distribution of
these shark that would create the non-linearity at low abundance for this
species. Again, please describe this in scientific terms.
We have clarified this in our response above. Please see response to Reviewer #1 Lines
153-160
185-188 – is this assemblage or abundance data? I don’t understand the data
being tested and how that necessarily fits into a chi square test. Further I don’t
believe this is an entirely fair test of the effect of current. The chi square
would only test whether current direction had an effect on camera
orientation? But you connected this to species/abundance information in this
sentence. I would’ve thought a GLM or a GAM with orientation information
would’ve made far more sense in particular with T1 or abundance data.
The chi-square test assessed if the distribution of viewpoints across current directions
differed from the expected random allocation of 25 % (i.e. by chance the Front
Viewpoint would face the Downstream direction 25 % of the time). We then used CAP
analyses to determine whether the current direction was influencing the assemblages
and abundances observed. The chi-square and CAP analysis form two different tests.
One to assess potential bias in the direction BRUVS landed in relation to current, with
the second test used to assess the influence of current direction on fish assemblages.
The text was modified to make this clearer:
“To assess the influence of current on the assemblages observed, current direction
was determined based on the flow of particles and marine plants in front of the
cameras. We ran a Pearson Chi-square goodness-of-fit analysis to test whether the
distribution of viewpoints across current directions differed from the expected
random allocation of 25 % (i.e. by chance the Front Viewpoint would face the
Downstream direction 25 % of the time). CAP analyses were then used to assess the
effect of current direction on fish assemblage (multivariate) and abundance
(univariate).”
See our earlier response to reviewer #2 about conducting further GLM or GAM
approaches.
One thing that isn’t entirely clear to me is how do you generate 360 counts? If
that is a MaxN over fully synchronized and simultaneously observed cameras I
think you’re ok. However if you are simply summing the MaxN values over the
four separate reads, that are in fact not synched and viewed simultaneously,
then in fact the reads themselves (counts) are interrelated. You’ve likely
accounted for the same fish in several views depending on how your MaxN
value worked out in time. This needs to be abundantly clear per how this
value is derived.
We have included a new section clarifying how MaxN values were calculated:
“The video from each viewpoint was processed separately, with MaxN estimates
recorded for each species. To estimate whether MaxN increases when including all
four viewpoints, time at MaxN on the bait-facing camera was identified, with the
MaxN observed on the other three viewpoints at that time added to calculate the
maximum number of individuals sighted across all four viewpoints while avoiding
double-counting.”
Results
202-203 – not unanticipated in my opinion. The effect of the bait isn’t
fundamentally changing the community composition because the bait plume
and deployment time don’t operate on a larger spatial scale than the
community. Perhaps this would be the case where you have very small patch
reefs and you are attracting sand species into an otherwise reef community,
but that likely would be the case with or without the extra view points.
Yes, as this is the first study assessing each viewpoint individually we feel it was
necessary to test whether there were any differences between those viewpoints, we
have articulate this as our first aim in the introduction section.
“We aim to 1) study how communities observed on the additional viewpoints differ
from the front (bait-facing) viewpoint”
212 – total abundance (within or pooled species?).
We have clarified this as pooled species
215 – lay? I’m not certain I understand what this means statistically.
We have clarified our meaning in the text:
“…but pairwise tests were unable to differentiate which pairs were different (p >
0.058, Online Resource 3).”
218 – So the assemblages between these two sites were different between
them or these two are different from all the other sites.
The difference detected was among viewpoints which was significant at several sites,
we have clarified this in-text
“…with significant differences being observed between Viewpoints at Near Zanoni
and the Barge…”
226 – Given the sample size I’d say this is unlikely to be significant … and it
wasn’t.
We wished to test whether our BRUVS had a tendency to face any particular
orientation (maybe through influence of the bait bag etc.), thus we conducted this chi-
square test to ensure that we had an adequate spread of current directions in relation
to different viewpoints. It was good that this was not significant as it meant we could
run further tests on current direction without having the bias of one viewpoint facing a
particular current direction resulting in viewpoint and current direction being
confounding.
223-231 – In all of this I see no real information on current strength. Perhaps
some of the ‘non-result’ on current is associated with differential currents at
drops, plus low samples?
We were unable to accurately measure current speed/strength at the depth where
BRUVS were deployed as current meters were not available. We attempted to estimate
current speed/strength from the footage collected (as we did for current direction), but
could not quantitatively and reliably estimate strength and, therefore, did not include
it in the analysis. We also feel that current speed/strength is unlikely to affect which
direction fish are observed on the BRUVS unit as this is most likely to be determined
by current direction, but future studies incorporating current meters into the design
may shine light on any such influences. So anything here about strength would merely
be speculation.
236 – Mild? Please discontinue the colloquial terms. This is in fact a 20%
increase in the estimate. Not all that mild especially you’re ramping up
sample, that would be easily detectable.
We have removed the word ‘mild’ and replaced it with ‘moderate’.
240 – Unsurprising.
We wished to test whether current direction may relate to species numbers due to
previous research indicating species may swim upstream towards the bait (e.g.
Bachelor et al. 2014). Without such test we would not be aware of whether such
differences could occur.
240-249 – Upstream and downstream. Front/back, Left/right. I think you need
to more explicitly define this in methods. Upstream downstream is almost an
afterthought as a parenthetical statement at the very end of the methods, but
in my mind is actually the critical thing to understand as this actually has the
impact on your viewing. These also feel like the more important results. You
don’t get much difference in composition or abundance regardless of
left/right/back/front … however you do see differences when you ask the
question of how was the bait bag oriented up or down stream of the current.
Trenkel demonstrates this pretty effectively as too why this result would
happen.
We have now explicitly defined these terms in method section and through a figure
(Fig. 1):
“Each camera faced one of four directions, to the Front (facing the bait bag), each
side (Left and Right), and to the Back (Fig. 1)”
And
“To assess the influence of current on the assemblages observed, current direction
was determined based on the flow of particles and marine plants in front of the
cameras. Each viewpoint within a BRUVS deployment was classified in relation to
the observed current direction (Fig. 1).”
For each results section, we addressed each aim in relation to viewpoint and then
current direction to ensure consistency for the reader.
263 – these species were less likely to be mobile, so really, this is a habitat
effect. Did you land on their house or not?
While species behaviour such as this could certainly influence results, we feel that this
is not the case for our chosen species as we saw an effect from Viewpoint. This
observed difference between Viewpoint shows that these species were mobile enough
to move around a BRUVS.
266-272 – Figure 6a … this nonlinearity is what’s being referred to by
Schobernd et al. The fact that at low abundances fits with Campbell et al who
suggest that for species that generally have low counts, the non-linearity is
basically a non-issue. I would actually test these in a GAM to evaluate fit when
you apply smoothing terms. Does the fit improve when you smooth a term
(i.e. allow the spline to bend to the shape of the curve) versus if it were a linear
fit. I’d say this is evidence that increasing field of view allows for examination
of the relationship suggested in Campbell et al. I’d suggest that you expand
on the analysis with this data.
We have cited those references in our discussion and further added a sentence about
the Campbell et al. results:
“MaxN has been reported to have a non-linear relationship with true abundance,
particularly for highly abundant species that can reach a saturation point, where more
individuals cannot fit within the field of view (17,18). By having the extra
viewpoints, we were able to count more individuals within the areas surrounding the
BRUVS and thus get a better representation of the abundance of a given species and
so reduce biases such as false negatives.”
and
“These results are similar to others (19), and further emphasis that those species
which have lower abundances are less affected by the non-linearity issues with
MaxN.”
See our response to reviewer #2 for our justification about not conducting additional
GAM analyses.
Discussion
278-279 – especially for highly abundant schooling species and shy guys. So if
it’s equivalent in other regards this is a better approach. Think you need to
emphasize that.
We agree that it is important for shy and abundant schooling species and we have
further emphasised these results later in the discussion:
“Studies which may particularly benefit from use of this technology are those
capable of running automated video analyses that dramatically cut down video
processing time (e.g., through machine learning), those which are likely to have a
high saturation of individuals on the front camera, and studies requiring species list
and diversity estimates as comprehensive as possible.”
284 – Only in a couple of habitat types for whatever reason, which could be
explained by other things. You’ve detailed this as a species specific kind of a
result owing to the presence of the leatherjacket. But that’s really an
argument about abundance and not assemblage. Assemblages you’ve shown
repeatedly no significant difference. I think you’re mixing results a bit
here. Needs to be cleaned up.
We have clarified the text to make this more obvious to the reader:
“There were detectable differences among the front and additional viewpoints with
most of these differences being driven by the higher abundance of some species on
the front viewpoint.”
287 – delete mill around.
We have made this change
300-302 – seems to be the strongest argument as to why you would want to
have 360 views. You can’t control the drop (25% chance of orientation in 1-4
positions). Therefore if current is modifying spatial distributions of the fish
you are underestimating abundance 25-50% of the time depending on the
field of view of the camera.
We have added in a recommendation further in the paragraph:
“Therefore, facing the BRUVS downstream using divers or via modified frame
designs may also lead to a reduction in false negatives. Where this is not feasible,
using 360 BRUVS will ensure that the downstream current direction is sampled.”
300-311 – I definitely agree. What about orientation of the cameras relative to
structure? Shy species etc might be impact by this as well. Really I’d define
most of this as ‘aggregating factors’. Bait, habitat, current, and
schooling. Theoretically these would all have a similar impact on data
abundance in particular.
A sentence about structures was added:
“Similar to current, proximity to structures (e.g. reef) may also affect the
assemblages observed (23, 23) by using additional viewpoints researchers can ensure
any viewpoints facing structures can also be adequately sampled.”
330 – work on the colloquial language throughout.
We have gone through the manuscript and removed the colloquial language we could
identify. For example, we have changed ‘scared by’ to ‘avoid’, and replaced ‘mild’ with
‘moderate’.
338 – nonlinearity in 6a. Leatherjackets. You could test fit in a GAM by
inclusion or exclusion of a smoothing term. Look up Simon Woods work on
this.
As stated earlier, the graphs we present convincingly show non-linearity confined to
the highest total abundances. We feel that there is no requirement to further model
that relationship using either GLM or GAM because it is a rather minor point in our
argument that does not require further mathematical description. In fact, the cost in
journal space to describe, report, interpret and reference that extra but minor
component would blow out the length of this manuscript. Hence we choose to not
adopt the suggestion for the little extra it would bring to this paper.
335-349 – there is also a critical link to stock assessment. The goal is to
understand whether a population is increasing or decreasing. This would
increase the ability of MaxN estimates to detect increases in population size,
that otherwise are nonlinear at high abundance (i.e. diminished ability to
detect this increasing trend). Good news is that at least the MaxN estimate is
still on the conservative side.
We agree and have added further information about stock assessments:
“By having the extra viewpoints, we were able to count more individuals within the
areas surrounding the BRUVS and thus get a better representation of the abundance
of a given species, reducing biases such as false negatives. This may be useful to
researchers who want more sensitive abundance estimates such as in marine
protected areas, where researchers may wish to detect differences in abundance
between closed and open areas or to conduct stock assessments.”
“356 – See Kilfoil et al. This is being done.
We have added in a sentence about this technique, but could not originally cite this
paper as it was not publicly available when the study was conceived and carried out,
nor when this manuscript was submitted:
“If advances were made in the automation of software for MaxN analysis, better
estimates could be calculated using additional viewpoints. Advancements also in the
use of commercially-available 360° video units have made it possible to use stitched
together-360° viewpoints to calculate abundances (20).”
381 – 383 – not if they’re synched into a landscape or composite 360
view. Disagree that they provide little benefit. You can understand current,
habitat location, relative to bait, improved detection of rare and abundant
species. There is much to be gained.
We have changed this section and moved it according to reviewer 1’s comments. We
have tried to fairly highlight pros and cons of using 360 degree BRUVS:
“One of the benefits of using the method used of the present study to maximise
MaxN is that it is relatively quick and only requires approximately 15 minutes to
calculate for the first species within a replicate with subsequent species taking a
shorter amount of time due to less file opening and calculating synchronisation times
for the videos. Comparatively, to fully analyse the videos using standard analysis
techniques with non-automated software, each additional camera increases video
processing time. The additional cameras also add extra capital cost to the project for
equipment and are logistically more challenging to organise in the field.”
From the conclusion:
“The additional cameras enabled us to better understand the biases associated with
counting abundance and richness from a single viewpoint. We were able to reduce
the effect of one type of counting error, false negatives, by observing additional
species and individuals not present on the front viewpoint. In particular, the extra
viewpoints are useful for observing infrequently-seen and shy species through the
ability to view the downstream current direction and viewpoints not containing the
bait and associated activity. There is, however, a high cost in terms of capital outlay
for equipment and analysis time accompanying the additional viewpoints, so we
recommend that researchers think carefully about their applicability to the desired
study and whether those research funds could be better spent on increased
replication. Studies which may particularly benefit from use of this technology are
those capable of running automated video analyses that dramatically cut down video
processing time (e.g., through machine learning), those which are likely to have a
high saturation of individuals on the front camera, and studies requiring species list
and diversity estimates as comprehensive as possible.”
388 – Or just put a 360 camera in the water. There are also versions that spin
on a pedestal.
We have changed this section according to reviewer #1’s comments by removing this
recommendation section and have clarified our recommendations within the
conclusion section.
Figure 1. I’d orient the pictures so that front and front are the same across
images. You could pretty much make this a single picture rather than two.
We feel that merging the two images would make the figure overly cluttered and
detach from an important aspect of the manuscript (defining the terms for viewpoint
and current direction) that the reviewer has previously highlighted (see reviewer #2
240-249). We have chosen this orientation as it aligns both the left and right sides to
be intuitive for the reader.
Reviewer: 3
To estimate species abundance with video-based methods will become more
an more relevant as the cost for underwater equipment is going down. Your
research is focusing on the tradeoff between accuracy in the measurement and
the effort to analyse the data when increasing the number of cameras, which is
a relevant topic for the community.
Let me give you some comments that could help to improve the paper:
* As stated in your introduction, your work is relying on BRUVS. For not-baited
video stations the you probably would end up with other results. This
restriction should be clearly stated in your abstract, conclusions and maybe in
the title as well.
We have changed the title to “What are we missing? Advantages of using more than
one viewpoint to estimate fish assemblages using baited videos” and clarified in our
abstract that only baited stations were used.
* A lot of progress has been made on automatic detection, identification and
tracking of fish in video sequences. Those new tools can dramatically cut down
costs in video analysis. Maybe you can revise your recommendations with this
trend in mind.
We have clarified this in the text and in the new conclusion/recommendation section,
see responses to Reviewer #1 and #2 above.
* Is there a chance to check your method against ground truth data? Maybe in
a large aquarium where the correct abundance of each species is known?
Aquariums studies must suffer from being unnatural due to the confinement of fishes
and the lack of habitat features, water flow, depth range, etc. The effect of bait in an
aquarium and the distance/direction from which fish would be approaching the bait
would be different to in situ situation. As such, we feel that aquarium experiments are
unlikely to be suitable. We’ve now moved beyond that need to test such set-ups under
unnatural conditions.
* It would be helpful for the user to get more information on the BRUVS: 1.
The opening angle of the cameras? 2. Use of artificial light?
The opening angle of the camera underwater was calculated to be approximately 94°
resulting in practicable 360° views around the BRUVS without overlapping when
considering camera spacing. No artificial light was used as deployments were
undertaken during daylight hours. Both these were added to the methods to clarify the
manuscript:
“The opening angle of the camera underwater was calculated to be approximately
94° resulting in practicable 360° views around the BRUVS without overlapping
when considering camera spacing.”
“BRUVS were deployed during daylight hours at each site over a one-month period
in the austral summer of 2016.”
* The provided XLS file is already a derived result. Do you grant access to the
raw material of the video cameras?
All species and abundance data were provided and enables analysis to be undertaken.
Raw video footage is not practical to upload with data depository due to its large file
size (1.5 TB).

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Michael Tobler):
The manuscript has been re-evaluated by the reviewers, and the revisions were generally
well-received. One reviewer points out that the paper could be improved with a different
statistical approach, and I encourage the authors to explore the suggestions in order to
publish the best possible paper. The reviewers also have a series of additional edits that
should be addressed before the paper can be finally accepted.
We have made the following minor changes to our manuscript as proposed by the reviewers,
please see our detailed response below.
Please see the reviewer comments in bold and our responses in italics.

Comments to the Author(s)
This was a vast improvement in terms of grammar etc, focusing language and being
descriptive in regards to methods however there are still grammatical issues in the
paper that were not cleaned up after round one. More importantly I still have an issue
with the statistical approach and the answer to that particular question:
‘With regards to the proposed GLM or GAM approach, the graphs we present
convincingly show non-linearity confined to the highest total abundances. We feel
that there is no requirement to further model that relationship using either GLM or
GAM because it is a rather minor point in our argument that does not require further
mathematical description. In fact, the cost in journal space to describe, report, interpret
and reference that extra but minor component would blow out the length of this
manuscript. Hence we choose to not adopt the suggestion for the little extra it would
bring to this paper.’
I strongly disagree on this statement. PRIMER is a piece of software that is most useful
for multivariate/community analysis. So the approach is appropriate for the
community analysis. However, for the univariate analysis this is not the best nor most
powerful approach. The power in using a GAM/GLM is that you can actually test
whether there is an improvement over a linear model. Further, describing that you use
a different statistical test would not make this paper exceedingly long (a sentence at
best), these are common statistical approaches found throughout the literature and as
always, the best statistical method is always the best answer. There are many available
open source programs that are well suited/vetted to conduct the analysis. Figure 6
graph-a is not ‘convincingly’ linear. Hence the suggested use of other distributions
that can test this question. Use of a GLM/GAM can also better frame your
‘convincingly’ linear statement on the other 3 species your testing for which it does
appear to be linear (e.g. use of information criteria, AIC for instance, to evaluate model
fits by the addition of a smoothing term).
Additionally given that there are now single unit spherical cameras on the market that
offer cameras in the 500 dollar range, don’t increase the amount of effort to annotate
video etc. The entire argument about cost here is just not holding water and should be
dropped.
We would like to thank reviewer #2 for their additional helpful comments on our manuscript,
we feel they have again improved our paper. Please see our specific responses below.
In regards to the use of GLM/GAM, it was not our intention to specifically test whether our
results conform to the theory of non-linearity of MaxN. Due to the low number of data points
(n = 6 -10) we have for each species present in Fig. 6, GLM/GAM statistical analyses are not
appropriate on such small dataset, thus why we have chosen this graphical analysis (we did
however run GLM and GAM anyway for the data presented and found no significant differences
between the models, probably due to low power from those sample sizes, thus we have not
included this in our revised manuscript). And given that the data for one camera are actually a
subset of that for all cameras, we feel that this non-independence puts any formal analysis on
shaky ground (hence our attempt at graphical examination).
Furthermore we have not ever used the PRIMER software in this section of the manuscript and
are sorry for any confusion surrounding this topic that may have arisen from
miscommunications about what was analysed in previous iterations of these reviewers’
comments. Our original aim for this section of the paper was to determine if MaxN was
different between the front and combined viewpoints regardless of the relationship between the
two MaxN. We feel that the graphs clearly show that the two MaxN are similar for the Port
Jackson shark, trevally, and snapper, but different for the leatherjacket due to the combined
MaxN being higher than the front only once MaxN >100, which is our main take-home
message for this section.

Abstract
Line 11-13. Perhaps true in Australia but in the US this isn’t really the case at all. AFSC
survey of Alaskan reefs uses no bait on their drop cam and drift cam surveys, SEFIS
survey in the South Atlantic is bidirectional, State of Florida survey (FWC) in the Gulf
uses bidirectional cameras, SEAMAP gulf of mexico uses 4 orthogonally placed
cameras (possibly spherical systems now), Florida State University uses a camera that
rotates on an axis.
Modify this statement to reference ‘some’ or ‘most Australian’.
We have updated this sentence to include ‘most’, as this is what we found when we conducted
our global review of baited video systems (Whitmarsh et al. 2017). It could be that there are
more unbaited systems using additional viewpoints or that the above projects remain as yet
unpublished, but such studies are not the focus of our paper.
Line 19. Costs are coming down significantly. Kodak 360 view camera, Nikon Key
Mission, Samsung 360 all cost around 500 bucks US. Just not accurate that this costs
more. Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center is currently deploying the Kodak camera
with their BotCam camera. Therefore costs are essentially the same as a single axis 70
degree field of view of GoPros.
We have removed the wording related to the costs and restructure the sentence as follows
“We specifically recommend the use of additional cameras for studies focusing on shyer
species or those particularly interested in increasing the sensitivity of the method by avoiding
saturation in highly-abundant species”
Line 36. Change from ‘currents’ to oceanographic conditions (e.g. water clarity and
currents)
We have made this change
Line 50. Delete ‘also’
We have made this change
Line 51-53. People have spent careers studying things like selectivity and catchability
for all kinds of gears. There is a long history of people trying to understand exactly
what a gear is collecting. Doesn’t mean that they’ve always had the answer, but it’s
certainly not for lack of effort. Restructure this sentence.
We have restructured this sentence as follows
“However, while some methods are suitably studied to address biases, other more novel
methods have not had the same level of scrutiny to potential biases inherent to the equipment
or experimental design.”
Line 108-109. Every single NMFS science center in the US has some optically based
survey. I think I’d just delete the part on ‘speeding up the uptake’. BRUV and other
optically based surveys have matured and are accepted routinely at assessments since
the early 2000’s. I’d redirect this towards a bigger question of how will laboratories
keep up with and deal with ever changing technology. Fisheries gears are stuck back
in the 80’s, whereas cameras and acoustics continue to improve ever single
year. Probably would be more on point given your topic on this paper.
We have reworded the sentence as follows
“By increasing the chances of sighting more individuals and species, this modification to
BRUVS may help to address some inherent biases and assist in informing the scientific
community of changing technological advancements.”
Line 109. Delete either thus or therefore.
We have removed ‘therefore’
Line 101. Add ‘species’ before richness.
We have made this change
Methods
Line 152. Change ‘replicates’ to ‘sites’.
This change was not made as replicates and sites represent two different spatial levels of
sampling with replicates being the individual deployments made within each site and thus
closer together than deployments made between sites.
169-173. How did you synch the cameras so that video ties for MaxN were the same
across all cameras and thus additive.
We used time that the BRUVS entered the water or settled on the seafloor to synch the times
between cameras. We have added the following sentence into the manuscript to describe this
“Times between cameras were synched to either the time the BRUVS entered the water or
reached the seafloor.”
Line 220. ‘not very distinct differences’. Change this language. Suggest. No distinct
differences
We have made this change
Line 224-5. ‘result for taxonomic composition alone was also not significant’. Change
language, suggest ‘ no significant differences were detected for taxonomic
composition’.
We have made this change
Line 229. Change ‘individuals’ to ‘counts’.
We have made this change
Discussion
Line 324. Delete ‘often’.
We have made this change
Line 327-328. Delete ‘(see Results, species richness)’. Hopefully readers had the sense
to read the results section, no need to reference it here.
We have made this change
Line 330-333. Combine these two thoughts/sentences. No need to separate this into
two thoughts. These are all solutions to the same issue.
We have made the following change to address this comment
“Therefore, facing the BRUVS downstream using divers, a modified frame design, or 360°
BRUVS may also lead to a reduction in false negatives.”
Line 363. Change ‘more individuals cannot fit within the field of view’ … ‘when field of
view is saturated’.
We would like to keep our original wording as we feel it links better with the first part of the
sentence and explains what a saturation point is for readers who may not be aware of such
terminology.
370-372. So Bacheler et al are wrong? MaxN has been shown to be non-linear to
increasing population size. As population increases MaxN cannot detect this change
and theoretically this could either be due to your metric or because in fact it didn’t
change. Seems to me there would still be a concern especially if a species is thought to
be recovering.
Our findings broadly agree that regular MaxN is likely to be non-linearly related to true
abundance for species with large population sizes similar to the results we found for our
schooling leatherjacket species. Other species with lower abundances did not show this non-
linearity which is also consistent with other studies. If researchers are interested in those species
that are often saturating their viewpoints, they should consider using additional viewpoints to
increase the accuracy of their abundance estimates. We have modified the text below to be
clearer.
“MaxN has been reported to have a non-linear relationship with true abundance, particularly
for highly abundant species that can reach a saturation point, where more individuals cannot
fit within the field of view (17,18). We have found similar results from our study as by
having the extra viewpoints we were able to count more individuals within the areas
surrounding the BRUVS. This enabled a better representation of the abundance of a given
species, especially in cases where a species was highly abundant and thus more likely to have
an abundance non-linearly related to MaxN estimates. Therefore, additional viewpoints were
able to reduce biases such as false negatives. This may be useful in studies requiring more
sensitive abundance estimates such as in marine protected areas, where researchers may wish
to detect any abundance differences between closed and open areas, or to conduct stock
assessments. Maximising MaxN estimates was most effective for highly-abundant species,
such as T. degeni. For species with lower abundances or without a tendency to mill around
the BRUVS, there are fewer benefits from using additional viewpoints to maximise MaxN.
For example, often there were no individuals occurring on any of the other viewpoints when
MaxN occurred at the front for Pseudocaranx spp. or H. portusjacksoni (see Fig. 6). These
results are similar to others (19), and further emphasise that those species which have lower
abundances are less affected by the non-linearity issues with MaxN.”
380-384. This is being done. Kilfoil et al put videos into a landscaped 360 view and
derived counts simultaneously according to their methods. If you do have to derive
counts on individual cameras then you’d be right.
We have added an additional reference to Kilfoil et al. as follows
“It could nevertheless be calculated by either watching the four viewpoint videos
simultaneously to find the highest MaxN across all viewpoints (similar to what is done by
those using stitched-together 360° videos e.g. 20) or to record fish numbers continuously as
they enter and leave the field of view and subsequently analyse the data to find the highest
MaxN.”
380-395. Mentioned before these cameras now are coming in single packages. Nikon,
Kodak, Samsung among many other manufacturers have put together units that cost
approximately 500$. Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center is deploying them. Single
pass on the video annotation, not as you say 4x the number of cameras.
Several papers have now come out stating that MaxN methods underestimate shark
abundance.
It seems likely to us that these single passes would take longer to watch with the increased field
of view compared to a normal video. Nevertheless, we agree that costs are getting cheaper and
360 will likely be an affordable option in the near future for many studies. We have added text
to include this.
“The additional cameras also add some extra capital cost to the project for equipment and
may be logistically more challenging to organise in the field, but newly commercially-
available 360° units are becoming increasingly more affordable.”
415-416. So you say that expense and time with viewing has to be balanced against
getting more deployments instead of more cameras. Except what you have effectively
done is created more video to read and more time and expense. This doesn’t seem
logical to me.
The whole expense part of the argument should just be dropped.
We have removed the sentences relating to costs
416-420. This is a problem for any optical based survey, not just for 360. The
bottleneck has always been manual processing of data.
We agree, but as machine-based learning and automated analyses become more widespread
and accessible, this extra ‘power’ could be put to good use using 360 viewpoints to get better
abundance estimates. We have reworded the sentence to make this clearer.
“While all optical-based surveys are likely to benefit, studies incorporating additional
viewpoints may particularly benefit from use of automated video analyses that dramatically
cut down video processing time (e.g. through machine learning).”

Comments to the Author(s)
The recommendations of the reviewers have been accurately recognized by the
authors. Most of them have been used to improve the manuscript. In some cases the
authors give good reasons not to pick up the suggestion - e.g. not to blur the focus of
the paper. With my scientific background, I do not have any additional comments.
We would like to again thank this reviewer for their previous helpful comments.
