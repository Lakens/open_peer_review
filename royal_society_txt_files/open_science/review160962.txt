The manuscript of Eady and Brown presents an interesting study on a fundamental question:
Which sex exerts primary control over copulation duration? The interests of the two sexes usually
do not coincide, and how this sexual conflict is resolved – closer to the male’s or the female’s
optimum - is one of the central question of evolutionary biologists and behavioural ecologists.
The authors address this question using the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. They found
that copula duration was repeatable, when males or females mated repeatedly with the same
male. However, when males or females copulated with different mates, copular duration was not
repeatable. Therefore, they concluded that it is neither the male nor the female that has the upper
hand, rather copulation duration is the outcome of male-female interactions.
The manuscript is very well written. Nevertheless, I have some problems with the design that
unless addressed, may undermine the interpretation of the results presented.
In my opinion the design does not allow to distinguish whether the male, the female or both
sexes control copulation duration. The author’s prediction was that if males exert control over
copula duration they will modulate their behavior according to the phenotype of the female.
Thus, copula duration of female should be repeatable, when the same female phenotype is
presented to different males (line 74-77). However, the problem is that even though it is not
repeatable it does not necessary mean that it is not under male control. The different males
presented might have different behavioral strategy due to genetic differences or differences in
condition. Consequently, the presented result can still mean that copulation is under male control
(or in female control, if females differ in their specific copulation strategies).

This is a neat, and well written and reported study with an interesting result. I have only a few
minor suggestions that I believe will improve the manuscript:
3
1. I would like to see a clear justification in the Methods for the repeated mating of females and
males. State, with reference to relevant literature, that this species mates multiply, and what is
known about the effect of mating on remating inhibition and copula duration of rematings.
2. While the data analyses are relatively simple, I would prefer a little extra detail regarding the
tests that were performed, including a clear statement of the dependent and independent
variables.
3. In the Discussion, suggest mechanisms used by females and males to determine the quality of
mating partners. Size seems to not be important. Cuticular hydrocarbons perhaps?
I have also included an annotated version of the manuscript, which includes a few minor
typographical improvements.

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author(s)
The authors clarified all the points raised and made appropriate changes. I have no futher
comments.
Reviewer 1 makes a good point “…the problem is that even though it is not repeatable it
does not necessary mean that it is not under male control. The different males presented
might have different behavioral strategy due to genetic differences or differences in
condition. Consequently, the presented result can still mean that copulation is under male
control (or in female control, if females differ in their specific copulation strategies).”
Essentially reviewer 1 is saying that males could modulate their copulatory behaviour in
response to different female phenotypes/genotypes. Thus, male A might increase copula
duration when mating with female Z, whilst male B might reduce copula duration when
mating with female Z. In both situations, males could technically be in control of copula
duration. However, in this scenario (painted by reviewer 1) the outcome (duration of copula)
is the result of a male-female interaction, and this is our primary take-home message. Thus,
in some respects we are both right. We believe we can resolve this by replacing the short-
hand term ‘control of..’ with ‘consistent, sex-specific modulation of…’. We have done this on
the last line of the abstract and refrained using the term control in the introduction at original
line 71 and original line 74. Of interest, we do not refer to males or females controlling
copulation in the discussion.
Thus:
These data suggest copulatory behaviour in C. maculatus to be largely the product of male-
female interactions rather than one sex exerting control over the other.
Changed to
These data suggest copulatory behaviour in C. maculatus to be largely the product of male-
female interactions rather than the consistent, sex-specific modulation of copula duration of
one protagonist in response to phenotypic variation in the other protagonist.
However, whilst this approach clearly partitions variation in copulation duration to male and
female population origin, it does not tell us which sex controls copulation within a population.

However, whilst this approach clearly partitions variation in copulation duration to male and

duration within a population.
The logic follows that if males exert control over the duration of copulation they will modulate
their behaviour according to the phenotype of the female.

Reviewer 2
1. I would like to see a clear justification in the Methods for the repeated mating of females
and males. State, with reference to relevant literature, that this species mates multiply, and
what is known about the effect of mating on remating inhibition and copula duration of
rematings.
We have added the following text to the 1st paragraph of the method section:
Under laboratory conditions about 80% of females remate within 48h of an initial copulation
so long as an adequate oviposition resource is available [30]. Female remating is also
influenced by male mating status: virgin males induce longer inter-mating refractory periods
in females than do non-virgin males [31].
Plus later in the methods when discussing how we controlled for an increase in copula
duration with mating history we refer to ref 34 (Puakku & Kotiaho 2005) who also found
copula duration to increase with increasing number of previous matings.
2. While the data analyses are relatively simple, I would prefer a little extra detail regarding
the tests that were performed, including a clear statement of the dependent and independent
variables.
In re-examining how intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated we discovered
an error in our calculations in that the calculated ICC values differed to those we originally
presented. However, the overall pattern and significance is the same (basically the
outcomes and take-home message are the same). Originally we calculated ICCs by hand
based on the treatment and error MS derived from a single classification ANOVA. The
ANOVA outputs are robust (i.e. cited F-values are identical to those presented in the original
manuscript as are the treatment MS and error MS values) but the new calculations yield
different ICC values. We verified this by running the analyses through the ICC package in R.
This has the benefit of providing 95% CI around our ICC estimates. Thus, although annoying
(to us) that we originally mis-calculated ICC values, the revision has led us to a more
complete description of our ICC values (i.e. we have now added the 95% CI’s to each ICC
value).
In the methods we have added text explaining exactly what were the IVs and DVs plus we
have added text (and a reference) to the fact we used the ICC package in R to calculate
Intraclass correlation coefficients.
3. In the Discussion, suggest mechanisms used by females and males to determine the
quality of mating partners. Size seems to not be important. Cuticular hydrocarbons perhaps?
Good point – we have added the following text and two new references to the discussion:
Some of these external stimuli could be conveyed via the hydrocarbon profiles of both males
and females as these are known to vary ontogenetically and in response to social cues [35].
They have also been shown to affect the duration of copula in D. melanogaster [36].
