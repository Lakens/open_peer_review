In this work, the authors reported the synthesis and application of Cu2O/HCFs for
nonenzymatic glucose detection. There are many grammar errors in this manuscript. The
manuscript is poorly prepared. The authors are encouraged to the check the English carefully. I
am afraid I cannot recommend the publication of this paper in the present forms.
Here are some comments for authors:
1. Please check the English carefully to avoid the errors.
2. The authors stated the HCFs are hollow structure. Please provide the high resolution TEM
image or SEM image to show the hollow structure. The HRTEM image for Cu2O should also be
included in the manuscript.
3. The authors stated “All relatively intense diffraction peaks with 2 theta angles of 36.2°, 43.5°,
62.4°and 74.7°, correspond to the crystal planes of (111), (200), (220), (311) of Cu matching well
with the standard XRD pattern for Cu2O of face-centered cubic lattice.[26] No peaks of impurity
(such as Cu) was found in the XRD patterns, indicating that the obtained particles are pure cubic
phase Cu2O with high crystallinity.” In Fig. 4, the XRD curve of sample at 500 °C is different to
other samples as there is large peak at around of 35 °. The authors claimed that the peaks
correspond to Cu. Subsequently, the authors present a conclusion that no peaks of impurity (such
as Cu) were found in the XRD patterns. Please check it.
4. Amperometric i-t curve are effective techniques to determine the analytical performance. The
authors should use Amperometric i-t curve rather than CV.
5. The selectivity should be tested by mixing the glucose with interferences.

This manuscript reports on a sensor for the detection of glucose using Cu2O nanoparticles doped
hollow carbon nanofibers (Cu2O/HCFs) as electrocatalysts. Cu2O/HCFs hybrid has been
successfully fabricated by in-situ deposition via direct reduction reaction of precursor
carbonization in thermal decomposition. The authors demonstrated that the resulting
Cu2O/HCFs represent promising enzyme-free glucose sensors. There are some critical
deficiencies to be improved before it can be accepted for publication. Detailed comments and
suggestions are listed as below.
1. Since the whole work is focused on Cu2O/HCFs hybrids, the key words of hollow carbon
nanofibers should be reflected in the title.
2. The references in the introduce should be more appropriate and more about the nanofiber-
based catalysts with the application in the field of biosensor. Although CNT is one dimensional
material, however, carbon nanofibers are the key factor in this manuscript. For example, the
Cu2O/rGO mentioned for photodegrading experiments? Cu2O/CNTs chrysanthemum-like
nanocomposite for the photocatalytic decomposition of phenol?
Besides, the highlight of this work is not clear: the reason why choosing Cu2O as biosensor
catalyst? Why doped (supported) on hollow carbon nanofibers or the advantage of the hollow
structure?
3. Fig. 3 XRD patterns are assigned to Cu2O not Cu. Can the authors explain the two pattern
peaks at around 36° in the red line.
4. Fig. 4 Raman spectra undergo significant changes, with the calcination temperature rising. The
broadened G band and increased D band in intensity mean amorphous carbon transforms into
graphitized carbon? The IG/ID ratio was calculated based on area or intensity? what about the
IG/ID ratios of the other samples?
5. Fig. 6 Cu2O/CHNS/GCE?
6. Why the glucose biosensor was performed in alkaline environment? Proper conventional
experiments should be included, i.e. steady-state current-time responses (I-t curves).

Comments to the Author(s)
In this work, the authors reported the synthesis and application of
Cu2O/HCFs for nonenzymatic glucose detection. There are many
grammar errors in this manuscript. The manuscript is poorly prepared.
The authors are encouraged to the check the English carefully. I am
afraid I cannot recommend the publication of this paper in the present
forms.
Here are some comments for authors:
1. Please check the English carefully to avoid the errors.
2. The authors stated the HCFs are hollow structure. Please provide the
high resolution TEM image or SEM image to show the hollow
structure. The HRTEM image for Cu2O should also be included in the
manuscript.
3. The authors stated “All relatively intense diffraction peaks with 2
theta angles of 36.2°, 43.5°, 62.4°and 74.7°, correspond to the crystal
planes of (111), (200), (220), (311) of Cu matching well with the
standard XRD pattern for Cu2O of face-centered cubic lattice.[26] No
peaks of impurity (such as Cu) was found in the XRD patterns,
indicating that the obtained particles are pure cubic phase Cu2O with
high crystallinity.” In Fig. 4, the XRD curve of sample at 500 °C is
different to other samples as there is large peak at around of 35 °. The
authors claimed that the peaks correspond to Cu. Subsequently, the
authors present a conclusion that no peaks of impurity (such as Cu)
were found in the XRD patterns. Please check it.
4. Amperometric i-t curve are effective techniques to determine the
analytical performance. The authors should use Amperometric i-t
curve rather than CV.
5. The selectivity should be tested by mixing the glucose with
interferences.

Thank you very much for your kind comments and good suggestions!
Based on the suggestions, I will answer the questions and modify the
article.
Answer questions
Questions:
1. Please check the English carefully to avoid the errors.
Answer:
Thank you for your kind questions.
We have revised the manuscript and tried our best to correct the
grammar mistakes. The manuscript has been resubmitted.
2. The authors stated the HCFs are hollow structure. Please provide the
high resolution TEM image or SEM image to show the hollow
structure. The HRTEM image for Cu2O should also be included in the
manuscript.
Answer:
Thank you for your kind questions.
We have performed TEM characterization of the material, as shown in
Fig.2c and Fig2.d. It can be seen from the TEM image that the
prepared material does show a distinct hollow structure, and the tube
wall and tube body can be clearly seen.
The purpose of this research work is that the novel modified carbon
materials were synthesized and their electrochemical performance was
studied. According to the existing characterization methods (XRD,
XPS) in the article, it can be confirmed that the metal particles in the
synthetic material in the experiment are cuprous oxide nanoparticles.
According to TEM characterization, it can be observed that the
cuprous oxide nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed inside the HCFs.

3. The authors stated “All relatively intense diffraction peaks with 2
theta angles of 36.2°, 43.5°, 62.4°and 74.7°, correspond to the crystal
planes of (111), (200), (220), (311) of Cu matching well with the
standard XRD pattern for Cu2O of face-centered cubic lattice.[26] No
peaks of impurity (such as Cu) was found in the XRD patterns,

different to other samples as there is large peak at around of 35 °. The
authors claimed that the peaks correspond to Cu. Subsequently, the
authors present a conclusion that no peaks of impurity (such as Cu)
were found in the XRD patterns. Please check it.
Answer:
Thank you for your kind questions.
Based on the comments provided, we re-prepared the material and
re-examined the materials. The previous “large peak at around 35°”
should be an instrument problem. We have put the new XRD
representation into the manuscript, as shown below.
Fig. 3 XRD patterns of Cu2O/HCFs.
Those were prepared at 400, 500 and 600oC for Cu2O/HCFs.
4. Amperometric i-t curve are effective techniques to determine the
analytical performance. The authors should use Amperometric i-t
curve rather than CV.
Answer:
Thank you for your kind questions.
Thanks to the ideas provided by the review, we used the Amperometric
i-t curve method to re-examine the linear range and selectivity. After
using the new technology, the results showed that the sensitivity was
improved, which was significantly higher than the old method. The
results of the selective investigation were clear at a glance. The
electrodes have good selectivity, the new linear range investigation and
selectivity results are shown below:
Fig. 9 (a) Amperometric responses of the Cu2O/HCFs modified
electrode after successive injection of 40 mM glucose in 0.1 M NaOH
at the applied potential of 1.1 V. (b) Plot of the catalytic current vs.
glucose concentration.
The following is the content of the article: including the analysis
results of the characterization results
......Fig. 9(a) illustrates the amperometric responses of the
Cu2O/HCFs/GCE upon successive addition of various concentrations
(7.99~33.33 µM) of glucose at a work potential of 1.1 V. In order to
achieve a homogeneous glucose concentration instantly,the solution
was vigorously stirred to ensure well-distributed of electrolyte and
glucose. Upon the addition of glucose, the Cu2O/HCFs/GCE reached
the dynamic equilibrium within 6s, indicating a very fast
amperometric response of modified electrode. Fig. 9(b) shows the
calibration curve of different concentrations of glucose on the
modified electrodes. As can be seen from Fig. 9(b), the Cu2O/HCFs
modified electrode displays a good linear range from 7.99 to 33.33
µM and the linear regression equation can be expressed as
I <U+F03D> 8.6538 <U+F0B4>10<U+F02D>8 C - 4.2746 <U+F0B4>10<U+F02D>5 (R 2 <U+F03D> 0.9919)
where I and C represent the response current and glucose
concentration, respectively. With a high sensitivity of 1218.3
µA·cm-2·mM-1, the the low limit of detection (LOD) was estimated to
be 0.48 µM by S/N =3, where S and N are standard deviation of the
background current and slope of the calibration curve, respectively.
Obviously, the Cu2O/HCFs modified electrode here possesses favorable
analytical properties. The high sensitivity was attributed to high
electrocatalytic activity of Cu2O nanoparticles.
5. The selectivity should be tested by mixing the glucose with
interferences.
Answer:
Thank you for your kind questions.
For the comments made by the review, we redesigned the experiment
and examined the selectivity using the new test method. The test
results are as follows:
Fig. 10 Amperometric responses of the Cu2O/HCFs modified electrode
to successive additions glucose (0.1 mM), AA (0.01 mM) and NaCl
(0.01 mM) Urea(0.01 mM), Valine (0.01 mM), Threonine (0.01 mM),
lysine (0.01 mM) in 0.1 M NaOH.
To evaluate the selectivity of the Cu2O/HCFs/GCE, seven possible
interfering biomolecules, Threonine, Valine, lysine, glutamic acid,
Ascorbic Acid(AA), Urea, and NaCl, which normally coexists with
glucose in human blood were examined. The experimental results are
shown in Fig. 10. Taking into consideration that the concentration of
glucose is at least 30 times of , AA, NaCl, Urea, Valine, Threonine and
lysine which is much higher than the concentrations of interfering
species in human blood [37], thus, normal physiological levels of
glucose (0.1 mM), AA (0.01 mM) and NaCl (0.01 mM) Urea(0.01
mM), Valine (0.01 mM), Threonine (0.01 mM), lysine (0.01 mM), in
0.1 M NaOH solution by CV measurement. As can be seen from Fig.
10, our fabricating sensor demonstrates high selectivity and reliable
anti-interference property by comparing the amperometric
responses of other relevant electroactive species.......

Comments to the Author(s)
This manuscript reports on a sensor for the detection of glucose using
Cu2O nanoparticles doped hollow carbon nanofibers (Cu2O/HCFs) as
electrocatalysts. Cu2O/HCFs hybrid has been successfully fabricated
by in-situ deposition via direct reduction reaction of precursor
carbonization in thermal decomposition. The authors demonstrated
that the resulting Cu2O/HCFs represent promising enzyme-free
glucose sensors. There are some critical deficiencies to be improved
before it can be accepted for publication. Detailed comments and
suggestions are listed as below.
1. Since the whole work is focused on Cu2O/HCFs hybrids, the key
words of hollow carbon nanofibers should be reflected in the title.
2. The references in the introduce should be more appropriate and
more about the nanofiber-based catalysts with the application in the
field of biosensor. Although CNT is one dimensional material,
however, carbon nanofibers are the key factor in this manuscript. For
example, the Cu2O/rGO mentioned for photodegrading experiments?
Cu2O/CNTs chrysanthemum-like nanocomposite for the photocatalytic

Answer:
Thank you very much for your kind comments and good suggestions!
Based on the suggestions, I will answer the questions and modify the
article.
Answer questions
Questions:
1. Since the whole work is focused on Cu2O/HCFs hybrids, the key
words of hollow carbon nanofibers should be reflected in the title.
Answer:
Thank you for your kind questions.
According to the request of the reviewer, I have changed the title to:
"Template synthesis of the Cu2O nanoparticles doped hollow
carbon nanofibers and their application as nonenzymatic glucose
biosensors"
2. The references in the introduce should be more appropriate and
more about the nanofiber-based catalysts with the application in the
field of biosensor. Although CNT is one dimensional material,
however, carbon nanofibers are the key factor in this manuscript. For
example, the Cu2O/rGO mentioned for photodegrading experiments?
Cu2O/CNTs chrysanthemum-like nanocomposite for the photocatalytic
decomposition of phenol?
Besides, the highlight of this work is not clear: the reason why
choosing Cu2O as biosensor catalyst? Why doped (supported) on
hollow carbon nanofibers or the advantage of the hollow structure?
Answer:
Thank you for your kind questions.
I have replaced the references in the preface with more relevant
articles. The paragraphs changed in the manuscript are as follows:
Among various metal oxides, Cu2O as an important class of p-type
semiconductor have been paid much attention in enzyme-free
glucose sensors in recent years owing to high electrocatalytic activity,
low cost, and good stability, has attracted much interest as a
promising candidate in the fabrication of electrochemical,[13]
Cu2O's advantages has been intensively investigated[14]. For example,
The Cu/Cu2O nanoclusters deposited carbon spheres have been
synthesized through a layer by layer assembly method and
subsequently in situ self reduction process, The results showed that
the Cu/Cu2O nanoclusters are homogeneously anchored onto the
carbon spheres ,The double shelled Cu/Cu2O/CSs showed remarkable
electrocatalytic activity toward glucose oxidation including two
linear range with high selectivity of 63.8 and 22.6 µA mM-1·cm-
2 respectively, as well as good stability and repeatability.[15] Siti Nur
Akmar Mohd Yazid et al. reported that a highly sensitive and
selective glucose sensor based on cuprous oxide/graphene
nanocomposites-modified glassy carbon electrode
(Cu2O/graphene/GCE). The proposed sensor was successfully applied
for the determination of glucose concentration in real human blood
samples.[16] A type of nanospindle-like Cu2O/straight multi-walled
carbon nanotubes (SMWNTs) nanohybrids modified electrode for
sensitive enzyme-free glucose detection has been fabricated, the
as-prepared nanospindle-like Cu2O/SMWNTs nanohybrids exhibit
much higher electrocatalytic activity on the oxidation of glucose than
the SMWNTs or Cu2O alone as the electrode modifying material,
More importantly, the nanohybrids modified electrode also show
good stability, reproducibility and high resistance against poisoning
by chloride ion and the commonly interfering species such as ascorbic
acid, dopamine, uric acid and acetamidophenol. These good
analytical performances make the nanospindle-like Cu2O/SMWNTs
nanohybrids promising for the future development of enzyme-free
glucose sensors.[17].

Cuprous oxide is a p-type semiconductor. Because of its high
electrocatalytic activity, good stability and low price, cuprous oxide is
used as a doping particle to bond with hollow carbon nanofibers.
Expect good electrochemical results.
The carbon-based material itself has good electrical conductivity, and
the internal network structure of the hollow carbon material is more
favorable for the improvement of electrochemical performance, and
the one-dimensional material has high aspect ratio, light weight, high
thermal conductivity, excellent electrical conductivity and the like, so
In the experiment, a hollow carbon material was selected as the main
body, and a cuprous oxide nanoparticle with high electrocatalytic
activity was used for modification to obtain a better electrochemical
effect.
3. Fig. 3 XRD patterns are assigned to Cu2O not Cu. Can the authors
explain the two pattern peaks at around 36° in the red line.
Answer:
Thank you for your kind questions.
Based on the comments provided, we re-prepared the material and
re-examined the material. The previous “ the two pattern peaks at
around 36° in the red line” should be an instrument problem. We have
put the new XRD representation into the manuscript, as shown below.
Fig. 3 XRD patterns of Cu2O/HCFs.
Those were prepared at 400, 500 and 600oC for Cu2O/HCFs.
4. Fig. 4 Raman spectra undergo significant changes, with the
calcination temperature rising. The broadened G band and increased D
band in intensity mean amorphous carbon transforms into graphitized
carbon? The IG/ID ratio was calculated based on area or intensity? what
about the IG/ID ratios of the other samples?
Answer:
Thank you for your kind questions.
The IG/ID ratio is calculated based on the height of the two peaks.
Since the AAO template is used as the hard template in this
experiment, the aluminum sheet will melt at 700°C, and the collapse of
the pores will cause the template to lose its significance as a template,
so the highest in the experiment. The temperature is 700°C, at which
carbon-based materials appear carbonized, but compared to carbon
nanotubes, the degree of carbonization is still less than that of carbon
nanotubes.
5. Fig. 6 Cu2O/CHNS/GCE?
Answer:
Thank you for your kind questions.
Due to my negligence, I put the uncompleted representation into the
manuscript. I didn’t notice it myself. Thanks to the reviewer’s
reminder, it has been corrected, as shown below.

6. Why the glucose biosensor was performed in alkaline environment?
Proper conventional experiments should be included, i.e. steady-state
current-time responses (I-t curves).
Answer:
Thank you for your kind questions.
Zhang et al.[34] investigated the effect of pH value on the glucose
electrochemical oxidation by Cu2O/HCFs modified electrode. The
result showed it is helpful to the mutarotation of glucose at high pH
value, and increasing current.

Thanks to the ideas provided by the review, we used the Amperometric
i-t curve method to re-examine the linear range and selectivity. After
using the new technology, the results showed that the sensitivity was
improved, which was significantly higher than the old method. The
results of the selective investigation were clear at a glance. The
electrodes have good selectivity, the new linear range investigation and
selectivity results are shown below:
Fig. 9 (a) Amperometric responses of the Cu2O/HCFs modified
electrode after successive injection of 40 mM glucose in 0.1 M NaOH
at the applied potential of 1.1 V. (b) Plot of the catalytic current vs.
glucose concentration.
The following is the content of the article: including the analysis
results of the characterization results
......Fig. 9(a) illustrates the amperometric responses of the
Cu2O/HCFs/GCE upon successive addition of various concentrations
(7.99~33.33 µM) of glucose at a work potential of 1.1 V. In order to
achieve a homogeneous glucose concentration instantly,the solution
was vigorously stirred to ensure well-distributed of electrolyte and
glucose. Upon the addition of glucose, the Cu2O/HCFs/GCE reached
the dynamic equilibrium within 6s, indicating a very fast
amperometric response of modified electrode. Fig. 9(b) shows the
calibration curve of different concentrations of glucose on the
modified electrodes. As can be seen from Fig. 9(b), the Cu2O/HCFs
modified electrode displays a good linear range from 7.99 to 33.33
µM and the linear regression equation can be expressed as
I <U+F03D> 8.6538 <U+F0B4>10<U+F02D>8 C - 4.2746 <U+F0B4>10<U+F02D>5 (R 2 <U+F03D> 0.9919)
where I and C represent the response current and glucose
concentration, respectively. With a high sensitivity of 1218.3
µA·cm-2·mM-1, the the low limit of detection (LOD) was estimated to
be 0.48 µM by S/N =3, where S and N are standard deviation of the
background current and slope of the calibration curve, respectively.
Obviously, the Cu2O/HCFs modified electrode here possesses favorable
analytical properties. The high sensitivity was attributed to high
electrocatalytic activity of Cu2O nanoparticles.
Fig. 10 Amperometric responses of the Cu2O/HCFs modified electrode
to successive additions glucose (0.1 mM), AA (0.01 mM) and NaCl
(0.01 mM) Urea(0.01 mM), Valine (0.01 mM), Threonine (0.01 mM),
lysine (0.01 mM) in 0.1 M NaOH.
To evaluate the selectivity of the Cu2O/HCFs/GCE, seven possible
interfering biomolecules, Threonine, Valine, lysine, glutamic acid,
Ascorbic Acid(AA), Urea, and NaCl, which normally coexists with
glucose in human blood were examined. The experimental results are
shown in Fig. 10. Taking into consideration that the concentration of
glucose is at least 30 times of , AA, NaCl, Urea, Valine, Threonine and
lysine which is much higher than the concentrations of interfering
species in human blood [37], thus, normal physiological levels of
glucose (0.1 mM), AA (0.01 mM) and NaCl (0.01 mM) Urea(0.01
mM), Valine (0.01 mM), Threonine (0.01 mM), lysine (0.01 mM), in
0.1 M NaOH solution by CV measurement. As can be seen from Fig.
10, our fabricating sensor demonstrates high selectivity and reliable
anti-interference property by comparing the amperometric
responses of other relevant electroactive species.......

Abstract: The cuprous oxide nanoparticles (Cu2O-NPs) doped hollow
carbon nanofibers (Cu2O/HCFs) directly synthesis by the anodic
aluminium oxide (AAO) template. The doped Cu2O NPs was formed
by in-situ deposition via direct reduction reaction of precursor
carbonization in thermal decomposition, and could act as
functionalized nanoparticles. The synthesized Cu2O/HCFs are
characterized in detail by transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) raman spectroscopy and inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results reveal that
Cu2O/HCFs have the tubular structure with an average diameter of ~
60 nm, and Cu2O NPs are uniformly distributed and highly dispersed
in HCFs. Electrochemical activity of Cu2O/HCFs was investigated by
cyclic voltammetry (CV), the glucose sensors displays high
electrochemical activity towards the oxidation of glucose. Cu2O/HCFs
are applying in the detection of glucose with a detection limit of 0.48
µM, a linear detection range from 7.99 to 33.33 µM and with a high
sensitivity of 1218.3 µ A·cm-2·mM. Moreover, the experimental
results demonstrate that Cu2O/HCFs have good stability,
reproducibility and selectivity. Our results suggest that
Cu2OCu2O/HCFs could be a promising candidate for the construction
of non-enzymatic sensor.

We have revised the manuscript and tried our best to correct the
grammar mistakes. The manuscript has been resubmitted.
2. In the part of “Introduction”, what is the AAO? Please write the

3. The author should take electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) to probe the electron transfer kinetics of each modified GCE.
Answer:
Thank you for your kind questions.
According to the comments provided by the reviewer, we added
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to the manuscript, and
used EIS to judge the electron transfer rate of the modified electrode
and the bare glassy carbon electrode. According to the characterization
results, the modified electrode has a higher electron transfer rate.
Helps the electrochemical detection of glucose, the characterization
results are as follows.
Fig. 7 Nyquist plots for Faradic impedance measurement of bare GCE(curve red) and
Cu2O/HCFs/GCE (curve black) in 0.1 mol/L NaOH containing 10 mmol/L K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4
[Fe(CN)6].The frequency range is from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz and the amplitude is 0.21
mV.
.............Nyquist plots for Faradic impedance measurement of bare
GCE(curve red) and Cu2O/HCFs/GCE (curve black) in 0.1 mol/L
NaOH containing 10 mmol/L K3 [Fe(CN)6 ]/K4 [Fe(CN)6].The
frequency range is from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz and the amplitude is
0.21 mV.When the electrode was modified with Cu2O/HCFs, the
diameter of the semicircle became significantly smaller, indicating
that Cu2O/HCFs can effectively accelerate the transmission of
electrons on the electrode surface. The results of the electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the glassy carbon electrode and the
modified electrode are consistent with the results of cyclic
voltammetry..................

Answer:
Thank you for your kind questions.
We have revised the manuscript and tried our best to correct the
grammar mistakes. The manuscript has been resubmitted.
The Cu2O/HCFs appearing in Q6 are the materials we synthesized.
The references are the citations contained in the interception part of
the article, and we check the cited documents, which are consistent
with the references.
2. In my opinion, the highlight is still not clear. I suggest the rewrite
the abstract section with more innovation points of this manuscript.
Answer:
Thank you for your kind questions.
The highlight of this work is on the synthesis of materials and the
potential of the material for the electrochemical detection of glucose.
The abstract part of the manuscript has been revised.
3. Several questions remain unanswered. The IG/ID ratios of the other
samples? In the manuscript, the G band broadened significantly and
displayed a shift to higher frequencies (blue-shift), and the D band
grew in intensity. How much the G band shifted and how much the
intensity increased, what is the data. It should be more accurate.
Answer:
Thank you for your kind questions.
Thanks for your suggestion, the article data should be more
comprehensive. For the reviewer's questions about Raman
spectroscopy data, we have listed the relevant data of the spectrum,
including the distance of the movement and the intensity of the peak
enhancement. The writing part is shown below, and the modified part
has been marked in red. The writing part is as follows:
Fig. 5 shows the Raman spectra of the samples calcined at 400, 500
and 600oC. The spectrum of our sample contains G band at 1584
cm-1, D band at 1352 cm-1. The D band represents the disordered
graphite associated with defects and amorphous carbon, whereas the
G band represents the ordered graphite corresponding to the
stretching mode of the C-C bonds in the graphite plane. The D band
is assigned to the breathing mode of A1g symmetry due to the phonon
interaction near the K zone boundary, while the G band is attributed
to the E2g phonon mode of the sp2 bonded carbon atoms.[28-30]
With the calcination temperature rising, Raman spectra undergo
significant changes. Specifically, the G band broadened significantly
and displayed a shift to higher frequencies (blue-shift), G band moved
from 1112 cm-1 to 1154 cm-1 and the D band D peak intensity
increased from 151.03 to 178.71. At 600oC, the peak Intensity
ratio (IG/ID) was 1.22, Crystalline carbon content gradually increases,
indicates that the amorphous carbon transforms into graphitized
carbon, which is consistent with the XRD results.
4. It’s better to provide the CV curves of Cu2O/HCFs with the
characteristic peaks of Cu2O in the supporting information.
Answer:
Thank you for your kind questions.
We have added the CV curve of Cu2O/HCFs to the support
information. In this work, it was determined that the synthetic metal
particles were cuprous oxide and the characteristics were XPS and
XRD, so I listed XPS and XRD characterization in the support
information. Add information as shown below
Fig.S2 CV curve of Cu2O/HCFs/GCE modified electrode for glucose
detection
Fig.S3 The above two pictures prove that we successfully prepared
Cu2O in the experiment.
