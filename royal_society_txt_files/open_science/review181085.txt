According to gamble-intending dilemma (GID) and risk-averting dilemma (RAD), the authors
demonstrate whether and when change the game class can eliminate the defectors in the system.
Especially, considering PD game, Chicken game, Stag-hunt game, trivial time game with
dilemma strength, authors demonstrate the five rules () have different mechanism for eliminating
the dilemma by distorting dilemma phase panel. Taking together, the proposed model could be
interesting and the related results also verified the theoretical analysis. However, they are also

Comments to the Author(s)

The idea of this paper is to use two parameters, representing the so-called “gamble-intending
dilemma” (GID) and “risk-averting dilemma” (RAD), to visualize the effects of various
mechanisms on the default phase plane (representing no external mechanism). The idea of such a
parametrization is already established in the literature, and the main contributions of this paper
are in how this parametrization is changed by five rules that are known to act as promoters of
cooperation. The new results are nicely illustrated in Figures 1-3.
This paper gives a nice way of visualizing how each of five mechanisms (direct reciprocity,
indirect reciprocity, kin selection, group selection, and network reciprocity) transforms the phase
plane, which is instructive to someone interested in the dynamics of social dilemmas. This paper
is appropriate for RSOS provided the authors make some minor revisions. I suggest in particular
that the material from the SI be moved to the main text and that the background on the GID and
RAD be explained better.
Comments:
Title: add “social” before “dilemma”
Abstract: it is not clear what the authors mean by “…the relaxation…”
Abstract: the last sentence, beginning “The current approach may explain…” should be removed.
This statement seems too speculative and bold given the results of the paper.
P3, Introduction: change “escape from dilemma situations” to “overcome conflicts of interest”
P3: what is the mark ‘ appearing in D_g’? Is this supposed to be a comma?
P3-4: the gamble-intending dilemma and the risk-averting dilemma should be explained more in
the text, especially in the introduction.
P4: “note that the following equations are established…” should be changed to “note that the
following equations hold…”
P4: The authors should describe these derivations more in the main text, perhaps by moving
some material from the SI text here and expanding upon it. It is hard to follow what the authors
mean without flipping to the SI text, and since the supplement is so short, it can probably be
incorporated into the main text in a way that makes the calculations clear from the outset.
P6: Why is x used for the probability of meeting in another round? This is typically w or
\lambda.
P6: What does “rev” refer to?
P11: The last paragraph, beginning “In the future…” is again too speculative. I would remove this
entire paragraph as it does not make any substantive contribution to the discussion.
SI text: the notation involving the summation is overly complicated for an expression involving
just two terms. Why not just write the two terms instead of \sum from i=1 to 2?

Social dilemma can be observed in various forms in the real-world. Even if he/she does
not know the word “prisoner’s dilemma”, he/she is exposed to various social dilemmas
that are familiar for them. For example, people driving a car are exposed to the social
dilemma when changing or merging their driving lanes [9,10]. Many people wonder
whether to receive an expensive vaccination or not, because if people around them are
vaccinated, they can be lowered the infection risk without paying the vaccination fee
(cost) [6,11,12]. Thus, understanding these social dilemma structures is important for us
to constructe a better cooperative society.

These five reciprocity mechanisms and classical dilemma games (i.e., prisoner’s
dilemma game, chicken game (also hawk-dove game and snowdrift game) and stag-hunt
game) have been extensively studied to understand the mechanisms of promotion and
the evolution of cooperative behaviour [14-17]. All five reciprocity mechanisms are
known to promote cooperative behaviour by resolution (relaxation) of social dilemmas.
If we can visualize the relaxation of social dilemma which mentioned above, it will help
us to intuitively understand the evolution and promotion mechanisms of cooperative
behaviour.

In this work, by drawing a RAD-GID phase-plane diagrams for pair-wise games, we

REPLY:
Thank you for the correction. We change “ escape from dilemma situations” to
“overcome conflicts of interest” .
Line 40 in track change version.
In game theory, the primary focus of the 2 × 2 (pair-wise) dilemma game is the
investigation of the types of reciprocity mechanisms that enable players to escape from
dilemma situations overcome conflicts of interest and promote cooperative behaviours
[7,8].
P3: what is the mark ‘ appearing in D_g’? Is this supposed to be a comma?
REPLY:
Thank you for the comment. Sorry for having caused of confusion, however this mark
[‘] is not typos. The first (classic) scaling parameters of dilemma strength was
developed in 2007, and at that time it was represented by Dg and Dr (Tanimoto and Sagara
2007). These Dg and Dr are useful in quantifying the dilemma strength in game with
well--mixed population. However, in 2009, Tanimoto showed that these Dg and
infinite, well
Dr may be insufficient for indicating the dilemma strength when a specific reciprocity
is introduced into pairpair--wise games. Therefore, we added above background and
explanations about these scaling parameters to tthe he main text.
Line 105-108 in track change version.
These Dg and Dr are useful in quantifying the dilemma strength in game with an infinite
well-mixed population [18]. However, in 2009, Tanimoto showed that these classical
GID and RAD alone may be insufficient for indicating the dilemma strength when a
specific reciprocity mechanism is introduced into a pair-wise game [19]. For this reason,
Wang et al. introduce a new set of scaling parameters considering a finite population
with any of the reciprocity mechanisms by defining a new set of GID and RAD as Dg’
and Dr’, respectively [20].
P3-4: the gamble-intending dilemma and the risk-averting dilemma should be explained
more in the text, especially in the introduction.

Gamble-intending dilemma (GID) situation means that no solution is optimal in terms
of the upper-side payoff, inevitably leading to a particular dilemma in which equal
players are inclined to exploit each other. Therefore, the players’ mutual strategy pairs
(C, C) cannot be an equilibrium in GID situations. On the other hand, risk-averting
dilemma (RAD) situation means that there is no worst payoff on the lower side,
inevitably leading to another particular dilemma, wherein equal players try not to be
exploited by each other. Therefore, the players’ mutual strategy pairs (D, D) must be an
equilibrium [18].

By introducing the concept of five rules into pair-wise games, we compare the revised
(recalculated) dilemma strength of a game that applies one of the five reciprocity rules
(Dr’rev and Dg’rev) with that of the default game (i.e., Dr’ and Dg’) (see hereafter Eqs.
(11)-(26)).
P11: The last paragraph, beginning “In the future…” is again too speculative. I
would remove this entire paragraph as it does not make any substantive contribution
to the discussion.
REPLY:
Thank you for the critical comment. We have made remove this paragraph.
SI text: the notation involving the summation is overly complicated for an expression
involving just two terms. Why not just write the two terms instead of \sum from i=1
to 2?
REPLY:
Thank you for the comment. However, wwee just follow Wang et al.’s previous work in
2015 (Wang et al. 2015. Physics of Life Reviews 14, 1- 1-30). Should we change this
formula?

18 Abstract
19 Game theory has been extensively applied to help explain how cooperative behaviour is
20 promoted in human and animal societies. How do humans and animals establish reciprocity
21 when confronting a social dilemma? In 2006, Nowak theoretically proved that numerous
22 mechanisms and models for evolving cooperative behaviour reported over the last few decades
23 can be distilled into five reciprocity mechanisms (rules). Additionally, universal scaling
24 parameters were proposed to measure two different types of dilemmas, namely, the
25 gamble-intending dilemma (GID) and risk-averting dilemma (RAD). In this work, by drawing a
26 RAD-GID phase-plane diagrams for pair-wise games, we prove that these five rules are indeed
27 quite different for the resolution (relaxation) of the two dilemmas. These diagrams also
28 demonstrate whether and when game-class change (resolution of a dilemma) occurs, thus
29 implying how defectors can be eliminated. The current approach may explain why and how
30 cooperation can be promoted in human and animal societies.

35 1. Introduction
36 Game theory has been formulated as a tool for the optimization of individual behaviours
37 and has been applied in biology to investigate the reasons why cooperative behaviour evolved in
38 animal and human societies [1-6]. In game theory, the primary focus of the 2 × 2 (pair-wise)
39 dilemma game is the investigation of the types of reciprocity mechanisms that enable players to
40 escape from dilemma situations overcome conflicts of interest and promote cooperative
41 behaviours [7,8]. Social dilemma can be observed in various forms in the real-world. Even if
42 he/she does not know the word “prisoner’s dilemma”, he/she is exposed to various social
43 dilemmas that are familiar for them. For example, people driving a car are exposed to the social
44 dilemma when changing or merging their driving lanes [9,10]. Many people wonder whether to
45 receive an expensive vaccination or not, because if people around them are vaccinated, they can
46 be lowered the infection risk without paying the vaccination fee (cost) [6,11,12]. Thus,
47 understanding these social dilemma structures is important for us to constructe a better
48 cooperative society. In a seminal paper, Nowak presented a theory of reciprocity mechanisms for
49 the evolution of cooperation in which all reciprocity can be categorized into the following five
50 rules (protocols): direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, kin selection, group selection, and
51 network reciprocity [13]. These fundamental mechanisms are collectively known as “social
52 viscosity”. The dilemma resolutions used in many (if not most) previous simulation studies can
3
53 be categorized into one of these five protocols (rules) of reciprocity, and the five rules can be
54 converted mathematically into a 2 × 2 payoff matrix [8]. These five reciprocity mechanisms and
55 classical dilemma games (i.e., prisoner’s dilemma game, chicken game (also hawk-dove game
56 and snowdrift game) and stag-hunt game) have been extensively studied to understand the
57 mechanisms of promotion and the evolution of cooperative behaviour [14-17]. All five
58 reciprocity mechanisms are known to promote cooperative behaviour by resolution (relaxation)
59 of social dilemmas. If we can visualize the relaxation of social dilemma which mentioned above,
60 it will help us to intuitively understand the evolution and promotion mechanisms of cooperative
61 behaviour.
62
63 In this work, we denote the payoff matrix of pair-wise games with two strategies:
64 cooperation (C) and defection (D). Player rewards are determined by the payoff matrix and the
65 strategies that they choose (i.e., (C) or (D)) as follows:
C D
A =   = C

D  
66 (1)
67 where we consider an unlimited well-mixed population. In a pair-wise game, the strength of a
68 dilemma that disturbs the promotion of cooperation is expressed as two types of universal scaling
69 parameters: (i) the strength of the gamble-intending dilemma (GID) Dg’ and (ii) the strength of
4
70 the risk-averting dilemma Dr’ [12,18-20]. Gamble-intending dilemma (GID) situation means that
71 no solution is optimal in terms of the upper-side payoff, inevitably leading to a particular
72 dilemma in which equal players are inclined to exploit each other. Therefore, the players’ mutual
73 strategy pairs (C, C) cannot be an equilibrium in GID situations. On the other hand, risk-averting
74 dilemma (RAD) situation means that there is no worst payoff on the lower side, inevitably
75 leading to another particular dilemma, wherein equal players try not to be exploited by each other.
76 Therefore, the players’ mutual strategy pairs (D, D) must be an equilibrium [18]. In practice, Dg’
77 appears because players attempt to exploit their opponents, while Dr’ appears because players
78 attempt to avoid exploitation by their opponents. These scaling parameters of dilemma strength
79 depend on the relative magnitudes of the payoff matrix elements P, R, S, and T (see Eq. (1)). In
80 this work, we denote the payoff matrix of pair-wise games with two strategies: cooperation (C)
81 and defection (D). Player rewards are determined by the payoff matrix and the strategies that
82 they choose (i.e., (C) or (D)) as follows:
C D
A =   = C

D  
83 (1)
84 where we consider an unlimited well-mixed population. Note that xi(t) is the frequency of
85 strategy i at time t. The expected payoff for strategy i is given by  = <U+2211>   . Therefore, the
86 average payoff is given by  = <U+2211>   . The replicator dynamics can be written as follows:
5
87
88   =   - . (2)
89
90 For simplicity, if x (0 = x = 1) represents the fraction of cooperation strategy (C), the equilibrium
91 of Eq. (2) is expressed in one or two of the following states:
92
 * = 0, 1,
!"
#!"!$%
93 . (3)
94
95 However, this condition does not hold in a finite well-mixed population or a population with any
96 of the reciprocity mechanisms. If the game is depicted using classical GID (Dg = T - R) and
97 classical RAD (Dr = P - S) dilemmas [18], the payoff matrix takes the following form:
98
 - '(
A =   = & + '  +.
*
99 (4)
100
101 We also note that the third equilibrium of Eq. (3), which is the so-called internal equilibrium, can
102 be represented as follows:
103
* = ,
,-
- !,.
104 . (5)

105
106 These Dg and Dr are useful in quantifying the dilemma strength in game with an infinite
107 well-mixed population [18]. However, in 2009, Tanimoto showed that these classical GID and
108 RAD alone may be insufficient for indicating the dilemma strength when a specific reciprocity
109 mechanism is introduced into a pair-wise game [19]. For this reason, Wang et al. introduce a new
110 set of scaling parameters considering a finite population with any of the reciprocity mechanisms
111 by defining a new set of GID and RAD as Dg’ and Dr’, respectively [20].

129 and
130 =  -  - '( ' (10)
131
132 Depending on these two dilemma strengths, the game can be divided into four classes:
133 Prisoner’s dilemma (PD), Chicken (also known as the Snowdrift or Hawk-dove game), Stag-hunt
134 (SH), and the Trivial game with no dilemma (Supplementary Table S1) [12,20]. If both Dg’ and
135 Dr’ are positive, the game is prisoner’s dilemma (PD), whereby Defection (D) dominates
136 Cooperation (C). If, Dg’ is positive and Dr’ is negative, we face the so-called chicken game (CH),
137 which has an internal (polymorphic) equilibrium. If Dg’ is negative and Dr’ is positive, the game,
138 characterized by bi-stability, is called the stag hunt (SH) game. Finally, if both Dg’ and Dr’ are
139 negative, we deal with the Trivial game, whereby (C) dominates (D) (i.e. no dilemma exists).
140 Therefore, we can evaluate the evolution of cooperation more precisely if we quantitatively
8
141 compare the two constitutional strengths of the reciprocity mechanisms in all 2 × 2 games
142 (irrespective of the reciprocity mechanisms and finiteness properties) using a RAD-GID diagram
143 that consists of the two standardized measures (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Table S2). According to
144 the concept of universal scaling, the relaxation of these two types of dilemma is expressed by the
145 shift of the x-axis (i.e., the RAD-axis) and the y-axis (i.e., the GID-axis) of the RAD-GID
146 phase-plane diagram to the positive domain [20]. In this paper, we refer to the Dr’– Dg’ phase
147 diagram without reciprocity as the “default” (Fig. 2A). Note that in the RAD-GID phase diagram,
148 the first, second, third, and fourth quadrants represent the PD, Chicken, Trivial, and SH game
149 structures, respectively (see Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S1 in the Supplementary
150 Information).
151 Here, we apply the five reciprocities (direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, kin selection,
152 group selection, and network reciprocity) to a traditional (well-mixed infinite population) 2 × 2
153 game and analyse how these five reciprocities relax the dilemma strength using universal scaling
154 (i.e., the RAD-GID phase planes). We also examine what types of games relax which types of
155 dilemma strength following the introduction of the five reciprocities.
156
157 2. Model
158 We verify the dilemma strength of a 2 × 2 game involving a payoff matrix (Eq. 1). We assume an
9
159 infinite, well-mixed population (i.e., an infinite number of agents). Two individuals (players) are
160 selected from an unlimited population at random and asked to play the game. Players receive a
161 reward depending on the selected strategies (C) or (D) (Eq. 1). By introducing the concept of five
162 rules into pair-wise games, we compare the revised (recalculated) dilemma strength of a game
163 that applies one of the five reciprocity rules (Dr’rev and Dg’rev) with that of the default game (i.e.,
164 Dr’ and Dg’) (see hereafter Eqs. (11)-(26)).
165
166 3. Methods
167 We calculate all the coordinates are transcribed by each of five reciprocity rules (Fig. 2). For
168 example, the payoff matrix of direct reciprocity is derived as follows [12,20]:

180 Therefore, the coordinate (Dr’, Dg’) = (1, 1) moves to the coordinate (Dr’rev, Dg’ rev) = (0.8, 0.6)
181 by direct reciprocity (see Figs. 1B and 2B). See also Supplementary Information for Here we
182 also show the derivations of the dilemma strength of a game that applies one of the other four
183 reciprocity rules (i.e., indirect reciprocity, kin selection, group selection and network reciprocity)

230 4. Analytical results
231 Because the introduction of a reciprocity protocol changes the dilemma strengths, it transfers the
232 coordinates (Dr’, Dg’) of the default game to the new coordinates (Dr’rev, Dg’rev) (Fig. 1B-E,
233 Supplementary Table S3). For example, a default PD (i.e., (Dr’, Dg’) = (0.1, 0.1)) is transferred
234 into the regions of SH or Trivial via dilemma relaxations (Fig. 1B). The five reciprocity rules
235 proceed with the following three types of game-class changes and their combinations:
236 (1) The PD game becomes Chicken via the reduction of RAD (Dr’ decreases
237 to Dr’rev).
238 (2) The PD game becomes SH via the reduction of GID (Dg’ decreases to
239 Dg’rev).
240 (3) The PD game becomes Trivial (i.e., the dilemma is eliminated) via the
241 reduction of both RAD and GID (Fig. 1, Supplementary Tables S3 and S4).
242 Note that we can observe both the relaxation of dilemmas and their
243 enhancements (e.g., indirect reciprocity in Figs. 1C-E).
244 Below, we describe the transformation of the default phase plane via the introduction of
245 the five reciprocity rules (Fig. 2). We can observe the relaxation of positive values of GID and
246 RAD in all five rules (Fig. 2B-F). The enhancement of negative values of GID and RAD is also
14
247 observed (Fig. 2B-D). For example, Kin selection results in both relaxation and enhancement of
248 negative values of GID and RAD by distorting the square frame (Fig. 2D). Distortion of the
249 frame occurs in kin selection and network reciprocity (Fig. 1D and 1F) because both parameters
250 S and T appear in single cells of the payoff matrix (see Eqs. (17) and (23)).
251 The relaxation of the two dilemmas may or may not result in changes in game classes
252 (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S4). In direct reciprocity, because the default origin moves in the
253 opposite direction of the GID, a portion of the Chicken and PD area is converted into Trivial and
254 SH, respectively (Fig. 3B). In contrast, no game-class change is found in indirect reciprocity (Fig.
255 3C). In the remaining three rules (kin selection, group selection and network reciprocity),
256 because the default origin moves in the opposite direction of GID and RAD, five types of
257 game-class conversion occur (i.e., PD to Chicken, PD to Trivial, PD to SH, Chicken to Trivial
258 and SH to Trivial) (Fig. 3D-F, Supplementary Table S4). The regions of the game-class change
259 are increased as the strength of social viscosity increases (Supplementary Figs. S1-S5).
260
261 5. Discussion
262 Previous studies of universal scaling parameters quantitatively estimate the strengths of dilemma
263 relaxation [10-13]. In the present study, by introducing the graphical representation of dilemma
264 strengths, we analyse the qualitative differences in the dilemma relaxation in a pair-wise game
15
265 when five reciprocity rules are introduced. We visually demonstrate that the five rules have
266 different mechanisms for eliminating dilemmas by distorting/transforming the dilemma phase
267 plane. We also show where the conversion of game classes occurs in the phase-plane diagram in
268 each of the five cases.
269 The current graphical approach may be useful for interpretations of social cooperation in
270 game-theory contexts. Using this approach, we can divide these five rules into three categories of
271 reciprocity promoters: (1) originator (direct reciprocity), (2) potentiator (indirect reciprocity),
272 and (3) booster/enhancer (kin selection, group selection, network reciprocity). First, direct
273 reciprocity induces the phase changes along GID (Chicken to Trivial and PD to SH), but no
274 phase change occurs along RAD. Direct reciprocity is often ensured by group living (e.g.,
275 nest-dwelling), which is necessary for the origin of cooperation [2,3,21-23]. The category of
276 indirect reciprocity does not produce phase conversion (game-class change), even though it
277 potentiates the other rules by shrinking the dilemma phase space [21,24,25]. Note that in indirect
278 reciprocity, the dilemma strength can be increased for the Chicken or SH games (Fig. 2C). The
279 third category is the booster/enhancer of three different types. Kin selection is the enhancer of
280 cooperation in the colony of close kin, leading to eusociality [25-30]. The close kin group is
281 easily formed in underground group-living dwellers, e.g., termites, naked moles, wasps/bees and
282 ants [31,32], and haplodiploidy should have further promoted the eusociality in hymenopterans
16
283 [33]. Group selection has a strong effect in enhancing cooperative behaviour in any society,
284 including non-kin groups. Group selection is suspected to develop in extremely harsh
285 environments (e.g., extremely cold climates, extremely high elevation) because the persistence of
286 an entire group is threatened [34]. For example, lichen has evolved obligate symbiosis in the air
287 or on rock, where no other organisms can sustain themselves. Stochastic environments may also
288 promote cooperation for the same reason [35].
289 Both group selection and network reciprocity are suspected as a promotion function in
290 human societies [34,36,37]. These two reciprocity mechanisms have an effect as a
291 booster/enhancer of cooperative behaviour in societies in which cooperation has fully penetrated.
292 All of the reciprocity mechanisms in the third category induce phase changes (game-class
293 changes) along both GID and RAD (Figs. 1-3). Therefore, we can expect that these three types of
294 reciprocity mechanisms are a strong booster/enhancer for the promotion of cooperation in
295 developing societies.
296 In the future, based on the differences among these five rules, we may be able to
297 demonstrate when and why the eusociality of kin groups or a highly cooperative non-kin society
298 developed. Our study may also explain when and why cooperative behaviour penetrates into any
299 given society. As Wang et al. describe, universal scaling of the dilemma strengths is a fascinating
300 subject that simplifies the underlying structure governing social dilemmas and improves our
17
301 understanding of the emergence of cooperative behaviour [12].

411 Fig. 1. Phase planes of a pair-wise game with coordinate movements with the introduction
412 of the five reciprocity rules. The shaded colours indicate the regions of Trivial (blue), Prisoner’s
413 dilemma (PD), (red), Chicken (yellow) and Stag-hunt (SH), (green) games. (A) Default
414 RAD-GID phase plane. (B-E) Phase plane with coordinate movements according to the five rules.
415 The default point (black circle) moves to each point (see above keys) with the introduction of the
416 five rules. Initial default coordinates (Dr’, Dg’) are (B) (0.1, 0.1) in PD, (C) (0.1, -0.1) in SH, (D)
417 (-0.1, 0.1) in Chicken, and (E) (-0.1, -0.1) in Trivial.

419 Fig. 2. Transformation of the default phase plane (–1 = Dg’, Dr’ = +1) with the introduction
420 of the five rules in all 2 × 2 games. The shaded colours indicate the regions of Trivial (blue),
421 Prisoner’s dilemma (PD), (red), Chicken (yellow) and Stag-hunt (SH) (green) games. (A) Default
422 phase plane. (B-F) Transformed phase plane with the introduction of (B) direct reciprocity, (C)
423 indirect reciprocity, (D) kin selection, (E) group selection and (F) network reciprocity. The origin
424 in the default moves to the direction of the points indicated by pink arrows. The red flames
425 indicate the default phase planes. The thick black arrows indicate the relaxation and
426 enhancement of GID and RAD.
