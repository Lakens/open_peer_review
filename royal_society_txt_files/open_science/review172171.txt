The authors describe a combined experimental and theoretical study about the influence of NH3
on the SOA formation from ozonolysis of styrene. The experimental methods used by this paper
are conventional and the results are believable. The theoretical calculations supported the
experimental findings. These results would obviously help us understand the atmospheric
chemistry of styrene. The manuscript is well organized and understandable. I recommend the
paper be published in this Journal.
Some minor comments and questions are as follows:
1. Has the author considered the competitive reaction of Criegee intermediate with H2O? The
Criegee intermediate + H2O is considered to be the most important reaction in the atmosphere. It
cannot be ignored even if the RH less than 5%.
2. For the simplest CH2O2 + H2O reaction, the CCSD(T)/CBS still cannot get the accurate energy
barrier. Why did the author choose the CBS method to get the reaction energy barrier?

pendix A
In this manuscript, the authors performed chamber experiments to determine the effect of NH3
ard the aerosol formation of Criegee intermediates formed from ozonolysis of styrene. Theoretical
ulations using CBS-QB3 was performed to support the obtained experimental results. The results
w that the NH3 cause decrease in the SOA formation. The experimental results are interesting, but
experiment was done in one NH3 concentration. I think it is important to perform experiments at
erent concentrations before discussing the atmospheric impact of NH3 toward Criegee intermediate
ct toward the aerosol formation. Theoretical simulation of the reaction of CH2OO and C6H5CHOO
h NH3 is given in the latter part of the paper. However, for these results to be used in comparison
h the chamber results, the authors should calculate the rates for the Criegee intermediate NH3
ction. Also, they should provide a theoretical estimate for the rates of the formation of the secondary
nide from CH2OO and C6H5CHOO reaction with an aldehyde. Then they should compare the aerosol
ming rate and NH3 reaction rate to give proof that the Criegee intermediate NH3 reaction is the
son for the lower aerosol formation. Considering these issues with the results, I suggest major
sion with new experimental and theoretical results.

Responses:
According to the suggestions of reviewer #1, explanations and changes were made
as follows:
1. Has the author considered the competitive reaction of Criegee intermediate with
H2O? The Criegee intermediate + H2O is considered to be the most important reaction
in the atmosphere. It cannot be ignored even if the RH less than 5%.
Author reply: This is a good question. The bimolecular reaction between Criegee
intermediate (CI) with water has been carried out in our previous study (J. Am. Chem.
Soc. 2016, 138, 14409-14422). Although the rate constants of CI + H2O is several
orders of magnitude lower than other substances (e.g. SO2), the CI+ H2O reaction is
much more important in nature for its extremely high concentration. However, in our
chamber experiments, the background gas used was much drier than the real
atmosphere. More importantly, we aim to compare the SOA yields with and without
NH3. The CI + H2O reaction plays an equal role in both cases. So the competitive
reaction of Criegee intermediate with H2O was not considered in this work.
2. For the simplest CH2O2 + H2O reaction, the CCSD(T)/CBS still cannot get the
accurate energy barrier. Why did the author choose the CBS method to get the reaction
energy barrier?
Author reply: Thanks for the reviewer’s question. Just as the reviewer said, the
CCSD(T)/CBS level cannot provide the exact barrier with regard to the CH2O2 reaction
with H2O.1 It is required to contain beyond CCSD(T) calculations such as CCSDT and
CCSDT(Q) for obtaining reliable barrier height. It is particularly prohibitive to obtain
accurate barriers for such large and complex reaction systems due to the extremely
expensive computational costs. The purpose of this theoretical work is to study the
reaction mechanisms of how the ammonia influence the CIs reaction with aldehydes,
and help to explain the experimental work deeply. Different electronic structure
calculation method can give different energy barriers. However, the differences
observed do not affect the energy order and the mechanism suggested. We do not aim
to test the theoretical methods by comparing CBS method and other methods as it is not
practical for the large reaction systems.

and all the revision have made is marked in red in the revised paper.
According to the suggestions of reviewer #2, explanations and changes were made
as follows:
In this manuscript, the authors performed chamber experiments to determine the effect
of NH3 toward the aerosol formation of Criegee intermediates formed from ozonolysis
of styrene. Theoretical calculations using CBS-QB3 was performed to support the
obtained experimental results. The results show that the NH3 cause decrease in the SOA
formation. The experimental results are interesting, but the experiment was done in one
NH3 concentration. I think it is important to perform experiments at different

intermediate effect toward the aerosol formation. Theoretical simulation of the reaction
of CH2OO and C6H5CHOO with NH3 is given in the latter part of the paper. However,
for these results to be used in comparison with the chamber results, the authors should
calculate the rates for the Criegee intermediate NH3 reaction. Also, they should provide
a theoretical estimate for the rates of the formation of the secondary ozonide from
CH2OO and C6H5CHOO reaction with an aldehyde. Then they should compare the
aerosol forming rate and NH3 reaction rate to give proof that the Criegee intermediate
NH3 reaction is the reason for the lower aerosol formation. Considering these issues
with the results, I suggest major revision with new experimental and theoretical results.
Author reply: Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion. We agree with the reviewer’s
advice. Several chamber experiments at different concentrations of NH3 have been
added in the revised manuscript. The addition of NH3 caused decrease of the SOA yield,
and this decrease became more significant with the increase of NH3 concentration. Fig.
1 has been changed. And corresponding discussions has been added in the revised
manuscript.
Following the reviewer’s suggestion, the rate constants of the bimolecular
reactions between the Criegee intermediates with aldehydes and with NH3 were
evaluated using the conventional transition state theory (TST) which was carried out in
the TheRate program.1 The rate constants at room temperature (298 K) and atmospheric
pressure by B3LYP/6-311G++(2d,2p) and CBS-QB3 level of theories are depicted in
Table R1. At the CBS-QB3 level of theory, the rate constant for the
C6H5CHOO· reaction with NH3 is four orders of magnitude lower than it with
C6H5CHO. While for the reaction ·CH2OO· + CH3CHO, the absolute rate constant was
estimated (9.4 ± 0.7) <U+2A2F> 10-13 cm3 molecule-1 s-1 at 4 Torr,2 or a low pressure limit of
~1.6 <U+2A2F> 10-29 cm3 molecule-1 s-1 and a high pressure limit of ~1.7 <U+2A2F> 10-12 cm3 molecule-
1
s-1 experimentally.3 It indicates that the theoretical value of CI
(C6H5CHOO· or ·CH2OO·) + aldehyde (C6H5CHO or HCHO) on CBS-QB3 level
maybe one or two order of magnitude less than the true value. Furthermore, our
calculation results of ·CH2OO· + NH3 is at the lower end range of the previous work
by other methods (CCSD(T)/6-31+G(d), CCSD(T)/6-311+G(d,p), G3, etc.).4
<U+0001D463><U+0001D436>6 <U+0001D43B>5 <U+0001D436><U+0001D43B><U+0001D442><U+0001D442>+<U+0001D436>6 <U+0001D43B>5 <U+0001D436><U+0001D43B><U+0001D442>
From the discussion above, the ratio of reaction rate is
<U+0001D463><U+0001D436>6 <U+0001D43B>5 <U+0001D436><U+0001D43B><U+0001D442>+<U+0001D441><U+0001D43B>3
approximately 2 ~ 5 orders of magnitude. If the reaction between C6H5CHOO· with
NH3 dominates compared to that with C6H5CHO, the concentration of NH3 should be
2 to 5 orders of magnitude larger than the concentration of C6H5CHO. In the
experiments with excess NH3 (~3 ppmv), the amount of NH3 added in this work was
far more than aldehydes produced in the reaction. The addition of excess NH3 would
significantly consume the amount of CI, resulting in a marked decrease in the yield of
the final SOA. However, in the experiments with smaller [NH3]0/[styrene]0 ratio (<1),
the SOA yield was still found to be decreased, indicating that the above competitive
reaction mechanism is not the only way of the influence. There may be some other
reaction mechanisms which can also reduce the SOA yield after the addition of NH3,
like the nucleation effect or the organic amine formation. And this needs to be
investigated in the further research.
Electronic supplementary material has been added for the calculation process and
results. All of the above discussions and conclusions have also been amended
accordingly in the manuscript.
