General points
1. The authors discuss "limitations of this study…" (l. 219+). Along similar lines, the ms
would be improved if the authors included some discussion about single myofibrils vs other
muscle preps (permeabilized fibres, intact fibres, muscle): for example the constituents of each
and if their presence or absence might affect behaviour. What I have in mind is the question of
how generally applicable the behaviour reported here is.
2. How uniform is the initial SL? L127-8. What is a "good" striation pattern? What were
the rejection criteria? In what fraction of cases were they met?
3. "..average normal.." passive SL of 3.2 um is rather vague. Since SLNT assumes "initially
slightly longer"…sarcomere length (l. 76), it is important to state what degree of variation there
was to start with. Indeed was any detectable with the methods used?
4. Your isometrics are really "fixed-end" activations. As is clear in Figure 1b that there is SL
change as stress develops in the first few seconds of activation. If the SL were really clamped
during this period, might subsequent behaviour be affected? Or do you think that previous
behaviour is irrelevant?
Specific points
1. Key words. Perhaps add "stretch"
2. l.36. I suggest change to "a widely accepted". "…the most widely accepted" I take to be
the authors opinion. The theory certainly is widely known, but "accepted" is highly debatable!
3. l.40. Similarly, "Despite being widely known, this theory…" seems closer to reality.
4. State somewhere in the abstract that the myofibrils are from rabbit. Since thin filament
length varies within the animal kingdom, this information is relevant to where 2.8 microns is on
the descending limb.
5. State what the +/- values are; SD, SEM?
6. l.47-49. 0.9+/-0.5 significantly larger than 0.7+/-0.4? This seems wrong. Is the
"significantly larger" description referring to pair-wise differences.
7. l.54-55. "..RFE following active stretching of single myofibrils" would seem a more
accurate description.
8. l.141. How was CSA measured?
9. l.145. How is "constant" defined here?
10. Relevant generally and also to the points raised in l.200-211. Are the SL changes
repeatable when the protocol is repeated on the same myofibril segment?

l. 45: length on the plateau of the force-length relationship. 'c' is missing
In the methods section, it would be useful to explain why the protocol involves a shortening
phase.
Figure 1b: The averaged SL signal seems to show that SL is greater after the re-stretch than
during the initial isometric phase. The data in the table does indeed indicate SL to be 0.1 um
greater in FE than in I state. What is the force difference in the I state between SL of 2.8 and 2.9
4
um? Could the difference partly account for RFE? Is there a correlation between RFE and the
change in sarcomere length between the I and FE phases?
In Fig. 2a, it would be useful to use asterisks above the histogram of the myofibrils for which a
significant difference between I and FE status is seen.
Nine out of twelve myofibrils demonstrated popped sarcomeres in the FE-state. Is this
meaningful? Is the sample size sufficient?
There is a large variation in the number of sarcomeres for each myofibril. Is the number of
sarcomeres related to the probability of popping?
The paper (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 104(50):20114-9. Skeletal muscle resists stretch by
rapid binding of the second motor domain of myosin to actin. Brunello et al.) may offer an
alternative explanation for RFE, namely the binding of the second myosin head to actin induced
by stretch. This explanation is further developed in skeletal muscle in (Biophys J. 2011
;101(10):2445-54. Millisecond-scale biochemical response to change in strain. Bickham et al.) and
in cardiac muscle in (J Biol Chem. 2012 ;287(31):25696-705. Stretch of contracting cardiac muscle
abruptly decreases the rate of phosphate release at high and low calcium. Mansfield et al.).
Would it be helpful to suggest a possible alternative explanation for RFE?

Comments to the Author:
The paper has been reviewed by three experts, who all agree that the paper is scientifically sound
overall and has potential to make a valuable contribution to the field, contributing to the growing
body of evidence that sarcomere length non-uniformities cannot fully explain residual force
enhancement. However, the reviewers raise a number of concerns that require revision. I would
be happy to see a revised version of the manuscript that addresses these points, along with a
corresponding point-by-point response to the referees. In particular, please ensure that the
revised version fully addresses the concerns about statistical analysis of the results.

YAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE REVIEW
e: The Role of Sarcomere Length Non-uniformities in Residual Force Enhancement of Skeletal
scle Myofibrils
nuscript ID: RSOS-150657
hors: Johnston, Kaleen; Jinha, Azim; Herzog, Walter
iewer: Jenna Monroy, Department of Biological Sciences, Denison University
s is an interesting and useful paper that investigates the mechanisms underlying residual force
ancement of active muscle force following stretch. Despite decades of research, the cellular
hanism underlying residual force enhancement is not well understood. This is a controversial topic
deserves careful examination and tests of current theories. The goal of the paper was to directly test
cific predictions of the sarcomere length non-uniformities theory (SLNT).
lieve this paper has the potential to contribute to the growing body of evidence that the sarcomere
th non-uniformities theory cannot fully explain residual force enhancement. However, I have some
cerns about the analysis of the data.
re are three predictions of the SLNT that the authors can address with their data:
1. There is an increase in the variability of sarcomere length following active stretch (i.e. more
sarcomere length non-uniformity)
2. There is an increase in # popped sarcomeres (SL>4.0 µm) with active stretch
3. Short, strong sarcomeres lengthen less than long, weak sarcomeres during active stretch
ink it is important that the authors compare changes in actual sarcomere length in addition to average
omere length as it directly tests the prediction that short, strong sarcomeres will lengthen less than
g, weak sarcomeres. In addition, the authors should have systematically varied the magnitude of RFE
ssess whether there is a significant correlation between the standard deviation of sarcomere length and
magnitude of RFE. I do not think the authors can draw any conclusions about this relationship from
r data. Also, a statistical test (e.g. Fisher’s Exact test) is needed to determine whether there is a greater
portion of popped sarcomeres following active stretch.
paper should be written more clearly such that each prediction is addressed in the introduction, the
lts, and again in the discussion.
cific comments:
tract
es 38 – 40: The following sentence needs further explanation. “ The SLNT predicts that active
tching of a muscle causes sarcomere lengths to become non-uniform, with some sarcomeres
tched beyond actin-myosin filament overlap (“popping”), causing RFE.”
“popping” is predicted to occur during stretch but is not the cause of RFE. An additional sentence is
ded to explain the SLNT.
es 44 – 46: The average stretched length reported in the abstract (2.8 and 2.9 µm) does not match the
es reported in the methods (3.2 µm). Based on figure 1, it looks like the correct stretched length is 2.8
2.9 µm.
e 45: Change fore-length to force-length
e 47: “…varying amounts of non-uniformity (0.9 ± 0.5 µm)”- Is the 0.9 µm referring to the SD? Make
clear.
roduction
stated above, I think the authors can test three predictions of the SLNT. Each of these predictions
uld be addressed explicitly in the introduction.
thods
es 144 – 146: Definition of I-state and FE-state –Were the measurements taken at the same time point
all myofibrils? What was this time for the I-state and FE-state?
tistics
ink the Wilcoxon signed rank test is appropriate for comparing SL and SD in the I and FE states.
wever, one thing that is not clear in the methods is whether the authors compared the actual SL for
h sarcomere or the average SL for each myofibril between the two states. The analysis appears to be
ormed on the averages. While I think this analysis can answer the question of whether stretched
ofibrils show more SL non-uniformity, their data can test the SLNT more directly. Why not compare
SL for each sarcomere before and after stretch to assess whether short, strong sarcomeres
gthen less than long, weak sarcomeres?
ink the Spearman R correlation between the increase in SD and the amount of RFE does not
quately represent how sarcomere length changes with the magnitude of RFE. The authors controlled
amount of stretch and did not vary the stretch magnitude across a wide range of lengths.
mentioned above, a Fisher’s Exact or Chi Square test is needed to test the hypothesis that there are
e popped sarcomeres following active stretch.
ults
ould be helpful to organize the results such that one paragraph addresses each prediction.
cussion
ould be helpful to reorganize the discussion to first, restate the specific predictions that are tested in
paper and summarize the main findings addressing each prediction. Then, the authors can address
knesses associated with their study and finally address alternative hypotheses.

Title: The Role of Sarcomere Length Non-Uniformities in Residual Force Enhancement of
Skeletal Muscle Myofibrils

Data Accessibility Statement
In accordance with journal standards, a data accessibility statement was added to the manuscript
prior to the reference list.
We would like to thank the reviewers for a thorough and constructive review of our
manuscript. In the following we have addressed all comments by the reviewers on a point-
by-point basis. For ease of review, we repeat the reviewers’s comments below (bold font),
followed by our responses (regular font) and the corresponding changes to the manuscript,
if indicated (italics).
REVIEWER 1
General points
1. The authors discuss "limitations of this study…" (l. 219+). Along similar lines, the ms
would be improved if the authors included some discussion about single myofibrils vs other
muscle preps (permeabilized fibres, intact fibres, muscle): for example the constituents of
each and if their presence or absence might affect behaviour. What I have in mind is the
question of how generally applicable the behaviour reported here is.
We agree that another limitation of the study is that we used isolated myofibrils, which might
produce different results than what is seen in a muscle fibre or an entire muscle in vivo. This
limitation is now included and is addressed by referencing Llewellyn et al. (2008), who found
that sarcomere length variations in vivo were similar to the amount of variation seen in our
results. This comparison lends at least some credibility to the notion that sarcomere length non-
uniformities, which are the primary outcome measure of this study, are similar in isolated
myofibrils and intact in vivo human and animal skeletal muscles.
2. How uniform is the initial SL? L127-8. What is a "good" striation pattern? What
were the rejection criteria? In what fraction of cases were they met?
3. "..average normal.." passive SL of 3.2 um is rather vague. Since SLNT assumes
"initially slightly longer"…sarcomere length (l. 76), it is important to state what degree of
variation there was to start with. Indeed was any detectable with the methods used?
Good striation pattern of a myofibril was defined as visible I-bands, A-bands, and Z-lines.
Following myofibril isolation, most (~90%) of the myofibrils met this criterion. Beyond this,
myofibril length (total number of sarcomeres) was a consideration, as the system has a limited
stretching ability, which corresponds to 25 sarcomeres for this protocol. This criterion was met
by approximately 10% of myofibrils. Finally, the myofibril’s position on the glass coverslip
affected the ability of the needle to successfully pick it up. A horizontally positioned myofibril is
ideal and this occurred in approximately 5% of myofibrils that met previous criteria.
“Average nominal sarcomere length” is used because the length of the myofibril is controlled
through automatic manipulation of the needle that is attached to one end of the myofibril. The
position of the needle is in reference to the starting position of the cantilever that is attached to the
other end of the myofibril. As the movement of the attached cantilever is used to quantify the
force produced by the myofibril, movement is expected, and therefore alters the actual length of
the myofibril (and individual sarcomeres) in a linear manner with force. Prior to activation the
initial average sarcomere length (± 1 standard deviation) was 3.1 ± 0.2 µm, with an average
standard deviation of 0.1 µm, indicating that there was a relatively small amount of initial
variation in sarcomere length.
4. Your isometrics are really "fixed-end" activations. As is clear in Figure 1b that there
is SL change as stress develops in the first few seconds of activation. If the SL were really
clamped during this period, might subsequent behaviour be affected? Or do you think that
previous behaviour is irrelevant?
As mentioned in the previous comment, the manner in which the force measurements are
quantified (movement of the cantilever) results in small length changes in the myofibril upon
activation and force production that cannot be directly controlled for. Therefore, there is a small
amount of shortening of the entire myofibril when activation occurs and force increases. For this
reason, we define the isometric contractions as the periods when the total myofibril length is
constant and force has reached a steady-state value following activation (isometric) and stretching
(force-enhanced). We believe that perfect clamping of the myofibril during these periods would
not affect the results of the steady-state comparisons, but for lack of experimental data, this is a
speculation.
Specific points
1. Key words. Perhaps add "stretch"
We have added “active stretch” as a keyword for this manuscript, as suggested.
2. l.36. I suggest change to "a widely accepted". "…the most widely accepted" I take to
be the authors opinion. The theory certainly is widely known, but "accepted" is highly
debatable!
Changed, as suggested.
3. l.40. Similarly, "Despite being widely known, this theory…" seems closer to reality.
Changed, as suggested.
4. State somewhere in the abstract that the myofibrils are from rabbit. Since thin
filament length varies within the animal kingdom, this information is relevant to where 2.8
microns is on the descending limb.
Added on l. 41.
5. State what the +/- values are; SD, SEM?
The ± values are 1 SD. We have added this in the abstract (l. 44) and in the results (l. 213).
6. l.47-49. 0.9+/-0.5 significantly larger than 0.7+/-0.4? This seems wrong. Is the
"significantly larger" description referring to pair-wise differences.
This is referring to pairwise differences, which was explained in the methods section of the main
text. We have changed this sentence in the abstract to be more indicative of these findings.
7. l.54-55. "..RFE following active stretching of single myofibrils" would seem a more
accurate description.
We have changed the last sentence in the abstract.
8. l.141. How was CSA measured?
The diameter of each myofibril was measured and CSA was calculated as pr2. We have made this
more clear on l. 166.
9. l.145. How is "constant" defined here?
Constant was determined visually from the force-time graph as the point when the force reached a
plateau following activation (isometric) or stretch (force-enhanced). We have clarified this in the
manuscript (l. 175-176).
10. Relevant generally and also to the points raised in l.200-211. Are the SL changes
repeatable when the protocol is repeated on the same myofibril segment?
It is extremely difficult to repeat experiments in single myofibrils without substantial loss of
force. Therefore, we did not repeat contractions in our experiments as we would not trust the
results. In a recent paper, Cornachione et al. (Am J Physiol Cell Physiol. 310: C19-C26, 2016.
The increase in non-cross-bridge forces after stretch of activated striated muscle is related to titin
isoforms.) tried to make measurements for repeat contractions with isolated myofibrils with
disastrous and internally inconsistent results, likely because of great losses in force from one
contraction to the next.
REVIEWER 2
This is an interesting and useful paper that investigates the mechanisms underlying residual
force enhancement of active muscle force following stretch. Despite decades of research, the
cellular mechanism underlying residual force enhancement is not well understood. This is a
controversial topic that deserves careful examination and tests of current theories. The goal
of the paper was to directly test specific predictions of the sarcomere length non-
uniformities theory (SLNT).
I believe this paper has the potential to contribute to the growing body of evidence that the
sarcomere length non-uniformities theory cannot fully explain residual force enhancement.
However, I have some concerns about the analysis of the data.
There are three predictions of the SLNT that the authors can address with their data:
1. There is an increase in the variability of sarcomere length following active stretch (i.e.
more sarcomere length non-uniformity)
2. There is an increase in # popped sarcomeres (SL>4.0 µm) with active stretch
3. Short, strong sarcomeres lengthen less than long, weak sarcomeres during active stretch
I think it is important that the authors compare changes in actual sarcomere length in
addition to average sarcomere length as it directly tests the prediction that short, strong
sarcomeres will lengthen less than long, weak sarcomeres. In addition, the authors should
have systematically varied the magnitude of RFE to assess whether there is a significant
correlation between the standard deviation of sarcomere length and the magnitude of RFE.
I do not think the authors can draw any conclusions about this relationship from their data.
Regarding point 1, there is indeed an increase in the variability of sarcomere length following
active stretch compared to the corresponding isometric reference contraction. The average SD of
sarcomere length and the corresponding SD of the average SD was 0.9±0.5µm after active
stretching and 0.7±0.4µm following purely isometric contractions. Although these values appear
to be similar, since reference and experimental variations in sarcomere length were obtained from
the same myofibrils, a repeated measures test could be used that showed that indeed they were
statistically significantly different. This had been discussed in the original version of the
manuscript.
Regarding point 2, we performed statistical analysis to test if there was a significant increase in
the number of popped sarcomeres following active stretching compared to the isometric reference
contraction and found that there was no difference between the two scenarios. We now mention
this result in the results section of the revised manuscript.
Finally regarding point 3, we made a scatter plot of all sarcomeres initial length and the amount
they were stretched during the active lengthening protocol. We found that there was a weak, but
significant correlation between these variables. We have now included this test and observation as
a separate prediction of the SLNT in the manuscript.
Regarding the suggestion to perform tests that would provide systematically different amounts of
RFE, this is a good idea but was not done. However, by pure chance, the RFE measured in these
experiments differed over a wide range, and there was no relationship between sarcomere length
non-uniformity in the force enhanced state and the amount of RFE. This had been discussed in
the original manuscript.
Also, a statistical test (e.g. Fisher’s Exact test) is needed to determine whether there is a
greater proportion of popped sarcomeres following active stretch.
The SLNT predicts that active stretching will cause some sarcomeres to pop, which will result in
RFE. We were surprised to see that some sarcomeres had already popped in the isometric state,
which is why we reported this result in the paper. The SLNT does not make reference to
comparing the proportion of popped sarcomeres between states, which is why we did not run a
statistical test to determine the significance of this. We feel that the most important observation
in regard to popping sarcomeres was that RFE occurred in three myofibrils without any popped
sarcomeres, which opposes the main idea of the SLNT.
The paper should be written more clearly such that each prediction is addressed in the
introduction, the results, and again in the discussion.
In the revised manuscript, we now make sure that each prediction is introduced in the
introduction section and then addressed in the methods, results, and discussion sections.
Specific comments:
Abstract
Lines 38 – 40: The following sentence needs further explanation. “ The SLNT predicts that
active stretching of a muscle causes sarcomere lengths to become non-uniform, with some
sarcomeres stretched beyond actin-myosin filament overlap (“popping”), causing RFE.”
The “popping” is predicted to occur during stretch but is not the cause of RFE. An
additional sentence is needed to explain the SLNT.
We do not quite agree. The popping is indeed part of the explanation of the SLNT. The idea is
that the length change of a muscle or fibre is mostly taken up by some sarcomeres that pop,
thereby allowing other sarcomeres to not elongate at all or much less than they otherwise would.
This places these sarcomeres (the ones that did not pop) at a shorter length on the force-length
relationship than they otherwise would be, therefore endowing them with more force.
Unfortunately, we cannot make this explanation in the abstract, as suggested by the referee, as we
are at the limits of the allowed character count. However, this is fully explained in the
introduction section of the revised manuscript.
Lines 44 – 46: The average stretched length reported in the abstract (2.8 and 2.9 µm) does
not match the values reported in the methods (3.2 µm). Based on figure 1, it looks like the
correct stretched length is 2.8 and 2.9 µm.
The methods section described the protocol that was carried out by the automated movement of
the needle. Due to the compliance of the cantilever, the actual length change of each myofibril
varied, which is why the actual average sarcomere lengths are less. We determined that a
nominal average sarcomere length of 3.2 µm was an adequate length to ensure that the average
sarcomere length would fall on the descending limb of the force-length relationship, which was
the goal. However, we agree that the discrepancy in values may cause confusion, so we have
adjusted the manuscript to include the actual mean lengths.
Line 45: Change fore-length to force-length
Changed.
Line 47: “…varying amounts of non-uniformity (0.9 ± 0.5 µm)”- Is the 0.9 µm referring to
the SD? Make this clear.
Yes, the 0.9µm is the SD. We have clarified this now in the abstract.
Introduction
As stated above, I think the authors can test three predictions of the SLNT. Each of these
predictions should be addressed explicitly in the introduction.
The goal of the introduction was to provide a background of RFE in specific regard to the SLNT
and what this theory suggests and predicts. In order to do this, we felt an appropriate approach
was to describe RFE (l. 61-73), discuss and explain the mechanism proposed by the SLNT (l. 74-
95), highlight the four predictions of the SLNT that we felt we could test experimentally (l. 96-
108), and then describe the purpose of our study (l. 115-128). By doing this, we hoped to guide
the reader through the paper in a manner that facilitated a fluid understanding of the previous
literature and how it guided our work, without breaking up the information too much. As
suggested by the reviewer, we have added the fourth prediction and have reorganized the
manuscript to address each prediction explicitly in each subsequent section.
Methods
Lines 144 – 146: Definition of I-state and FE-state –Were the measurements taken at the
same time point for all myofibrils? What was this time for the I-state and FE-state?
Each steady state was defined as the time point the myofibril stress and total length reached a
plateau following activation (I-state) and stretch (FE-state). This was not necessarily at the same
absolute time as length changes were accomplished at a constant speed, thus a myofibril with
more sarcomeres than another one would be stretched for a longer absolute time, which resulted
in variations in the total time (73.7 – 83.0 seconds for the entire protocol). Since isolated
myofibrils do not show fatigue with prolonged activation, the exact timing of when measurements
at steady-state are made is less important than it would be in a single intact fibre or a muscle,
where a steady-state can only be held for a very short time before fatigue starts to affect the
forces. All of the myofibrils reached full activation within 5.6 seconds (mean ± 1 SD = 2.5 ± 2.0
seconds) of the beginning of the calcium solution influx.
Statistics
I think the Wilcoxon signed rank test is appropriate for comparing SL and SD in the I and
FE states. However, one thing that is not clear in the methods is whether the authors
compared the actual SL for each sarcomere or the average SL for each myofibril between
the two states. The analysis appears to be performed on the averages. While I think this
analysis can answer the question of whether stretched myofibrils show more SL non-
uniformity, their data can test the SLNT more directly. Why not compare the SL for each
sarcomere before and after stretch to assess whether short, strong sarcomeres lengthen less
than long, weak sarcomeres?
The comparisons made for this paper are based on the averages for each myofibril. Since we
defined non-uniformity as the standard deviation of the mean sarcomere length for each myofibril
in each state (as has been done previously), we needed to use average values. The issue with
comparing each individual sarcomere in the manner suggested has now been included in the
manuscript as a separate prediction and the results are discussed accordingly. We now plotted the
change in sarcomere length between the I- and FE-states vs. the initial sarcomere length (new
figure 3). We approximated the data using a linear regression analysis and found that there was a
weak, but significant relationship between these variables (r = 0.216; p = 0.011).
I think the Spearman R correlation between the increase in SD and the amount of RFE does
not adequately represent how sarcomere length changes with the magnitude of RFE. The
authors controlled the amount of stretch and did not vary the stretch magnitude across a
wide range of lengths.
We agree with the reviewer that we did not systematically change the amount of stretch in these
experiments, and therefore do not have a “magnitude of stretch” induced change in RFE.
However, for similar amounts of stretch we found great differences of RFE (range from 22 % to
78 %) and also found a great variation in sarcomere length non-uniformity after active stretching.
Based on the SLNT one would expect that greater sarcomere length non-uniformity would be
associated with more RFE, however our results did not confirm that expectation. This finding led
us to the conclusion that the final sarcomere length non-uniformities following active stretching
were not related to RFE for one stretch magnitude. Obviously, had we performed more
experiments with different magnitudes, we might have found that greater stretch magnitudes were
associated with greater RFE and also with greater sarcomere length non-uniformities. However,
for lack of experimental data, we cannot comment on such a scenario.
As mentioned above, a Fisher’s Exact or Chi Square test is needed to test the hypothesis
that there are more popped sarcomeres following active stretch.
We ran a Fisher’s exact test on the data and found that there was no significant difference in the
number of popped sarcomeres between the two states. This result is now included and discussed
in the manuscript.
Results
It would be helpful to organize the results such that one paragraph addresses each
prediction.
We have rearranged the results section, as suggested.
Discussion
It would be helpful to reorganize the discussion to first, restate the specific predictions that
are tested in this paper and summarize the main findings addressing each prediction. Then,
the authors can address weaknesses associated with their study and finally address
alternative hypotheses.
We have made these changes to the manuscript.
REVIEWER 3
l. 45: length on the plateau of the force-length relationship. 'c' is missing
Changed
In the methods section, it would be useful to explain why the protocol involves a shortening
phase.
We have added a sentence at the end of the experimental protocol section in the methods section
to explain this.
Figure 1b: The averaged SL signal seems to show that SL is greater after the re-stretch than
during the initial isometric phase. The data in the table does indeed indicate SL to be 0.1 um
greater in FE than in I state. What is the force difference in the I state between SL of 2.8
and 2.9 um? Could the difference partly account for RFE? Is there a correlation between
RFE and the change in sarcomere length between the I and FE phases?
Rabbit psoas myofibrils have myosin length of approximately 1.6µm and actin length of
approximately 1.1µm. Therefore, sarcomere lengths of 2.8 and 2.9µm are on the descending limb
of the force length relationship, and the force at 2.9µm would be expected (based on myofilament
overlap) to be about 7% smaller than at 2.8µm. Therefore, our force enhancement values are
likely a small underestimate of the true force enhancement values.
There is no relationship between the change in sarcomere length and the amount of force
enhancement.
In Fig. 2a, it would be useful to use asterisks above the histogram of the myofibrils for
which a significant difference between I and FE status is seen.
Differences between the I- and FE-states were compared using Wilcoxon signed ranks test on the
average sarcomere length non-uniformity in each state for the myofibrils; therefore, only a single
value of sarcomere length non-uniformity is available per myofibril and thus no comparative
statistics within a myofibril can be run.
Nine out of twelve myofibrils demonstrated popped sarcomeres in the FE-state. Is this
meaningful? Is the sample size sufficient?
We think that this information is meaningful within the entire context. The entire context is that
nine out of twelve myofibrils had popped sarcomeres in the FE state, 7/12 myofibrils had popped
sarcomeres in the I-state, and 3/12 myofibrils had force enhancement but no popped sarcomeres.
According to the SLNT, some long/weak sarcomeres have to pop for force enhancement to occur,
as the SLNT requires that the majority of sarcomeres do not elongate much, but that most
elongation is taken up by few weak sarcomeres that get stretched to such long lengths that their
passive force can match the active forces of the “short” sarcomeres. If there is no popped
sarcomeres, then there cannot be force equilibrium between the long and short sarcomeres and
force enhancement cannot occur.
Therefore, the results of the popped sarcomeres is important because (i) some myofibrils showed
great force enhancement in the absence of popped sarcomeres, (ii) some myofibrils had popped
sarcomeres in the I-state but that did not produce force enhancement, and (iii) some myofibrils
had sarcomeres in the I- and FE-state and there still was force enhancement. All these
observations are inherently not consistent with the underpinnings of the SLNT, where I-state
myofibrils should have uniform sarcomeres that are not popped and that popped sarcomeres are
required for force enhancement in single myofibrils.
There is a large variation in the number of sarcomeres for each myofibril. Is the number of
sarcomeres related to the probability of popping?
We ran a Spearman R correlation between the number of sarcomeres in a myofibril and the
proportion of sarcomeres that were popped in the FE-state and found that there was no significant
relationship between these two variables (r = -0.160, p = 0.620).
The paper (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 104(50):20114-9. Skeletal muscle resists stretch
by rapid binding of the second motor domain of myosin to actin. Brunello et al.) may offer
an alternative explanation for RFE, namely the binding of the second myosin head to actin
induced by stretch. This explanation is further developed in skeletal muscle in (Biophys J.
2011 ;101(10):2445-54. Millisecond-scale biochemical response to change in strain. Bickham
et al.) and in cardiac muscle in (J Biol Chem. 2012 ;287(31):25696-705. Stretch of
contracting cardiac muscle abruptly decreases the rate of phosphate release at high and low
calcium. Mansfield et al.). Would it be helpful to suggest a possible alternative explanation
for RFE?
I think we have to be very careful here. The study by Brunello et al (2007) does not deal with
residual force enhancement but deals with the enhancement of force during stretch, and the
proposed rapid attachment of the second head of the cross-bridge caused by strain in the first
(attached) cross-bridge head when a fibre is stretched (not at steady state seconds after the stretch.
So the two situations are different. Similarly, in the Bickham et al. (2012) paper, they studied the
increase in force and decrease in phosphate release during stretch, not at steady-state after a
stretch. In both these papers, they investigated molecular mechanisms that happen within ms of
stretch application while residual force enhancement is typically evaluated 3-5 seconds after any
active stretching has ceased. Alternative mechanisms have been proposed by the dozens in the
past ten years, but these studies do not seem to point at an alternative mechanism, as no
measurements were made after stretching had ceased. Despite these alternative mechanisms, the
SLNT has prevailed as the predominant theory, and all we are saying here is that there is further
evidence that likely the SLNT is not the primary factor for residual force enhancement. Proposing
other mechanisms, when this study was designed to test predictions for the SLNT, seems to go
beyond what we can say based on our data.
