Comments to the Author(s)
label_comment_2
The authors present a theoretical analysis of the energy accumulation and dissipation of coal
pillar in gob-side entry. The numerical simulation and case study are conducted to verify the
rationality of the research method. I have a few major comments as follows:
1. In section 2.2, the author used two mathematical models, named "Weibull distribution law"
and "damage theory of micro-statistics". What is the basis for this ? A theoretical model
established needs to be based on a large number of experiments. The authors need to justify that
these two models can truly describe the strain softening characteristics of coal samples.
Otherwise, the results derived from such a non-consistent model are thus questionable.
2. What is "quasi-static deformation". Please explain it in detail.
3. How to determine the position of the points j and s in the coal pillar instability stage (Figure 3)?
4. The authors need to justify the reasonability of the fold catastrophe model compared to other
previous studies.
5. In line 35 of P11, what is the criterion for judging the coal seam's burst tendency?
6. Page 13. Correct: Figures 11 and 12.
7. In the numerical modeling, I didn't see any results about crack propagation. How does the
author come to this conclusion that “Many cracks in coal seam are development, ……”? (Please
3
see Wu et al., 2019. Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering)
8. In figure 14, the energy density at the two ends of goaf reach to 1.96×1016 J. This value is so
large. Is it reasonable? Please further analyze and discuss.
9. I didn't see the roadway driving along the goaf in the numerical model. Therefore, how does
the author compare the theoretical results with the observation result (Line 14 to 16 of P15)? It is
questionable.
10. The topic of paper is energy characteristics of coal pillar in gob-side entry. But, in the section
of numerical simulation, the authors focuses on the analysis the stress evolution of coal seam
mining rather than roadway driving along goaf. The numerical results need to be more closely
related to the topic of the article.

Appendix A
This manuscript presents an investigation on the mechanism of rockbursts in the context of
gob-side entry roadway driving, which is of great interest to coal mining engineers. It is an
important topic of rock mechanics and rock engineering and very interesting for the readers of
the journal. This article is very innovative and worth publishing. However, a concern with the
manuscript is the explanation of results. The numerical analysis of the results should be further
described.
Therefore, I recommend publication of this manuscript after the minor revision. Specific
comments and suggestions for the improvement of the manuscript are noted below.
1. Roadway driving along adjacent goafs is an effective method to develop the recovery rate of
coal resources. The wide of coal pillar is important, the authors do not discuss. This part should
be replenished in the revised version.
2. We usually describe the dispersion of rock materials by Weibull distribution, normal
distribution or other distribution. In section 2.2, is it valid to use Weibull distribution to describe
the F-u relationship of coal? The author should elaborate on this part.
3. In section 4.1, what are those parameters for?
4. In section 4.2, rock burst index is a very effective index to predict rock burst tendency. How are
the dynamic damage time, elastic energy index and impact energy index defined and measured?
5. In section 4.4, the variation of stress abutment distance ahead of the working face (from 10 m
at 50 m advance to 40 m at 100 m advance) should not be expected, in that the model which is
homogeneous should yield similar volumes of failure zones around the working face.
6. The theory proposed is reasonable and innovative. Therefore, I recommend the use of
theoretical models in numerical models and the authors can strengthen of the connection with
the theoretical part.
7. Coal and gas outburst and rock burst are the most serious dynamic disasters in coal mining. In
shallow mining, most of the dynamic disasters are single coal and gas outburst or rock burst, and
the interaction and interaction are not significant. With the increase of mining depth, the
interaction between the two kinds of disasters began to appear, resulting in coal and gas outburst,
rock burst and two kinds of disasters coexisting and compounding each other. Both of them are
unstable sudden dynamic disasters, and their triggering mechanism can be explained by energy
theory. Whether the author tries to combine them?
8. In the process of mining, the effects of soft coal and hard coal seem to be very different, and
their risk of rock burst is different. For the model of Fig. 2a, does the author consider the
influence of strength on rock burst of coal body?
9. The mining stress path is a process in which the vertical stress increases and the horizontal
stress decreases during the mining process, which is inconsistent with the conventional stress
loading path. Therefore, can Figure 3 reflect the effect of mining process on rock stress and strain?
I suggest that the author explain this matter more clearly in order to provide better guidance and
help for mining.

Summary of amendments
Re: “Destabilitation and energy characteristics of coal pillar in roadway driving
along gob based on rockburst risk assessment”
For Royal Society Open Science
Manuscript ID: RSOS-190094
Many thanks for reviewers and editor’s constructive comments. These comments and
suggestions have been carefully incorporated into the revised manuscript. The
point-to-point replies for the comments are summarized as below:
Reviewer #1:
This manuscript presents an investigation on the mechanism of rockbursts in the
context of gob-side entry roadway driving, which is of great interest to coal mining
engineers. It is an important topic of rock mechanics and rock engineering and very
interesting for the readers of the journal. This article is very innovative and worth
publishing. However, a concern with the manuscript is the explanation of results. The
numerical analysis of the results should be further described.
Therefore, I recommend publication of this manuscript after the minor revision.
Specific comments and suggestions for the improvement of the manuscript are noted
below.
(1) Roadway driving along adjacent goafs is an effective method to develop the
recovery rate of coal resources. The wide of coal pillar is important, the authors do
not discuss. This part should be replenished in the revised version.
A: Thank you for this suggestion. Reasonable width design of coal pillar is the key for
ensuring stability of surrounding rock in the roadway driving along adjacent stable
gob. According to the geological and mining conditions, the width optimization of
coal pillar in gob-side entry is obtained on the basis of the abutment pressure
distribution characteristics and the ultimate balanced theory in theoretical analysis. At
present, the typical dimensions for narrow pillar width in various situations (such as in
different mining depths, mining thickness, roadway widths, mining methods, strata
spatial structures etc.) have not been summarized comprehensively in published
literature. This issue is the next research topic for the authors. The related research
results have been achieved by Bai et al. (2004) as follow: through the numerical
calculation and analysis, the relationship among the stability of narrow coal pillar, the
mechanical property of coal seam and the pillar width is studied. According to various
conditions of the coal seams, the rational width of the corresponding narrow coal
pillar is determined; the rational width is 4~5 m in soft coal seam, and the rational
width is 3~4 m in medium-hard coal seam. This manuscript was revised with
reference to this suggestion.

narrow coal pillar of roadway driving along goaf. Chinese Journal of Rock Mechanics
and Engineering 23(20): 3475-3479.
2. We usually describe the dispersion of rock materials by Weibull distribution,
normal distribution or other distribution. In section 2.2, is it valid to use Weibull
distribution to describe the F-u relationship of coal? The author should elaborate on
this part.
A: Thank you for this suggestion.
The dispersion of rock materials has an important influence on the results of research
question, and many distribution types (such as Weibull distribution, normal
distribution or other distribution) could be employed to clarify this characteristic of
rock materials. Many experiments (such as Karcinovic D. (1982); Pan, Y. (2004) et al.)
have been done to clarify that "Weibull distribution law" and "damage theory of
micro-statistics" are suitable for the dispersion and strain softening characteristics of
of rock materials. On this basis, it is valid to use "Weibull distribution law" and
"damage theory of micro-statistics" to describe the F-u relationship of coal, and the
load–displacement relationship of coal mass could be expressed as
<U+F0E9> <U+F0E6> u <U+F0F6>m <U+F0F9>
F <U+F028> u <U+F029> <U+F03D> <U+F06C> u exp <U+F0EA> <U+F02D> <U+F0E7> <U+F0F7> <U+F0FA> , (1)
<U+F0EA><U+F0EB> <U+F0E8> uc <U+F0F8> <U+F0FA><U+F0FB>
where <U+F06C> represents the initial stiffness factor, uc represents the maximum
displacement, and m represents the kin exponent.

3. In section 4.1, what are those parameters for?
A: Thank you for this suggestion. Those parameters in section 4.1 are prepared for the
next numerical simulation in section 4.2 and theoretical calculation in section 4.6, for
example, the intensity of this rock burst, in which the energy released is
6.4512 <U+F0B4> 107 J , is calculated by those parameters in section 4.1.
4. In section 4.2, rock burst index is a very effective index to predict rock burst
tendency. How are the dynamic damage time, elastic energy index and impact energy
index defined and measured?
A: Thank you for this suggestion. The burst tendency is an inherent property of coal,
and there are four indices of burst tendency (dynamic damage time, uniaxial
compressive strength, elastic energy index and impact energy index), which can be
obtained in the complete stress–strain curve in mechanical test of bursting tendency of
coal samples, with reference to the “classification and laboratory test method on
bursting liability of coal (GB/T 25217.2-2010)”. To be more specific, the dynamic
damage time is the duration of the rapid drop in post-peak stress, and elastic energy
index is the ratio of elastic deformation energy and dissipation deformation energy
(the area of the hysteresis loop formed by the loading and unloading curve while the
coal samples load from 75% to 85% of the peak strength to completely unload), and
impact energy index is the ratio of the pre-peak stress accumulated deformation
energy and the post-peak dissipated energy.
5. In section 4.4, the variation of stress abutment distance ahead of the working face
(from 10 m at 50 m advance to 40 m at 100 m advance) should not be expected, in
that the model which is homogeneous should yield similar volumes of failure zones
around the working face.
A: Thank you for this suggestion. This manuscript was revised with reference to this
suggestion.
6. The theory proposed is reasonable and innovative. Therefore, I recommend the use
of theoretical models in numerical models and the authors can strengthen of the
connection with the theoretical part.
A: Thank you for this suggestion. In mining practice, the width of coal pillar in
gob-side entry is approximately 4 m to 10 m, and the length of working face is
approximately 200 m to 250 m; thus, confined to size discrepancy, the stress evolution
of coal seam mining is researched carefully by numerical simulation in this paper.
Besides, the better understanding of stress and energy evolution of coal seam mining
is beneficial for researching energy characteristics of coal pillar in gob-side entry. The
more closely research related to the topic of the article would be done in follow-on
work. This manuscript was revised with reference to this suggestion.
7. Coal and gas outburst and rock burst are the most serious dynamic disasters in coal
mining. In shallow mining, most of the dynamic disasters are single coal and gas
outburst or rock burst, and the interaction and interaction are not significant. With the
increase of mining depth, the interaction between the two kinds of disasters began to
appear, resulting in coal and gas outburst, rock burst and two kinds of disasters
coexisting and compounding each other. Both of them are unstable sudden dynamic
disasters, and their triggering mechanism can be explained by energy theory. Whether
the author tries to combine them?
A: Thank you for this suggestion. The mining practice indicates that interaction
between two kinds of disasters (coal and gas outburst, rock burst) begins to appear in
deep mining, and both of them are unstable sudden dynamic disasters. Two kinds of
disasters (coal and gas outburst, rock burst) in coal mines represent the dynamic
disaster of surrounding rocks in working face or during roadway excavation, and they
are caused by the abrupt release of elastic strain energy in coal mass. Therefore, the
energy theory could be adopted to reveal their triggering mechanism, which is
meaningful and complex. In coal mining process, the excavation causes stress field
redistribution in the original rock mass, and this phenomenon leads to stress
concentration and elastic strain energy accumulation. It is obvious that the strength of
a rockburst is proportional to the differential value of accumulated energy and
dissipated energy in a coal mass. The total accumulated energy in the coal mass and
the position of accumulated energy are vital to rockburst behavior. This research work
would be carried out in follow-up work. This manuscript was revised with reference
to this suggestion.

compound disaster in deep mine. Journal of China Coal Society 43(11): 3042-3050.
8. In the process of mining, the effects of soft coal and hard coal seem to be very
different, and their risk of rock burst is different. For the model of Fig. 2a, does the
author consider the influence of strength on rock burst of coal body?
A: Thank you for this suggestion. In Fig. 2a, the difference between soft coal and hard
coal is the curve slope of F-u relationship of coal in Fig. 2b, and the influence of
strength on rock burst of coal body has been considered in the manuscript. This
manuscript was revised with reference to this suggestion.

9. The mining stress path is a process in which the vertical stress increases and the
horizontal stress decreases during the mining process, which is inconsistent with the
conventional stress loading path. Therefore, can Figure 3 reflect the effect of mining
process on rock stress and strain? I suggest that the author explain this matter more
clearly in order to provide better guidance and help for mining.
A: Thank you for this suggestion. In mining practice, the vertical stress increases and
the horizontal stress decreases in the front of mining face, which is different from the
conventional stress loading path. This stress state of coal has an important influence
on the mechanical response of coal, more importantly, the magnitude and location of
peak stress of abutment pressure should be researched systematically. In Figure 3, the
change rule of vertical stress (especially the characteristic of peak stress of abutment
pressure) can be reflected in the manuscript. On this basis, better guidance and help
for mining, such as reasonable development layout and protecting seam mining
technology, are adopted in engineering practice to reduce the high stress concentration
in the coal seam and prevent high load from leading the coal pillar to the peak stress
point. Water injection in coal seam is also employed to reduce the strain-softening
stiffness factor of the coal pillar in the post-peak stage and improve the stiffness factor
of a double-block system in rock burst prevention. This manuscript was revised with
reference to this suggestion.

Reviewer #2:
The authors present a theoretical analysis of the energy accumulation and dissipation
of coal pillar in gob-side entry. The numerical simulation and case study are
conducted to verify the rationality of the research method. I have a few major
comments as follows:
1. In section 2.2, the author used two mathematical models, named "Weibull
distribution law" and "damage theory of micro-statistics". What is the basis for this? A
theoretical model established needs to be based on a large number of experiments.
The authors need to justify that these two models can truly describe the strain
softening characteristics of coal samples. Otherwise, the results derived from such a
non-consistent model are thus questionable.
A: Thank you for this suggestion. In the uniaxial compression test of coal sample,
when the working load reaches the compressive strength of coal sample, the ability of
coal sample to resist deformation weakens with the increment of compression amount.
The property of coal sample is known as the strain softening characteristics in
post-peak stage. As shown in the stress-strain curve of coal sample in figure (a), when
d <U+F065> <U+F03E> 0 , d<U+F073> <U+F03C> 0 , and <U+F073> <U+F0A2> <U+F028><U+F065> 0 <U+F029> <U+F03C> 0 in the post-peak stage.

Many experiments (such as Karcinovic D. (1982); Pan, Y. (2004) et al.) have been
done to clarify that "Weibull distribution law" and "damage theory of micro-statistics"
are suitable for the strain softening characteristics of coal samples. On this basis, it is
valid to use "Weibull distribution law" and "damage theory of micro-statistics" to
describe the F-u relationship of coal, and the load–displacement relationship of coal
mass could be expressed as
<U+F0E9> <U+F0E6> u <U+F0F6>m <U+F0F9>

where <U+F06C> represents the initial stiffness factor, uc represents the maximum
displacement, and m represents the kin exponent.

2. What is "quasi-static deformation". Please explain it in detail.
A: Thank you for this suggestion. In this article, the quasi-static deformation is the
mechanical response of coal pillar under the action of quasi-static loading, namely, the
term of inertia force caused by deformation is omitted. This manuscript was revised
with reference to this suggestion.
3. How to determine the position of the points j and s in the coal pillar instability stage
(Figure 3)?
A: Thank you for this suggestion. In Figure 3, the slope of the post-peak stage of coal
sample in j and s points are equal to that of oblique on , the first point is j, and the
next point is s; thus, the initial point and terminal point of dynamic destabilization of
coal sample is point j and point s, respectively. This manuscript was revised with
reference to this suggestion.

4. The authors need to justify the reasonability of the fold catastrophe model
compared to other previous studies.
A: Thank you for this suggestion. In previous studies, the catastrophe model is
suitable to clarify the dynamic destabilization, and the cusp catastrophic model is
usually employed to analyze the instability process, such as the destabilization of
geometry form of the elastic body. Compared to the cusp catastrophic model, the fold
catastrophe model is consistent with the key characteristics of dynamic destabilization
of coal pillar, such as the irreversibility of destabilization, two types of steady state
(unstable equilibrium in point j and stable equilibrium in point s in Figure 3.

The fold catastrophe model is one of seven types of catastrophe mathematical model.
According to the fold catastrophe theory, the control variable a and state variable
x3
x are both one, the potential function is <U+F02B> ax , and the equilibrium surface
3
equation is x 2 <U+F02B> a <U+F03D> 0 . The point in equilibrium surface refers to an equilibrium state
of mechanical system, and the equilibrium surface of fold catastrophe model is shown
in Fig. 5.

Figure 5: Balance curve of the fold catastrophe model
In equilibrium surface equation of fold catastrophe model, x is the state variable,
and a is the control variable. The system is in dummy status if a <U+F03E> 0 , while the
system is a parabola if a <U+F0A3> 0 ; the straight line a <U+F03D> 0 (or the axis K <U+F02D> 1 ) divides the
parabola into upper and lower branches. x1 and x2 represent the expression of state
variable x on branch 1 and branch 2, respectively. In branch 1, x1 <U+F03C> 0 , which
refers to the unstable equilibrium, and in branch 2, x2 <U+F03E> 0 , which refers to the stable
equilibrium. Therefore, there are two equilibrium states for the fold catastrophe model;
one is unstable, and the other is stable; besides, one equilibrium state cannot change to
the other equilibrium state. This manuscript was revised with reference to this
suggestion.
5. In line 35 of P11, what is the criterion for judging the coal seam's burst tendency?
A: Thank you for this suggestion. The burst tendency is an inherent property of coal,
and the criterion for judging the coal seam's burst tendency is “classification and
laboratory test method on bursting liability of coal (GB/T 25217.2-2010)”. To be
more specific, there are four indices of burst tendency (dynamic damage time,
uniaxial compressive strength, elastic energy index and impact energy index), which
can be obtained in mechanical test of bursting tendency of coal samples, and these all
play an important role in evaluating rock burst hazards in coal seams. In this article,
the dynamic damage time is 46 ms (strong), the elastic energy index is 6.79 (strong),
the impact energy index is 5.14 (strong), and the uniaxial compressive strength is 14.0
MPa (strong), according to the bursting tendency classification of coal sample, shown
in table 1. Therefore, the comprehensive evaluation results of burst tendency indicate
that the coal samples show a strong impact tendency. This manuscript was revised
with reference to this suggestion.

A: Thank you for this suggestion. This manuscript was revised with reference to this
suggestion.
7. In the numerical modeling, I didn't see any results about crack propagation. How
does the author come to this conclusion that “Many cracks in coal seam are
development, ……”? (Please see Wu et al., 2019. Rock Mechanics and Rock
Engineering)
A: Thank you for this suggestion. The conclusion that “Many cracks in coal seam are
developed, ……” is obtained in mining practice, rather than in numerical simulation.
This manuscript was revised with reference to this suggestion.
8. In figure 14, the energy density at the two ends of goaf reach to 1.96×1016 J. This
value is so large. Is it reasonable? Please further analyze and discuss.
A: Thank you for this suggestion. In this article, the unit of energy density in figure 14
is J/mm3, so the energy density at the two ends of goaf reaches to 1.96×1016 J/mm3,
namely 1.96×107 J/m3. This manuscript was revised with reference to this suggestion.
9. I didn't see the roadway driving along the goaf in the numerical model. Therefore,
how does the author compare the theoretical results with the observation result (Line
14 to 16 of P15)? It is questionable.
A: Thank you for this suggestion. In this article, the numerical simulation focuses on
the analysis the stress evolution of coal seam mining rather than roadway driving
along goaf, and theoretical results is compared with the observation result in mining
practice. To be more precise, in mining practice, a rock burst induced by coal pillar in
the gob-side entry, located in frontal abutment pressure region of No. 3306 working
face, occurred in Xin’an coal mine. The earthquake observation station records that
the rock burst intensity is equivalent to an earthquake of 2.3 Richter magnitude (in
section 4.1). Meanwhile, in theoretical analysis, The intensity of this rock burst, in
which the energy released is 6.4512×107 J, is equivalent to an earthquake of 2.1
Richter magnitude (in section 4.6). Therefore, the theoretical result is close to the
observation result in mining practice. This manuscript was revised with reference to
this suggestion.
10. The topic of paper is energy characteristics of coal pillar in gob-side entry. But, in
the section of numerical simulation, the authors focuses on the analysis the stress
evolution of coal seam mining rather than roadway driving along goaf. The numerical
results need to be more closely related to the topic of the article.
A: Thank you for this suggestion. In mining practice, the width of coal pillar in
gob-side entry is approximately 4 m to 10 m, and the length of working face is
approximately 200 m to 250 m; thus, confined to size discrepancy, the stress evolution
of coal seam mining is researched carefully by numerical simulation in this paper.
Besides, the better understanding of stress and energy evolution of coal seam mining
is beneficial for researching energy characteristics of coal pillar in gob-side entry. The
more closely research related to the topic of the article would be done in follow-on
work.
