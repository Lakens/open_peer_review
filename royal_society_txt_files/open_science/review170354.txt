This is a very interesting study of a very rare form of language transmission that focusses on the
use of inter-beat duration as a means of encoding. The analysis provided strongly suggests that
V-V interval duration is the relevant dimension of speech that is captured by inter-drumbeat
intervals. This finding will be of great interest to those studying other speech surrogates,
including other drummed forms of communication. I strongly support publication, but I have
some minor comments which I think need amending.
1. On p. 12, the expected relative durations of three V-V interval types are listed as VC < VCC <
VVC, but looking at the data of Figure 6, I see the ordering as VC < VVC < VCC. If I am
misinterpreting things, perhaps this could be clarified, otherwise, this is a rather important typo.
2. In the supplementary materials provided, at least one video (mang_mm_10.mpg) clearly shows
a considerable number of beats which appear to be marked by simultaneous right and left hand
drum hits. Nowhere in the paper is there any discussion of such behaviour or how it might be
interpreted. I think this merits comment.
3. The treatment of linguistic rhythm is relatively simplistic. In particular, the only timing
options considered are syllabic and inter-vowel intervals. I do not know if a moraic analysis of
the language has been conducted, but it seems likely that a consideration of moraic structure is at
least worth considering.
4. The success that the authors have had in elucidating the role of inter-beat intervals would not
be threatened at all by adding some discussion of where they remain ignorant, and what the next
most important outstanding questions are.

This article deals with the fascinating topic of emulated drummed speech. Such speech is an
important source of information from which we can learn more about the mechanisms that
provide an abstract encoding of acoustic speech information in a natural environment. The topic
is highly relevant and the expertise in this area strongly needed. Some parts of the paper can
make a strong contribution to our knowledge and I would thus appreciate to see this study
published eventually. I think, however, in its present form the paper is not suitable for
publication and needs major revisions of the following points:
- The overall organization of the paper is in the style of an experimental study (intro, method,
results, discussion) but essential requirements of an experimental study are missing. It remains
unclear by the end of the introduction what hypotheses were tested and how they tie into the
information provided in the intro. Hypotheses then appear in other parts of the paper, e.g. in the
results section ("we therefore hypothesized that the representation of rhythmic structure must
play a crucial role in decoding Bora drummed messages" - mind that this hypothesis is difficult to
test the way it is formulated). By the end of the introduction it is not possible to understand the
method because the fundamental idea about the experiment is missing. The necessary
information can be picked up at various places during the results and discussion which makes
the paper hard to follow. Throughout the results section it remains unclear what are the findings
and what the interpretations of these findings. I appreciate that many of the results are not results
in a strict experimental sense but the authors need to find a way of disambiguating this to make
the paper intelligible for the reader.
- The abstract is not in the style of an experimental study. It remains unclear what is previous
knowledge and what is knowledge that the present article found. The experiments were carried
out and what were the main findings? Please rewrite the abstract clarifying these points.
- The concept of rhythm and – in particular 'linguistic rhythm' – is unclear. On p. 2 'rhythmic
structures' are named as a distinctive acoustic property of spoken language. While other prosodic
information like intonation reveal clear ways of contrasting meaning, such examples are lacking
in case of rhythm, at least according to my knowledge. There is no known example in any of the
languages of the world in which the meaning of a sentence is altered unambiguously by altering
its speech rhythm. I doubt that this is the case in drummed language. What the authors describe
is a contrastive distinction of meaning in terms of segment or syllable duration. Such contrasts
exist in many languages and it is unclear to what degree they are related to speech rhythm. The
study thus is in need of definitions for the concepts used such as speech rhythm, linguistic
rhythm and rhythmic structures. This is also crucial for the argument about whether v-to-v
interval or syllables as the underlying rhythmic units of speech. The study wants to make a
4
strong point here but the literature about this point is very controversial (add discussion - there is
no supporting literature so far). It should also be pointed out how these concepts tie into the
phenomenon of contrastive duration. One could probably argue that Bora drummed speech
encodes pitch and vowel duration and that the overall rhythmicity is at best a by-product of these
factors.
- The argument about the information content of drummed speech does not become quite clear to
me. On the one hand the authors argue that drummed speech is a drastic acoustic reduction in
the frequency domain, on the other hand they state that drummed speech still contains four
distinct frequencies that are apparently clearly identifiable as four distinct pitches. It has
repeatedly been pointed out that speech reduced to four discrete frequency bands remains highly
intelligible (see Robert V. Shannon et al., 1995, Speech Recognition with Primarily Temporal
Cues; Science [270, 5234], 303-304). It has also been demonstrated that speech is highly
intelligible when the first three resonance are turned into sinusoids (sine-wave speech,
http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Sine-wave_speech). It thus seems possible that with four
discrete tones the abstract spectro-temporal information should be stylized in drummed speech.
However, I am not aware that natural equivalents have been identified so far for the experimental
speech conditions (noise vocoding and sine-wave speech). Drummed speech might be such an
equivalent which would be extremely interesting as such.
- The actual experimental results on the question whether drummed Bora represents syllabic or
V-to-V intervals in speech comes surprising and out of context given the previous part of the
paper. The question is interesting but I disagree with the conclusion "that the rhythmic units
encoded in drummed Bora correspond more closely to V-to-V intervals (as annotated in Figure 1)
rather than to syllables". I do not see why the significant differences in t-tests between the interval
durations should be an indicator for which rhythmic units are encoded in the drumming. What is
the hypothesis and what is the rationale for it? And what are rhythmic units and what is their
significance? Also, there is no literature discussion on the topic (see point 1, above). The question
for why it is important to know which rhythmic units are relevant is unclear to me. It should be
discussed along with the questions posed above about whether rhythm fulfils linguistic functions
and, if yes, what these functions are.
- As for the statistics, multiple t-tests do not seem an appropriate model for testing the differences
between the interval types as the data stems from one dataset and number of tokens varies
drastically between groups. It would be important to test for the main effects to begin with. Given
the strongly varying number of tokens between groups a linear mixed model is probably most
applicable.
Minor comments:
p. 2: systematic phonetic methods -> what does that mean?
p. 2: we establish -> what does that mean? you found? you argue?
p. 2: please correct "results suggests"
p. 3: tone values -> rather: tone categories?
p. 3, l. 50: maybe avoid multiple use of "use" in one sentence
p. 6: "it turned out that about 5% [were] errors" -> how did this "turn out"? For excluding data
you must provide strict rules. Who decided they were 'slips of the drum'? Was a native Bora
speaker involved?
p. 9: "This question is crucial for understanding the representation of the rhythmic structure of
spoken language in drummed speech, but has – to our knowledge – never been systematically
addressed in previous studies on drummed speech" -> such statements should be in the
introduction
p. 9: "sometimes called weight" -> when?
5
p. 9: "the well-known concept of syllable" -> which one?
p. 12: "as shown above" -> where?
P. 14: "This adds to growing evidence in the recent literature" -> which literature?
Figure 1:
- "indicate" seems not the right word here. The wave-forms show the air pressure over time.
- strictly speaking the linguistically distinctive acoustic information is not readily visible in a
spectrogram but is a product of human interpretation of spectrographic information.

Comments to the Author:
Dear Dr Meyer
Thank you for submitting your paper for consideration at Royal Society Open Science. I have
now received 2 reviews of the manuscript from researchers with relevant expertise. As you will
see, both reviewers are supportive of the paper and its novelty but also have some concerns. My
interim decision is to invite a resubmission after major revisions.
Importantly, both reviewers wish to see a more thorough handling of the issue of linguistic
rhythm - in terms of its definition and role in language comprehension, how it should be
measured, and how the current results fit with the existing literature. Please also note the
comments of Reviewer 2 regarding the use of t-tests, and their interpretation for this study.
Reviewer 2 in particular requests that the manuscript should be undergo some reorganization
such that it fits more clearly with the conventions of an experimental paper. I agree, and
recommend that the abstract and introduction in particular are organized more clearly to pose the
experimental question and hypotheses. This should make the results and discussion read more
coherently with the overall aims of the paper.

Associate Editor Comments to Author (Dr Carolyn McGettigan):
As the authors will see, Reviewer 1 is now happy to recommend publication. I have also read the
revised manuscript and agree that the majority of concerns from both original reviewers have
been addressed. However, the results section has undergone major revision for this version, and
there are some points where additional clarification is needed. Therefore, I would like to request
that the authors attend to the following points before submitting a final version of the
manuscript:
• The supplementary material ESM1Revised indicates that a large number of posthoc
comparisons were carried out between different levels of the variables SYLLABLE and V-
TOVTYPE. Please indicate whether these were corrected for multiple comparisons, and if so,
which method was used.
• “Using nested modelling techniques we verified for each model that both DRUMMER and
SYLLABLE (in model 1) and both DRUMMER and V-TO-VTYPE (in model 2) had a significant
effect on the IBD variations”. In a revision to the text, please clarify the following:
o Do the nested modelling techniques refer to likelihood ratio tests, or some other method?
o Was significance determined by forward or backward modelling?
o Related point: at what stage does the interaction of DRUMMER*HYPOTHESIS arrive? This
becomes particularly important when a 3-way interaction emerges (see section “Comparison to
spoken Bora”) – indeed, are there 2-way interactions present in this model? Please clarify.
14
• Terminology: The authors talk about “modalities” of variables (i.e. drummer 1 and drummer 2
are two “modalities” of DRUMMER). Would “levels” be more appropriate?
• Organization of the text: Please move the information about the exact R function used to run
the models (“by building three linear effect models in R [69] and using the lm function to perform
linear analyses”, p9) to the start of the section “Rhythmic structure” on p11. This puts all the R
info in the same place.

Appendix A
1.a) General comments:
R1: This is a very interesting study of a very rare form of language transmission that focusses on the
use of inter-beat duration as a means of encoding. The analysis provided strongly suggests that V-V
interval duration is the relevant dimension of speech that is captured by inter-drumbeat intervals. This
finding will be of great interest to those studying other speech surrogates, including other drummed
forms of communication. I strongly support publication, but I have some minor comments which I think
need amending.
R2: This article deals with the fascinating topic of emulated drummed speech. Such speech is an
important source of information from which we can learn more about the mechanisms that provide an
abstract encoding of acoustic speech information in a natural environment. The topic is highly relevant
and the expertise in this area strongly needed. Some parts of the paper can make a strong contribution
to our knowledge and I would thus appreciate to see this study published eventually. I think, however,
in its present form the paper is not suitable for publication and needs major revisions of the following
points...
1.b) General response to 'General comments':
We thank the reviewers for these comments and performed a deep major revision to meet te
expectations of the reviewers. Details are provided in the next responses.
2.a) Comments on organization of the paper:
AE: Reviewer 2 in particular requests that the manuscript should be undergo some reorganization such
that it fits more clearly with the conventions of an experimental paper. I agree, and recommend that the
abstract and introduction in particular are organized more clearly to pose the experimental question and
hypotheses. This should make the results and discussion read more coherently with the overall aims of
the paper.
R2: The overall organization of the paper is in the style of an experimental study (intro, method, results,
discussion) but essential requirements of an experimental study are missing. It remains unclear by the
end of the introduction what hypotheses were tested and how they tie into the information provided in
the intro. Hypotheses then appear in other parts of the paper, e.g. in the results section ("we therefore
hypothesized that the representation of rhythmic structure must play a crucial role in decoding Bora
drummed messages" - mind that this hypothesis is difficult to test the way it is formulated). By the end
of the introduction it is not possible to understand the method because the fundamental idea about the
experiment is missing. The necessary information can be picked up at various places during the results
and discussion which makes the paper hard to follow. Throughout the results section it remains unclear
what are the findings and what the interpretations of these findings. I appreciate that many of the
results are not results in a strict experimental sense but the authors need to find a way of
disambiguating this to make the paper intelligible for the reader.
2.b) Response to 'Comments on organization of the paper':
We extensively reorganized the manuscript such that it fits more clearly with the conventions of an
experimental paper, in particular the introduction. Specifically, we formulated a research questions at
the beginning of the introduction, which is further developed in the course of the introduction. Four
specific hypotheses are now made explicit at the end of the introduction in a new section called ‘aims of
this study’. The hypothesis for the experimental study now reads “Bora drumming represent V-to-V
intervals, based on the iconic association of prominent acoustic peaks in drumming and spoken
language, rather than syllables, only vowel length or only moras, and that these rhythmic units should
be consistently respected across different drummers “. We now deal in the discussion and interpretation
of our results with the point made by following infelicitous formulation in the previous version, as noted
by R2: "we therefore hypothesized that the representation of rhythmic structure must play a crucial role
in decoding Bora drummed messages". Any information relating to hypotheses or background
information has been removed from the section ‘results’ (now called ‘results and discussion’), in
particular the development of the hypothesis regarding syllables vs. v-to-v intervals . Within the “results
and discussion” section, we made sure to make clear what the findings and what the interpretations of
these findings are. We renamed the final section ‘conclusion’.
We also now make explicit that our study includes, on the one hand, an experimental study involving
statistical analyses of measurements taken in drummed and spoken Bora, and, on the other hand,
qualitative analyses of tonal, lexical and grammatical aspects that interact with rhythm (addressing R2’s
comment “I appreciate that many of the results are not results in a strict experimental sense but the
authors need to find a way of disambiguating this to make the paper intelligible for the reader.”)
3.a) Comment on the abstract:
R2: The abstract is not in the style of an experimental study. It remains unclear what is previous
knowledge and what is knowledge that the present article found. The experiments were carried out and
what were the main findings? Please rewrite the abstract clarifying these points.
3.b) Response to 'Comment on the abstract':
The abstract has been rewritten, and structured in the following way:
- 1. Previous knowledge: Many drum communication systems around the world transmit information by
emulating tonal and rhythmic patterns of spoken languages in sequences of drumbeats. Their rhythmic
characteristics in particular have not been systematically studied so far, although understanding them
represents a rare occasion for providing an original insight into the basic units of speech rhythm as
selected by natural speech practices directly based on beats.
- 2. The experiment/study: Here we analyse a corpus of Bora drum communication from the Northwest
Amazon, which is nowadays endangered with extinction.
- 3. Results/main findings/knowledge that the present article found: We show that four rhythmic units
are encoded in the length of pauses between beats. We argue that these units correspond to vowel-to-
vowel intervals with different numbers of consonants and vowel lengths. In contrast, aligning beats with
syllables, mora or only vowel length yields inconsistent results. Moreover, we also show that Bora
drummed messages conventionally select rhythmically distinct markers to further distinguish words. The
two phonological tones represented in drummed speech encode only few lexical contrasts.
- 4. Interpretation/wider relevance: Rhythm thus appears to crucially contribute to the intelligibility of
drummed Bora. Our study provides novel evidence for the role of rhythmic structures composed of
vowel-to-vowel intervals in the complex puzzle concerning the redundancy and distinctiveness of
acoustic features embedded in speech
4. a) Comments on handling 'linguistic rhythm':
AE: Importantly, both reviewers wish to see a more thorough handling of the issue of linguistic rhythm -
in terms of its definition and role in language comprehension, how it should be measured, and how the
current results fit with the existing literature.
R1: The treatment of linguistic rhythm is relatively simplistic. In particular, the only timing options
considered are syllabic and inter-vowel intervals. I do not know if a moraic analysis of the language has
been conducted, but it seems likely that a consideration of moraic structure is at least worth
considering.
R2: The concept of rhythm and – in particular 'linguistic rhythm' – is unclear. On p. 2 'rhythmic
structures' are named as a distinctive acoustic property of spoken language. While other prosodic
information like intonation reveal clear ways of contrasting meaning, such examples are lacking in case
of rhythm, at least according to my knowledge. There is no known example in any of the languages of
the world in which the meaning of a sentence is altered unambiguously by altering its speech rhythm. I
doubt that this is the case in drummed language. What the authors describe is a contrastive distinction
of meaning in terms of segment or syllable duration. Such contrasts exist in many languages and it is
unclear to what degree they are related to speech rhythm. The study thus is in need of definitions for
the concepts used such as speech rhythm, linguistic rhythm and rhythmic structures. This is also crucial
for the argument about whether v-to-v interval or syllables as the underlying rhythmic units of speech.
The study wants to make a strong point here but the literature about this point is very controversial
(add discussion - there is no supporting literature so far). It should also be pointed out how these
concepts tie into the phenomenon of contrastive duration. One could probably argue that Bora drummed
speech encodes pitch and vowel duration and that the overall rhythmicity is at best a by-product of
these factors.
4.b) Response to 'Comments on handling 'linguistic rhythm'':
We added a literature review section on these issues in the introduction (entitled ‘Speech rhythm’). In
this section we discuss speech rhythm in terms of its definition and role in language comprehension and
how it has been measured in previous studies. We also discuss how it relates to segment durations. We
avoid the term “linguistic rhythm” (also in the title), as it is too strongly associated with one line of
research (rhythmic typology), which is not completely relevant here, and use “speech rhythm” instead.
We also discuss v-to-v interval or syllables (see also our response to “Comments on syllabic or V-to-V
question”). This discussion also clarifies how “rhythm” in the sense relevant here contributes to
contrasting meaning, and how the current results fit with the existing literature on segment duration, as
well as sine-wave and vocoded speech (see also our response to “Comments on information content”).
Regarding the role of moras and vowel duration, we now discuss the role of moras in Bora phonology,
and we present and discuss results on the hypotheses that only moraic structure or only vowel length
would be represented in drummed Bora.
5.a) Comments on information content:
R2: The argument about the information content of drummed speech does not become quite clear to
me. On the one hand the authors argue that drummed speech is a drastic acoustic reduction in the
frequency domain, on the other hand they state that drummed speech still contains four distinct
frequencies that are apparently clearly identifiable as four distinct pitches. It has repeatedly been
pointed out that speech reduced to four discrete frequency bands remains highly intelligible (see Robert
V. Shannon et al., 1995, Speech Recognition with Primarily Temporal Cues; Science [270, 5234], 303-
304). It has also been demonstrated that speech is highly intelligible when the first three resonance are
turned into sinusoids (sine-wave speech, http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Sine-wave_speech). It
thus seems possible that with four discrete tones the abstract spectro-temporal information should be
stylized in drummed speech. However, I am not aware that natural equivalents have been identified so
far for the experimental speech conditions (noise vocoding and sine-wave speech). Drummed speech
might be such an equivalent which would be extremely interesting as such.
5.b) Response to 'Comments on information content':
Regarding the “drastic reduction” of drummed Bora, we explain in the Introduction that drummed Bora
in ‘talking mode’ relies only on two frequency levels which are fixed by the size of the drums (It is only
in the ‘musical mode’ that four pitch levels are used, for purely musical means). Moreover, the
frequencies that are drummed cannot be modulated in amplitude or frequency as in sine wave speech or
vocoded speech or even natural whistled speech (and these modulations are a key aspect in these
transformations). The hollow-log drums do not allow any modulation. Thus, being devoid of modulation,
drummed Bora is effectively a strong reduction. We also explain now the relation between our study and
results on noise vocoding and sine-wave speech in the introduction (section ‘speech rhythm’), namely
that these provide indications that rhythmic structures comparable to those represented in drummed
speech contribute to intelligibility.
6.a) Comments on syllabic or V-to-V question:
R2: The actual experimental results on the question whether drummed Bora represents syllabic or V-to-
V intervals in speech comes surprising and out of context given the previous part of the paper. The
question is interesting but I disagree with the conclusion "that the rhythmic units encoded in drummed
Bora correspond more closely to V-to-V intervals (as annotated in Figure 1) rather than to syllables". I
do not see why the significant differences in t-tests between the interval durations should be an
indicator for which rhythmic units are encoded in the drumming. What is the hypothesis and what is the
rationale for it? And what are rhythmic units and what is their significance? Also, there is no literature
discussion on the topic (see point 1, above). The question for why it is important to know which
rhythmic units are relevant is unclear to me. It should be discussed along with the questions posed
above about whether rhythm fulfils linguistic functions and, if yes, what these functions are.
6.b) Response to 'Comments on syllabic or V-to-V question':
In response to this comment we
- 1. reorganized the introduction, in which we now develop the research question and make explicit the
hypothesis (see also our response to Comments on organization of the paper);
- 2. include the newly written section ‘speech rhythm’ in the introduction, in which we provide a
literature review discussing what rhythmic units are, what their significance is (e.g. stress placement)
and why it is important to know which rhythmic units are relevant (e.g., Are speakers sensitive to one or
the other type in perceptions? Can one or the other type explain, e.g. stress placement better?) ;
- 3. we provide further statistical testing (see reply to Comments on statistical tests).
7;a) Comments on statistical tests:
AE: Please also note the comments of Reviewer 2 regarding the use of t-tests, and their interpretation
for this study.
R2: t-tests do not seem an appropriate model for testing the differences between the interval types as
the data stems from one dataset and number of tokens varies drastically between groups. It would be
important to test for the main effects to begin with. Given the strongly varying number of tokens
between groups a linear mixed model is probably most applicable.
7.b) Response to 'Comments on statistical tests':
We thank the reviewer 2 for this comment. We applied linear models to our data in order to consider
interactions between groups considered for our study and report the results and discuss them. We
present three different linear models, providing a more complete statistical analysis than before.
However, we consider that there is no counter indication to apply t-tests in the way we did it. The
multiple t-tests we applied in the previous version of the manuscript compared means 2 by 2 and relied
on the fact that the different categories (V-to-V types and syllable types) are represented by a number
of items ‘n’ largely superior to the limit required to apply such tests (which is often n=30 according to
uses in statistics). There are no other conditions to apply such tests of comparisons of mean values
when the number of tokens is as high as the one we analyze. We chose this kind of test because we
found it provided to the reader the most simple and the clearest statistical analysis given the limited
number of speakers-drummers still really expert in this practice nowadays. We consider here the two
drummers-speakers as case studies. Applying a general Anova (not applicable here because the number
of tokens varies very drastically between groups) or a general linear mixed model would mean that we
consider ‘subject-drummer’ as a random effect in the mixed model and that we would implicitly
extrapolate statistically their results , which is not possible according to best practices in statistics (see
Reference 70 in our new version of the manuscript: Harrison et al. 2017 Best practice in mixed effects
modelling and multi-model inference in ecology. (doi:10.7287/peerj.preprints.3113v1).
8.a) Comment on questions for future research:
R1: 4. The success that the authors have had in elucidating the role of inter-beat intervals would not be
threatened at all by adding some discussion of where they remain ignorant, and what the next most
important outstanding questions are.
8.b) Response to 'Comment on questions for future research':
We added two questions for future research at the end:
1. Applying refined methods for p-center localization, as slightly preceding vowel onsets.
2. Comprehension experiments to determine the limits of intelligibility of drummed Bora=
9.a) Comment on simultaneous right and left hand drumming:
R1: 2. In the supplementary materials provided, at least one video (mang_mm_10.mpg) clearly shows a
considerable number of beats which appear to be marked by simultaneous right and left hand drum hits.
Nowhere in the paper is there any discussion of such behaviour or how it might be interpreted. I think
this merits comment.
9.b) Response to 'Comment on simultaneous right and left hand drumming' :
To clarify this point, we added the following sentence in the introduction (just before ‘Bora phonology’):
“Note that ‘talking mode’ messages can be preceded by ‘musical’ sequences, during which both drums
may be played simultaneously, fulfilling the function of ringtones.”
10.a) Comments on typos R1:
R1: On p. 12, the expected relative durations of three V-V interval types are listed as VC < VCC < VVC,
but looking at the data of Figure 6, I see the ordering as VC < VVC < VCC. If I am misinterpreting
things, perhaps this could be clarified, otherwise, this is a rather important typo.
R1: Small points:
• Figure 4, 4th row, DEC-PLURAL seems to be reversed
• p. 11, penultimate line: "set 18 trisyllabic" -> "set of 18 trisyllabic . . . "
10.b) Response:
We thank the reviewer for pointing out these important typos that we have now fixed.
11.a) Comments on minor issues R2:
p. 2: systematic phonetic methods -> what does that mean?
p. 2: we establish -> what does that mean? you found? you argue?
p. 2: please correct "results suggests"
p. 3: tone values -> rather: tone categories?
p. 3, l. 50: maybe avoid multiple use of "use" in one sentence
p. 6: "it turned out that about 5% [were] errors" -> how did this "turn out"? For excluding data you
must provide strict rules. Who decided they were 'slips of the drum'? Was a native Bora speaker
involved?
p. 9: "This question is crucial for understanding the representation of the rhythmic structure of spoken
language in drummed speech, but has – to our knowledge – never been systematically addressed in
previous studies on drummed speech" -> such statements should be in the introduction
p. 9: "sometimes called weight" -> when?
p. 9: "the well-known concept of syllable" -> which one?
p. 12: "as shown above" -> where?
P. 14: "This adds to growing evidence in the recent literature" -> which literature?
Figure 1:
- "indicate" seems not the right word here. The wave-forms show the air pressure over time.
- strictly speaking the linguistically distinctive acoustic information is not readily visible in a spectrogram
but is a product of human interpretation of spectrographic information.
11.b) Response:
All of these minor issues have been fixed. We comment here on those three issues that involved more
than mere stylistic or terminological adjustments:
1. Page. 6: criteria for exclusion: we added “We excluded from the analysis drummed data in which the
number of drumbeats or their tone category did not match the intended Bora phrase due to ‘slips of the
drum’, that were identified during fieldwork together with a native speaker (about 5% of the recorded
messages “
2. Page 9: This statement has been moved to the introduction
3. Page 14, regarding "’This adds to growing evidence in the recent literature’ -> which literature?”. We
discuss relevant literature in the new section ‘Speech rhythm’ in the introduction and additionally
provide references for this statement (in the conclusion)

whether these were corrected for multiple comparisons, and if so, which method was used.
• “Using nested modelling techniques we verified for each model that both DRUMMER and SYLLABLE
in model 1) and both DRUMMER and V-TO-VTYPE (in model 2) had a significant effect on the IBD
variations”. In a revision to the text, please clarify the following:
o Do the nested modelling techniques refer to likelihood ratio tests, or some other method?
o Was significance determined by forward or backward modelling?
o Related point: at what stage does the interaction of DRUMMER*HYPOTHESIS arrive? This
becomes particularly important when a 3-way interaction emerges (see section “Comparison
to spoken Bora”) – indeed, are there 2-way interactions present in this model? Please clarify.
• Terminology: The authors talk about “modalities” of variables (i.e. drummer 1 and drummer 2 are
wo “modalities” of DRUMMER). Would “levels” be more appropriate?
Reply and modifications in the paper to attend to these points:
P.11 we replaced “Using nested modelling techniques and” by “Using nested modelling techniques
and F-tests we performed a backward selection and”
p.11 P.12 and P.14, we replaced “modalities” by “levels”
P.11 Line 35 we added « and their interactions » after the bracket.
p.11 Line 38-40, we replaced the sentence ‘Next, we performed multiple comparisons between
means of the different modalities of each variable and using the lsmeans package as well as the
unction glht of the package multcomp in R [69,71,72]’ by a clearer and more explicit text, as follows:
Next, we performed multiple comparisons. For each of the models for which it was needed, the
multiple comparisons were done using the method described in the article by Hothorn & al [71].
Thereby, we used the function glht from the package multcomp of R software. This method allows us
o perform multiple comparisons of means after building appropriate matrices of contrasts (using the
unction lsmeans from the package lsmeans). Mainly, it ensures that the overall type I error
associated with the simultaneous decisions don’t exceed the pre-specified significance level (usually
0.05) by adjusting p-values *69,71,72+.’
P.14 Line 38 we added « and their interactions » after “drummed speech”
Other Editor’s comment:
• Organization of the text: Please move the information about the exact R function used to run the
models (“by building three linear effect models in R *69+ and using the lm function to perform linear
analyses”, p9) to the start of the section “Rhythmic structure” on p11. This puts all the R info in the
ame place."
Reply to attend this point:
P.9 line 36-37 we deleted “by building three linear effect models in R [69] and
using the lm function to perform linear analyses.”
P.11 line 30 we added “in R [69] and using the lm function to perform linear analyses”
Additionally, we fixed a number of minor typos and stylistic errors, namely:
p.5 line 51 we added ‘From now on, we will adopt the phonemic transcription without slashes (‘/’).’
And the two preceding lines made clear the difference between phonemic and phonetic symbols in
he inventory of IPA symbols used to describe Bora language.
p.15 last sentence, we deleted “that”
p.16 line 11 we deleted “and never to iconically emulate speech”
p.16 line 37, we deleted one non necessary “+”
Acknowledgements: We deleted repeated information on Volkswagen Foundation grants and added
one additional acknowledgement for an Eurias Marie Curie Cofund Fellowship that was forgotten in
he last version
Ethics statement: We moved this information from the main text (methods section) to the closing
tatements as requested.
