Summary:
The development of avian eggs is sensitive to temperature variation, such that in warm climes
environmental temperature may often surpass that required for embryonic development. This is
an interesting ‘side effect’ of nesting at low latitudes that have received comparatively little
attention in the literature. To remedy this Griffith et al. measured several aspects of the thermal
environment in zebra finch nests, and also performed an experiment in which nests were placed
in either exposed or shaded locations to study the effects of nest thermal environment and length
of the incubation period. Results show that nests frequently experience temperatures in the range
of embr yonic development, and that even seemingly short-term exposure to warmer nests may
decrease the length of the incubation period. As such, this ms sheds light on a relatively neglected
aspect of avian incubation, and should be of interest to a range of ornithologists.
Overall I was quite pleased with this ms, but there are a few issues that needs the attention of the
authors. Please find below a few general comments, followed by a list of line specific remarks of a
more itemized nature. I hope you will find these useful when revising your ms.
General comments:
1. It is remarkable that eggs could withstand nest temperatures of above 50 degrees C. Would
these temperatures ever be realized in natural (i.e. non-experimental) nests? Do you have any
information on the behavior of the female and/or male in very hot days during the egg laying
period? I would assume birds nesting in exposed conditions would shade the eggs also during
laying when needed?
2. For your cold/hot nests experiment, did you ever find natural nests in the same environment?
This is an important piece of information, because the effect of temperature on the length of the
incubation period in itself is unsurprising. The interesting part of it all is (at least to me) whether
birds would preferentially build nests in hotter areas, e.g. during cold(er) season breeding) to
gain thermal benefits from solar incubation. But if birds never use these nest locations, then we
must discuss the biological relevance of this result. Please comment.
3. It is unclear if the 24 natural and 64 artificial nests (i.e. nest boxes; lines 125-127) that were
‘recently vacated’ had previously been used for rearing nestlings. I assume they had, as the
opposite was not stated (cf. Lines 151-152). It is likely that thermal conductance of nests changes
during the nestling stage from soiling and change in physical structure of the nest etc., in which
case the absolute temperatures reported here might not be relevant for nests during egg laying.
While I realize that any differences in conductance between fresh and used nests are likely
relatively small, it is important to acknowledge any potential such effects. Along these lines, it
also needs to be acknowledged that thermal properties of an empty nest and a nest with eggs
inside are likely to differ.
4. The ms does not detail whether you calibrated iButtons prior to, or after, use. These devices are
prone to between-instrument variation that might affect estimates of means (particularly for
small samples). Any such effects might be relevant in cases where one is interested in absolute
3
temperatures, such as when assessing the temperature tolerance of heat exposed eggs where even
small deviations of a few degrees C could be important.
5. While it is true that a reduction in deep body temperature could allow birds to prevent eggs
from overheating, this is also a strategy that comes at a considerable water cost (as acknowledged
by the authors). For this reason, many desert birds or birds from hot climes do the opposite – i.e.
allow body temperature to increase hyperthermia) to conserve water during incubation. This can
certainly be quite effective in terms of water conservation, but likely comes at a cost to somatic
regulation. To this end hyperthermia might represent a trade off between water supply, somatic
cost, and risk of overheating to eggs. In any event, I think you need to better acknowledge not
only that hypothermia in desert climes is very costly in terms of water balance but also, as a direct
result thereof, many birds allow body temperature to fluctuate in the opposite direction.
6. It seems to me some essential literature is not included in the ms. This concerns some of the
work on the ecophysiology, nest site selection, etc. of incubating desert birds by Williams and
Williams & Tieleman (e.g. Tieleman et al. Condor, 110, 2008; Tieleman & Williams, 2005, in Drent
et al. (eds): Seeking nature’s limits, etc.) where there might be additional insights into water- and
heat balance that could be relevant to your present work. Likewise, I think that the work on
ambient incubation in crab plovers by DeMarchi and colleagues (2008, J Avian Biol) could be
interesting to you.
Minor comments:
1. Lines 34-35: I am not quite sure I follow the link to climate change. At least with regards to
increasing global or regional temperatures the predicted temperature rate of temperature change
is such that birds should be able to adapt accordingly. For an increase in the likelihood of extreme
weather events the story is different, but it is not clear if this is what you are referring to here.
2. Line 38: Perhaps consider adding ‘nest temperature’ to the keywords?
3. Lines 78-80: I think you need to make clearer already at this point that ambient incubation need
not always be a serious threat to successful reproduction, but can in fact be beneficial in relieving
parental workload under certain circumstances (as is acknowledged in the Discussion).
4. Line 92: “…ambient temperature on the length of the incubation period.”
5. Line 116: It would be interesting to also see these data plotted separately for your study period,
as this will make it easier to evaluate results from your experiment. Perhaps A (full data set) and
B (study period) panels would be worth considering for Fig. 1?
6. Lines 279-291: Effect sizes would be helpful to better understand the nature of these effects.
7. Lines 326-330: I was intrigued by the large effect on incubation period for a relatively brief
period of ‘ambient incubation’. Could you speculate on the nature of this effect for a full
incubation period in natural nests?
8. Lines 340-343: But should not such effects already be included in estimates of hatching
asynchrony from natural nests?
9. Line 345: “…the oldest and largest…”
10. Lines 348-351: Unclear, please revise.
4
11. Line 359: ‘temperature logger’ rather than probe? This seems a more adequate way of
describing an iButton.
12. Line 618: Missing a ‘.’ in this sentence.
13. Line 641: ‘temperature logger’ likely more appropriate than ‘probe’.
14. Fig. 2A: Inclusion of a 1:1 line would be helpful when reading the graph.
15. Fig. 3A: This figure is a bit busy for my taste. Perhaps it would be worthwhile to see if
graphical display can be improved?
16. Fig. 2A, C, Fig. 3A, B, Fig. 4A: Explanatory legends in the figure panels would be helpful here.

Manuscript ID: RSOS-150371
Authors; S. Griffith, E. Sorato, M. Mainwaring, and C. Beckmann
I found the manuscript regarding effects of high ambient temperatures on early development of
zebra finch embryos interesting and fairly well-written. My specific comments can be found
below.
1) Lines 52-63: I believe predictions regarding effects of climate change vary regionally. Are
tropical regions predicted to experience the same level of change as locations at higher latitudes?
Variability in temperatures and precipitation patterns may be more important than just changes
in the averages. The citation by Conway and Martin (2000) is fairly dated and I think there are
much better citations to include here. I think the comparison here between temperate and tropical
locations is weak.
2) Lines 75-80: Eggs can actually begin to develop at temperatures as low as 24-27 C (Webb
1987). Check out the paper by Walls et al. Auk 128:663-670 (2011) that examines the effects of
temp and incubation delay on egg viability.
5
3) Line 144: Give the actual months that nest boxes were monitored.
4) Lines 163-165: Here you indicate that the treatment ran for 6 days (during 26 Nov-4 Dec)
but on Page 13 and in Fig 4a (line 305) you present temps over 193 hrs or approximately 8 days.
This needs to be clarified. Even if the exposure is only 6 days, with a clutch of 4-5 eggs that
exposure time is more than what would occur naturally, right? Zebra finches begin incubating on
the penultimate or ultimate egg depending on the clutch size.
5) Line 169: So you checked for hatching just once per day? Was the time of day consistent?
You might want to indicate the time that nest were checked in the Methods.
6) Lines 230-233: Usually when AIC is used for model selection, a table of models that were
considered along with AIC values and Akaike weights is given and parameter estimates from the
top model or after model averaging are simply given and discussed in the text. These tables are
pretty confusing and don’t allow the reader to know which other models were considered and
their strength.
7) Fig 1: Why give all the individual max temperatures? I think providing a regression line
with 95% CI would be a better way to provide this information.
8) Figures: I think your use of Figs is overdone. Many of these figures are not needed and
information could be included in the text. Example: Figures 2b , 3a,b, 4b,c,d.
9) Lines 295-296: I don’t see the comparison between natural nests and nest boxes in Fig 4a.
It looks like it is a pretty meaningful difference, so I am wondering why you combined nest types
and gave results for hot vs cool? I guess you chose to use egg as your experimental unit and not
box type?
10) Lines 298-299 and 302-302: I am confused here. It doesn’t look like hot chambers spend
2.6 times more time, but on average 2.6 hours more (5.5 vs. 2.9 hrs). Same comment for the
comparison on lines 302-303: not 3.7 times as long but 3.7 hrs. Or am I just misinterpreting things
here?
11) Line 312: Your really didn’t have much of a difference in developmental time (0.4 days)
considering you were checking for hatch daily.
12) It would have been nice to have monitored nest temperatures after eggs were placed
back in nests with parents for incubation. Were incubation temps the same or different? Did you
include a potential nest effect in the analysis to account for potential variation among nests?
13) Precocial birds like ducks will begin incubation before the clutch is complete. So at the
start of full incubation there will often be developmental asynchrony of 3-4 days between the
least and most developed eggs. However, eggs laid later in the sequence develop faster so that all
eggs are able to hatch synchronously. I think potentially more interesting is whether these high
temps are influencing offspring phenotype and survival after hatch.

High environmental temperatures and ‘ambient incubation’ drive embryonic development and
lead to earlier hatching in a passerine bird
Griffith et al.
Reviewed by Davina L. Hill, SRUC, UK
OVERVIEW
This is an interesting and timely study on the thermal environment experienced by zebra finch
eggs before parental incubation in the semi-arid zone of south-eastern Australia. Data consist of
temperature and biological (e.g. time to hatching) measurements collected by the research team
in the field, as well as records from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s Automated Weather
Station. The main finding is that atmospheric and nest temperatures recorded in the study often
fell within the range of temperatures considered optimal for embryonic development (a
phenomenon they refer to as ‘ambient incubation’). Moreover, temperatures regularly exceeded
this range. The authors used a simple experiment (comparing different nest types placed in the
sun or the shade) to show that ambient incubation can shorten developmental time. They discuss
the potential implications of ambient incubation for hatching asynchrony. I also think the study
might also be useful from an applied perspective, with potential to help inform design and
placement of nestboxes. The text is engagingly-written and structured logically and there are few
errors with language. I think that this paper would make a valuable contribution to Royal Society
Open Science. I have a number of suggestions for improvement, but think that these can be
addressed without much difficulty.
COMMENTS
1) The clarity of the manuscript could be improved by making sure that terminology is
defined and used in a consistent way. In the Introduction, the authors seem to use environmental
temperature, atmospheric temperature and ambient temperature interchangeably at times
(example below), and at other times they seem to imply distinct meanings.
‘for temperate species … ambient temperatures typically range between an average of 5 to 20°C
[8]. By
58 contrast, birds breeding in tropical and sub-tropical regions typically breed …
59 … when atmospheric temperatures may range between -5 and 45°C’
These three terms should be defined at first mention if they refer to different things. Ambient
temperature is later described in the Methods (L116-120), but the term seems to have a different
meaning in the Introduction. Also I suggest avoiding the term nest microclimate when referring
specifically to nest temperature (e.g. L89-90, 91, 134 etc). Microclimate comprises several variables
(e.g. humidity, which can also influence embryonic development), so I find it misleading to say
‘We characterised the microclimate of nests in a sub-tropical population’ (L24) when only
temperature was measured.
2) L104-106 I’d like to see a little more information on the breeding ecology of the zebra
finch under natural conditions. This would give the reader more background for understanding
7
the choice of methods and interpreting the results (e.g. the incubation span, when incubation
begins in relation to laying, when breeding occurs at the study site, that the species is a biparental
incubator etc).
3) L181 ‘multiple observations from the same site and from the same day were modelled’
What are sites (regions? nests?) I’d be interested to see (in the section on fieldwork) how many
sites were surveyed and how far away they were from each other (mean, SE and range, or
approximate figures if these were not measured). This would give an idea of the spatial scale
surveyed and how spatially independent sites were.
4) L203 This paragraph describes analysis of a time series of eight 24h periods for 4 nests.
Was there any evidence of temporal autocorrelation?
5) How were contrasts between different levels of factors carried out (e.g. Tukey tests)?
6) Please provide standard errors or standard deviations with means (e.g. L263-274, ranges
can be kept).
7) The sample of nests used is small for some of the experiments. The repeated-measures
designs seem to provide good statistical power, but I’d like to see some consideration of how
representative the experimental nests were.
8) I’d be curious to know to what extent zebra finches locate nests in shaded areas or
orientate their nests to a certain direction under natural conditions. Or perhaps this is a topic for a
future study?
9) I suggest including the R scripts as Supplementary Material. This would further improve
transparency and be a useful resource for researchers working on similar questions.
SPECIFIC COMMENTS
ABSTRACT
‘Temperatures frequently
25 exceeded the level at which embryo’s develop optimally’
Please specify whether you mean atmospheric or nest temperature.
L32-33 It would be clearer to say ‘atmospheric temperatures’ rather than just temperatures.
INTRODUCTION
L78 ‘ambient incubation is likely to affect many avian species’
Do you mean affect or just that they will experience it? As far as I’m aware this is the first study
to test whether ambient incubation actually affects embryonic development. Also L84-87.
L82-83 ‘atmospheric temperatures regularly exceed 36°C, the threshold at which eggs are
typically incubated’
The second part of this sentence is ambiguous. Perhaps rephrase to ‘...36°C, the lower threshold
for optimum embryonic development’.
8
METHODS
L107 Avoid using only ‘station’ – you describe both a Research Station and a Weather Station.
L104-106 Move species information to the end of this section so that location information is
together.
L114 State whether atmospheric temperatures were recorded in the shade?
L124 I suggest the subtitle ‘Nest temperature’ for consistency with the previous subtitle.
L125 I assume you used one iButton per nest (no repeated measures)?
L158 Add company name and place for Fimo clay, and (L163) move company details for iButtons
to where iButtons were first mentioned
L175 Give the version of R used (edit the year in the references if necessary).
‘We examined how nest microclimate influenced the hatching time of individual eggs
199 by using linear mixed models (with normal error distribution and identity link function), to
200 assess differences in temperature between ‘holding chambers’ in each treatment (‘hot’ and
201 ‘cool’) and between ‘holding chambers’ of different type (‘nestboxes’ and ‘natural nests’)’
This paragraph describes methods for comparing nest temperatures, so L198 is not relevant here.
L229 ‘Maximal initial models, including all of the explanatory variables and all of
229 their interaction terms (one-way and two-way)’
What do you mean by a ‘one-way’ interaction term?
RESULTS
L243, 384 Pluralise ‘data’.
L253, 258, 265, 286, 381 Habitat locations were not really ‘random’ as some were selected on the
basis of being suitable nest sites for zebra finches (L118-119).
‘The time to
316 hatching was similar for eggs placed in the temperature chambers constituted by either the
317 natural nests or the nest-boxes, and none of the higher-order interaction terms considered
318 were significant.’
What do you mean by higher-order terms? You state in the Methods (L229) that two-way
interactions were the highest-order interaction terms tested, but this suggests something
different.
DISCUSSION
L409-414 Keeping eggs cool using evaporative cooling is also likely to be a challenge in moist
tropical climates because the humidity limits the effectiveness of evaporative processes.
L418 ‘parents are able to adaptively adjust their investment in eggs’
This is a bit vague. Do you mean maternal investment into the egg before laying (vs. behavioural
adjustments by both parents after laying, discussed in the previous paragraph)?
‘development time varied
9
421 with laying order (but not in a consistent…way)’
Please explain this statement more clearly or remove it.
L431 An interesting point that you touch upon here and in L266-368 is the idea that optimum
incubation temperatures and lethal thresholds might vary between species, and that species that
evolved in warm environments might have higher optima. The optimum might also depend on
humidity.
REFERENCES
Please correct citations 20 and 22.
TABLES
L558, 587 ‘*’ doesn’t occur in Table 1 or 2 so it’s not necessary to define it in the legend.
‘All
559 factors (dummy binary variables)’
This should be briefly explained in the Methods as well as here in the legend.
Please indicate which levels of the two factors were used as reference levels in the legends (e.g.
night and vegetation) so the reader can see what comparisons are being made without returning
to the text.

Comments to the Author:
An interesting manuscript. Three reviewers have commented on it, and their comprehensive
reviews should be attached: there's a lot of sound advice within them, and I'd advise careful
revision to address their concerns (in particular about the details of iButton deployment, the
relation between the experimental and natural nests and their sample sizes, and the fit of the
manuscript into the wider literature). Could you also give exact p values in the tables (plus
indicate dfs for the t values).
Pay particular attention to reviewer #2's suggestion about presenting AICs (maybe with
supplementary information, if you don't want to overload the manuscript), and consider whether
you can move a few of the figures into supplementary information, as you don't want to overload
the message you present in the main manuscript. Figure 3a is particularly noisy, and could
probably lose the lettering of the top and bottom grey values without losing readability.

Do you mean affect or just that they will experience it? As far as I’m aware this is the first study
to test whether ambient incubation actually affects embryonic development. Also L84-87.
L82-83 ‘atmospheric temperatures regularly exceed 36°C, the threshold at which eggs are
typically incubated’
The second part of this sentence is ambiguous. Perhaps rephrase to ‘...36°C, the lower threshold
for optimum embryonic development’.
METHODS
L107 Avoid using only ‘station’ – you describe both a Research Station and a Weather Station.
L104-106 Move species information to the end of this section so that location information is
together.
L114 State whether atmospheric temperatures were recorded in the shade?
L124 I suggest the subtitle ‘Nest temperature’ for consistency with the previous subtitle.
L125 I assume you used one iButton per nest (no repeated measures)?
L158 Add company name and place for Fimo clay, and (L163) move company details for iButtons
to where iButtons were first mentioned
L175 Give the version of R used (edit the year in the references if necessary).
‘We examined how nest microclimate influenced the hatching time of individual eggs
199 by using linear mixed models (with normal error distribution and identity link function), to
200 assess differences in temperature between ‘holding chambers’ in each treatment (‘hot’ and
201 ‘cool’) and between ‘holding chambers’ of different type (‘nestboxes’ and ‘natural nests’)’
This paragraph describes methods for comparing nest temperatures, so L198 is not relevant here.
14
L229 ‘Maximal initial models, including all of the explanatory variables and all of
229 their interaction terms (one-way and two-way)’
What do you mean by a ‘one-way’ interaction term?
RESULTS
L243, 384 Pluralise ‘data’.
L253, 258, 265, 286, 381 Habitat locations were not really ‘random’ as some were selected on the
basis of being suitable nest sites for zebra finches (L118-119).
‘The time to
316 hatching was similar for eggs placed in the temperature chambers constituted by either the
317 natural nests or the nest-boxes, and none of the higher-order interaction terms considered
318 were significant.’
What do you mean by higher-order terms? You state in the Methods (L229) that two-way
interactions were the highest-order interaction terms tested, but this suggests something
different.
DISCUSSION
L409-414 Keeping eggs cool using evaporative cooling is also likely to be a challenge in moist
tropical climates because the humidity limits the effectiveness of evaporative processes.
L418 ‘parents are able to adaptively adjust their investment in eggs’
This is a bit vague. Do you mean maternal investment into the egg before laying (vs. behavioural
adjustments by both parents after laying, discussed in the previous paragraph)?
‘development time varied
421 with laying order (but not in a consistent…way)’
Please explain this statement more clearly or remove it.
L431 An interesting point that you touch upon here and in L266-368 is the idea that optimum
incubation temperatures and lethal thresholds might vary between species, and that species that
evolved in warm environments might have higher optima. The optimum might also depend on
humidity.
REFERENCES
Please correct citations 20 and 22.
TABLES
L558, 587 ‘*’ doesn’t occur in Table 1 or 2 so it’s not necessary to define it in the legend.
‘All
559 factors (dummy binary variables)’
This should be briefly explained in the Methods as well as here in the legend.
Please indicate which levels of the two factors were used as reference levels in the legends (e.g.
night and vegetation) so the reader can see what comparisons are being made without returning
to the text.

Manuscript ID: RSOS-150371
Authors; S. Griffith, E. Sorato, M. Mainwaring, and C. Beckmann
I found the manuscript regarding effects of high ambient temperatures on early development of
zebra finch embryos interesting and fairly well-written. My specific comments can be found
below.
1) Lines 52-63: I believe predictions regarding effects of climate change vary regionally. Are
tropical regions predicted to experience the same level of change as locations at higher latitudes?
Variability in temperatures and precipitation patterns may be more important than just changes
in the averages. The citation by Conway and Martin (2000) is fairly dated and I think there are
much better citations to include here. I think the comparison here between temperate and tropical
locations is weak.
2) Lines 75-80: Eggs can actually begin to develop at temperatures as low as 24-27 C (Webb
1987). Check out the paper by Walls et al. Auk 128:663-670 (2011) that examines the effects of
temp and incubation delay on egg viability.
3) Line 144: Give the actual months that nest boxes were monitored.
4) Lines 163-165: Here you indicate that the treatment ran for 6 days (during 26 Nov-4 Dec)
but on Page 13 and in Fig 4a (line 305) you present temps over 193 hrs or approximately 8 days.
This needs to be clarified. Even if the exposure is only 6 days, with a clutch of 4-5 eggs that
exposure time is more than what would occur naturally, right? Zebra finches begin incubating on
the penultimate or ultimate egg depending on the clutch size.
5) Line 169: So you checked for hatching just once per day? Was the time of day consistent?
You might want to indicate the time that nest were checked in the Methods.
6) Lines 230-233: Usually when AIC is used for model selection, a table of models that were
considered along with AIC values and Akaike weights is given and parameter estimates from the
top model or after model averaging are simply given and discussed in the text. These tables are
pretty confusing and don’t allow the reader to know which other models were considered and
their strength.
7) Fig 1: Why give all the individual max temperatures? I think providing a regression line
with 95% CI would be a better way to provide this information.
8) Figures: I think your use of Figs is overdone. Many of these figures are not needed and
information could be included in the text. Example: Figures 2b , 3a,b, 4b,c,d.
9) Lines 295-296: I don’t see the comparison between natural nests and nest boxes in Fig 4a.
It looks like it is a pretty meaningful difference, so I am wondering why you combined nest types
and gave results for hot vs cool? I guess you chose to use egg as your experimental unit and not
box type?
10) Lines 298-299 and 302-302: I am confused here. It doesn’t look like hot chambers spend
2.6 times more time, but on average 2.6 hours more (5.5 vs. 2.9 hrs). Same comment for the
comparison on lines 302-303: not 3.7 times as long but 3.7 hrs. Or am I just misinterpreting things
here?
11) Line 312: Your really didn’t have much of a difference in developmental time (0.4 days)
considering you were checking for hatch daily.
12) It would have been nice to have monitored nest temperatures after eggs were placed
back in nests with parents for incubation. Were incubation temps the same or different? Did you
include a potential nest effect in the analysis to account for potential variation among nests?
13) Precocial birds like ducks will begin incubation before the clutch is complete. So at the
start of full incubation there will often be developmental asynchrony of 3-4 days between the
least and most developed eggs. However, eggs laid later in the sequence develop faster so that all
eggs are able to hatch synchronously. I think potentially more interesting is whether these high
temps are influencing offspring phenotype and survival after hatch.

Comments to the Author(s)
Summary:
The development of avian eggs is sensitive to temperature variation, such that in warm climes
environmental temperature may often surpass that required for embryonic development. This is
an interesting ‘side effect’ of nesting at low latitudes that have received comparatively little
attention in the literature. To remedy this Griffith et al. measured several aspects of the thermal
environment in zebra finch nests, and also performed an experiment in which nests were placed
in either exposed or shaded locations to study the effects of nest thermal environment and length
of the incubation period. Results show that nests frequently experience temperatures in the range
of embr yonic development, and that even seemingly short-term exposure to warmer nests may
decrease the length of the incubation period. As such, this ms sheds light on a relatively neglected
aspect of avian incubation, and should be of interest to a range of ornithologists.
Overall I was quite pleased with this ms, but there are a few issues that needs the attention of the
authors. Please find below a few general comments, followed by a list of line specific remarks of a
more itemized nature. I hope you will find these useful when revising your ms.
General comments:
1. It is remarkable that eggs could withstand nest temperatures of above 50 degrees C. Would
these temperatures ever be realized in natural (i.e. non-experimental) nests? Do you have any
information on the behavior of the female and/or male in very hot days during the egg laying
period? I would assume birds nesting in exposed conditions would shade the eggs also during
laying when needed?
2. For your cold/hot nests experiment, did you ever find natural nests in the same environment?
This is an important piece of information, because the effect of temperature on the length of the
incubation period in itself is unsurprising. The interesting part of it all is (at least to me) whether
birds would preferentially build nests in hotter areas, e.g. during cold(er) season breeding) to
gain thermal benefits from solar incubation. But if birds never use these nest locations, then we
must discuss the biological relevance of this result. Please comment.
3. It is unclear if the 24 natural and 64 artificial nests (i.e. nest boxes; lines 125-127) that were
‘recently vacated’ had previously been used for rearing nestlings. I assume they had, as the
opposite was not stated (cf. Lines 151-152). It is likely that thermal conductance of nests changes
during the nestling stage from soiling and change in physical structure of the nest etc., in which
case the absolute temperatures reported here might not be relevant for nests during egg laying.
While I realize that any differences in conductance between fresh and used nests are likely
relatively small, it is important to acknowledge any potential such effects. Along these lines, it
also needs to be acknowledged that thermal properties of an empty nest and a nest with eggs
inside are likely to differ.
4. The ms does not detail whether you calibrated iButtons prior to, or after, use. These devices are
prone to between-instrument variation that might affect estimates of means (particularly for
small samples). Any such effects might be relevant in cases where one is interested in absolute
temperatures, such as when assessing the temperature tolerance of heat exposed eggs where even
small deviations of a few degrees C could be important.
17
5. While it is true that a reduction in deep body temperature could allow birds to prevent eggs
from overheating, this is also a strategy that comes at a considerable water cost (as acknowledged
by the authors). For this reason, many desert birds or birds from hot climes do the opposite – i.e.
allow body temperature to increase hyperthermia) to conserve water during incubation. This can
certainly be quite effective in terms of water conservation, but likely comes at a cost to somatic
regulation. To this end hyperthermia might represent a trade off between water supply, somatic
cost, and risk of overheating to eggs. In any event, I think you need to better acknowledge not
only that hypothermia in desert climes is very costly in terms of water balance but also, as a direct
result thereof, many birds allow body temperature to fluctuate in the opposite direction.
6. It seems to me some essential literature is not included in the ms. This concerns some of the
work on the ecophysiology, nest site selection, etc. of incubating desert birds by Williams and
Williams & Tieleman (e.g. Tieleman et al. Condor, 110, 2008; Tieleman & Williams, 2005, in Drent
et al. (eds): Seeking nature’s limits, etc.) where there might be additional insights into water- and
heat balance that could be relevant to your present work. Likewise, I think that the work on
ambient incubation in crab plovers by DeMarchi and colleagues (2008, J Avian Biol) could be
interesting to you.
Minor comments:
1. Lines 34-35: I am not quite sure I follow the link to climate change. At least with regards to
increasing global or regional temperatures the predicted temperature rate of temperature change
is such that birds should be able to adapt accordingly. For an increase in the likelihood of extreme
weather events the story is different, but it is not clear if this is what you are referring to here.
2. Line 38: Perhaps consider adding ‘nest temperature’ to the keywords?
3. Lines 78-80: I think you need to make clearer already at this point that ambient incubation need
not always be a serious threat to successful reproduction, but can in fact be beneficial in relieving
parental workload under certain circumstances (as is acknowledged in the Discussion).
4. Line 92: “…ambient temperature on the length of the incubation period.”
5. Line 116: It would be interesting to also see these data plotted separately for your study period,
as this will make it easier to evaluate results from your experiment. Perhaps A (full data set) and
B (study period) panels would be worth considering for Fig. 1?
6. Lines 279-291: Effect sizes would be helpful to better understand the nature of these effects.
7. Lines 326-330: I was intrigued by the large effect on incubation period for a relatively brief
period of ‘ambient incubation’. Could you speculate on the nature of this effect for a full
incubation period in natural nests?
8. Lines 340-343: But should not such effects already be included in estimates of hatching
asynchrony from natural nests?
9. Line 345: “…the oldest and largest…”
10. Lines 348-351: Unclear, please revise.
11. Line 359: ‘temperature logger’ rather than probe? This seems a more adequate way of
describing an iButton.
18
12. Line 618: Missing a ‘.’ in this sentence.
13. Line 641: ‘temperature logger’ likely more appropriate than ‘probe’.
14. Fig. 2A: Inclusion of a 1:1 line would be helpful when reading the graph.
15. Fig. 3A: This figure is a bit busy for my taste. Perhaps it would be worthwhile to see if
graphical display can be improved?
16. Fig. 2A, C, Fig. 3A, B, Fig. 4A: Explanatory legends in the figure panels would be helpful here.

Abstract: Tropical and sub-tropical species typically experience relatively high ambient
temperatures during reproduction, and are subject to climate-related challenges that are largely
unexplored, relative to more extensive work conducted in temperate regions. We studied the
effects of high environmental temperatures during reproduction in the zebra finch. We
characterised the microclimate of nests in a sub-tropical population of this species. Temperatures
frequently exceeded the level at which embryo’s develop optimally, even in the absence of
parental incubation. We experimentally manipulated internal nest temperature to demonstrate
that an average difference of 6° Celsius in the nest microclimate during the laying period reduced
hatching time by an average of 3% of the total incubation time, due to ‘ambient incubation’.
Given the avian constraint of laying a single egg per day, the first eggs of a clutch are subject to
prolonged effects of ambient temperature relative to later laid eggs, potentially increasing
hatching asynchrony. Whilst birds may ameliorate the negative effects of ambient incubation on
embryonic development by varying the location and design of their nests, high temperatures are
likely to constitute an important selective force on avian reproductive behaviour and physiology
in sub-tropical and tropical regions, particularly in the light of predicted climate change.

Summary:
This is a revised version of RSOS-150371 “High environmental temperatures and ’ambient
incubation’ drive embryonic development and lead to earlier hatching in a passerine bird” by
Griffith and co-workers. I was Reviewer #3 on the original submission.
General comments:
Overall authors have done a fair job in responding to the criticisms raised by myself and the other
reviewers. The revised ms has improved as a result. However, regarding my own comments
some further revision is required. Specifically:
1. With regards to iButton calibration: please add details on calibration procedures and results to
the ms. Please also clarify if you adjusted temperature recordings according to calibration results,
as should be done. In situations like this, where absolute temperatures are important, even inter-
instrument variation within 1 C could be biologically important.
2. With regards to the section on hypothermia as a means of egg cooling, there is still need for
improvement. Firstly, you need to acknowledge phylogeny here as all of the studies you cite are
for Columbiformes, whereas you have worked on a passerine. Thermal responses differ over the
avian phylogeny, so it will be important to let readers know that you are referring to non-
passerine work. Similarly, body mass varies substantially for the species you cite and the one
you have worked on, so variation in physical properties (e.g. surface area) are also likely to
introduce variation in cross-phyla differences in temperature- and water stress. Secondly, I still
think you need to acknowledge the role of hyperthermia in the thermal ecophysiology of birds in
hot climes. I find I disagree with your argument that this is not relevant for your Discussion, and
would rather argue that the addition of a few sentences on the fact that hyperthermia is not
unlikely in birds inhabiting arid climes for water scarcity reasons would make for a fuller
20
Discussion in which you could offer a potential mechanism for egg cooling and then evaluate its
likelihood based on actual physiological measurements made for small desert birds. It would not
have to be much, but I would think a short acknowledgement prudent.
3. I am still not convinced by the packaging of this study within the context of global change
biology (e.g. as in the Introduction). I see the application, but also find that climate change is far
from what you have studied here. It would be fine to mention this in passing in the Introduction,
and keep the Discussion as is. But at present the first section (lines 44-68) of the Introduction
gives the impression that this is indeed a study on climate change, a notion with which I disagree.
4. With regards to the inclusion of a 1:1 line in Fig. 2a: I still think this would make sense, because
you offer a fair bit of Discussion on the buffering of the nest structure from Ta. So showing how
the relationship between Tnest and Ta deviates from symmetry would better illustrate what you
try to convey from your Discussion. (As a side note, I would think it prudent if authors left it to
the discretion of readers to decide upon what is the main thing to take from displays.)
Moreover, while I do not like to raise new points in a revision I think you need to better motivate
your roof removal experiment. That is, we would need to know if open cup nests are ever built
by zebra finches in the wild for proper evaluation of the biological relevance of this part of the
study. If not (i.e. if open nests are never a reality to a zebra finch), I think you need to better
establish the motivation for the experiment and the importance of these results in the context of
the study objectives (perhaps by re-phrasing it in the context of consequences for open cup
nesters). If this cannot be achieved, then it might be worthwhile cutting this part from the ms. It
adds relatively little to the overall thm.
In addition, I have made the following minor remarks:
1. Line 91: This should read ‘atmospheric temperature’, because this is what you have studied.
2. Line 95: Internal temperature of what? This could refer to both eggs and nests.
3. Line 122: I see no reference to ambient temperature on, lines 123-133. Please revise the
subheading accordingly.
4. Lines 146-147: “…brood. This may affect the thermal dynamics of the nest, as would…” So:
take out ‘slightly’ from this sentence. You cannot make any claims as to the size of this effect
without actual measurement of heat flux before and after soiling.
5. Line 158: “…pre-incubation nest temperature” to avoid confusion.
6. 172: Do you know this? If not, revise to be less affirmative.
7. Line 194: “…between 8 am and 10 am.” Exclude the rest of the sentence.
8. Line 322: Fig. 3b was not included in my version of the ms.
9. Line 400: Please revise, as this may convey the message that your are not confident in your
measurement of the thermal environment for eggs.
10. Line 409: Normally, as in always? This distinction is important.
11. Line 410: Results indicate roof removal increased nest temperature. Which is correct?
21
12. Line 438: “…through evaporative cooling…”
13. Lines 449-451: Yet, your nest temperatures are for nests in natural locations?

This is a revised version of RSOS-150371 “High environmental temperatures and ’ambient

Griffith and co-workers. I was Reviewer #3 on the original submission.
General comments:
Overall authors have done a fair job in responding to the criticisms raised by myself and the other

1. With regards to iButton calibration: please add details on calibration procedures and results to

as should be done. In situations like this, where absolute temperatures are important, even inter-
instrument variation within 1 C could be biologically important.
2. With regards to the section on hypothermia as a means of egg cooling, there is still need for
improvement. Firstly, you need to acknowledge phylogeny here as all of the studies you cite are
for Columbiformes, whereas you have worked on a passerine. Thermal responses differ over the
avian phylogeny, so it will be important to let readers know that you are referring to non-
passerine work. Similarly, body mass varies substantially for the species you cite and the one
you have worked on, so variation in physical properties (e.g. surface area) are also likely to
introduce variation in cross-phyla differences in temperature- and water stress. Secondly, I still
think you need to acknowledge the role of hyperthermia in the thermal ecophysiology of birds in
hot climes. I find I disagree with your argument that this is not relevant for your Discussion, and
would rather argue that the addition of a few sentences on the fact that hyperthermia is not
unlikely in birds inhabiting arid climes for water scarcity reasons would make for a fuller
Discussion in which you could offer a potential mechanism for egg cooling and then evaluate its
likelihood based on actual physiological measurements made for small desert birds. It would not
have to be much, but I would think a short acknowledgement prudent.
3. I am still not convinced by the packaging of this study within the context of global change
biology (e.g. as in the Introduction). I see the application, but also find that climate change is far
from what you have studied here. It would be fine to mention this in passing in the Introduction,
and keep the Discussion as is. But at present the first section (lines 44-68) of the Introduction
gives the impression that this is indeed a study on climate change, a notion with which I disagree.
4. With regards to the inclusion of a 1:1 line in Fig. 2a: I still think this would make sense, because
you offer a fair bit of Discussion on the buffering of the nest structure from Ta. So showing how
the relationship between Tnest and Ta deviates from symmetry would better illustrate what you
try to convey from your Discussion. (As a side note, I would think it prudent if authors left it to
the discretion of readers to decide upon what is the main thing to take from displays.)
Moreover, while I do not like to raise new points in a revision I think you need to better motivate
your roof removal experiment. That is, we would need to know if open cup nests are ever built
by zebra finches in the wild for proper evaluation of the biological relevance of this part of the
26
study. If not (i.e. if open nests are never a reality to a zebra finch), I think you need to better
establish the motivation for the experiment and the importance of these results in the context of
the study objectives (perhaps by re-phrasing it in the context of consequences for open cup
nesters). If this cannot be achieved, then it might be worthwhile cutting this part from the ms. It
adds relatively little to the overall thm.
In addition, I have made the following minor remarks:
1. Line 91: This should read ‘atmospheric temperature’, because this is what you have studied.
2. Line 95: Internal temperature of what? This could refer to both eggs and nests.
3. Line 122: I see no reference to ambient temperature on, lines 123-133. Please revise the
subheading accordingly.
4. Lines 146-147: “…brood. This may affect the thermal dynamics of the nest, as would…” So:
take out ‘slightly’ from this sentence. You cannot make any claims as to the size of this effect
without actual measurement of heat flux before and after soiling.
5. Line 158: “…pre-incubation nest temperature” to avoid confusion.
6. 172: Do you know this? If not, revise to be less affirmative.
7. Line 194: “…between 8 am and 10 am.” Exclude the rest of the sentence.
8. Line 322: Fig. 3b was not included in my version of the ms.
9. Line 400: Please revise, as this may convey the message that your are not confident in your
measurement of the thermal environment for eggs.
10. Line 409: Normally, as in always? This distinction is important.
11. Line 410: Results indicate roof removal increased nest temperature. Which is correct?
12. Line 438: “…through evaporative cooling…”
13. Lines 449-451: Yet, your nest temperatures are for nests in natural locations?

Abstract: Tropical and sub-tropical species typically experience relatively high atmospheric
temperatures during reproduction, and are subject to climate-related challenges that are largely
unexplored, relative to more extensive work conducted in temperate regions. We studied the
effects of high atmospheric and nest temperatures during reproduction in the zebra finch. We
characterised the temperature within nests in a sub-tropical population of this species in relation
to atmospheric temperature. Temperatures within nests frequently exceeded the level at which
embryo’s develop optimally, even in the absence of parental incubation. We experimentally
manipulated internal nest temperature to demonstrate that an average difference of 6° Celsius in
the nest temperature during the laying period reduced hatching time by an average of 3% of the
total incubation time, due to ‘ambient incubation’. Given the avian constraint of laying a single
egg per day, the first eggs of a clutch are subject to prolonged effects of nest temperature relative
to later laid eggs, potentially increasing hatching asynchrony. Whilst birds may ameliorate the
negative effects of ambient incubation on embryonic development by varying the location and
design of their nests, high temperatures are likely to constitute an important selective force on
avian reproductive behaviour and physiology in sub-tropical and tropical regions, particularly in
the light of predicted climate change that in many areas is leading to a higher frequency of hot
days during the periods when birds breed.

Comments to the Author:
An interesting manuscript. Three reviewers have commented on it, and their comprehensive reviews
should be attached: there's a lot of sound advice within them, and I'd advise careful revision to address
their concerns (in particular about the details of iButton deployment, the relation between the
experimental and natural nests and their sample sizes, and the fit of the manuscript into the wider
literature). Could you also give exact p values in the tables (plus indicate dfs for the t values).
Pay particular attention to reviewer #2's suggestion about presenting AICs (maybe with supplementary
information, if you don't want to overload the manuscript), and consider whether you can move a few
of the figures into supplementary information, as you don't want to overload the message you present
in the main manuscript. Figure 3a is particularly noisy, and could probably lose the lettering of the top
and bottom grey values without losing readability.
Yes we have now specified all candidate models and their AIC scores in supplementary tables. We have
also removed the lettering from Figure 3 as suggested.

High environmental temperatures and ‘ambient incubation’ drive embryonic development and lead to
earlier hatching in a passerine bird
Griffith et al.
Reviewed by Davina L. Hill, SRUC, UK
OVERVIEW
This is an interesting and timely study on the thermal environment experienced by zebra finch eggs
before parental incubation in the semi-arid zone of south-eastern Australia. Data consist of temperature
and biological (e.g. time to hatching) measurements collected by the research team in the field, as well
as records from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s Automated Weather Station. The main finding
is that atmospheric and nest temperatures recorded in the study often fell within the range of
temperatures considered optimal for embryonic development (a phenomenon they refer to as ‘ambient
incubation’). Moreover, temperatures regularly exceeded this range. The authors used a simple
experiment (comparing different nest types placed in the sun or the shade) to show that ambient
incubation can shorten developmental time. They discuss the potential implications of ambient
incubation for hatching asynchrony. I also think the study might also be useful from an applied
perspective, with potential to help inform design and placement of nestboxes. The text is engagingly-
written and structured logically and there are few errors with language. I think that this paper would
make a valuable contribution to Royal Society Open Science. I have a number of suggestions for
improvement, but think that these can be addressed without much difficulty.
COMMENTS
1) The clarity of the manuscript could be improved by making sure that terminology is defined and
used in a consistent way. In the Introduction, the authors seem to use environmental temperature,
atmospheric temperature and ambient temperature interchangeably at times (example below), and at
other times they seem to imply distinct meanings.
‘for temperate species … ambient temperatures typically range between an average of 5 to 20°C [8].
By
58 contrast, birds breeding in tropical and sub-tropical regions typically breed …
59 … when atmospheric temperatures may range between -5 and 45°C’
These three terms should be defined at first mention if they refer to different things. Ambient
temperature is later described in the Methods (L116-120), but the term seems to have a different
meaning in the Introduction. Also I suggest avoiding the term nest microclimate when referring
specifically to nest temperature (e.g. L89-90, 91, 134 etc). Microclimate comprises several variables
(e.g. humidity, which can also influence embryonic development), so I find it misleading to say ‘We
characterised the microclimate of nests in a sub-tropical population’ (L24) when only temperature was
measured.
Yes, we completely agree that we had been inconsistent and this lacked clarity. We have now only used
‘ambient’ when referring to ‘ambient incubation’ (which we have defined). We have now been much
more specific and now only refer to ‘atmospheric temperature’, ‘nest temperature’ and ‘location
temperature’. We have removed all mentions of environmental, or ambient conditions as these were too
vague.
2) L104-106 I’d like to see a little more information on the breeding ecology of the zebra finch
under natural conditions. This would give the reader more background for understanding the choice of
methods and interpreting the results (e.g. the incubation span, when incubation begins in relation to
laying, when breeding occurs at the study site, that the species is a biparental incubator etc).
Yes we agree this is useful and have now added some additional information in the introduction to
provide this background.
3) L181 ‘multiple observations from the same site and from the same day were modelled’
What are sites (regions? nests?) I’d be interested to see (in the section on fieldwork) how many sites
were surveyed and how far away they were from each other (mean, SE and range, or approximate
figures if these were not measured). This would give an idea of the spatial scale surveyed and how
spatially independent sites were.
We agree and have now added this extra detail to the methods section. We have also indicated the level
at which we were interested in exploring variation to help clarify this.
4) L203 This paragraph describes analysis of a time series of eight 24h periods for 4 nests. Was
there any evidence of temporal autocorrelation?
Yes, there was indeed temporal autocorrelation between these nests but the statistical non-
independence of these chambers was accounted for by using “day” as a random intercept in the
model (see Table S3a).
5) How were contrasts between different levels of factors carried out (e.g. Tukey tests)?
We did not calculate contrasts between levels and instead let readers judge differences between levels
from the provided means and SE (e.g. as shown in figures). Philosophically we are opposed to doing
formal contrast analysis for a number of reasons. First, we adopted an Information Theoretical
Approach based on AIC (e. see Burnham & Andersson 2002, and multiple papers on multimodel
inference), and not a classical Null hypothesis testing approach under which contrasts are carried out.
Second, many factors were obtained by discretising continuous variables (e.g. time of day and nest
orientation were originally measured continuously), and there is a degree of arbitrariness on how
Factor levels were defined, so we don’t see much value in testing the significance of differences
between, for example the period 6-12.00 versus 12-18.00.
6) Please provide standard errors or standard deviations with means (e.g. L263-274, ranges can be
kept).
We agree that these should be added and have now done so.
7) The sample of nests used is small for some of the experiments. The repeated-measures designs
seem to provide good statistical power, but I’d like to see some consideration of how representative the
experimental nests were.
We agree that the sample size for this component of the work is relatively small. The experimental nests
represent fairly normal levels of natural variation in nest temperature. Our data show that typical nest
temperatures vary between 2 degrees cooler and 2 degrees hotter than atmospheric temperature and
this is typically determined by the atmospheric conditions and the position of the nest. Therefore the
experiment nests were placed to represent the cooler and hotter end of the ‘natural’ spectrum, but not
exceed that. The atmospheric conditions during the period of the manipulation are also representative
of the typical temperatures found in November and December as shown by a new consideration of the
long-term BOM data. We have added the following to the methods section:
“The average daily maximum temperature during this period was 37.27°C (± 6.1 SD). This period is
representative of the maximum daily temperatures recorded during November and December over
the longer term data provided by BOM for this area (shown in Figure 1), and the average daily
maximum temperature is equivalent to the 80% quantile.”
8) I’d be curious to know to what extent zebra finches locate nests in shaded areas or orientate their
nests to a certain direction under natural conditions. Or perhaps this is a topic for a future study?
We agree this is an interesting question and indeed have specified in the Discussion:
“The extent to which nest orientation may vary across a season with increasing atmospheric
temperatures is an open question, and one that is worth investigating given the effects that we have
demonstrated here.”
Unfortunately we did not collect data on the degree of shading for different nests which would
require more intense measurement throughout the day. Both that and the question regarding
orientation will be the focus of future work.
9) I suggest including the R scripts as Supplementary Material. This would further improve
transparency and be a useful resource for researchers working on similar questions.
We have now included all of the R scripts as Supplementary Material.
SPECIFIC COMMENTS
ABSTRACT
‘Temperatures frequently
25 exceeded the level at which embryo’s develop optimally’
Please specify whether you mean atmospheric or nest temperature.
Yes, done
L32-33 It would be clearer to say ‘atmospheric temperatures’ rather than just temperatures.
Yes, done
INTRODUCTION
L78 ‘ambient incubation is likely to affect many avian species’
Do you mean affect or just that they will experience it? As far as I’m aware this is the first study to test
whether ambient incubation actually affects embryonic development. Also L84-87.
Yes, have replaced with ‘may’, and possibly respectively.
L82-83 ‘atmospheric temperatures regularly exceed 36°C, the threshold at which eggs are typically
incubated’
The second part of this sentence is ambiguous. Perhaps rephrase to ‘...36°C, the lower threshold for
optimum embryonic development’.
Yes changed.
METHODS
L107 Avoid using only ‘station’ – you describe both a Research Station and a Weather Station.
Yes, done
L104-106 Move species information to the end of this section so that location information is together.
Yes, done
L114 State whether atmospheric temperatures were recorded in the shade?
Yes, done
L124 I suggest the subtitle ‘Nest temperature’ for consistency with the previous subtitle.
Yes, done
L125 I assume you used one iButton per nest (no repeated measures)?
Yes and now clarified.
L158 Add company name and place for Fimo clay, and (L163) move company details for iButtons to
where iButtons were first mentioned
Yes, done both.
L175 Give the version of R used (edit the year in the references if necessary).
Yes, done.
L229 ‘Maximal initial models, including all of the explanatory variables and all of
229 their interaction terms (one-way and two-way)’
What do you mean by a ‘one-way’ interaction term?
Apologies, this was a mistake and we have now corrected to Two-Way interaction.
RESULTS
L243, 384 Pluralise ‘data’.
Yes, done
L253, 258, 265, 286, 381 Habitat locations were not really ‘random’ as some were selected on the basis
of being suitable nest sites for zebra finches (L118-119).
Agreed and we have now removed the use of ‘random’ in this context.
DISCUSSION
L409-414 Keeping eggs cool using evaporative cooling is also likely to be a challenge in moist tropical
climates because the humidity limits the effectiveness of evaporative processes.
Yes, agreed and we have added a note to this effect.
L418 ‘parents are able to adaptively adjust their investment in eggs’
This is a bit vague. Do you mean maternal investment into the egg before laying (vs. behavioural
adjustments by both parents after laying, discussed in the previous paragraph)?
Yes, we have now clarified this
‘development time varied
421 with laying order (but not in a consistent…way)’
Please explain this statement more clearly or remove it.
Yes we have removed this.
L431 An interesting point that you touch upon here and in L266-368 is the idea that optimum
incubation temperatures and lethal thresholds might vary between species, and that species that evolved
in warm environments might have higher optima. The optimum might also depend on humidity.
Yes agreed.
REFERENCES
Please correct citations 20 and 22.
Done.
TABLES
L558, 587 ‘*’ doesn’t occur in Table 1 or 2 so it’s not necessary to define it in the legend.
Done
‘All
559 factors (dummy binary variables)’
This should be briefly explained in the Methods as well as here in the legend.
Yes, done.
Please indicate which levels of the two factors were used as reference levels in the legends (e.g. night
and vegetation) so the reader can see what comparisons are being made without returning to the text.
Yes, done.

Comments to the Author(s)
Manuscript ID: RSOS-150371
Authors; S. Griffith, E. Sorato, M. Mainwaring, and C. Beckmann
I found the manuscript regarding effects of high ambient temperatures on early development of zebra
finch embryos interesting and fairly well-written. My specific comments can be found below.
1) Lines 52-63: I believe predictions regarding effects of climate change vary regionally. Are
tropical regions predicted to experience the same level of change as locations at higher latitudes?
Variability in temperatures and precipitation patterns may be more important than just changes in the
averages. The citation by Conway and Martin (2000) is fairly dated and I think there are much better
citations to include here. I think the comparison here between temperate and tropical locations is weak.
The Conway and Martin (2000) paper is cited because it is to our knowledge the only paper that has
addressed the conceptual ideas that are important and that we are considering in our study. We have
done a lot of literature work and particularly have read all of the more recent papers that cited
Conway & Martin’s paper. In the revision we have now included the following new references: Ardia
et al. 2006; Beissenger et al. 2005; De Marchi et al. 2008; Londoño et al. 2008; Tieleman et al. 2008;
Mougeot et al. 2014; Shibuya et al. 2014.
With regard to the second point raised by the referee, we agree that it is difficult to compare tropical
and temperate species, and indeed this is not our aim. In this paper we are only trying to raise
awareness of the fact that temperate and tropical systems will differ in the average temperatures they
are subjected to. We believe that what we have written about different temperatures in these regions is
fairly uncontroversial, but also important in introducing our work.
2) Lines 75-80: Eggs can actually begin to develop at temperatures as low as 24-27 C (Webb 1987).
We agree and are familiar with that paper (which we have cited). We have been careful to identify the
temperatures we have discussed as being those for ‘optimal’ levels of embryonic development and
indeed that is as specified by Webb (1987).
3) Line 144: Give the actual months that nest boxes were monitored.
OK added.
4) Lines 163-165: Here you indicate that the treatment ran for 6 days (during 26 Nov-4 Dec) but on
Page 13 and in Fig 4a (line 305) you present temps over 193 hrs or approximately 8 days. This needs to
be clarified. Even if the exposure is only 6 days, with a clutch of 4-5 eggs that exposure time is more
than what would occur naturally, right? Zebra finches begin incubating on the penultimate or ultimate
egg depending on the clutch size.
We agree that this may have been confusing and have now clarified this in the methods. The trial was
conducted during a nine day period (as nominated). However for each clutch (depending on the clutch
size) the treatment varied and was only the length that the clutch size would have determined. i.e. eggs
were put back in the nest the day after the last egg was laid. Therefore the treatment was normal and
no eggs were subjected to the nominated period of nine days.
5) Line 169: So you checked for hatching just once per day? Was the time of day consistent? You
might want to indicate the time that nest were checked in the Methods.
Yes, the time of day was relatively consistent (between 8 and 10am) and this detail has been added into
the methods.
6) Lines 230-233: Usually when AIC is used for model selection, a table of models that were
considered along with AIC values and Akaike weights is given and parameter estimates from the top
model or after model averaging are simply given and discussed in the text. These tables are pretty
confusing and don’t allow the reader to know which other models were considered and their strength.
Yes, we agree with this and we have now provided all models and their AIC scores as supplementary
material. We have also clarified in methods that all remaining candidate models had AIC scores >5
compared to best models, and therefore had little support.
7) Fig 1: Why give all the individual max temperatures? I think providing a regression line with
95% CI would be a better way to provide this information.
We have presented the raw values and not average estimates as the focus here was on the range of
variation in atmospheric temperatures. Particularly the occurrence of extreme maximum daily
temperatures given their implication for incubation. Eggs are obviously affected by daily values and
not averaged effects.
8) Figures: I think your use of Figs is overdone. Many of these figures are not needed and
information could be included in the text. Example: Figures 2b , 3a,b, 4b,c,d.
Yes we agree that there were a lot of figures and have reviewed all figures and have reduced the
number. Significantly as well as editing Fig 3a as suggested by the editor. We removed the former Fig
2b and therefore 2c becomes the new 2b. We have also removed Figs 4b and 4c.
9) Lines 295-296: I don’t see the comparison between natural nests and nest boxes in Fig 4a. It
looks like it is a pretty meaningful difference, so I am wondering why you combined nest types and
gave results for hot vs cool? I guess you chose to use egg as your experimental unit and not box type?
We agree that this effect was not illustrated in Fig 4a and have now omitted that. We also agree that
the referee is correct in stating that we focused on experimental chamber type (hot or cool versus
natural and nest box), because the affect of the former was so much stronger (and indicated in the
text).
10) Lines 298-299 and 302-302: I am confused here. It doesn’t look like hot chambers spend 2.6
times more time, but on average 2.6 hours more (5.5 vs. 2.9 hrs). Same comment for the comparison on
lines 302-303: not 3.7 times as long but 3.7 hrs. Or am I just misinterpreting things here?
Yes, we agree that we made an error there and have now corrected it in the text to state that the
chambers were hot for 2.6 hours longer.
11) Line 312: Your really didn’t have much of a difference in developmental time (0.4 days)
considering you were checking for hatch daily.
We agree that this does not seem like a big difference but as discussed in the discussion this can be a
significant amount on average given the relatively short duration of development.
12) It would have been nice to have monitored nest temperatures after eggs were placed back in
nests with parents for incubation. Were incubation temps the same or different? Did you include a
potential nest effect in the analysis to account for potential variation among nests?
Yes, nest of origin was fitted as a random intercept term to account for the non-independence of eggs
originating from the same nest.
13) Precocial birds like ducks will begin incubation before the clutch is complete. So at the start of
full incubation there will often be developmental asynchrony of 3-4 days between the least and most
developed eggs. However, eggs laid later in the sequence develop faster so that all eggs are able to
hatch synchronously. I think potentially more interesting is whether these high temps are influencing
offspring phenotype and survival after hatch.
Yes we completely agree and we are now focusing on post-hatching effects in new and ongoing work.

Comments to the Author(s)
Summary:
The development of avian eggs is sensitive to temperature variation, such that in warm climes
environmental temperature may often surpass that required for embryonic development. This is an
interesting ‘side effect’ of nesting at low latitudes that have received comparatively little attention in
the literature. To remedy this Griffith et al. measured several aspects of the thermal environment in
zebra finch nests, and also performed an experiment in which nests were placed in either exposed or
shaded locations to study the effects of nest thermal environment and length of the incubation period.
Results show that nests frequently experience temperatures in the range of embr yonic development,
and that even seemingly short-term exposure to warmer nests may decrease the length of the incubation
period. As such, this ms sheds light on a relatively neglected aspect of avian incubation, and should be
of interest to a range of ornithologists.
Overall I was quite pleased with this ms, but there are a few issues that needs the attention of the
authors. Please find below a few general comments, followed by a list of line specific remarks of a
more itemized nature. I hope you will find these useful when revising your ms.
General comments:
1. It is remarkable that eggs could withstand nest temperatures of above 50 degrees C. Would these
temperatures ever be realized in natural (i.e. non-experimental) nests? Do you have any information on
the behavior of the female and/or male in very hot days during the egg laying period? I would assume
birds nesting in exposed conditions would shade the eggs also during laying when needed?
Yes, we agree. Yes we believe that these temperatures will be regularly realised in natural nests. The
hot experimental chambers were designed to represent the ‘hot’ end of the continuum in natural nests
and those in nest boxes. As explained in the methods they were normal nests that had been built by
birds and were placed in positions exposed to the sun, but no more so than some of the other nests in
our study sight. The changes we have to the methods should now make this clearer (in response to
issues raised by Refereee 1). Unfortunately we don’t have any information on female behaviour in
these hot conditions, but earlier work at this site (in which nests were videoed intensively during the
laying period), found no evidence of females staying in nests for long periods during this phase of
reproduction (although that work was not conducted during hot conditions. We agree that this is
worthy of further investigation and have stated as much in the discussion.
2. For your cold/hot nests experiment, did you ever find natural nests in the same environment? This is
an important piece of information, because the effect of temperature on the length of the incubation
period in itself is unsurprising. The interesting part of it all is (at least to me) whether birds would
preferentially build nests in hotter areas, e.g. during cold(er) season breeding) to gain thermal benefits
from solar incubation. But if birds never use these nest locations, then we must discuss the biological
relevance of this result. Please comment.
As stated above the experimental hot and cool nests were erected in the same environment as natural
nests, and were put there deliberately to represent the normal variation seen in natural nesting
positions. We have clarified this in the methods section.
We agree with the second point and again have suggested in the discussion that this is an interesting
question for further investigation.
3. It is unclear if the 24 natural and 64 artificial nests (i.e. nest boxes; lines 125-127) that were ‘recently
vacated’ had previously been used for rearing nestlings. I assume they had, as the opposite was not
stated (cf. Lines 151-152). It is likely that thermal conductance of nests changes during the nestling
stage from soiling and change in physical structure of the nest etc., in which case the absolute
temperatures reported here might not be relevant for nests during egg laying. While I realize that any
differences in conductance between fresh and used nests are likely relatively small, it is important to
acknowledge any potential such effects. Along these lines, it also needs to be acknowledged that
thermal properties of an empty nest and a nest with eggs inside are likely to differ.
Yes, we agree with this point and have now added a line to make this clear and also add the caveat that
the thermal properties may differ slightly from clean nests with eggs in. We also agree that such effects
are likely to be relatively small.
4. The ms does not detail whether you calibrated iButtons prior to, or after, use. These devices are
prone to between-instrument variation that might affect estimates of means (particularly for small
samples). Any such effects might be relevant in cases where one is interested in absolute temperatures,
such as when assessing the temperature tolerance of heat exposed eggs where even small deviations of
a few degrees C could be important.
All of the iButtons were checked prior to use and were all found to be giving the same reading across
the range of temperatures observed in this work (within a single degree Celsius).
5. While it is true that a reduction in deep body temperature could allow birds to prevent eggs from
overheating, this is also a strategy that comes at a considerable water cost (as acknowledged by the
authors). For this reason, many desert birds or birds from hot climes do the opposite – i.e. allow body
temperature to increase hyperthermia) to conserve water during incubation. This can certainly be quite
effective in terms of water conservation, but likely comes at a cost to somatic regulation. To this end
hyperthermia might represent a trade off between water supply, somatic cost, and risk of overheating to
eggs. In any event, I think you need to better acknowledge not only that hypothermia in desert climes is
very costly in terms of water balance but also, as a direct result thereof, many birds allow body
temperature to fluctuate in the opposite direction.
These are interesting points with respect to the thermal physiology of adult birds but it isn’t directly
relevant to our discussion which should necessarily focus on adaptations that can prevent over-heating
of eggs. In the interests of keeping our discussion as tight as possible we have refrained from adding
this discussion point.
6. It seems to me some essential literature is not included in the ms. This concerns some of the work on
the ecophysiology, nest site selection, etc. of incubating desert birds by Williams and Williams &
Tieleman (e.g. Tieleman et al. Condor, 110, 2008; Tieleman & Williams, 2005, in Drent et al. (eds):
Seeking nature’s limits, etc.) where there might be additional insights into water- and heat balance that
could be relevant to your present work. Likewise, I think that the work on ambient incubation in crab
plovers by DeMarchi and colleagues (2008, J Avian Biol) could be interesting to you.
We did include discussion of many of these papers in earlier drafts of the manuscripts, but cut them out
in order to keep the discussion tighter and more focused. We have put those earlier sections back now
and referred to some of this work to redress the deficiency identified by the referee. In the revision we
have now included the following new references: Ardia et al. 2006; Beissenger et al. 2005; De Marchi
et al. 2008; Tieleman et al. 2008; Mougeot et al. 2014; Shibuya et al. 2014; Londoño et al. 2008.
Minor comments:
1. Lines 34-35: I am not quite sure I follow the link to climate change. At least with regards to
increasing global or regional temperatures the predicted temperature rate of temperature change is such
that birds should be able to adapt accordingly. For an increase in the likelihood of extreme weather
events the story is different, but it is not clear if this is what you are referring to here.
We have added ‘particularly in the light of predicted climate change that in many areas is leading to
a higher frequency of hot days during the periods when birds breed’. That should make the link
clearer.
2. Line 38: Perhaps consider adding ‘nest temperature’ to the keywords?
Yes, we have now done so.
3. Lines 78-80: I think you need to make clearer already at this point that ambient incubation need not
always be a serious threat to successful reproduction, but can in fact be beneficial in relieving parental
workload under certain circumstances (as is acknowledged in the Discussion).
Yes, we have now added “although there may also be benefits of breeding in warmer conditions”
at the end of this sentence.
4. Line 92: “…ambient temperature on the length of the incubation period.”
We have left this as it is because the ‘length of the incubation period’ has caused lots of confusion to
referees of previous manuscripts. As they have rightly pointed out in the past this phrase could refer to
the period of parental incubation behaviour. We have however adjusted it to “parental incubation to
quantify the effect of nest temperature on the period required for eggs to hatch”, which should
hopefully sort out the problem.
5. Line 116: It would be interesting to also see these data plotted separately for your study period, as
this will make it easier to evaluate results from your experiment. Perhaps A (full data set) and B (study
period) panels would be worth considering for Fig. 1?
Most of the referees wanted us to simplify and reduce the number of figures and therefore we have
refrained from making this change. However in response to comments from referee 1 we have now
added the important contextual information that will help to place the heat during the study period in
the broader context.
6. Lines 279-291: Effect sizes would be helpful to better understand the nature of these effects.
We agree have now added effect sizes wherever possible in the results section.
7. Lines 326-330: I was intrigued by the large effect on incubation period for a relatively brief period
of ‘ambient incubation’. Could you speculate on the nature of this effect for a full incubation period in
natural nests?
Not quite sure what the question is here. Some of the eggs were subject to up to five days of ambient
incubatin which is not a brief period given the incubation period (by the parents) is only about 12 days
long. As already clarified in response to comments from other referee’s
8. Lines 340-343: But should not such effects already be included in estimates of hatching asynchrony
from natural nests?
Yes, we have now added effect sizes were we could.
9. Line 345: “…the oldest and largest…”
Yes, changed.
10. Lines 348-351: Unclear, please revise.
We have now deleted this whole sentence to improve clarity.
11. Line 359: ‘temperature logger’ rather than probe? This seems a more adequate way of describing
an iButton.
Yes, we have replaced probe with iButton.
12. Line 618: Missing a ‘.’ in this sentence.
Yes, fixed.
13. Line 641: ‘temperature logger’ likely more appropriate than ‘probe’.
Yes, fixed
14. Fig. 2A: Inclusion of a 1:1 line would be helpful when reading the graph.
Other referees and editor requested us to remove as much clutter from graphs as possible and
therefore we have refrained from drawing this additional line which would not help clarity much
anyway. The main thing to take from this graph is the linear increase and the difference between types
of nest.
15. Fig. 3A: This figure is a bit busy for my taste. Perhaps it would be worthwhile to see if graphical
display can be improved?
Yes, we have removed most of the labelling on the graph now.
16. Fig. 2A, C, Fig. 3A, B, Fig. 4A: Explanatory legends in the figure panels would be helpful here.
Again we don’t want to make the graphs any more busy and have not added legends. Most of these
figures have now been omitted on the advice of editor and other referee.

High environmental temperatures and ‘ambient incubation’ drive embryonic
development and lead to earlier hatching in a passerine bird
By Griffith et al.
Reviewed by Davina L. Hill
COMMENTS
The authors have addressed my concerns, and the revised version is clearer and
easier to follow. I particularly appreciate the new supplementary material,
including scripts for the analyses, and tables of candidate models.
Specific comments:
You ‘removed all mentions of environmental, or ambient conditions as these
were too vague’. The term ‘environmental temperature’ should also be
substituted in the title.
Yes OK we have now done this
L33-34 It would be clearer to say ‘high atmospheric temperatures’ rather than
just ‘high temperatures’.
Yes, done.
L116 Delete the second ‘years’.
Yes, done.
L119 State how many days parents incubate in this species.
Yes done.
L341-6 Please give estimates of variability around the means.
Yes, have now added standard errors.
L348 Please clarify what interactions you’re referring to here (e.g. refer to Supp.
Tables).
Yes, done.

Summary:
This is a revised version of RSOS-150371 “High environmental temperatures and
’ambient incubation’ drive embryonic development and lead to earlier hatching
in a passerine bird” by Griffith and co-workers. I was Reviewer #3 on the
original submission.
General comments:
Overall authors have done a fair job in responding to the criticisms raised by
myself and the other reviewers. The revised ms has improved as a result.
However, regarding my own comments some further revision is required.
Specifically:
1. With regards to iButton calibration: please add details on calibration
procedures and results to the ms. Please also clarify if you adjusted temperature
recordings according to calibration results, as should be done. In situations like
this, where absolute temperatures are important, even inter-instrument
variation within 1 C could be biologically important.
Yes, we agree that this was not clear and we have now added a section in
the methods to indicate the way we checked the quality of data coming
degrees and we did not correct for this.
2. With regards to the section on hypothermia as a means of egg cooling, there is
still need for improvement. Firstly, you need to acknowledge phylogeny here as
all of the studies you cite are for Columbiformes, whereas you have worked on a
passerine. Thermal responses differ over the avian phylogeny, so it will be
important to let readers know that you are referring to non-passerine
work. Similarly, body mass varies substantially for the species you cite and the
one you have worked on, so variation in physical properties (e.g. surface area)
are also likely to introduce variation in cross-phyla differences in temperature-
and water stress.
Yes we have now added a few sentences to make these points.
Secondly, I still think you need to acknowledge the role of hyperthermia in the
thermal ecophysiology of birds in hot climes. I find I disagree with your
argument that this is not relevant for your Discussion, and would rather argue
that the addition of a few sentences on the fact that hyperthermia is not unlikely
in birds inhabiting arid climes for water scarcity reasons would make for a fuller
Discussion in which you could offer a potential mechanism for egg cooling and
then evaluate its likelihood based on actual physiological measurements made
for small desert birds. It would not have to be much, but I would think a short
acknowledgement prudent.
Yes, agreed and we have now added a few sentences to this effect.
3. I am still not convinced by the packaging of this study within the context of
global change biology (e.g. as in the Introduction). I see the application, but also
find that climate change is far from what you have studied here. It would be fine
to mention this in passing in the Introduction, and keep the Discussion as is. But
at present the first section (lines 44-68) of the Introduction gives the impression
that this is indeed a study on climate change, a notion with which I disagree.
Yes, we agree that this could be toned down and indeed have now removed
any reference to ‘climate change’. Instead we have instead focused our
introductory argument on the importance of understanding how climate
and climatic variation are likely to affect avian reproduction. Our study is
certainly focused on the effect of an important component of climatic
variation (atmospheric temperature) on reproduction and therefore we
hope that the changes we have now made are appropriate.
4. With regards to the inclusion of a 1:1 line in Fig. 2a: I still think this would
make sense, because you offer a fair bit of Discussion on the buffering of the nest
structure from Ta. So showing how the relationship between Tnest and Ta
deviates from symmetry would better illustrate what you try to convey from
your Discussion. (As a side note, I would think it prudent if authors left it to the
discretion of readers to decide upon what is the main thing to take from
displays.)
OK, we have now added this line onto this Figure. We had been wary of
the initial submission was that our figures were too busy and we made
efforts to reduce the complexity of many of them.
Moreover, while I do not like to raise new points in a revision I think you need to
better motivate your roof removal experiment. That is, we would need to know if
open cup nests are ever built by zebra finches in the wild for proper evaluation
of the biological relevance of this part of the study. If not (i.e. if open nests are
never a reality to a zebra finch), I think you need to better establish the
motivation for the experiment and the importance of these results in the context
of the study objectives (perhaps by re-phrasing it in the context of consequences
for open cup nesters). If this cannot be achieved, then it might be worthwhile
cutting this part from the ms. It adds relatively little to the overall thm.
Yes, we agree that this needed better justification. By removing the roof of
these nests we were absolutely going outside of the normal zebra finch nest
to ask the question in an experimental way of how much is the roof
contributing to the internal nest temperature. It is only by exceeding
natural variation that we can often get insight into the ultimate cause of
that variation (for example the very classic tail lengthening experiments in
the widowbird by Andersson (1982). We have now provided a better
justification for this component of the work in the introduction and added
an additional sentence in our discussion of this point.
In addition, I have made the following minor remarks:
1. Line 91: This should read ‘atmospheric temperature’, because this is what you
have studied.
Yes, changed
2. Line 95: Internal temperature of what? This could refer to both eggs and nests.
Yes, clarified that this is nest temperature.
3. Line 122: I see no reference to ambient temperature on, lines 123-133. Please
revise the subheading accordingly.
Yes, changed to Atmospheric and environmental temperatures
4. Lines 146-147: “…brood. This may affect the thermal dynamics of the nest, as
would…” So: take out ‘slightly’ from this sentence. You cannot make any claims
as to the size of this effect without actual measurement of heat flux before and
after soiling.
OK removed ‘slightly’.
5. Line 158: “…pre-incubation nest temperature” to avoid confusion.
Yes, have added ‘nest’
6. 172: Do you know this? If not, revise to be less affirmative.
OK, we have modified this.
7. Line 194: “…between 8 am and 10 am.” Exclude the rest of the sentence.
OK, deleted the rest.
8. Line 322: Fig. 3b was not included in my version of the ms.
OK, not sure why this is. I can see it in the checked version of the
resubmitted PDF and have also ensured that it is present in the final
revised version.
9. Line 400: Please revise, as this may convey the message that your are not
confident in your measurement of the thermal environment for eggs.
OK have deleted that qualifying statement.
10. Line 409: Normally, as in always? This distinction is important.
Yes, agreed and have deleted ‘normally’
11. Line 410: Results indicate roof removal increased nest temperature. Which is
correct?
Yes, agreed this was an error and an important one to pick up. Have
changed ‘decreases’ to ‘increases’. Thanks.
12. Line 438: “…through evaporative cooling…”
OK, have changed this now.
13. Lines 449-451: Yet, your nest temperatures are for nests in natural locations?
Yes, we have added an additional sentence here to clarify exactly what we
mean.
