The authors report on a sintering temperature effect on a type of material for NO2 sensing
application. The NO2 sensor is composed of YSZ with WO3 as the electrode for the sensing
measurements. The novelty of this study comes from the connection between the temperature
effect and material system combination (YSZ + WO3 + NO2). SEM is used to understand the
surface morphology along with standard sensing and EIS measurements. I do appreciate that
authors connect the fundamental diffusion and reaction mechanisms to the surface morphology
and voltage changes. Overall, the work has reached a decent level of novelty, but more
understanding about the data sets should be included in the content. As such, I recommend that
this work be published in Royal Society Open Science after the following major revisions:
1. The voltage responses are similar between 800 and 850C sintered data at the operating
temperature 500C in Figure 5a. However, the responses are lage between 800 and 850C sintered
data at the operating temperature 550 and 600C in Figure 5b and 5c. Can authors explain more in
the manuscript?
2. All voltage responses data in Figure 6a-6c have the non-zero y-intercept when NO2
concentration is 0 ppm. Can authors elaborate more about this observation here?
3. Voltage response is increased proportionally with NO2 concentration in Figure 6a-6c except the
850C sintering temperature data points in Figure 6b. Can authors discuss more about this
observation here?

4. Authors discuss that the thickness of the electrode changes with the sintering temperature. This
thickness effect is competing with the microstructure formation as a function of the sintering
temperature. Which effect is more impactful on the sensing capability based on two different sets
of data here in Figure 5 and 6?
5. Authors should combine the Figure 7 and 8 together for more efficient usage of manuscript
layout.

These authors used deposited WO3 on YSZ and used it as a NO2 sensor. The authors saw a
dependence on the sintering conditions with 800 C delivering the best performance. They
attribute the improved performance to the morphology.
1) The authored should have used single crystal substrates to test if the WO3 morphology
depends on the substrate surface, termination, morphology, and conditions.
2) The authors should provide a compelling explanation as to why sintering yields different
thicknesses. Now it seems to violate the most basic mass conservation.
3) The morphology cannot be obtained or even cursorily analyzed with Fig. 3 as in Fig. 3 I only
see qualitative differences. AFM or profilometry would be needed.
4) I am not sure why the authors used so few points in Fig. 6 they seem to have quite a bit of
scattering. Experiments should be repeated on other samples, and the fitting curve and R2 are not
very meaningful. Also, there are multiple figs 6.
5) It is very unclear how (if at all) the circuit in Fig. 8 fits with Fig. 7. The authors are
recommended to carry out DRT analysis (see https://www.bio-logic.net/wp-
content/uploads/AN60.pdf and key references therein)
6) The quality of the figures needs improvement as the SEM is not aligned and the fonts are
elongated. The schematics are visually unappealing. Also, the labeling of the figures should be
formatted consistently.

7) The writing should be improved, and the article should be checked by a native speaker or a

Appendix A
Reviewer: 1
What is the innovation of the manuscript? It should be clearly stated.
Answer: The sintering temperature affects the microstructure of the sensing electrode
(SE), which in turn affects the electrical properties of the gas sensor. Generally, in
order to reduce gas consumption caused by gas phase catalysis during gas diffusion in
the SE, the SE should be controlled at a suitable thickness. But for volatile material
WO3, in order to avoid the damage of the integrity of WO3-SE caused by
volatilization of electrode material, and ensure the proper electrode thickness, it is
particularly important to control the sintering temperature. This paper innovatively
combines the SEM results, NO2 sensing performance and EIS results to reveal how
the morphology of the SE affects the sensing performance by affecting the reaction
sites, adsorption sites, and gas phase reaction consumption.
Reviewer: 2
1. The voltage responses are similar between 800 and 850°C sintered data at the
operating temperature 500°C in Figure 5a. However, the responses are large
between 800 and 850°C sintered data at the operating temperature 550 and
600°C in Figure 5b and 5c. Can authors explain more in the manuscript?
Answer: Compared with the 800 °C sintered WO3-SE, the electrode morphology of
850 °C sintered WO3-SE is incomplete, resulting in fewer adsorption sites for NO2
molecules. At a lower operating temperature of 500 °C, the difference in response
signal caused by adsorption sites difference is small. But as the operating temperature
increases, the gas desorption effect enhances, and the signal gap caused by the
adsorption sites difference becomes larger. Therefore, we could see a similar signal at
500 °C (5a) and a significant signal difference at 550 °C (5b) and 600 °C (5c).
2. All voltage responses data in Figure 6a-6c have the non-zero y-intercept when
NO2 concentration is 0 ppm. Can authors elaborate more about this observation
here?
Answer: In this study, the sensor consists of a piece of YSZ solid electrolyte and a
pair of symmetrical Pt electrodes screen printed on both sides of YSZ, and one of Pt
electrode is coated with a layer of WO3 sensing material. In the base gas (0 ppm NO2),
the response signal is derived from the oxygen potential difference in the vicinity of
the two Pt electrodes. Since the printing process is difficult to ensure the perfect
symmetry of Pt electrodes on both sides, and the layer of sensing material coated on
one Pt hinders the transmission of oxygen to some extent, that finally resulting in a
non-zero response signal due to the different oxygen potential on the both Pt
electrodes. So non-zero y-intercept could be found when NO2 concentration is 0 ppm.
3. Voltage response is increased proportionally with NO2 concentration in Figure
6a-6c except the 850°C sintering temperature data points in Figure 6b. Can
authors discuss more about this observation here?
Answer: In Section 3.2 of the experimental introduction of this paper, it has been
mentioned that the response signal of each concentration is the average value from the
three measurement results. It may be due to the experimental error and the insufficient
samples, the relationship between the response signal and the logarithm of the NO2
concentration does not have a good linear relationship, and this phenomenon is very
common in the potentiometric sensor literature. Sensors of this structure generally
follow the mixed-potential mechanism, so we usually use a linear fitting method when
analyzing the potential signal with the logarithm of gas concentration.
4. Authors discuss that the thickness of the electrode changes with the sintering
temperature. This thickness effect is competing with the microstructure
formation as a function of the sintering temperature. Which effect is more
impactful on the sensing capability based on two different sets of data here in
Figure 5 and 6?
Answer: The difference in sintering temperature will result in the difference in the
microstructure and the thickness of the electrode. The microstructure of the electrode
will affect the adsorption sites and the reaction sites, and the thickness will affect the
gas phase catalytic reaction consumption of the target gas and affect the gas
concentration reaching the reaction sites at the TPB. Combined with the
microstructure observation of SEM and the test signal results of Fig. 5 and 6, it is
considered that the thickness effect is more impactful on sensing performance.
5. Authors should combine the Figure 7 and 8 together for more efficient usage of
manuscript layout.
Answer: Thanks for your advice. I will modify my manuscript and combine the two
figures.
Reviewer: 3
1) The author should have used single crystal substrates to test if the WO3
morphology depends on the substrate surface, termination, morphology, and
conditions.
Answer: A single crystal substrate is generally used for a resistive type gas sensor,
which has a semiconductor metal oxide printed on the substrate. The sintering
temperature of the resistive sensor is generally less than 500 °C, and the test
temperature is below 300 °C. But for the potentiometric sensor, the YSZ substrate is
not only a structural support, but also has the function of an oxygen ion conductor. In
this work, the YSZ is an isotropic polycrystalline material prepared by the same
tape-casting and sintering procedure. Therefore, all YSZ substrates have the same
properties and surface conditions. The sensing electrode WO3 studied in this paper are
prepared by the same batch of printing, except the different electrode sintering
temperature which could not influence the YSZ surface conditions, so the different
electrode morphology comes from the sintering temperature difference, not from the
substrate difference.
2) The authors should provide a compelling explanation as to why sintering
yields different thicknesses. Now it seems to violate the most basic mass
conservation.
Answer: In the case where the sintering temperature is lower than the melting
temperature of the electrode material, the sintering process does not cause a
significant change in the electrode thickness. However, the sensing material WO3
used in this paper is an easily sublimation material, and it begins to sublimate above
650 °C which is mentioned in Section 3.3. The higher the temperature, the more
obvious the sublimation. So the difference in electrode thickness is caused by varying
degrees of sublimation caused by different sintering temperatures.
3) The morphology cannot be obtained or even cursorily analyzed with Fig. 3. As
in Fig. 3, I only see qualitative differences. AFM or profilometry would be
needed.
Answer: The AFM equipment test mode of the school test center is contact type. The
WO3 material used in the paper is easily destroyed due to its crisp structure. The test
center does not recommend us to use this equipment. In fact, the surface morphology
difference of the sintered electrode at different temperatures can be seen by the SEM
analysis. As the sintering temperature increased, the sensing electrode became crispy
and porous, and there is a significant Pt electrode exposure phenomenon caused by
WO3 sublimation at the sintering temperature of 850 °C.
4) I am not sure why the authors used so few points in Fig. 6 they seem to have
quite a bit of scattering. Experiments should be repeated on other samples, and
the fitting curve and R2 are not very meaningful. Also, there are multiple figs 6.
Answer: In this paper, the sensor response signal is tested only at the NO2
concentration of 100, 200, 400 and 500 ppm, so each set of data has only 4 points
which are insufficient. Each signal value is the average value after three tests of the
same sample. It may be due to the experimental error and the insufficient samples, the
relationship between the response signal and the logarithm of the NO2 concentration
does not have a good linear relationship, and this phenomenon is very common in the
potentiometric sensor literature. Sensors of this structure generally follow the
mixed-potential mechanism, so we usually use a linear fitting method when analyzing
the potential signal with the logarithm of gas concentration. Therefore, we use the
linear fitting method and R2 to evaluate the degree of compliance of the linear
relationship. Figures 6a, b, and c are test results for the operating temperatures of 500,
550 and 600 °C, respectively, so there are multiple Figs 6.
5) It is very unclear how (if at all) the circuit in Fig. 8 fits with Fig. 7. The
authors are recommended to carry out DRT analysis
(see https://www.bio-logic.net/wp-content/uploads/AN60.pdf and key references
therein).
Answer: We are very grateful to the reviewer for the DRT analysis method file. This
is a very effective analytical method that has been widely used in fuel cells and
batteries, but it is rarely used in the field of gas sensor applications. We have used this
tool to analyze my data and made changes in the manuscript. The analysis process
using this method makes the mechanism explanation of the work more convincing
6) The quality of the figures needs improvement as the SEM is not aligned and
the fonts are elongated. The schematics are visually unappealing. Also, the
labeling of the figures should be formatted consistently.
Answer: Thanks for the reviewer's suggestion. This problem does exist, we have
revised the manuscript.
7) The writing should be improved, and the article should be checked by a native
speaker or a professional editor.
Answer: We have already invited a researcher who is working in an English speaking
country to review our manuscript, and the grammar and vocabulary errors have been
modified according to your suggestion.
